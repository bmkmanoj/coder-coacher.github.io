no it's only on YouTube I hope everybody
can sort of hear they still have to let
me know if you sort of can't hear
anything or you know it's a bit crap or
one of the volumes too low because it's
hard to hear it on my end so you'll just
have to let me know if you know you see
the too loud too quiet whatever you just
give me a sort of heads up
the exits always quite fiddly just
trying to get the sort of settings right
for the stream because it's sort of
different from when I try and record I
mean I've tried to put it in so like 60
FPS and see what the settings are like
but you never know with a stream
especially if I don't know the internet
connection should be able to handle it
but hopefully don't hear any sort of too
many sort of clicking sounds because the
keyboard is quite noisy so I'll try and
be quite soft on it
it depends how far I get through
actually playing the game there might be
some spoilers so I mean if you if you're
prone to a spoiler bentham you might not
want to watch I guess
a mass for the solve would I do a series
the the thing is it's it's difficult
because this is actually quite a sore
big general game you need the idea
before you actually put all the
mechanics the mechanics themselves are
quite simple but once you start putting
in solve all the ideas and the story
elements then you sort of time and all
your designing and things like that
solved start taking over yeah this is
the game I created and created yeah
yeah most of the stuff was created by me
and my friend too you know we when we
originally created the game there's only
certain things like some things in the
environment that one actually modeled
BIOS I either sort of trees and some of
the little bits there but for the rest
of the part that you'll see with inside
the school and things like that they're
all either assets that you can get
widely in unity from the free standard
assets or the very very occasional sort
of environmental pack just to help
spruce it up because it's hard for just
two people to end up creating everything
yes it's made in unity and yeah it's a
horror game
the game realistically it took on and
off about us about two years because
it's one of those things it's hard to
say if you really had a caller ID on
you'd written it all down and you had a
clear picture from the beginning but
things always change at the end of the
day and that it just ends up you know
adding extra time and time and then if
it's your first game you don't really
know what it means to make the game how
you need to optimize it and test it I
mean I tested it probably thousands of
times to make sure it was as bug free as
possible and even when I launched people
still nitpicked at things when I got it
drove me insane I mean I could literally
complete the game in about 20 minutes
because I knew exactly where it's gone
what to do so it's good just to get us
off general opinion from loads of people
that you know might be interested in
playing again
and the games over 10,000 copies at the
current moment but it was never one to
sort of make millions and millions of
you know pounds dollars or whatever you
want to look at it was more of a one
that you know we just decided to make a
game and it's off moved on and moved on
into a full release that we released on
Steam and then you know it went from
there really
as for a sort of designer document it
was more so it was just sort of we had
this idea that we wanted to make
something like a slender clone
originally and tried to start doing with
a little forest and then we thought now
we gave up for a little bit and then we
just decided that I why don't we
actually make a you know full horror
game because we'd seen somebody on
YouTube who played a sort of indie
horror game you know one of the
youtubers back in the day would play it
and we didn't like the look of the indie
game and we thought you know we can do a
better job than this we can make a
cool-looking sort of indie horror game
so then it turned into what this is
today we thought yeah we'll just you
just go and do it
really
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna start in a
second it's just that I was waiting you
know to give people opportunity to just
come in and ask a few questions because
it sounded looking you know back from
this into the chat so on it's just you
left it sort of given me a little bit of
leeway in this yeah it's all in unity
and the most heart the public the
hardest thing was just it was putting
everything together and you're not
knowing what actual people wanted when
you release on a platform like Steam
because you know while I might as well
sort of briefly get started is that you
know look in a menu I'm always quite
into having a nice looking menu I mean
that's the thing that we aim for you see
a lot of them which are quite static I
mean evening Triple A games but I liked
it when if you could have a little bit
of movement so this is just a sort of
scene where we've got AIT's a camera
here and it's just playing the back of
the actual path again which you'll see
in a moment and it was just something
that I thought it looked nice because
it's sort of a setting with via you see
the volumetric lights have got fog in
the background here there is some big
lighting there is just one directional
light with the real-time lighting as I
said there's the Sun shafts image effect
it's to remember that this was made in
4.3 so it's quite an old sort version of
unity I mean it's like even when I was
developing it was you know two three
years old at the time so it was just it
sort of held back a little bit on the
visuals in some areas so you know you've
got to give it sort of sort of chance in
that area this was all written in
JavaScript originally because that's
what I started with before I moved to
c-sharp because obviously they've got
rid of JavaScript now but you know the
the fairly similar and even with you
know this it's not the most sort of
epically programmed game that you'll
ever find because it hasn't got enough
mechanics in to sort of push it to the
boundaries of you know adding in lots of
different characters with multiplayer
and inventories and stuff like that it's
very sort of basic to say was the first
thing that I ever did from the start
um no everything that you can see in
every part of the game was made by me
and my friend whether it would be must
you know 90% of the our assets all the
sounds that you'll hear in the game
pretty much you know the effects just
the story the design work everything
that's gone into it is pretty much the
BIOS really for this game I don't really
know how many lines it was it wasn't an
epic amount because of lot of the things
are quite simplified some made sure it
was nice and simple but it was probably
a fair few thousand lines in the end
among god knows hundreds of scripts I
guess but like I say every time you go
and start a game you learn a lot from it
you can take what you've learned and say
that I would have done a script in a
particular way in this game and I look
and do it and do it now I can do it much
shorter or I can make sure that the
scripts are all refined so you make a
script for each part of your game so you
don't just whack 3,000 lines in one
script which does everything does your
health it does you gameplay and it does
all that stuff it's what you learn as
you go along which makes a big
difference to have anything you make in
the future
this is this games already done it was
already released so it's it's been out a
year now pretty much so I'm just working
on the next one
yeah so like I said when I started I
wanted to just say about the men's
things that I learn and the things that
are noticed so when people look at so
I've try not to laugh when you look at
this if I click on the options menu in
4.3 I really hated the UI system it was
the worst thing in the world to try and
do it in unity 5 and above now you can
pull your you eyes in you can pull boxes
in and it's great it's it's really
awesome and a lot of people especially
on platforms when you go to steam or on
an Xbox or a PlayStation platform you
make sure you have a variety of options
these are terrible I can look at it
really then you've got you pretty much
you main thing that people actually want
is an inverted Mouse option and if you
don't get that people I'll end up asking
you you know why is the inverted Mouse
and you'll just get that in the actual
forums and stuff and they'll say and
then that's one major thing because some
people like inverted I thought which is
more of a thing with sim flight
simulators people like a little black
brightness slider with unity it's a
little bit difficult because it doesn't
have a particular gamma feature it's
usually better if you have an image
effect which you can sort of adjust you
can adjust your mouse sensitivity
because people don't sometimes they
don't have a mouse which you can adjust
on the fly so people might play and go
well this is too sensitive so that's
always good normal like Mouse slider let
you change resolution graphic settings
so like I can put it in low or an ultra
doesn't really change it too much
because a lot of it was baked out as for
jump scares there is jump scares but we
try and we try to solve minimalize it so
it's more of an experience than it was
just stuff jumping out at you and yeah
field of view is another one that I
didn't put in with this but some people
didn't like it I didn't get too many
comments about it but people also want
support for sort of widescreen monitors
and you know higher resolutions but
what's the time when things are
integrated with unity they also have
auto fill most of you feel in a year
sort of fields for you and you just need
stuff like that and obviously like the
main thing a safe system is you know of
really important because people didn't
really like what we did in this and only
saves at certain points ie when you move
to a new scene and
people want to save on the fly if they
don't have a lot of time so it's
something to sort of be mindful of when
you sort of get into it yeah it is the
first time I've actually streamed
something as for the game getting over
is that the one way you used that little
solve there's again a like a little pot
and he sort of hits the hammer I don't
know if that's if that's the one that
I'm thinking of so you'll have to let me
know why a horror game I think you know
taking it down to its soft core concept
if when you think about it it's really
if I think about all the games you can
make and all the sort of different
things that you can make a third-person
game first-person game a driving game an
action game a multi play again when I
think of a horror game it's fairly
straightforward if you've got a good
concept which you can take from you know
start to finish but and then there's not
an awful lot of other core elements
depending on how crazy if you take a get
my Resident Evil for instance like
Resident Evil 7 there is a lot of core
concept in that whether that's AI
running after you
whether it's weapon shooting infantry
Management's all that type of thing but
it was something that I wanted to start
with was a basic idea but we could
implement as much as many things as we
wanted to without making it too
difficult for a first game
the game's $4.99 in pounds and six
dollars 99 well you just want to look at
other people's games and then decide but
of my games you know what what quality
and what content do you have in yours
how does it compare to some people's on
Steam you can watch youtubers play you
can see all the Triple A games and just
decide a price point depending on how
long your game takes because people have
a funny thing about if it's too short
or if it's too longer if you've popped
too much filler in the price can
sometimes sort of negate the sort of
difficulties that you're gonna have down
the line I will continue with the
Survival Series I've just been waiting
to sort of make my blood mainly recover
from my actual eye surgery so you'll
have to just give me a chance to be
honest some of the story sort of came in
as we went a long putt I said that's the
that's just the nature of games even if
you're in the biggest studio ever you're
gonna you know come to something that
was really the issue or something that
wasn't an issue and it has to be changed
or somebody comes up with a good idea
that especially you've got two people
you've got to think of all the ideas and
do all the other stuff which you'd find
a team of you know 20 and Beyond doing
it all so it really depends but it's
good just to keep yourself on track and
try your best to do all really um really
for pullet put it into 2017 point three
I'd have to redo all the models and
stuff in PPR and things like that nice I
don't think it's worth it enough because
it's it's not a blockbuster of a game so
therefore it's not worth me putting in
the time to solve redo it
now no DLCs for this type of thing I
mean at the end of the game without
spoiling anything then you know there is
a soft cliffhanger and it could I could
do it let's say quantum co-op number two
of this game but to be honest with you
it's not gonna happen because I'm
already working with something else so
you know this is pretty much the be-all
end-all of this game yeah I'll publish
this live screen at a live stream
afterwards so everybody can sort of see
it after I've done it that pretty much
the trees were the only thing that was a
sort of part of a major pack one of the
sort of forest asset packs because it's
one of those things that at the time
were doing everything else if you can
get a big pack um you know you've got to
side on the air of caution when it comes
to you know people say come on core
asset flippin and you've got to be
careful because sometimes people can go
to an extent way you can obviously see
that they've either copy and pasted
loads of assets left the scene as it was
and just sort of plot their game in and
released it or they're not really
changed much but if you take assets and
you use them to design it in your own
way and nobody really ever knows that
you've you've done that let's say
because you've used those assets to
assist your game not you've used those
assets to make the game for you if that
sort of comes to make it makes sense and
I can't remember after maybe put a link
out for the asset for the trees but
honestly it was such a long time ago
that I got this I want to save forests
nature packable honestly I can't really
say it was one of the older packs that's
on the star if anything so I'll staff
now so for the last thing you know you
want little tooltips to tell people what
they're gonna do so you know you they
can't just start the game accidentally
and I guess I'll read the soft gist of
the story as we sort of go along so some
people didn't really like the story some
people didn't mind it so it's really up
to you
I haven't read in a long time so please
forgive me if I'm a bit rusty so he
players Joel denna former United States
Marine Corp Special Forces is a father
of
in a recent divorcee he served for 12
years of one of the highest-ranking
officers and worked his way up to
captain before being discharged after
suffering massive head trauma on duty
Joel was highly regarded as one of the
best company grade officers and received
the highest commendation of Medal of
Honor for his undeniable bravery trial
and operation he spent 18 months in a
medically induced coma doctors said that
the odds are extremely low that we'll
ever wake up again despite this is
former two squad mates Mike and filly
visited him everyday and watched him
make a full physical recovery of the
next year Joel still suffers occasional
disorientation and blackouts which he
has a regular checkup spawn Joe was left
having to build a new life for himself
in a city in a job that he doesn't like
and without the comfort of his children
his wife left him for a new man in New
York and when he was still in the coma
Joel hasn't seen his best friends for
the last six months while they're on
deployment and they arrived to me up
from for a weekend away on a
back-to-basics fishing trip to reminisce
about the old days meeting off a hiking
trail in the forests of Wisconsin and so
sorry for butchered that so just the
story was he was a military sort of
officer it had an injury he was in a
coma he solve lost his wife and children
let's say and then he saw he's going to
meet his friends again in this you know
let's say make-believe forest that we
have in Wisconsin it was just something
that we sort of cobbled together when we
were designed to do it now I don't live
in the u.s. I live in the UK so it's
just something that maybe resonated with
people more so we'll skip on people
usually like to see just a brief
overview of looking at what the controls
might be and then you know when you see
the controls you can look you know
regular controls WASD EQ F and B it just
it depends what you want and sometimes
if you've got controller remapping and
things like that
these should update but here was yet
again something a 4.3 wasn't very easy
to do controller support was all
because the input system in unity was
crap and it still is but there is other
assets now to sort of help you along as
you go through it why did it choose us
for the character I don't know like I
say resonated with maybe more people so
that might be cool and then we sort of
created a little sort of animation that
sort of you know gave some text and sort
of give you a sort of eerie build-up to
the game I mean it's too quick for me to
end up reading it so if you can read it
as I'm going through that that's fine
yeah I do do this as a full-time job now
and hello to the people that have joined
in and I don't know if you can hear in
the background while there sort of fades
in to the bit that we're doing is that
you've got some sort of like little
footsteps as you creep along to the area
that we are now and the big thing about
it is is you want to add as many things
that make it fully of a sort of
believable as possible hope everybody
can sort of hear what's going on and
it's not all sort of broken yeah I made
this again so like I say if you've got
any black screens or any paused moments
or any moments they've got silence
that's not very good you want to just
make it feel nice and impactful so as I
said it was a black screen and then we
had some just foxes some footsteps in
sort of ground which I got and it just
makes it feel like oh yeah so I've been
walking up to this point so I'm now in
this forest to wherever we are so yeah
this was one of the scenes that was most
proud with because if you put the fog in
and you put the sort of volumetric
lights then you can make it look pretty
cool
so apologies if you can hear any of my
keyboard so well you know we tried to if
you look if its core concept is you can
imagine where these boulders are these
rocks I put sort of in a ravine area
even I've just got a text message so
it's gonna bother me while I yeah speak
behind here there's actually nothing you
know it just pretty much is to try and
give the illusion that there's more
there than there is because that's the
whole thing about the actual big thing
about games if you can make it seem like
there's more than there is then you've
sort of accomplished your task because
it might look like I'm sort of in an
environment with the sort of leaves
floating like it's on a solve it could
be a autumn ish day yeah unity 4.3 yeah
and then we put some sort of text
message in to make it sort of feel more
believable that even it looks a bit crap
when I look at it now because it always
does when you go back to something that
you made a long time ago and you wanted
to make it feel believable that they
said hey Joel can't wait to see you
tomorrow
so it's because it's been so long and
you can hear I can see when you receive
it you can't really send anything it's
just more of a sort of adding to the
plot on you and you reply with and
you're replied with this yesterday hey
yes so it's nice to get away I need a
break and whatever and then they said
that we've gone fishing we'll be back
soon and follow the trail to the camp
maybe collect some sticks and rocks to
build the camp fire 10 of each should be
fine I see you soon so it was just to
add some disposition and give you an
objective without physically saying even
though it does say collecting 10 sticks
10 rocks you get the objective without
it sort of popping up in the con and
saying yeah this is what you should do
and then you just always need something
to close it and then maybe bring back
your phone if you need reminding of your
objective now this games just on PC and
that's pretty much it
and then it depends if you've got the
sort of the initiative you can be you
know you could create this game in a
year you could create in six months it
could take you five years it depends how
you committed you are to the whole thing
so as I go along I can you know do the
very good thing we had some sort of
birds fly out of the the bushes just to
sort of try and add some impact to it
and then like I said most of this area
it's all very much encapsulated off and
if you can see sort of up here you can
see sort of the edge but it's about
filling the area with nice things and
things that you can look at and just
make it feel like a believable little
forest and as I run down here you can
see sort of a little rabbit with a bit
of a crappie animation because it was
quite hard to do we don't really we tend
to stick with the less organic stuff
because it's quite tricky to do
especially when trying to make realistic
assets and it's just trying to sort of
add a little things where you can add a
little colliders and make things happen
like you saw those birds move across the
camp and do stuff from there so you can
see that I've hit the camp now and I
can't go any further down there because
it's blocked off because it doesn't let
you because we didn't want you to go any
further before you completed the first
bit that we'd ask you to do so you can
see the camp here that you know they've
set it up already
and you can see that when we walked over
here that there's a sort of a campfire
that you can build and it's sort of a
black outline to give you some
disposition to say that oh look I'll
probably need to make this comfort like
they told me to do and so then you can
solve walk away and you can look around
and you see others the stick there so
I'm just gonna collect some sticks and
rocks like it told me so you know a sort
of little minigame fetch quest type of
thing curse games always have this sort
of stuff so you can you know just look
around so forgive me if I can't find
anything because I used to be able to do
this in like 10 seconds because I'd know
where I'd placed all the sticks but
we're not playing it for so long I'm not
really sure where I put them
probably got a fare for you that and you
make sure you get lots of popups to
remind people how many they might have
got which is something that I didn't do
at the time it does pop up in the corner
eventually and said that I've collected
this many things but loved it so if you
see an I don't because the microphones a
little bit in the way
yeah some of this stuff like I say it's
Sam soft that you can see would ten
wouldn't at the bottom you can see that
some stuff is still quiet you know when
you learn to do the games you learn to
see what worked and what didn't and it's
always good to be try and be as obvious
as possible with a lot of things that
you do and give a lot of a lot of
prompts to the player especially if it's
something that they have to do
themselves so you explain maybe why the
crosshair goes red and how you need to
interact but sometimes it's about you
know working out yourself sometimes and
as the experience goes once you get the
called mechanics down with a game like
this with it being fairly basic you
don't need to do an awful lot to it the
textures sort of the textures from this
or either from CG textures or the
environments or pack that we had and
some of the there is some
post-processing in this game but I
didn't use an awful lot because either
tax did too much I didn't really had too
much effect to the game
I saw as we're here we created this
collected the sticks and the rocks and
then we can you know move over to the
area where there's that sort of
silhouette of a campfire and we can
choose to place that down and then place
the sticks to actually you know sort of
craft a campfire let's say where it's
really not and you know we saw can walk
around the camp and want to look at
whatever else is then you can see that
we can highlight lighter food and
matches and we got the idea that there's
a few of the games that did it you know
like this ikat member who has Ethan cats
that did sort of pop-ups like this and I
really liked them and I just wanted to
do if my again just cuz I like the
little pop-ups at the top so you can see
it there and I can see that compress
back I'm on fire and we've crafted the
final like we were asked to do it
depends what you want to say about the
game it's not unique in the concept of
the core concept of a horror but it's
more about we wanted to create an
experience that was better than you know
some rubbish you sort of horror games
that we'd seen and then
and we default you know it was good in
the end we thought it was a fairly good
experience so we decided to release it
and make into a sort of final release
the game does use some jump scares but
it's not fully focused on jump scares
it's more about the experience and the
things that you find out as you go along
so you can see in the bottom that we got
another text message in the text
messages far of filtered and it says
make sure you set up lieutenant and have
a drink of water if you're feeling
thirsty after a long walk we won't be
long
so again giving somebody an objective
without directly giving somebody an
objective and you can sort of see it
like this it maybe it looks and it's not
fantastic because it's just sort of a
model in front of the camera which
appears with a different texture on it
and I mean if I was doing it now I'd
probably do it with the UI so it would
look a little bit better and there's two
of us that made the game I'm not I
probably won't play the inside again
because I'll probably take me too long
but maybe I'll either do it again and do
the second half or I'll just get enough
before people get bored and then solve
quit it maybe and you know it's said to
do a ten so you can see the soft
silhouette and I can place to sort of
place my ten so we can see that we're
ready for the you know the things that
going on here and then it said have a
drink of water so some people they
either found the stuff that I added to
this game straight away and it would be
clicked and they found all the sticks
built the ten and build the fire some
people struggle with it some people find
it really easy some people complain
about it and go you know this puzzle was
easy or this was too hard or you should
have explained it better there's a big
thing about when you make a game you
have to solve
balance it and decide that people are
gonna love it or they can hate it the
you know it's unless you make a really
stellar game and then everybody loves it
but this one wasn't now
it's not gonna be released on a console
it's just literally a PC release and
then we've got something where we can
have a drink so you can do that and you
can see that we put a little frost the
player and I get a little dizzy effect
because we're sort of been drugged and
we fall love and you can hear the sound
effect of falling over and you know the
solve weird sounds and you can sort of
see the enemy character there in the
back before it fades out and we give you
a sort of disposition to say that now
it's two hours later and then you give
you something to you on the floor and
you step back up and trying to add some
audio into getting back up off the floor
because it's one of those things where
like I said in the very beginning when
you get up from something you need the
audio to go with it to make it seem
believable so you had a little bit of a
rustling on the floor and maybe a
rustling of clothes as you get on it
sort of it takes longer than you expect
just to make the little sounds that go
with it even if they're only a split
second if it feels like it's realistic
or it feels like it's believable then
that goes a long way to make everything
else feel believable the drunk effect
was just an image effect which was the
motion blur so you just ramp it up
really high and then when you move your
mouse you get that sort of blurred
effect and then we've got another text
message to give you again some general
idea that you can see the last mystery
girl and they're saying to your help
Joel we came across an abandoned school
and couldn't resist taking a look the
gate and the door were actually open the
door locked on us and the lights have
gone out come and get us out and then
because it's been a bit of time
afterwards according to when you got it
so maybe sort of 40 minutes after the
st. Joel help us out what are you doing
and he said we don't think we're alone I
mean a little bit cliche maybe but you
know that's what happens when you make
your first game it's a little bit cliche
and then we're sort of in the scene
where you start with and you can see on
these trees here it looks like it's it's
stars or something in the sky where it's
not it sort of the edge of the truly
alphas
the tree and there were sort of broken
and I tried my best to fix and get rid
of it but he wouldn't go away so you'll
see it everywhere on the stupid trees
really a night but that's the way it
goes sometimes you just have to sort of
put your head in the sand I do have a
tutorial on and doing a like a Fed and
fade in and out with a scene all I did
in this game was do assault black square
in front of your camera and then sort of
did an alpha fade across it yeah I
should have said that there were stars
on that nobody would have known
indifference and he would have looked
okay but now that's that's just a little
secret and then I put sort of a particle
effect all the way around the edge just
to make it look more Aryan spooky so you
can see then we can pick up our torch
and you can see it'll give you a little
prompt to say that you press E to search
different items so we can search in here
that I can see in the top bottom left
nothing was found I can press here
batteries acquired and I can search here
and there's always a sound to go with it
now this was entirely corrected in unity
fall well the thing is now with the wind
zone it's already in now so there's
nothing I can pretty much do about it at
this point in time so I can press you
know F and you get the regular
flashlight and things like that within
the game and I'll just run down here to
the sort of very beginnings of the game
and you can see that a lot of people
complained about if a flashlight wasn't
big enough bright enough didn't last a
long enough let's say that this you know
has a very fairly big arc and it has a
little bit of a sway so when you turn
you don't get the fault you get the full
sort of range of motion so you can cover
all the sort of distance that you can so
it's not just like a little pinprick in
the floor where you can't actually see
anything that you're doing yeah the old
batteries trick which nobody likes but
it's one of those easiest sort of game
mechanics that you can put in without
putting too much effort now it's not use
any post-processing stack it's just
using some old image effects from unity
4.3 so it's everything that was solved
by themselves
and all of the major things that I'll
sort of mentioned is that happen a lot
of times in in game see of the edge of
this map here is that I tried to put
things in the way which to make it sort
of seem believable but it blocked off
because I don't want you to be able to
go down there but the sort of an
invisible barian people here invisible
barriers and it's it's hard to it's hard
to sort of make it seem believable
without you know I wanted a falling tree
but it would self click through the
floor and look weird and yeah just let
me know if people can still hear it and
everything and around the edge of
originally when I released the game it
didn't have these sort of barriers so
you couldn't go through and you could
sort of just hit an invisible barrier
and people complained about that and
it's something that I spent ages boxing
off this whole area to make sure that it
didn't actually you know create a
problem and people didn't find it on
immersive because it's all about keeping
the immersion there to make it realistic
and I don't even know where I am
this point here where we can look at the
map here you can see a sort of map of
this mount high forest and now as we get
up to it you can see that there's a
question mark over it so I'd left it
open for people to think what might I
need to do at this point here and you
can see the small surprising thing is a
lot of people didn't see powerplant key
card and then it says in 97 and a lot of
people who tested it never even saw that
it actually said this here so looks like
ooh you might have to find another part
of this map to you know work out
whatever this code is that I might need
because it wouldn't be there for no
apparent reason you can get some of this
stuff on the assets table but only sort
of maybe some more environmental stuff
and the sort of trees but other than
that it's all created by us and the
sound was all by me and my friend we
just got some ideas of what we wanted to
create and just created the idea and you
can see there's a school bus here that
soft crashed just as sort of an airy
effect I guess and you can see that
Highschool with the lights on because I
guess why not with a sort of old
monument and you can sort of travel down
this road which is maxed out by the
things that either side press Q to put
something back in my torch and you can
see that I added we added some sort of
road markings and things and you can go
a few ways you can go all the way up
here which gets you all the way to solve
this broken down so bridge area with the
school bus and you can see that the lake
that we're near now with the sort of fog
over and you know there was the little
bits which you add a little bits of
scenery and things like that just to
make it a little bit more interesting
like this thing with the ivy over with
the signs and just to make it feel like
it you know it would be a real place if
you weren't there yeah yeah everything's
everything's modelled by me all my
friends so yeah everything is now this
game has already been out a year so all
the advertising has already been done
realistically and you can see here that
there's a sort of cabin and you can see
that the door's locked
and I can sort of try and get in
backhand and I can see through the sort
of window what's going on and what might
be in there but the sort of it's you
sort of first puzzle to guests you know
more than you know what do I need to do
is home probably need a key to be honest
I can't even remember what you do at
this point so I'm sort of running along
with just the things that we've done so
like I say you want to make stuff seem
believable with a little little axe in
the wood with the stacks of wood would
make it look like a sort of old janitors
cabin let's say yeah it was on the steam
greenlight originally and then you know
it got released you know before it went
steam direct and then we released it on
Steam now there's no particular AI in
this it's more of a just a sort of
experience than anything else and you
can see best all the things that we did
there was a little there's another way
to get across here and you can see there
that there's a question mark over here
so it looks like we might need some
planks
and big thing about this you see this
here is sort of like you see that oh I
might be able to jump into the water
there but I made sharper invisible
colliders absolutely everywhere because
I didn't want people trying to break the
game and jumping into the water and then
getting stuck because I I know people
would try them and people did when they
were testing it and they managed to jump
out and then you couldn't get past these
here as in because they're sort of
collided as well and you get stuck in
the water and then you break the game
and then everybody would hate it so
you've got to just make sure that you
try and do what everybody else would try
and do especially if somebody's trying
to jump everywhere and break stuff
because that's what people like to do so
again this is all collided until you
sort of find the pieces then you can
move across yeah there was just the
basic waterfall from the unity standard
assets so you can see that those planks
there you could see that on here you can
see that put a little outline and I've
got plank and I've seen one over on this
side so I can pick that up and I can
move all the way over here and I can go
and place the plants down and you sort
of heard the sound effect and we get the
planks here and now we can walk over the
sort of this side of the bridge
and we can solve run across here and we
run we're gonna run towards the school
so you can sort of see and the other
side of this our bridge so as I move
across you know we just sort of tried to
build the area to make it seem like it
would be a believable area so you can
see the sort of entrance to the school
here and you can see the little sign and
I can see that the other side of this
bridge that was blocked off by that bus
so now you can actually search the
rucksack so you can might be able to you
saw a map piece that and you can search
the other ones and then I got some
batteries and I found nothing so I've
got that other map piece that I'd
originally found and then it's one of
those things where you every game pretty
much has fetch quests no matter which
way you look at it so you just take
somebody somewhere to find something
that they may or may not have been
looking for and you know based on that
and then you can get them to run back to
your their area and a lot of horror
games have a sort of limited sprint
system so we decided to make it not too
short or too long but maybe just enough
to sort of not get too annoying that you
know this guy is not on it should be an
Olympic sprinter we've been in the
military but it's something that you
want to decide on when you if you decide
to make something like this and so I'm
just running back to as long as I've
them the right way I'm running back to
the original map piece that we could
place them and then you can print put it
then you can see now that we came from
the sort of ten area here where was the
camp and then we're now here and you can
see that we've got some markings that
the broken bridge was just that light
green the school at the top they a cabin
that we couldn't get into and then the
power plant that we haven't been to yet
so now it reveals the entire code nine
seven two or four so we can pretty much
just again just be a sort of fetch II
sort of quest to decide you know now
we've got that code we've got another
piece of this sort of puzzle but want to
be able to make
and we try to adding a little sound
effects that you gone along it so you
might have heard a sort of dodgy
sounding wolf because it's weird when
you sprint it sort of breaks the sound
effect and we come into sort of the
arranged powerplant II area and this was
sort of copied in a similar style that
we saw the power plant area and grand
theft auto 5 and we sort of took some
pictures of that so we like the look of
it and we mid solve a little power plant
area most of it looks pretty outdated
because it's in a pretty old version of
the engine which you know I like to do a
lot better-lookin assets these days but
it's about just learning new techniques
as you go along yeah what most of the
sounds are actually triggered just with
a say a box Collider or something like
that
and here's the keypad 97 to 4 and - good
job I got that right it's a bit small
because someone 2k resolution so on they
after I had to make sure it was correct
and you can see them when we look at the
wall you know you might have to do
something here in this cabin and this
little sort of Shack so you can see that
looks like there's two missing levers
that we might need and you know you can
have a look around and you can see that
those are green which is the station on
the grounds because you can see the
grounds have power and this is the
school grounds and the main school power
because you can see when we went by the
school there was no lights on so now you
know that you know you might need to
something there to do it rather than me
just leaving it so I'm knocking you what
they were gonna do and you can see as
you looked on this side that we pick up
keys so we've got keys now so we can
probably run back to the cabin that we
originally couldn't get into and I'm you
know do something in there and find out
more part of the story
and we just have to sort of run down
here I'll put another battery and I've
got a little you buy at the tops of
signified batteries and the wicking girl
in this cabin and we can unlock it now
and we sort of added something to give
you a sort of flashback as to what could
have happened and the you know maybe
previously in the past of something in
the game with a sort of bit of audio but
it sort of wasn't really embellished
enough in the game and you know we tried
to then add some areas into the game so
I don't know you could see the sort of
enemy character there as I sort of put
it to sort of be an airy moment in the
game which is and then when you go away
and look out it's not actually there
anymore and it's just sort of on a
trigger sort of basis so it's just one
of those things that you know you add
little tidbits in and maybe is it is or
isn't either scary when if somebody
finds it or not and you can see we sort
of tried to add little bits that the
amount hi janitor has escaped the hands
of the Sheriff Department and is the
men's got a suspect in the school
murders of six children the officers
have closed the school journey
investigation and the log cabin has been
there usually takes refuge has been left
abandoned how his staff described him as
being a very quiet individual so it's
worth trying your best to add solve
individual pieces of tidbits of
information picked up one of those
switches and I could search inside the
fridge and I can see here you know that
there was trying to be some sort of
effects on things looking at the bed
that you might have chained people up on
or something like that and you can see a
little areas of you know little bits in
this cabin and you saw that the when I
walked over a Collider over here the
light bulb smashed because that was a
rather cliche at the time when we made
that people were quite into just sort of
breaking a light bulb and you'll see
that in a lot of sort of the games even
like you know the big ones will end up
doing stuff like that just dissolved
cheap horror jump scare
and then we sort of tried to add in some
notes to give solve some disposition on
the whole thing so there's gonna be a
reporter that solved I'd gone gone
around and sort of reported on this
whole event so you find out a little bit
more about the whole story in general so
we started as you know this is somebody
who's been here before things have been
really slow for a decent story at work I
don't think I've long less before I get
the sack mr. Thompson has been a total
dick lately ever since I stole the
Jenkins farm story from last month
always was a slimy douche I really need
a decent story the amount how he school
killings will be an epic article if I
was surely to make it to the front page
the school is off limits due to the
toxic spill but I have come prepared and
managed to get a gas mask from Peter
works in the medical stunt cop and he
owed me a favor I mean I know I could
get into a fuckload of trouble for going
in but I can just run the story as an
anonymous interview from an old student
so again it's trying to add some sort of
little tidbits to say that you know
you're trying to lewd - a story of what
happens so you saw the little newspaper
clipping you saw the reporters account
of you know what might have happened
here
and it's about you know getting those
little tidbits and then taking it with
you so I've got those two and Ellie
missed it then I got the two switches so
I now can take them back to the power
station of where we need to use them
originally so I'll run back down here
where we originally a lot of people got
confused in this area when they played
especially on a scene I'd actually seen
them testing it and they sort of
couldn't remember which way it was which
that's what we saw I've tried to add the
map at some point it's just trying to
remember your left from your right and
then you can see that I can place the
two switches here and now we're gonna
need to sort of do a little minigame now
this one was either will make or break
you as a person and some people got it
in like two seconds or some people took
20 minutes trying to do it and then some
people gave up and sort of maybe left a
negative review or some people just said
it was too easy so it's again that
balancing that balancing act because it
depends who you are I don't actually
know the solution to this puzzle so I'm
gonna guess number that's right there's
a number one that's right
is it there's at the end here there
there there no what did you guess I've
got it first time and then we've got a
little prompt to engage the power and
then you get a sound effect of the power
station powering up some of the
generators
so now we can run along here and we've
got that power run for the school so we
can now that was pretty easy if you know
what you're doing but what happens if
you don't if you get in the wrong order
you can pull this you have to pull five
squit switches in a specific order if
you get one order wrong it will reset
the fifth and then switch which confused
people because it doesn't just reset as
soon as you get one wrong so that's what
I think confused people in the long run
so it just depends if you get one right
like one light green you remember that
was one of the ones in the order so if
the first one went green you know that's
the first lever that you need to pull in
the particular order if on your third go
one lit up you know that was the third
switch to pull in that sort of order it
depends depends who you are and how you
think of it and how you work out the
puzzle the puzzles or maybe it was how
my mind worked out and decided to
program it it's you know I'm good or bad
if you know you think it think of it
like that
my PC specs is sort of a regular i7 with
a gtx 980 so it's you know not the best
but it's not bad and we sort of added in
a lot of flash back again first sort of
splashing in the water just tossed
trying to add some sort of eerie effect
and that probably made people jump more
than anything else in the game
most of the areas weren't actually baked
out they were actually real time because
it was one of those things where when
you bake stuff out you come move stuff
quite as easily and things can get
awkward especially if you know you turn
lights on and off so it depends what
part of the game it is and you can see
that we've got something here to switch
the score power one so you could maybe
hear that the sound effects was going
off there and you can see that the
school lights have come on before I go
in there we've got a letter from the
police reporting that they've closed the
school due to a toxic waste spill and
the medical some carpet closed it and
for public safety you're not allowed to
go in but of course because seen as
though we're here you know we we're not
going so you've got we can go in the
game I think it's a little bit of
rubbish just to solve the sort of
simulate school and we've got a little
cabin here with a few things inside with
a second reporter no with just some
computers and some bits that we can see
and you can see the reporter not to that
it says oddly enough that the power
seemed to be on the school very strange
indeed
I managed to find the button that opens
the main school gate the place is really
strange
Erie had to think that this was a fully
functioning boarding school the main
entrance was locked I have a set of keys
for the security pod to come in I guess
these might open that side door it's
probably just psychological but I could
swear somebody is following me it will
be that janitor huh so we tried to sort
of maybe add an element of comedy to
sort of almost be ironically aware that
you're almost in a horror game but you
know I guess the reporter wouldn't
necessarily right no it's quite like
that maybe if it was on solve maybe a
tape recording that somebody was
dictating to himself so that's maybe
what it was you know somebody with a
little bit more comedy than anything
else and then we again we just tried to
make itself simulate a school so you can
see that this bus is on you can hear the
engine and we just put some seats and
sort of tried to simulate the look of a
sort of grand boarding school by putting
sort of trash and stuff in here and have
little sort of potted plants with the
wall around with little sort of bushes
and lights and just stuff like that
train simulator and then make the look
of a grand school it almost reminds me
of people said it looked like because
I've reminded them about last and that
was some sort of inspiration when
looking at even though out lasses sort
of whole concept of the game along with
models assets and the engine was much
more of you know broad and very
spectacular especially when you'd seen
it and this is you know a lot more of a
dumbed down version but it was the best
thing that we could do at the the time
you know with sort of the Ivy coming
down with the sort of lights on the
school and things like that as the Train
sort of simulate the look that makes it
feel believable and then we go into the
side gate here and we sort of get to a
solve log play area with some swings and
stuff like that if it was a boarding
school
you know kids might end up playing out
and then we get to us this soft side
door which the reporter was actually
sort of mentioning about and then we can
enter the school and you get the blacked
out and you heard the sound of me
opening a door and then we get into the
school now and you know we're directly
into the school and we get another text
message to sort of now describe more of
you know what you might need to do so
it's you sort of reply and said I'm
inside wherever you we use them the
light from our phone but the battery is
almost dead
we found some pen in one of the
classrooms and have painted painted
arrows leading to where we are so you
know again is trying to give people
things and I give you a sort of
objectives to say you need to search for
your friends so you have this the
forefront in your mind so I'm here now
to search for my friends so now I can
see that this was the era that were they
were talking about so they've I've given
you some direction in how to actually
first you know partake in the actual
game and again this was one of our
favourite areas that we did because this
forest the area back there was sort of
the first thing we ever did when we
created this game and the school was
what we probably spent most time working
on and you know just sort of decorated
the most and you can see it like you
know like the little bags here the
tables the sort of and then we call it
bunting the sort of flags that you'd see
in the things that are around and about
and things like that and the sort of
different alphas and cardboard box this
stuff that's on the floor just to make
it seem believable and then you give a
sort of walk into the bathroom and you
know you might be able to okay remember
if you don't if you can hear that
because I don't really have my
headphones on because it annoys me too
much but you could interact with some of
the the dryers and even in I think one
of the toilets you could interact with
to flush if that's if that's all yeah if
that's what you could hear because we
wanted to make it so that at least some
stuff was sort of interactable and makes
it feel like it you know it was a place
which you might
not be something you want going and you
can see that we sort of put markings on
the door to sort of suggest away you
might want to go and you can see this
off some of the stuff that we'd seen and
we try to add more sort of letters and
things to make it seem like it was a
school at some point so we had a
teachers report for some of the kids the
you know you will see that you know may
have been abducted or something that's
happened to them so you see it comment
on their behavior and you know what I
saw some information on those children
if you know you feel like you want to
look at it and we had different areas
where you could search for batteries and
things like that and with a lot of
things that we did especially when their
work or puzzles is the wrap-up question
mark there so if you end up looking at
this when you want to do you think
there's a question mark there so I might
need that in the future so you can look
it and think I'll remember that
and then you might then think about it
and you can see it there's a projector
on at the time so you might want to use
that in the future so it's about giving
tidbits to the player without obviously
saying we'll look at me I need to do
something with it
you just want to you know give the
impression that there is things there as
well and as you sort of creep along the
school you can see that are blocked off
certain areas where I didn't want you to
go in oh I think you heard some banging
there at that point because it was just
trying to add a little eerie bits into
the game just because what's more
ominous than the soft knocking on the
door always hear that now I mean at the
time it wasn't quite as prevalent but I
mean everybody likes to have a good
knock on the door at this point and then
we sort of put little easels which the
sort of men enemy of the game could have
been setting up to sort of try and scare
you off play with you now so they're
asking would they go this far for you
when you sort of asking sort of moral
questions about would your friends do it
for you and you know will you go that
far for them and what have you and you
can see that we can see the as an
algebra lesson and we can do something
with that and then there was a little
search in here to find something
so it's more of just a thing where we
wanted this game to just be you have a
little search around and you can maybe
see the things and as you go it was
built up in such a way where like you've
just said in the comments that I didn't
hit you with all the things they had to
do at once you knew you had Serge V
friends but as you go along I'm giving
you little bits of information that
could be something that you know you
then use later on so then you know so I
see you go through the school year sort
of getting different areas I can't go in
that room so I can go in there I don't
think I can go in there and not many
people commented on it but you can see
this is sort of like the school emblem
and it's quite funny that this is
actually a picture of my dog and we saw
of put some sunglasses on it and took
the picture and put it at the mountain
high school just as I don't know for the
laughs really and then nobody ever
commented and said that either that
looks stupid all that was funny but this
one of those things that maybe if people
didn't didn't know they didn't really
think too much into it so there you go
and that was something that we did and
you can see the another arrow that says
go down there but before I do that you
can see that when I run down here I
blocked off certain areas so you
couldn't go and you can see there's an
exit there and you can see that when I
trained search this locker it said it
needs a crowbar see you then you would
go that there's gonna be lots of things
that you end up finding but you don't
know it yet and you can see that this
storeroom is got another one of those
key code sort of and sort of items and
there's another room here which you know
you might look in at some point or you
need to go in here eventually but we're
gonna follow the arrows down and this is
a flickering light because everybody
loves a flickering light
and as you run down I tried to add it's
good to be more coherent than I was with
placing if you know items that are
interactable maybe making it more
obvious or making sure that everybody
knows where ever need to search because
a lot of the things in this game what
you saw up might be able to search on
not just for the sake of not giving you
too many batteries because if I press B
I've only got one battery at the moment
but you can pretty much stock up about
fourteen ventually and then you don't
actually need them eventually but it's
just one of those things that you might
want to consider you know a lot of
people's hair the whole car mechanic of
a battery system which it is a bit sort
of lame I guess but it's another one of
those things and you walk into this
groom he still runs these holes count
while you can again just another thing
to sort of her trying to loot to be sort
of creepy and eerie and scary and as you
if you can hear along with you know as
long as you play in this school you sort
of hear creepy sounds which are just
sounds of sort of metal moving scraping
things like that and it sort of adds to
the atmosphere especially if maybe you
didn't know what was happening I know
what's happening I'm not even listening
to audio so it's not quite as big a
thing but it's good to just have creepy
sort of noises in the background and
footsteps and sort of variation on your
footsteps because you'll hear in a lot
of games like resident evil I always use
that as an example cuz it was a really
good example they have you know what do
I want to say like footsteps on
floorboards and they have lots of
different creaking and then you'll hear
creaking so I've just general ambient
creak and it's quite scary I mean if you
solve sits silent in your house really
quiet
you might hear you know your computer
you might hear some lights buzzing you
might hear some people outside you might
hair some creepiness houses and
buildings are not silent it doesn't mean
there's ghosts and monsters running
around it's just one of those things
that make it seem a little bit more
eerie
and as you walk along put a little
basketball on a chair and you can the
hair sort of some keys and it and I sort
of flashlight and you can hear somebody
going into a doll so it was solved to
her then allude to the fact that all you
might want to go down here at this point
see what's going on and you can see that
the some sort of like a spill here and
what we can't go in this room yet and
you know it's just again trying to
allude to as many things you possibly
can and you can see I heard the sound
effect from down there but it's pretty
dark and you can see that this is the
gymnasium area or the sort of gym area
and you can see that when I got to this
doll it's actually locked so I'm going
to obviously need something to go in it
and I can run down here and you can see
that blocked okay now you can see the
stairs B and I can have a look and you
can see that I try to mark everything
accordingly so now you need a keycard so
we've got about a million things going
on now and you're already things I've
got a camera what I was supposed to be
doing I'm just by the speaking getting
my friends but where are my friends now
we walk down here where we heard that
original sound effect and I'm trying to
remember why actually doing the game
guess I haven't played in such a long
time and we're in this star room where
I'm gonna just try and collect all the
batteries that can and you can see that
there's now some barrels with looks like
an oil spill and with a question mark on
so you know again you might need that
eventually so you get in still a little
bits of story in a little elements where
you think you might you know eventually
come back to all these places if you
find an item that you might use so again
it's about again like I always say set
dressing so the whole school was you
know dressed accordingly to look like a
school and I think something bangs in
there I don't know if it did it did it
bang in there you'll have to tell me cuz
I can't hear it again just a little bit
swear just to keep people on the toes
when they go past cuz it could be
something there
yeah the item of a things that you could
search were just random they had
batteries in either yes I even know it
wasn't set specifically I could have
said specifically if I wanted but none
of those things and then this was a
specific sort of art room so you can see
yourself like a pence bill and equipment
and things on the floor and you can see
that a little note here on this thing I
can't really see what this says and some
Hawking's English asked us to move and
continue to talk
fair warning given refused to do so
argued when I would not give where to
him he refused I'm being told to move
for doing fuck all well that was a it
was difficult to read that enough fun
anyway and that's actually and note that
I think I was just again something to
add some something to the game which
made it feel like you know this might
have been a kid who was a bad kid and
you'll see reports about that child and
the other ones and just again something
something out of nothing
just to add to solve some position to
the game and now you can see that I got
a computer room key from this draw here
so we must have passed a doll which had
a computer room so I always give you
some sort of information some people did
want an entry to check what we had but
as long as you didn't wildly click and
not realize that you picked up a key you
were okay and in hindsight in the future
I would always add something to say that
you know in the bottom corner to show
that you've got a key which you can
highlight over so you remembered that
what you've always gone so you don't
just run in and go oh my god
I don't even know why I just picked up
and I've just wasted it so I think it
was one of the doors on this side so you
can see computer lab which I can now
open with the key
and I can walk in here and I'm trying to
think what I needed to do was there
something in here I can remember I think
I can switch these computers on so you
can see that I you know did some
interact ability with the other things
in here so this was sort of the first
major puzzle mm-hmm
which was something that we thought of
the people ended up quite liking so you
can see the shapes like I said that the
enemy is sort of playing with you
throughout the game and sort of looking
for different elements that can make it
feel like you know you're playing a
proper sort of crazy story where
somebody might be playing it it sort of
up on you so you can see that there's a
star a triangle a circle and a soft
shield so you can see on the boards here
there's a shield in this room and you
know if you eventually work it out you
can work out that the shield in this
room corresponds to the number seven
because we're going to need that to open
that key card sort of thing that we had
down the bottom so we've got a seven as
I think the last number we need to look
out for a circle a star and a triangle
so you've got to look into the other
rooms that you could possibly go in and
we've got a security room here which is
also got a keypad so was there anything
in this room yes so it's a circle on
this room so that is a six and you know
I hope everybody's remembering nice for
me because I'm trying to do this look at
the chat and so we've got a seven and a
six and then I think as I recall there
was maybe one in this room a triangle
being far triangles far and then could
have been one down here and I'm not 100%
sure if there was but
yeah and then the diamond is one now
evolved for I've already actually
forgotten what was the diamond being one
and over and back some some people
didn't like the fact that you had to
backtrack quite a bit but he's trying to
add some sort of longevity to the game
so could actually find her seven six
four one yeah well I can't afford paper
so that's what we've got I can't
remember if it was for this one now that
wasn't our code and now we're gonna be
stomped I'm gonna be stomped now
because seven was the last seven was the
last and then circle what was circle god
I'm even I'm even forgetting am I have
to find him a bit of pepper just so I
can remember my own puzzle my own puzzle
trolling me
I should have been prepared for this
really should have been prepared to sort
of work out what I was supposed to be
showing but again like I say if even if
I'm if I'm struggling to remember what
it was then you know it was good enough
to confuse everybody else right so that
the last one was definitely a seven the
circle was the one before that which was
a six in this one I used to remember all
the codes off by her and I could you
know run around like I said in the game
in 20 minutes and then you know to
complete it before you know it in this
room it was a triangle and what's that
for
and what was the other shape that was
looking for it was a star now I don't
know if I'm actually the star wasn't in
this room that was a diamond that was
probably just to trick that was Polly
just to trick me I'm thinking where is
the other one what could it possibly
have been the art room goddess it's
pretty embarrassing that I can't even
remember myself let me just run down
here again nor than a second give me
give me a chance
only been a year since I've played it
now that's the square didn't need a
square design
now I can't remember what rooms I
haven't been in now so it's quite easily
to get confused so I've definitely I've
been in that one we got the square there
I don't think there's there's not a room
down there can't go in there yet has
anybody actually seen the star or just
me going crazy so I'm going crazy
that was a circle can't go in the
science lab I'm sure I definitely got
that one triangle yep
I had to have been had to bend down here
was that this probably this room here
actually that I haven't checked yet oh
it is there we are room number two so
was it to to was the star
yeah properly have probable are properly
riddled myself right let's run back one
more time and then we'll find out you
say you see what I mean DC when you make
it good when you make a decent puzzle
then it gets you good so it's definitely
too triangle is for two four six seven
yeah that's definitely the one and I
think it's probably for the security
room here so again I'll clear that two
four six seven and yeah there we go now
we're in yep yep you're right I should
have remembered and here was a sort of
another sort of puzzling element where
you saw a map of the entire school it
took us ages to sort of decide on the
sort of mapping of the entire school so
you can see that you're here in the
security room and you can look around
the different areas so you can see where
you could possibly be and you can see
the different zones because this was a
puzzle that I worked on for like two
weeks especially when it gets activated
so sort of turn different sections off
and stuff like that and it took
absolutely ages and killed me especially
testing it and again we tried to add
some little bits where you could see
that there's ventilation off in a
particular zone so I'm giving you more
information about you know what you
might need in the future and you can see
that now there's information on the
backup generator and you can see that
pod question mark because you know
everybody loves a lot of question mark
and you got I need this upon a lot of
well alarm on just because why not it
doesn't do anything it was just
something that fell be funny and maybe
scare people a few people jumped on the
trailer but that's because they're a bit
of a coward anyway and you can see that
I've got sort of sort of different
cameras so you can see different areas
so you can see the power station you can
see the different areas of the school
they're not live updated they're just
pictures to save on performance but
they're just to add a little bit more
believability so you can see exactly
what's going on within the school and
you can see this computer which is got
some sort of information on which again
you might need to use in the future
and I've got something I can pick up a
memory stick which is like a flash drive
and I've got another note here from the
reporter saying that I managed to find a
code to the security room it was written
in a notebook must have been one of the
security team members I sat through what
felt like hours of video tapes I finally
found something the janitor had taken
two students down into the laundry room
and knew there was up there was
something about that room he had one of
them tied up and made him watch as he
beat the other with some sort of weapon
it was extremely hard to watch but it
was good evidence for my story I can see
it now a police cover-up beating and
torture took place in ask in the school
I was right under the nose of the head
teacher strong but effective I guess
time to get out of here now this was
quite ironic because the actual head
teacher of this school is my dog's our
beagle and we put the actual principal
is actually principal Beeks so I was
right under the nose of the head teacher
so again if you sort of were in on the
sort of inside joke right under his nose
being a dog haha funny funny and again
just some sort of you can see the tapes
there that he might have looked through
as it was going along so again just
adding a little bits to sort of
reinforce the idea that there was a
reporter here he had looked through
loads of tapes and he had found some
sort of details but now you remember
that we've got a key card and you
remember that computer that had a
question mark at the beginning and you
think to yourself yeah I could probably
use it there so I guess or and now we
sort of added in another element here
and you see that the solve we start and
you know the tried to creeper fire the
whole idea of this game and add the
sound effects to make it seem you know
have you got white takes so these things
sort of appear so having an on on I
can't even think of the word ominous
areas to make it feel more creepy and
then it you know it needs to be so you
don't need to put us on a ghost man
jumping out in front of you because you
know you don't need to do that
and you can see that now I can take this
to the computer knits and user memory
stick and you could hear a little sound
and now you can see that there's a
little letter saying here but please be
advised the code for the starve room is
changed with the incidents with some of
the students with the altercation with a
janitor the students managed to obtain
the code and locked student inside with
the janitor which led to allegations and
the investigation the matter has been
dealt with in the code now is 3 1 2 9 so
again we get another code which is for
that storeroom that we originally saw
yeah the scraping metal was just to sort
of simulate the sound of somebody
upstairs so you're not trying to just be
area again yet again and we can go for 3
1 2 9 I think it was yep and we got it
right and then we can search these items
and these took a while just to stock up
the sort of items on these shelves just
to make it look like you know it could
be a storeroom
so people like it when it feels like it
was something again I go about along
this believability buff I believe that
we saw did it well enough that it feels
like it could have been a school and it
could have been stuff that happened so
now we can open the dart and go down
into the sort of creepy looking basement
and we will come walk across and you can
see the salm eyes at the bottom of there
which solve you know were there to sort
of be more spooky because you sort of
reveal a little bit more tidbits of what
that thing actually was you know later
down the line so it's about now giving
you something else to think about you
know is there goodness some gonna be
actually some in AI that comes around in
chess is you but you don't quite know
about again it's one of those things
that you know you need to find out and
we need to crawl back just bill and you
can see that there was another letter
here keeping this all a secret has been
pretty easy since well forever but
recently those meddling kids who won't
leave me alone they're onto me I know it
I'm going to have to do something about
them it's a bit awkward to read term
break is coming up I'm sure no one
notice if they don't make it home
soon this school will be will be no more
with the toxic waste plan about to
happen
they think they can on me they need me I
have protected them for years they're
not going to take this away from me I
need to have my fun before this becomes
a ghost town I might keep the mouthy one
as a pet so again this was supposed to
be something from the actual janitor
himself sort of writing something to say
that you know the kids you know may have
been bullying him or you know the
something alludes to something more
sinister going on and you can see
there's everybody's favorite puzzle here
again and you can see that although we
might need another switch to do this and
everybody's favorite everybody's waiting
for the bolt cuz there they are
now we can get into the gym to sort of
allude to the next bit how many hours
did I put into the entire game and I
wouldn't like to say her in probably too
many yeah
the meddling kids was quite scooby-doo
ish yeah
considered did I consider doing voice
acting for it or did I consider getting
somebody to voice act it for us because
it's one of those things that people
don't like if it's not done well and if
it's soft cringy then people got very
good doing voice acting and we've got a
bull blowing might need and then there's
a report not five again trying to give
you more tidbits to what's going on
I could hear noises moans from the
basement it seems to be from the laundry
room the door is solid no way to get in
there this must be where those incident
happened with the kids this school is
really messed up I think I saw something
down one of the corridors I don't know
what the hell it was it was short quick
really strange looking maybe I'm just
seeing things now I'm definitely seeing
things I'm going to see if I can find
any more information maybe some clues so
again the janitor alluding to some stuff
that you've even have already been
alluded to already read some things
about and you can see that the laundry
room is there but we can't go in that
yeah so we've got the in bolt cutters
and we saw we need to now head back
out really so what would I recommend
some miss Stein off game development I
don't know try not be too ambitious with
your actual game itself
just keep it fairly small and you know
get confident with writing some game
mechanics and don't get too overwhelmed
with doing stuff you just need to break
it down into small little tasks and like
I said that if something if that da and
by the gym was locked and I need to pick
something up you just had a little sort
of track a little boolean to say now if
I've got the bolt cutters I couldn't in
a now open this door so it's just pretty
much this just like that so now you can
see that I can run back up here and I
can run down the school to where the
gymnasium area was like I said I
considered the voice acting but then I
need to find something to do it and need
to program it all in
so again I didn't really feel like it
was worth it enough to end up doing it
and now I break the channel and we can
go in and we're in the sort of gymnasium
area and this was a had quite a
difficult thing to do in unity 4.3
because see the wooden floor which is a
bit shiny there wasn't like reflection
probes and stuff it's more it was
something where you had to back out a
texture of this area and you know based
on the lights that were there you made
it look a bit more reflective because it
was quite hard to do and you can see you
know just some sort of gymnasium mats
and stuff like there's even some rope I
don't know if I put I think I put there
I put a soft cloth modifier on to make
it look like you know those drops that
you're getting sort of a gymnasium area
this sort of got a bit weird but they go
sort of another another sort of little
tiny bit because you can see that there
it's all a bit broken but I thought was
cool nonetheless and with a lot of
markings and stuff that and now we can
go into an area that we haven't been in
yet and we can go into the sort of
changing room area and here we still
need a crowbar and you know we think
that if we can go into a new area we'll
probably find something cool and there
we go
pick up the crowbar everybody's
favourite also
and you can see now we can end up
searching the all these lockers and you
can see that if I can search these
lockers now then I could search all
those are the lockers that were closed
beforehand so you know then I can get a
stock of batteries for later on almost
like when you get a boss battle but not
quite like that and we've got another
reporting now this is probably I think I
remember this one I went to leave
through the fire table of course it's
locked it's like I'm in a horror game
haha I'll find another way but first let
me take a selfie now I wasn't ever sure
about this line but my friend wanted to
put it in so we ended up leaving it in I
don't know where it sort of finds itself
in the whole grand scheme of things and
then he says I'm joking I don't do
selfies I'd ring my friend to come and
help me but there's no signal here it
just gets better
shit I've gone back to the security room
I've hidden in the locker heard
footsteps and the rattle of the keys no
joking this time somebody is in this
school now the lights have gone out I
saw him it came into the security room
ooh is wearing a large count and a hood
was it the janitor surely not
he didn't hear me I held my hand over
mouth I'm really spooked there must be
an exit that's open is a bit here's a
bit of a plonker yeah I always thought
it was a bit weird to write that but you
know if you know you can get away with
it not too many people mentioned it so
you know it was okay and then we picked
up the bull because you can see around
this side there's no bulb in it and
we've got a little question mark and if
you hadn't you know picked it up there
would be a question mark and you think
to yourself you know what do I need to
do now
I've press it and you can see that it
said there is all a cover up now I'm
wondering now you're wondering or you
know what could have happened to your
why is it cover up so you've got to walk
out you see the little sign and you
would have saw something Scott along
along the background and you can see
shall I make you my next pet because
referring to possibly the children and
what has happened to them
and then as we go out we got over here
and we're you know going out because
we're thinking you know what do we need
to do now realistically and now we'll
leave the solve this sort of gym area
only walk to once you know where we
might need to go and you can sort of
hear the lights going off and we can
walk down here and it says find the
generator so or going towards where you
know we thought the generator was it was
back down here to watch the right
because I remember excited you know like
I said I tested it a million times so I
do remember when most of the things out
so you can see them down here we're
looking for the generator that we saw
just before it all ended and we can go
ah great it needs fuel my favorite
another one of my favorite puzzles in
the whole wide world of ever know where
to find some fuel so we remembered that
there was some you know an oil spill
with some sort of fuel so we need to go
that way but now it's locked so why
can't we go through here now and now
we're stuck in here so we sort of
finding out an element of you know wide
what we do next and what would we need
to actually do I'm a good length for
gameplay is usually around you know
people like longer games especially if
they've got a lot in them usually
between you know two and three hours a
problem minimum and you know go probably
two hours at a minimum and then you know
beyond that especially it works better
if your games got replay value it'll add
time on by itself this doesn't
particularly I've replay value because
once you've done it you've done it and
then you can't really do anything with
it again I don't really up there the
game no because it's coming to a point
where you know if people come to me with
a problem that was broken I could update
it but like I said it's in 4.3 so it's
pretty old now
now I can't remember there should be
there should be like a a phone that goes
off at one point and this door opens I
think yeah I can hear the phone now and
then we can walk in here and we can see
sort of like a little effect on the wall
and you can see lots of solved like oh
that one of those we had flashbacks with
things saying look in like what might
have happened in the past because you
know how it been drugged with that you
know bottle that had been drunk from so
you've sort of hallucinating and seeing
different things and you see sort of
text messages that people have sent in
the past to see that I heard something
can you help me with little things like
that I was just trying to be another
relevant you can see sort of like a box
of mobile phones and camping stuff so
you might not have been the first person
that this actually happened to so you
know who's the janitor taken and you
know what's actually happened when this
whole process and you can see that the -
um and he's just trying to allude to the
fact that if you're not the first you
know what could have happened what is
going on in the whole this whole idea of
this school and I'll just have to wait
till this audio sequence has been done
bit was just long enough for maybe
peoples have a look around and see their
notes that were there and you can see
there's another another know and these
were suppose have been notes from people
who were here in the past who were also
like Joel and doing just things to
saying that and my wife was tick and we
were camping on the hill about a mile up
the trail that woke up in the middle of
the night I heard screams from a
distance I came over to this school no
sign of her there was loads of funds in
camping gear stored away what's going on
we were not the first that's obvious
someone is in here I keep hearing them
all the exits seemed to be locked tight
if I don't make it out please might tell
my kids that I love them from somebody
else called Gerry see so it was just
trying to allude to the things that you
already saw it may have worked out in
your own mind
and now look we got another text message
at this point so now we've got another
text message and you can see that this
is the last text as my phone's about to
die I don't know where Mike is we're
trying to find a way back down the
stairs and and he just disappeared find
a way upstairs so yeah again I'm
reminding you that you're still looking
for your friends that's the main sort of
mission in it but there's little things
in there stopping you do it so I needed
to find a way upstairs you know you need
a keycard originally to get up to that
staircase in skin staircase B so now we
get to here and then you open this door
and you get a little shock sound and
this got a lot of people actually and
then it's an easel saying your courage
is misplaced so yet again another soul
trying to be an airy step and now we
need to find the fuel that we originally
wanted to get after so we can run down
here and we're aiming to get to the
place where there was that fuel but now
you can see remember that place with
that the something outside even though
this off you can see that the torch goes
this our flashlight goes to the wall
because I don't know why there was some
collision issue there that couldn't fix
but there's a math but this was supposed
to catch your attention if that you
walked past me or like oh yeah there's a
lens flare on it and a concea and you
know you walk in here and you're like
what's going on and then you see our
look here's the empty jerrycan that I
wanted you know I'm gonna need that I
can use that with the fuel that's good
and now you can see the doors locked on
milano the door's locked
and then you can hear these blood on
this floor and you can think you can
hear the sound of eating that i found up
being quiet
and it was meant to allude that that
little sort of a thing that you saw in
the sort of basement at one point and
you sort of trying to again allude to
the fact that you know there's creepy
actual things going on and he's trying
to sort of slowly slowly slowly finding
out little things about it on and I
think I can search in there for some
possible more batteries and then I just
need to wait for that finished before I
could go out side into here and you can
see that and you heard that the locker
sort of flicked up and there's another
sort of jump-scare sort of thing and
that got a lot of people because
especially if you're wearing headphones
and then you hear those lockers bang
it's a pretty good one so it could be
sort of the school could have been
rigged up by him to sort of do it and
you can see that there's now a fuel so
you can fill up your jerrycan so now
there was a sound effect of filling up
the fuel so like yeah now we've got a
full jerrican called cool now we can go
back and do the generator and yeah this
might not seem an awful lot scary I mean
it maybe is a little bit more immersive
if you're actually there you know
listening with the headphones and you
don't really know what's going on and I
remembered that in this locker those
batteries and then there was the power
switch that we needed that was probably
the most hidden thing that we'd put in
this game
ie that the power switch was hidden in
that locker that some people you know
found it a bit tricky and then didn't
hide it because I thought about putting
it somewhere and then we decided we put
it in that locker in the security room
and I think there is a hint down here
that some people struggled with it so if
you were actually cautious enough you
could see that spare generated tools can
be found in the security room Locker
so you had to be a sort of insightful
enough to end up looking at that and
then you can see that we can film the
generator up now and there's a sound of
if you can hear just a sort of jerrycan
emptying out to fill up this thing
and we can place the other switch there
so we're ready to do this puzzle so
again it was like the one that we would
originally see so you know that if
there's even instructions if people
didn't know what they were doing that to
make the to make the generator what you
need to fill up with fuel and press the
button on the jet that generates to
engage the power so I'll make sure you
have five levers on the wall and pull
them in and the correct sequence it's
not the same code but I can remember let
me guess
- that's right - we're gonna get far far
three no see yeah I got it wrong then
and I know that was the fourth one so
there we got it wrong because it reset
so two three number five number one and
this one and then I heard the sound of a
doll
I'm thinking an air creepy stuff on
banging and then we put added some more
sound effects to make it seem more Airy
and then you can hear it I saw banging
and then eventually you know after
you've gone through the little scary
moment you can sort of then open this
door you just have to you just have to
way to help for a minute and love and
then there's another sign which suggests
look this way a chop chop so again we
were just them alluding to more things
and making it seem like he is self
setting you up and you know loading two
more things where do you get the sound
effects and those are there's a big pack
on the unity stalk um how come when it's
called big FX pack or something which
has got thousands of audio effects as
well as gain stuff from friends sound
org and just mixing it together because
that's all you can do think about just
close your eyes and think about what
possible sounds could make up a sound
because before I move on I just like to
say that there was a the developer the
sound designer in Skyrim who said they
did the sounds for you know like the
magic and the lightning or the fire or
ice you know what do all those things
sound like the the most of the things
don't have a sound so you need to think
about you know what you can possibly
make this sound so you might have to
think and and get weird sound like a a
stone hitting I think for most of the
pick up sounds I've got is somebody
throwing a stone on the floor but it
just sort of eludes the fact that you're
picking something up and anything like
that if you've rustling to search
through a bag you get some sort of
clothes rustling and put that with some
paper something like that if you're
picking up a piece of paper and I
reporters know you have a bit of paper
that's being turned up and it sort of
has that sound I could be a ripping
piece of paper you know little things
like that which just add elements to it
the biggest inspirations are guitar we
watched every single horror game Under
the Sun possibly you know from a lot of
different youtubers played them
ourselves and just took as many ideas
from everybody else as possible
so you can see now this door shut and I
can't move
so you can see that I open it and it
says look behind you because that's
pretty classic I said behind you Joel
and then no really is behind you this
time and then you have the sort of
something hitting you or something
happening and then you sort of knocked
out knocked over and it goes black and
then you set to wake up in the star room
again but now it's completely soft
trashed and broken and you can see that
now I can't go down there anymore
because I don't addint the Holland Terra
TV game is don't make people go down
somewhere if you know it's a big long
corridor if they've realistically don't
need to go down there again because it's
just gonna make the longevity and
they're gonna get annoyed so you have to
even though there's a lot of
backtracking in this game you have to
keep it so they don't get too annoyed up
or come out and be wanting the sort of
killing you again I think down here but
this was where that original entrance
was where the computer that we did the
solve flash drive and I blocked that
area off see couldn't go down there
anymore saw what it was another element
to say I don't need you to go down there
anymore seed after waste you time so I
think this was the very start of the it
was the get this green gas here where
you can see that if I walk into it then
you can hear some audio of him starting
to choke and cough hope for everybody
could hear that and it was solved to a
lude of the to allude the next things
that you had to do so if I can't go down
that way and everywhere else was blocked
I don't really know what to do now so
I'll look now these this thing that I
was telling you about before I can see
that there's emergency power and I can
see that if I read the thing on here you
can I have two three zones on at any one
time
and zone 1 must be powered on at all
time so the whole board goes off so like
I said this was one of the things where
God it took me ages and ages and ages
and ages to create this debug it because
if I put on zone 2 you can see that zone
2 comes on I can put the school lights
on so I can have three zones on at once
and now seen as ozone to is on you can
actually hear ventilation noises because
that's what I added to make it seem
they're not realistic that the
ventilation is now on so now Mac I can
there's no gas here anymore now if it
turns on to off now what the glass gas
would come back cuz the end ventilation
sounds would go off so I have to see now
if I run up here to stairs B when we
originally had seen it you can see that
I can look at the dal and it said all
this this needs power now so originally
had power cuz the entire school had
power but now that's a particular zone
you've got to be careful
alright done well thanks for tuning in
with a stream and I hope you complete it
in the end and you can see that we tried
to make it so that you can see the upper
floors that where you've got stairs be
here and you've got stairs they're there
so I need this woman to have power to
that area so it's about working out the
little puzzle I'll show you this last
bit and then I'll probably end this sort
of stream here because it's been going
on for that one off one hour forty
minutes and I'll do the sort of last
half maybe another time so people can
check it out so it doesn't end up
lasting too long and boiling people and
with it on but we walk down here and you
can hear some music and you can hit see
that this is now open and we walk
through here and this is a new path this
was this off kindergarten area and we
can only walk in here and we can see
that this is another star room and we
look in and you can see that so this is
what you've been looking for and it's a
key card that we need
so again loading something else with the
sort of same track record of using the
easels to solve be quite ominous and now
we can pick up the key card and then we
turn around and everybody really liked
the fact that now there's no doll there
anymore and so you know there's no
darling all that seems a bit weird and
we'll turn round again and now there's
the sort of jack-in-the-box
which is playing which was we thought
was quite cool and scary because it's
getting playing with your mind whether
it's a figment of your imagination or
something else and then but little jack
in the box pops up with it's sort of
sound effect and as it's happening
you're wait for you know something to
happen and it pops back to real life and
then the easels change this time you
better hurry now John and then we can
see it this way and we can turn back and
you can see there's another thing set up
for you with a little scare which is how
do you define what is real yeah
another one of those things to say that
how do you define what's real do you now
actually know what's going on at this
very moment or is it you know is it a
little bit creepy what is it is it real
is it just again that's been set up so
now I've got the key card and I've got
the power onto the particular area that
I want you to think so we can go up here
now it's green and I've used the key
card stairs we haven't been upstairs yet
and you can see that this area is
blocked off we've got another lock of
that and you can see that there's now
some sparks and a solve looks like
what's wore in the flop and you could
hear that I was get electrified as I
walked in there so now I can't go that
way
now by can't go in here because I'm now
choking on the actual fumes so I'm
obviously gonna need to do something
with the power so the powers on appeal
next to this or these backs they're
going on so I've now opened that doll
here because it's now open so I can
probably turn the power off to this area
seeing as though that's on there so we
can walk here and you can see nobody has
ever made it this far John so again it's
trying to lewd two more things and then
there was a slum door here where the
character might have been behind it it's
just another knob which is about some of
the children and we can run back down
here and into the security room again
and you can see that I've got zone forum
so what I'll do is I'll turns on to off
now actually zombie to some far-off put
zone three and then puts on to one
because that's what I need now and so on
when acid always stay on this on to is
to get rid of that gas just down the
hallway there and zone three is what we
need for later I think as I remember
rightly
the janitor probably did they've a crazy
guy
so it seems and then as we've run around
you can see that there's no sparks on
anymore so we can now run through the
actual water because I'm not get
electrified by the the crazy box
Collider that's there and then you can
see that the arrows are still here
pointing that the way we need to go and
you can see that the Samedi here were
they a sort of thing over the head and
you can see remote reporter not seven
just by him so there's some fucked up
being in here I traveled or something it
keeps following me scuttling around on
the floor freaky thing I saw him again
it is the janitor it has to be I've been
forced to come upstairs I'm in the doms
hiding the Wardrobe I have my gas mask
on there's some really bad toxic waste
up here here he is how does he know
where I am
he's calling out my name WTF why am I
still writing my book he's opening the
wardrobes and making a run for it so I
suppose when you think about it you
don't even know if it was the actual
reporter that was you know writing these
things it could have been the janitor
couldn't it because he's everything else
upon you so now I can pick up the gas
mask and when I've got the gas mask I
need a new filter so I can see that and
now I'm stuck and yet again it was
another sort of element to say what's
going on so why am I stuck and then he
turned round and you see that the guy
was is actually stood there looking at
you and you sort of get dragged
backwards and then you're back to normal
which was sort of morva maybe another
freaky thing again are just some sort of
something to make it break up this off
monotony of just running around
collecting stuff and we can run in this
DOM and these are all like you know the
part of the Dom boarding school and
they're quite like these areas with the
sort of lights and all the curtains and
stuff like that and you can see it
there's another report here it was a
letter to the parents of the school to
say that the kids had locked themselves
in with the janitor and
that you know the janitor had done up
inappropriate things to them and then
they'd got in trouble for it
and you can see that I can pick up the
gas mask filter and I can press G to
equip the gas mask and you can hear that
put it on and you get some sort of
scratches on the screen to suggest that
you're actually wearing a gas mask I
think the big thing is Russell is mask
games that you play it end up being a
big key hunt I mean if you take the car
concept of a game like Skyrim you get a
quest I need to find the golden claw or
whatever it is I need to find this
Germany to find this claw and then
that's it you know you fight some
enemies in between but then you take it
back and you get some money and then
that's about Percy that's your job line
and your character levels up I mean yet
there's more things in it you level up
and you get your character up you fight
maybe different enemies so it Resident
Evil for example if I strip it down to
its collar and and stake out the combi
you find a key to open a door to open
another door to get to a new area so
then I open another doll and yeah then
there's some puzzles thrown in between
like any game ever I mean yeah I mean
like I said I never claimed that this
game was the core best example of a
horror game or an adventure game or
whatever else but it's about
understanding and adding more layers as
much as you can because if I ever make
something in the future I'm gonna make
it more and more believable and far more
advanced than this ever was
and we can went to the sounds lab I
think there's a sound going on look they
got principal bzees room ironically and
it's in this room I think there's a
Radio one that's making a noise and I
can press it off and then I'll see music
soon as the mind
tick-tock because you know you still get
your objective to do what you were
trying to do and I can run a Nick and
you can see the thing with the sort of
creepy eyes again and you can see that
this is four powers on but I need a key
card so you can see here now where again
the Janet has given us a little task and
he said let's play a game very much sort
you know likes a bit like so the card is
key for your bet get her friends to be
free a feeling light in the head it
might be time for and then you had to
guess the missing word so if you weren't
a smart enough we gave you a sort of a
three-letter word you see that it's time
for bed so you saw some beds in the sort
of boarding rooms
and here was the only you could see that
about that one went into this science
room and you could see the little
science e room with the sort of lab
equipment and but we need to follow that
puzzle to look for the thing time for
bed
so was in this one so let's play a game
time is ticking
but are they still kicking I feel it's
time for a tree so you bet better get
something too and then eat being the
answer to that and this was a note from
the kids to say Chris it's a girl
someone's got the keys to the storeroom
you to lead him in ask him to get you a
replacement pencil sharpener or a new
parent or something just get him in
there Sam will do the rest
PS destroy this not this time unlike the
other one as if John fuck from Brian
because the this was thought of like
their plan to lead that Janus cuz they
didn't like him you know it's a sort of
from those of the notes that you read
that you know to plan that they it sort
of you know inappropriately touched them
so they get in the game in trouble and
now we're at the sort of cafeteria
because it was they needed something to
eat again another thing you had to be
observant to work out what the different
areas that you needed to go to and now I
said let's play again it's all a test in
which you could be the best and this one
is hidden in there something for you to
grab and it's meant to be the science
lab so he can run on back down here I
think it's in this doll to the science
lab and then you can see that you know
we can look in here we've got a big red
arrow pointing and then you can say open
safe and we've got the star room key
card you see a pop at the bottom now
something's going on and we look behind
us and you can see something there with
a bit of a shock sound I'm saying it's
time John
and that was another thing just to pop
him up and sort of give you another
scare before you know you decide oh you
know else you're gonna do so you've got
the key cancer you knew you had to get
to this doll and then you've almost got
a little a small moral choice here which
is follow the red arrows to save your
friends or follow the Red Cross to save
yourself so you can see that the red
arrows are on this doll so if you're you
know your good friend you would go in
there or if you were a bad friend
there's red x's on the floor and you can
say the hyena I want to get out of here
and then you can open the push to exit
and then it says you thought it would be
that easy so he was never gonna let you
out as it were when it came to it so it
was seeing like another thing of just
this whole concept of it playing with
you and just doing everything with it
and just keeping with this consistent
snail of these easels and things always
doing things to make it more scary so
now we can go into this room and you can
see that there's more easel set up and
the music's move music soothes mine so
you might have not been the first person
that you know he's done it to and it
could be something else and you can see
them all on the floor and you can see
something back here which is like a
laundry chute with an arrow and with a
question mark
and you know or watch no one you see a
question right you can't help but
interact with it so you go to up and
have a little look because that's
obviously what you do and you sort of
look and you can see the guy behind you
and he knocks you out and knock you down
into the actual larger issue and you can
hear the sounds of falling into a
laundry chute and then onto the floor
and again you can't just search in
laundry chute fall onto floor because
you don't get sound effect for that so
now we're in the the actual laundry room
I mean I'm at this point I'm getting
towards the end of the game now because
Nassau might as well finish it at this
point
and we're in the laundry room which is
you know where the kids could have got
murdered at woman that where we've been
suggested before and you can see here
over think I'm dead everyone thinks I'm
dead
we're trying to warn people that he was
sick sick he was scary he's always one
step step ahead of us we had to try and
set him up but that was only the final
straw he flipped Chris found a secret
passage we kept it to ourselves for a
while but that we went to investigate
we knew we were coming he killed them in
front of me left them to rot in lingerie
and vile cruel scum he's kept me in here
for months he waits sometimes so hungry
feeds me human flesh always bringing new
bodies down I can't take any more and
this was another one of those children
who were the ones that had been taken by
the janitor and if you see it here he's
got like lines that the child has had to
written out and you can see as you you
sort of walk around here you can see the
different areas and you can see there's
a little letter here with a sort of
stamp of Leo where and you can see
sector 1 and subject Joel dent Joel
again then was arriving on the west side
of the recon location for the in the
next couple of days prior
you'll be sent to direct straight to
your smart meter when confirmation is
made please make sure all appropriate
systems are arranged for his arrival ask
for further details of required but we
have high hopes for this individual we
need to test his resolve and see how
strong his heart is and how stable his
mind is you'll continue to have Leo West
protection and continue at the course of
your monthly delivery
so again it's trying to allude to more
things and you can see in here it's a
bit dark on here but we've got this room
where you can see this box moving so
it's got like the little creature in and
you can see that it never let me lead in
level it's you leave and you can see the
solve dead bodies and stuff down here
and you walk into this area and then you
can start hearing some sound effects so
these what we were quite proud of in the
end on these just put the headphones on
it's like in here so you can hear the
soft romping and some sort of flies
around and you can hear the little thing
and you can hear uh sort of a little
bang of a pot just then so it's meant to
suggest outside and you can and you can
hear a sort of door up and then with
still some way there's still the thing
eating with the flies and then you can
hear some keys rustling here and then
it's the somebody's trying the doll and
it bangs on it
and then somebody's moving something in
the background and the sort of look
sounds like a some stones moving well
sorry you couldn't hear it I could have
turned it up but it was just solved
somebody rustling around grabbing some
things and then just coming to the door
and there's a shame because if I'd known
it was so quiet it would turn to hell
but I would have broke and everything if
I did so I'll maybe possibly record it
sometime again and you could hear the
things and even in this room you can
hear sort of washing machines moving
what I could do is I could try and I
don't if that made any louder that you
can hear sort of washing machines moving
it's off to add to the ambience and then
here's a soft secret switch so we press
the secret switch and then you can hear
the sit here and the sound of the smooth
stone and then there's the moving soft
contraption which lets you in
and then we walk down here down the
secret passageway and we're sort of
getting towards some sort of cool stuff
and then we get to solve a secret
elevator which was solved the sort of
towards the end of the game so what
we're doing here and then we close it
because you know again if you haven't
played it before you don't know what's
going on so we are fade out and we have
some sound effects of the elevator going
down there's that way and then we sort
of get to the point where it's almost
like a a surprise situation and I get it
so on a hit a Collider those the dolls
then close on this elevator so we can't
end up breaking it and we then hit
ourselves in the sort of the leo where
area and you can walk in and it solve
solve a little bit inspired by resin the
evil and things like that because you
can see the little sort of leo where a
map of the actual facility with like a
hologram which moves and you can see the
sort of cameras to the school and the
sort of an interrogation room and things
like that and you can see the different
things and we can see that you know the
storage and all the things to going on
here and you come down to the bottom and
you can hear somebody at the toilet and
then there's no lift going on now I
wasn't a time machine it was just
something to go to this secret area
which was eluded of you know the playing
a test on him and then we can interact
with some of the screens and we can see
that there was other people that were
tested other than Joel and you can see
that Joel dent is at the bottom and you
can see that he's still to be a tested
for recruitment so it's all pretty much
a test between finding suitable
candidates and things like that
and you can see that there was a letter
written sage or a Joel dent served 12
years in the US Marine Corps Special
Forces captain before being discharged
for massive head trauma he came to Leo
where's tension after receiving the
highest commendation of Medal of Honor
for his bravery and valor we believe
Joel has the perfect and stable mind set
to be man first to manipulate on one
side he has a family with two children
an ex-wife who can be used as a form of
motivation for cooperation with Leila
Joel wears two close friends in Mike
Mike ship well and filly breath well
both of which are still in the forces
the usual route has been followed in
which the friends mobile phones have
been cloned so incoming and outcoming
messages have been intercepted and sent
complex voice imitation software used to
arrange a meet in the camp at the top of
the trail everything has the green light
and we are waiting the arrival within
the next 24 hours we need to this to be
a success as we are running out of
suitable candidates for the process so
again it sort of then tying up some
loose ends in the fact that you know why
was he getting text messages from people
you know how did he believe it and why
was he in text message in the school and
why was all this sort of crazy stuff
going on
and the game was about two years but
it's almost towards the end of the game
now and we walked down here because we
found some marks who you know we want to
go to different places so we want to
this is only interrogation and security
want to go to you know na classified are
weapons of mass destruction research
facility awards one two three five six
so we can now press the button to get in
the other elevator to go somewhere so
we're just waiting for it to come down
you should be able to hear some sort of
audio of the elevator coming down and
then it's opening up I'm gonna I'm just
going to turn the audio down a touch
because in here it gets quite loud and
you're probably a Urrea drums or bleed
because mine did when I created it and
now we're here and you can hear the some
guy in the bathroom that's finishing up
and it's just closing before he gets out
of the door and you can hear somebody
banging on this as you saw about to go
down
and then the sound effects of the
elevator moving the elevators obviously
not moving but it's just the sounds to
simulate we're moving down and then we
get a crash and then we get a big red
warning lights and sort of a shaky cam
and you can hear the alarm and the gas
coming in and then we get you Joel the
character choking as you know he's been
gassed in this elevator bukas and you
know this was the whole part that with
you know finding out what's going on and
then he's getting captured by Leo where
I guess and then you sort of waking up
and seeing what happens so you go to a
black screen and you see that it's two
months later so you don't know what's
happened over the course of this time
until you're about to sort of wake up
and then now you can hear a sort of
heart rate monitor ECG whatever the
soundness of like a constant beep as you
sort of fade in slowly with a little
camera animation looking at the ceiling
so you know what are you doing and then
you can see in this room and it sort of
fades and then you're back at this point
here and you don't have much camera
sensitive scene you've got a little bit
of a blur here so you can have a look at
the room and you can see the saw like
the little ECG monitor with scans and
stuff like that and you can see the
little stethoscope on the desk and you
can see the my social cognitive science
for level a and you can see sort of the
room with what's going on and just saw
up a little bad with like the vials next
year because it was sort of trying out
all that little bits of trying to make
it feel like it might be a secret
facility
yeah yeah you quite right with the
monitors because a lot of people ended
up going self to and far thinking of
what can I do so it'd be good to have
some maybe like some queue to tell you
that and that was what you should have
done and how it should have gone that
way
yeah help make sure it's an FPS survival
multiplayer game with RPG elements and
then might be selling a few million
copies but now you can start to hear
some let me push pause at second and you
can hear the sort of hurry money to go
up and then you can hear some people
talking and the solve monitor go sort of
really high and then you can hear
somebody entering a code a dot and then
you can solve here a flatline and you
sort of hear some sort of muffled people
running in and again all the sound
effects are very singular sound effects
we just have to make one layered sound
effect to make it and you can hear
people solve over you may be about to do
a sort of ECG and you can hear the sound
of the ECG going off at the time and
then there's the and the nasta
cliffhanger at the end of the game
really that it's left to your
imagination to decide that if you could
be left for a sequel then it could be ah
but you don't really know what happened
to Joel because they were doing the
tests and they'd left him in the sort of
coma and
then all the things that happened with
the whole sort of idea of you know will
he save his friends will he not you
don't really know what's happened to him
if you hit continue it just go back to
this menu and I was just saving time
because it just as a fade so it doesn't
it doesn't do anything more unless
unless somehow it's been updated and I
don't know what it does but I'm a just
literally goes on and then gets to back
to this menu screen so like in the
comments to this some this stream if you
know you want to see updates on possible
current sort of projects that we're
doing you can follow you like volumetric
games you can look at the website and
follow us on Twitter or Facebook and we
will post updates when we have more
information about the current game that
I'm developing or will upload more
content to the soft speed shooter
Channel when you know there's a maybe a
trailer or more concrete stuff to share
but other than that you know this was
just an insight into looker you know
their entire playthrough of this game
and sort of give you an idea of you know
what we did where the ideas came from
some ideas and stuff to look at when
you're doing it yourself maybe mistakes
to avoid and then you know you can take
what mistakes I made and make it far far
better
the games were flee about two hours by
for the most part knew what I was doing
so I could breeze through most of it
somebody actually did a speedrun for the
game and they did it in and I think
there is a website for actual speedrun
and it does it in didn't about was 20 or
30 minutes I mean I could do it pretty
fast I could probably set a speed run
myself because as long as you know all
the codes and where exactly where you
going and you don't get anything wrong
you can do it pretty fast but yeah
hopefully this sort of game it would be
a living thing about you know what you
can do to make a video again because
it's quite a big thing in the end that
it takes a lot longer I showed the
entirety of that gaming like two hours
but it took a whole two years so I'm not
making it so it never really does it
justice but just like with the people
who work day in day out in the industry
and things like that they really do put
a lot of effort into
and even though something you know we
can say for anything's like all that was
crap off you know the graphics looked
really crap or anything like that
there's a lot of effort that goes into
it and not just any one thing all the
little things make up you know the
bigger picture
yeah I've said this game is about two to
three hours and four hours depending on
your take with each puzzle you saw it if
you were here from the beginning you saw
all the way through so I did it in just
pretty much you know less than two hours
realistically cuz like I said I knew it
pretty much what was going on
that was made in unity 4.3 yeah so I'll
like to thank everybody for you know
sticking around if you stuck around and
for watching it for even if he had
joined in halfway through I'll upload
this afterwards so you can then see you
know the rerun overall and hopefully it
was you know clear enough for everybody
to see enough sort of volume for
everybody to follow it all the way
through so you know thanks for sticking
with it and checking it out and
hopefully I have more to share in the
future so thanks for watching guys and
I'll see you again bubbly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
