a tutorial which is going to be based
around the idea of doing something sort
of simple crafting may be something
you're not
vaguely similar you'd find in Minecraft
but this is not going to show you how to
make an infantry system and hold though
your items it's going to show you how to
pick up an item and then based on what
you picked up there it will set some
values and you can press a button and
you'll craft another item out that item
so it's based on just initially you'll
find that item then you can craft it
straight away it's not like holding the
item collecting some more items it's
going to best one item produce one thing
and you can change it depending on what
I show you here and everything that you
need to know so if you look at my scene
now it's similar to most of my other
videos I've got a first-person
controller which is tagged player
I've got directional light whatever's in
my scene and what I've got here is if i
zoom in on the object
I've just got it's meant to represent
some logs so all the times made three
cylinders in unity and just group them
all together and name them logs now I've
got a box Collider on these so I create
I deleted each of the colliders off
these logs and put one box Collider over
the whole group so I'll just wing
component physics box Collider and just
so I'll be able to have something to
make and be able to make the kicked-up
and what I've also done is my log there
I've got a plank here that I've made and
all it is is to create a new prefab if
you right click on your project panel
create prefab you'll get an empty box
what you can do is create the object in
your scene so all I did was went and
created a game object other cube
mid-long and I added while I kept the
box Collider kept the mesh renderer
added a rigidbody to it I made sure use
gravity was ticked and from this side I
distract the plank
to the prefab slot so prefab just makes
an object that you can always drag back
into your scene with everything that
you've set so with a rigidbody and stuff
and so that's the basis of what we need
so we're going to be able to pick this
up and produce a plank out these logs so
what I'm going to do first is I'm going
to create a new JavaScript file and call
this and pick up logs and I'm going to
open up one of develop and when that's
open we're going to just delete these
two functions and we're going to write
private variable mouse over equals false
herbs pulse and then we're going to have
two more variables one called length bar
have it call on integer equal to 150
then another variable width bar is set
to integer equals 25 now what we're
going to need to do is actually make it
so that when we hover over the object we
know we can pick it up to give an
indication that we can sew a function on
mouse-over
and if you add the two brackets and then
the curly brackets a mouse or is equal
to true and then we'll save function on
mouse exit add the together brackets or
send mouse over equals false so that's
all well and good
someone we mouse over sets it through
when we exit the object it sets it to
false then we'll write function on GUI
add our two color brackets all set if
mouse over is set to true at the two
curly brackets then inside here we'll
say destroy nope no wrong and in set my
GUI first GUI dot box up and brackets
new rect open brackets 200 along 200
down then we'll set length bar width bar
close the brackets put a comma and we'll
say pickup
logs more close that semicolon and now
we want to write a function called on
Mouse down so when we actually click on
the item will say destroy game object
and now we're going to have to reference
another script so what we're going to
actually need to do is go back into
unity create another screwed java script
and we're going to call this managed in
far inventory I'll manage whatever we
picked up railing and then we're going
to say in here I'm going to say variable
manage script call on manage inventory
not in equals game object dot find
first-person controller close that up
dot get component in brackets manage in
with a semicolon then we'll say manage
script dot and now we need to actually
change boolean in a village script so
what we're going to do is and I'll
delete these in here we'll set variable
log collected boolean equals false I'll
save that save that and then we'll write
in here that manage script dot log
collected is equal to true we'll save
that and that's all we need to do there
mulder will go into unity and will on
our logs here will pop pick up logs and
we'll run the game you'll notice that my
logs are there if I hover over it says
pick up logs if I click it it does what
it needs to do but I haven't actually
said to do anything now if we're going
to manage infantry script what I'm going
to do is create a private variable here
and call this sure GUI set that was
boolean set that equal to false then I'm
going to create two and variables one
called prefab call it in type transform
and then another variable called player
and set that as transform we'll call
this plank actually so we know what's
going on oops then what I want to say is
move on to put write a write function of
bit add the two curly brackets and say
that if log collected is set to true
then add the two curly brackets and says
show Gy is equal to true then we'll set
if log collected is equal to true and
input dot get key open brackets P close
the two brackets put the curly brackets
and say we'll set a function called mate
plank but before we do that we'll set
function on GUI
at the two curly brackets and say if
sure Gy is set to true
then we'll do something so we'll
actually copy this here from our other
script just pass that in but what we're
going to do is set it to 100 200 225 and
then what we'll write in here instead is
press P to craft your blank and then
under here as we wrote up here to the
function to make a plank we'll say
function make plank add the curly
brackets and say instantiate in brackets
plank comma
player dot drums form transform dot
position then we'll say comma quaternion
dot identity close the bracket semicolon
and then say it log collected equals
false and say sure Gy equals false
so essentially I'll run through what the
scripts doing so when we hover over it
we're going to show a GUI if we exit
it's going to set to false or not gonna
see it I'm Mouse down it's going to
destroy the object so the logs and then
we're going to find the script which is
attached to our first controller and set
the logs collected boolean to true and
one logs collected equals true it's
going to actually show the GUI so the
GUI is there not say you can craft
something then if collect if you've got
some logs which is set to true and you
press P you will set the function call
make blank and make plunk just
instantiates the object that we set up
here so the plank the prefab that we
made
and it's going to instantiate right next
to the player and then it's going to set
qalaat logs collected to false and show
it show GOI to false because that means
once it's being created we won't have
any more logs and it won't show the GUI
anymore until we have another game
object which we pick up which has got
the same script attached so if we go
back into unity now and we go on to the
first person controller and we add the
managed infantry then what we're going
to do is add our prefab here and then
we're going to add our first little
controller here I will press play and we
can go up to the object if we hover over
we can see pick up logs or left click to
see that now say press Pete's craft if
we press P you'll notice that I just
dropped a plank and all the GUI have
disappeared if I press P again nothing
happens so then you could do something
with that you could pick it up use an
infantry to pick something like that or
manage it all that way but this is just
a very simple way to take an object set
some values to true when you've got it
got it on the player and then make
something from that instantly so if
you're making a game where you collected
an item and had to make it straight away
to give you health maybe if you had to
pick up objects to craft things but
that's just a very simple way and if you
