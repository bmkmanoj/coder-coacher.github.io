editor extensions for September 2017 so
number one is the bond tool bond
visualizer and this is a bond tool which
is a a torch lets you visualize the
bonds are the rigging that you've done
within unity itself and also comes with
a library so you can sort of pause
things from there it's it says at the
bottom here that there's a free update
coming out with some cool features so
take a look at that so as you can see
you can actually visualize the bond
structure that's already that you might
have brought in from another program so
you can see it in engine and number two
is the global inspector settings which
sometimes if you've got nested game
objects which are hidden and other
things are quite hard to find and
sometimes it can be a little bit messy
so you could find it edit any field on a
game object in actually one place
without you then having to you know try
and rummage around your entire scene and
hierarchy to try and find what you're
actually looking for and it just helps
you manage the things that are there and
it's compatible with 2d and 3d and
supports datatypes vectors colors and
primitives and it's completely component
based so you can change as needed and
number three is the empty at zero
creator so this is one if you end up
creating lots of empty game objects
where you sort of hide things away you
know when you organize your hierarchy
and you see in similar to the other
asset if you've got a lot of these going
on because I do this and you just manage
all the things in the hierarchy so it
doesn't get messy and when you often
create an empty game object ill create
it somewhere strange and you know just
not zero zero zero doubt in sort of the
world space so this asset helps you
create one just zero without you then
having to reset the you know the
transforms to zero so it's just a way
just a shorthand to just save you a few
you know seconds each time you ever do
that and number four is these simple
dialogues and this is a dialogue system
made for simple dialogue trees with a
custom editor
and you can access information within
the script and it's got a custom editor
to add dialogue nodes you can trigger
for each window to detect when you've
hit a node and there's multiple trees
per dialogue for the components and have
different trees for different situations
and number five is auto localization and
this is a as it suggests a localization
tools easy to use this tool for managing
and changing the language in game
there's no need to manually setup the
meaning of each keyword it has a draws
the translation from the google
translate and it will automatically
translate every word and it doesn't use
any API but needs the needs internet for
this to be set up so this is one of
those things that you know might not be
incredibly accurate but if you're
looking for a cheaper alternative to
soft translations and localization this
might be something for you these are all
the top five free editor extensions for
September 2017 so again I'll leave a
