today and this is gonna be looking at
controlling opacity our transparency
within substance so then you'll be able
to bring that forth into your game
engine depending on what ever you use
now it's a fairly easy way to be able to
start doing that all you do is add
yourself an opacity channel and change
to share that with in substance painter
so you can go here to the viewer
settings click on the shed I'm gonna
change it to PBR metal rough with alpha
blending and now we'll go back onto the
texture set settings I'm gonna add a
another channel by clicking the little
plus box and we will add opacity now we
can change this anywhere we like on a
material or sort of a layer that we
might already have within our object so
for the sake of this I'll give you an
example we could do that on many
different things I could do that on my
logo that I've got here I could add an
the opacity channel knock this down and
then it would almost act as a cutout as
something that you might have you know
chiseled out of your object so you can
see all the way through and that's just
simple way to control a simple this
simple opacity and then when you bring
that into your game engine you need to
make sure that you use a shade raw
material that supports transparency so
thanks very much for watching don't
