tutorial and this is going to talk about
and show you how to use emissive
textures within new 35 now emissive
textures of slightly change because they
work with the global illumination and
why this is good is if you have a scene
and emissive objects before and a
message of objective just an object or a
texture that almost illuminates itself
so if you've ever seen an exit sign on a
doll or something in real life and
you'll see it glowing in green now to
simulate that in unity 4 you'd often
have to put a light over it and simulate
that with a sort of greenish color but
now in unity 5 it comes built in with
its own shared and its own emissive
properties now what we want to do is I
will create a new material to show you
how to do this so what we'll do is
create a new material and I'll call this
emissive on the sky yellow for instance
so now if we go to the inspector when we
have a look at that it's just on the
standard shader that comes with unity 5
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
set the albedo just the standard diffuse
to a yellow and then what I'm going to
do is on the emissive you can set a map
here so we've got the emissive or
emission slot down here if we increase
the emission value what I'll say is to
about 3 this is just to show the example
and what I'll do is I'll also copy that
color there roughly because I could copy
the exact IDB values there but for the
sake of this I've got it here now your
emissive value is set to 3 and the
global illumination is real-time now if
I add this emissive color to my object
itself you'll notice that it was already
pre computed with the baking but if I
pull this away from the wall a little
bit because it's a little bit bright it
will recompute the
GUI and you'll notice that the object
will then emit light or its emission
from itself with the unity five share
that itself so which is really good for
as I said creating that exit sign or any
materials actually glow and you want to
that more realistic effect that if
something glows it's going to apply the
color evenly around the space that
you've got on the floor if it wasn't
such a deep red because these walls are
whitish gray you can see it on this
object here on this wall back here and
the two walls corresponding now you can
sort of see the light down at the bottom
but you can see that it casts its own a
mission really it's quite simple yeah as
I said you can add your own emission map
to that side you can obviously increase
the size of the emission depending on
but because we've already baked the
real-time we can decrease it and
increase it as we need to but for the
sake of this it's just a really simple
way to show you how to work simple with
the emissive material and create an
effect that you might be looking for
