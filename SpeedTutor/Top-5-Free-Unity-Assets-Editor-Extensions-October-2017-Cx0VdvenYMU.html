attentions for October 2017 and number
one is the PDT item spawner and this
suggests that it will be free until the
next update and I'm not sure where and
the updates gonna be but if you want to
pick it up well this you know videos
active so it's an item spawner which is
a lightweight system which allows you to
randomly spawn objects or items which
were directly and with the solution
extracted from the procedural dungeon
toolkit and it allows you to supply a
prefab and self spawn locations when
with scripted objects and you can easily
control you know if one item wants to be
spawned one time in one scene you can
control wherever it's actually specified
to be spawned with a simple GUI script
number 2 is an asset called error blocks
now like with any of these they show I'm
not sure how good any of these are but
it might be another one if you're
looking for this type of thing so it's
an editor extension tool which allows
you to sort of help build aerodynamic
models and things like aeroplanes and
turbines and it's got a simple UI that
allows users to create and drawing the
blocks together and there's an
aerodynamic model which makes blocks
behave actual aerodynamically and
there's also other elements which help
you easily create Palace and turbines
number three is the D lighting tool and
this is a tool specifically around the
solve pipeline of photogrammetry when
people take you know a lot of pictures
of a specific item from the real world
and you can bring it into you know the
capisi and you can make us all very
photorealistic object out of it now this
is something and a tool which allows you
to set the actual shadows and lighting
information away from the actual object
that you've scanned in so if you're
interested in the photogrammetry sort of
pipeline you can choose which find this
way to actually take away the shadows
and you don't do the own shadowing and
lighting when you need to in the engine
before is an interest one called head
games and this is a lot of sort of
editor extension which adds some games
to the actual heads to itself and will
you know give you some examples of how
to do it so you can see that there's a
bubble game and a Tetris game which you
can add when you import these scripts
and you can just go to window games and
it will do a lot of pop out and you can
play some like little games in the
editor which might be fun if you know
you getting bored at one point and
number five is the large terrain
generator and this helps you easily
generate a large terrain with double
resolution and generates a realistic
terrain can be used in the editor or at
runtime with the maximum over loop
resolution of 8,000 by 8,000 just add
the terrain generator component to a
game object and define the parameters
that you need and based on the things
that you see here and then it will
create one large terrain which contends
far smaller terrains
so if you want other tools to generate
trees and graphs you have to use them in
each of the sort of specified small
terrains
so just an easier way to create
something really large if that's what
you're looking to do these were top five
editor extensions for October 2017 I'll
put all the links in description so you
can check out everything from this month
