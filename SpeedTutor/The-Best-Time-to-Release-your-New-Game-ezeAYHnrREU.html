and we're gonna be discussing another
really important topic is when to
actually release your game especially if
you go into a big platform like Steam
now you can just google something like
this and you'll find a lot of good sort
of suggestions on places like Reddit and
articles written by certain people up on
this matter it's more common sense than
it is anything else but it's about
understanding different times of the
year a difference of promotions that
they'll have on Steam what market you're
aiming towards and you know sort of what
the things you've already added to you
game the big thing is if you're looking
in your games you know close to
completion what time of year you
currently sat out you're gonna want to
avoid certain months of the year
especially steam if you don't a release
during a Christmas sale or a summer sale
or the periods you know sort of very
close to being before or after because
if you think about it when people am
going to steam they want to get you know
make big savings on lots of sales and if
your game comes out just before just
after the sale people are gonna be less
inclined toward two bikes or think to
themselves our weights the summer sales
it might be on then you games not on
summer sale you get forgotten about if
you wait till after everybody's spend
all the money you know court and cool
people people most likely don't spend
all their money but the less likely to
then buy the game if they think all
they've just bought twenty games on the
steam summer sale why why would they
necessarily need to pick up yours unless
it was something they were really
waiting for you want to avoid Christmas
again because that's another one where
there's gonna be big sales and things
like that so you want to release in
months yet on the build it could be
August September again October is where
Halloween would be and you know it used
to be seasonal things and you know major
events used to be more for you know
particular types of games but most of
the big sort of sales where it's
Halloween at Christmas summer things
like that usually every game ends up
being
there and you know it's hard to avoid it
sometimes but it's good to realize that
Christmas sort of the end of October and
things like that might not be the best
but it depends what time and how long
are you realistically wait do you want
to avoid months of the year like January
because that will be just after
Christmas and people have spent a lot of
money on family children whatever else
and then the less inclined to maybe
spend no that can work both ways and
then people and you know a lot of kids
might have had more money for Christmas
and they want to spend some money to
release in months before it or you know
towards it you know again away from a
big promotional sale you want to avoid
maybe big releases that might be in your
soft category of a style of games so you
might be releasing a shooter you want to
avoid big ones like say a Call of Duty's
coming out or something big like that
you want to avoid times where something
like that is check out the competition
check out the coming soon lists on Steam
so you can see here on the upcoming list
we can see that when most of these games
are going to be coming out check by what
tag is it a strategy adventure action
search what type of game that you're
developing and see what's coming out see
what the quality is like see if there's
anything that you think oh is this a
class better than mine is it gonna be
around the same day you want to try and
look at the competition and try and
avoid it or you know if you can't do
that try and realistically get to the
best time that you could possibly can
like I mentioned in a previous video is
that you want to be able to make sure
you have a tasty game and set it going
on say a Thursday if you set your game
live on a Thursday you're hitting it
just before the weekend happens and the
most sales on Steam from my experience
especially is the most sales happen on a
Friday Saturday and Sunday obviously
like you can expect Friday people finish
work Saturday Sunday the weekends where
people had time to relax Monday Tuesday
not great days Wednesday Thursday and so
so really but definitely - what's your
weekend is your best bet and if you
release on a Thursday you give chance
you know get the ball rolling on a sort
of mid-ground day and then set the bar
even higher when it comes to Friday and
you just saw out any issues just before
it gets to very peak traffic if you do
run into any problems and it's also then
you've got to think about you can look
at some of the Steam documentation and
things like that and they all give you
information to when to release the best
times but it's best to release a time
which is later on in America because if
you see my other video I'll mention that
man America is the biggest market for
releasing games so you want to
accommodate that you will see so many
things accommodate to America and
American time zones usually a few from
different parts of the world you'll see
it often in and you know PST PDT
the time farmer est whatever it might be
you know time zones will be filter
towards that and often all the time
zones that we've forgotten about now
that's not necessarily a bad thing in
some cases but you want to also strive
to M for that because the best time is
say five six o'clock onwards for
releasing your game even seven o'clock
on want to just say it with the thing
with if you release some content on
YouTube it's best to hit a certain time
during the week and not so it doesn't so
much matter on the weekend but like I
say if you're aiming to release on the
Thursday you want to release later in
the day for America even if it's not a
very good time for other parts of the
world but really it's dependent on where
you're from on what market you're trying
to hit know if you're trying to hit the
biggest market they go I've given some
of the best points I can but it's really
looking at do your own research and see
you know what might be coming out at the
time when you're releasing by looking at
steam upcoming look at avoiding big
promotional and times of the year avoid
biggest the biggest games because they
always come out all the platform but
like I said you can do your own research
and look at some of these pause
someplace like ready and then get your
own ideas of what might be best for you
so thanks again for watching don't
