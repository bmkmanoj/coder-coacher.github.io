tutorial today and we're gonna be
looking at creating a camera zoom or
something that when you say you right
click on your mouse you camera's gonna
zoom in so all i've got all you will
need is a blank scene and you're gonna
need a first-person controller so you
can get that from your standard assets
characters and a first-person controller
prefab and you can import that in if you
right-click on the project panel import
package characters if you don't have
those you may have not installed them
when you first installed unity you can
get them from the assets top under
standard assets when you drag the prefab
into your scene or into the hierarchy
you will get two things you will get
your FPS control if that's what you're
going to use we have the things that
will work for that and if you open that
out you will get first person character
which classes as your camera and that's
the thing that we're going to change
today so we're going to actually change
the field of view so almost the feel
that we will get smaller so it will zoom
in so what we'll do is we're going to
create a script so we'll right click in
the project panel click career and I'm
going to choose a JavaScript file and
I'm gonna call this camera zoom call it
whatever you want then what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to open that up so once
we're here in Visual Studio what I like
to do is I like to rearrange my curly
brackets how I like it so when we first
here were in the public class or the
first class that were actually given so
first of all when were in a public class
what we want to do is we're going to
start by writing a few variables and
such so we're going to need to control
how much we're going to need to zoom how
much we're going to need to have our
normal amount and what we didn't want to
do from there so what we can say is we
can set the first value to an integer
int have that add called zoom and we can
have that equal to 20
then what we'll do is we'll have another
integer
we'll have an integer or we can have it
normal for the normal amount that we're
going to have I'm going to set it to our
normal field of view and if we go back
into unity just to test this you can see
that if I click on the first person
character and you can see that the field
of view normally is 60 so we can change
this in the inspector if we want to or
we could actually make it a private if
we wanted to but for the sake of this
I'll leave it as public then what I want
to do is we'll have a float call this
smooth and set it equal to five and this
is gonna be the value they're going to
use to smooth out the camera motion so
it doesn't just go from 60 to 20
instantly you can leave that and don't
have the smoothing but the smoother just
allows it to do a smoother transition
between it then what we could then do is
write thriver bool so we're gonna have a
private boolean here which is going to
be cold is zoomed and set that equal to
false to begin with another semicolon so
this is just gonna be to control whether
we've zoomed in or out or not then below
here we're gonna have a void update then
we're gonna have the two brackets and
two curly brackets below then from there
we're gonna say that if input dot gets a
mouse button down and then we want to
have brackets 1 + 1 in brackets 4 in
this instance it means the right click
where 0 would be left click so what
we're going to right click we're going
to be able to do the zoom then we're
going to have two curly brackets below
there and then we're going to say that
is zoomed is equal to exclamation mark
is zoomed with a semicolon and all this
is doing is it's saying it's saying to
itself is that is zoomed is currently
equal to false when we right click we
want it to be set is exactly the
opposite of what it's currently at so if
it's false and we right click it'll turn
it to true and if it's true we right
click it will be turning
false so it just does it easily for us
without was doing that much coding then
what we'll do is we'll have another if
statement under here or say that if is
zoomed and we'll have to calibrate it's
under there so what is zoomed means is
that we can do two different instances
of this so is zoomed all means is that
in this case when it's in the
conditional statement is that if is
zoomed is equal to true so it'd be the
same as writing that whereas if we did
is zoomed with an exclamation mark in
the front it would set it be equal to
false it would be like writing that so
for this instance we're saying that if
is zoomed is equal true so in time
inside our color brackets we're going to
be writing what we want to do here it's
really saying it get component so we're
going to be looking for a component that
we're after we're going to put two
angled brackets in there and we're going
to be searching for the camera so we're
gonna be looking for the camera
component because we're going to have
this on our main camera and we'll put
two kind of two normal brackets
afterwards then what's a dot field of
view equals math F dot lurk and then
we're going to open up the brackets
again and here we're gonna say get
component again and then we're gonna
have angle brackets again just like we
did it within a search for camera and
then we're going to put the two brackets
and we're going to say dot field of view
and then we're going to put the word
zoom and then comma time dot Delta time
times by the smooth and then at the end
of our stay we'll just put a semicolon
so all this is saying is we're the same
we're looking for the component camera
and we're looking for the field of view
and then what we gonna do with the field
of view is we're going to learn
Seiler just allows you to a smooth
smooth transition between certain values
so we're gonna lap the camera field of
view with the zoom amount so the zoom
amount is 20 so we want to move the
field of view to 20 but based on a
smooth value so based on time not Delta
time is done every frame so every frame
we move will move 5 units every time
sort of smoothly
Mako's move without it being too jittery
and seen us thought that our movers into
the slightly zoomed in view we need to
be able to zoom out so what we're gonna
right under here is we're gonna write an
else statement with two color brackets
and we're gonna say that if we zoomed in
we're gonna do this if we do anything
else so if we're not zoomed in anymore
we're gonna just pretty much do the same
thing so we're gonna copy this line here
and we're just gonna paste it in again
and the only thing we need to do is
change
zoom to normal so then we're going to
pretty much just zoom back out from what
we had so we have the exact same thing
so we're doing is we're checking to see
if we're right clicking we're setting
the boolean true or false directly
opposite to what currently is
we'll say that if it zoomed will zoom it
if anything else will zoom out so we'll
go back on to the first person character
we'll drag the camera zoom script on to
there and then what we'll do is we'll
press play and you'll see that I can
then zoom in when I right click and zoom
out it doesn't matter how many times I
do it I can still do everything that I
need to
on what we might want to do up here is
so we can see these in the inspector
I'll just write public in front of all
these variables that we've got because
that'll automatically be set to private
if not so zoom come we could set that to
say one normal zoom in really far we
can't the normal we can have the smooth
up to 20 so it does it much quicker so
we can then press play and you can see
that up zoomed in a ridiculous amount
and I can't even see where I am but it's
much faster than it already was but it
still makes it a smooth amount so really
all you need to remember is that we're
doing it based on as a field of view
change based on zoom amount a normal
amount and a smooth value we're changing
a boolean depend on we write it click
and then we're just checking and
changing the field of view accordingly
to what we've clicked so hopefully this
helps you out and helps you discredit
something simple which I think a lot of
games would benefit from music so thanks
very much for watching don't forget to
