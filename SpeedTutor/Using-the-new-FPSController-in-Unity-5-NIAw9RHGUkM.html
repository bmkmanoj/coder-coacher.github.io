tutorial and this is gonna be looking at
the FPS controller and how it's changed
from unity far to unity 5 now obviously
if you've had any time to look at it you
don't need to watch this video but if
you're a little bit confused and seeing
how things changed the virtual unity of
done a good job on making the FPS
controller especially quite a lot better
with how it works because it's added a
lot of features that people constantly
would always use like footstep sounds
jumping sprinting all that stuff that
you'd have to put extra time and effort
into just making it work but this comes
out of the box with all the features
that you require so you may have seen
this scene before in unity 4 but I
brought it back again for unity 5
because we couldn't miss out on this so
what I'm going to show you straight away
is line way of the tutorial is is
importing a custom package by
right-clicking on the project and import
characters now once you've done that if
you go into your standard assets and go
to characters you'll have a few
different things that you might want to
impart now we're going to go for the
first-person controller will look at
prefabs and we'll just drag the FPS
controller into our scene and you'll see
it looks very much the same as it did in
unity for the only difference being that
it's got an FPS first person control
first person character should I say
attach to it which acts as its main
camera and you can do all the stuff that
you did before with the clipping plans
and all that stuff that you used to now
the difference is in the main parent is
the FPS controller and that now it
doesn't have a character martyr which
controlled speed and of which you could
move and all that sort of stuff now it
has just one first-person and roller
script and that controls your walking
speed your running speed when you hold
shift
the lens at which you take a stride you
how high you can jump how quickly the
gravity will bring you down now
mouselook is on the first person
controller itself so you can turn that
up to increase sensitivity and have your
minimum maximum values there you can
have a look at your field of view you
can enable head-bobbing because that
used to be a script by itself you can
adjust the parameters there for that
script you can have a look at the jump
Bob you can set the step interval so how
many times you want to be able to step
it now comes with its own ability to put
jump sounding and landing sounds it
comes with an array for footstep sounds
and it comes with its own rigid body and
audio sauce already attached so if we
just run our game you'll notice that we
dropped in and it made a sound when we
walk it automatically Bob's up and down
within time with the footsteps that
we've got if a hold shift you can hear
that in movement increased and the
footsteps increased as well you jump all
the sounds come with that and as I said
the head bobbing along with that but as
I said this is a really good character
controller for just getting you're up
and running with a first-person sort of
view and it has everything inclusive in
one so we can adjust all these
parameters so walk speed can be quicker
run speed you know we can move so much
quicker and it's so easy because they've
done it all for you and you can disable
head Bob so we don't have that if you
don't need it you might want to entrain
to increase your step interval make it
slower you know whatever you need it to
be but that was just a brief look at the
first-person controller script which is
on the first-person controller you can
double click and open up in monodevelop
if you need to edit this script I'll
look at it but this is where I might be
referencing some things for future stuff
in the
is to come so that was just a quick
overview of the new first-person
controller and the things that it helps
you do you know without you having to
even do anything so thanks very much for
watching and don't forget to Like
