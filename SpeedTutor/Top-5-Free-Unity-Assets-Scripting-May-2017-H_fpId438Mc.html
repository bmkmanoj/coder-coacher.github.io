scripting assets for May 2017
one thing I want to mention before I
start with this video is that sort of
these actual scripting s it's a hard to
sort of give an example so I'm showing
it in the unity asset star just to give
you an idea of what is available so
number one is the main menu with a
parallax effect and this is quite a nice
little asset where you can create a
fairly simple menu with parallax
background which just Scrolls across
devinder however you want to you know be
able to create it and it features a
scene selector with animated move around
you can expand it with an options menu
sterilised you can take a look at the
demo scene number two is curriculum and
this as it suggests a way for developers
that might be making an educational game
to obtain specific curriculum materials
so whether it be questions or things
from a certain topic which categorizes a
mask question and things like that and
will be coming up a particular format
which you can access within the unity
number three is the plug SDK which is a
dedicated in-app community so it's a
library of which lets the people that
play your game have community features
which allow you to as you can see in the
background here that you can comment
post little images and how things are
related to the things that you want to
be able to see within your game
depending on what you're trying to
achieve so you can almost drive more
community content and you can drive more
users to use your app if you give them
stuff that they might want to use number
four is auto focus and it's a VR and a
are related sort of plugin which helps
to avoid the common simulation of the
motion sickness when people use VR
headsets and things like that they can
get very and fatigued in the eyes and it
becomes strand of a long period
so this tries to negate that effect by
doing some sort of special calculations
and you know allowing you to adjust
settings accordingly to avoid these
particular things so if that's something
that you're looking to try and minimize
and give this asset ago and number five
is the Trello bug tracker the free
version this is something that you can
add to your game which will allow users
to report bugs or things that they might
have found within their game you can see
you can add a little button and it will
add a UI pop-up in the game and you'll
be able to submit a request to tell that
you what might have happened so it's a
nice little way for you to get a basic
set of features which allows you to
create and upload the information that
they've done and you can choose to
upgrade to a pro version if you need a
lot of the tools that they're offering
number six is the fantasy heroes editor
and I think this is a really nice one we
just it's a almost fully fledged and
editor for creating your very own sort
of 2d sprite II characters and you can
customize the body parts and the colors
you can play some animations and it
comes with a few different examples of
you to be able to based on this UI you
can see here change the style and lock
of the character economy which can go
straight into your game and allow you to
modify as you need to remember you can
look at all the assets that I've
featured on the page that I will post in
the description and it will feature all
the assets that I've found for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
