how to change your wireframe color in
3ds max so a lot of the times when
you're actually working say you're
working like here with a white image in
your view poppelen it can get in the way
and you can't really see so I've
selected now you can barely see the
white selection wireframe behind it so
really nice and easy way to change it if
you go to customize customize user
interface and wait for that to appear go
to colors and if you've gone the
elements and click the drop-down go
geometry and down here you want to go to
selection and you'll see the white color
there so you can change it to anything
you want say we just for example so
equi-join it to red you can change it to
whatever you want
change it to red and then apply colors
now and you've just got to give that a
lot second to just refresh your max one
key thing now is that you'll notice
gloss that nothing will have changed
you're going to need to restart 3ds max
now you'll notice when you restart 3ds
max and you click on your object you'll
actually have a red wire frame so you
can actually see this a lot better you
can you can can change your reference
planes and make them a darker gray so
you can see the white on it but for ease
of this sake that's pretty much all you
need to do with Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
