tutorial today and today we're going to
be looking at the cloth modifier are the
cloth system within unity 5 now has
changed a little bit since we've seen it
in unity for now I did a few tutorials
on it previous but I thought and a few
people have actually asked how to bring
it up for unity 5 so it really depends
on how you're going to do it you can
bring in a model from a 3d program and
apply to your scene but I'll show you
directly in unity of how you can
actually do it so what we're going to do
is we're going to say game object at the
top and say create empty and what we'll
do is it will create an empty game
object within our scene and then within
our scene you will see it sort of maybe
close to your character if that's where
you want it to be maybe raise it up a
little bit so it's a little bit sort of
ahead of your character and out of the
way a little bit now on the right hand
side in the inspector all we can do is
we can add component and what we can
search in here is we want to search
cloth and we want to apply the cloth
modifier to it we can also do it by
going up to component physics and cloth
and it will do the same thing so now
we've got a skinned mesh renderer and a
cloth component on the actual empty game
object and as I said you can do this
with a 3d model or a plane or anything
like that that you might have made in
unity or Brian for the 3d program now
whether or not it has it already it'll
have an empty mesh object here and
because it needs to have a mesh which it
can apply the physics to now if we click
the little solve the plus box to search
what we need it will show all the
different meshes that I've got within my
unity project so if I search plane I
want to actually apply a plane to that
and you can apply any objects the one
I'm going to choose the plan that comes
with unity now it might end up being
pink because it might not be able to
find the material that you want to use
so you might want to add your own
material here and I'm just going to like
this red material that I've got here
what might wanted to do is I'll change
it to
so it's more sort of standardized and
now we've got that selected you can see
the wireframe and you can see that it
has a lot of different polygons in and
we need to make sure that it has a lot
of polygons to be able to make it sort
of look realistic or applying physics to
make a cloth so now we've got that
together what we need to do is we need
to edit the constraint so now this is
the new thing in unity 5 now if we click
on edit constraint you will see all the
vertexes that are made up of this match
and if we click paint and what we're
going to do is actually pane where we're
going to constrain the match so we can
click on each of these vertexes because
you can see when I highlight them if i
zoom in a little bit my highlight them I
can then left-click on them and
constrain this top edge because I wanted
to wipe like let's say a large curtain
and now I've got that in I can want it
constraint and if I show you again if I
go back on it you can see it's a
constrained at the top now if I then
press a play you will see that my cloth
will now be constrained to the top but
it doesn't really do anything by
exciting it might move slowly based on
it has a but we can add some external
acceleration to the cloth to make it
maybe simulate wind like I did in a
different tutorial now if I apply a not
0.5 to the z-axis we just get a tiny bit
of movement to look like wind might be
applying itself to that mesh now
essentially that's pretty much it for
the basis of setting up a mesh to act
like a piece of cloth but if you then
want to take it step further and use
your character to sort of knock in and
out and knock the mesh around is again
slightly different it's this is a system
using it you can use capsule or sphere
colliders now your first-person
controller if it's brought in from the
unity 5 first burst controller what we
need to do is we need to make sure that
it's got a capsule Collider
now I don't know if there's a better
workaround than this or if there's a
different way of doing this but
the first person controller has a
built-in Collider on it so it acts with
a rigidbody now we can't actually use
this to work with the cloth because if
you see down here we can use two sets of
collisions which will collide with the
cloth we can use sphere or Capshaw
colliders now if I have a the cap circle
line down here and I set the array size
to one you can see that I'll be able to
add a new capsule Collider here now we
can obviously make another object which
might be a sphere add a capsule Collider
to it or as a sphere Collider imma be
able to push it in and out of the cloth
to make it move now to make this work
with the character what I'm going to do
is go component physics and capsule
Collider and you can see the capsule
Collider in between the normal Collider
which the character already has what I
can do is I can change the actual height
of it to match the character let's say
and this is just an example and in my
capsule colliders slot I will add my
first person controller in there and you
will see that it's the FPS controller
capsule Collider now a good way to test
it is if we press play you'll notice
that in game now if I flip back to my
scene select the first burst controller
and I select it whilst the game is
playing I can move it into that cloth
and effect it based on the collider what
a mute with which I'm using and it'll
only be affected by the collider that
we've actually set it on giving it and
you can do it similarly with say we
quickly select a creative 3d objects and
a sphere here and we've got this sphere
it's got its own sphere Collider on it
we'll go back to the cloth we'll gone
sphere colliders add one will say that
the first Collider I'm going to add the
sphere in here will do exactly the same
thing play it I'll go back into my scene
I'll grab the sphere and I'll push it
into the cloth as if we want to affect
it so essentially that's pretty much the
sort of simplicity of just having your
cloth
and being able to use a character or a
different object to affect that in terms
of physics so hopefully that helps some
people out thanks very much for watching
