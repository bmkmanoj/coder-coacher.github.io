short videos today and maybe tomorrow
and this is going to be about walking
into triggers and when a timer expires
we're going to move scenes now a lot of
people have been asking me about this
and to save probably the hassle I'm
going to just show the two quick videos
and hopefully this ion's anything out
that people want to know so these are
very simple sort of games design
techniques and really if you ever see
anything in a game where enemies spawn
once you get to a certain location
anything like that is usually because
you've walked through a trigger and it's
triggered something to happen an event a
enemy to spawn whatever it might be so
what we're going to do straight off is
add a game object we'll go create other
and then we'll add a cube or put it down
towards the ground and what we'll do is
we'll scale a cube so we're definitely
going to be able to walk through it what
we'll do is then we'll delete the mesh
renderer and then you'll just have the
box collide that's left and then from
the Box Collider you want to make sure
that it is trigger then on your
first-person control you'll make sure
that is tagged as player mines there if
you need to add a new tag you can add
one down there and then what we can do
from there is create a new script and
we'll add it javascript and Morcar lip
move scene trigger now obviously you can
have that as whatever you want will open
up and want to develop
and then once we wrap him on and develop
we'll delete the two standing functions
that would be in it and then we'll do is
we'll save function on trigger enter
open brackets call call on collider
close that up put two curly brackets
below will say that if call dot but on
develop likes to change it to cold tag
is double equals in corpse player clause
that of add two curly brackets below
then we'll say application dot make sure
a capital Lord level and then open
brackets and then quarts and then inside
the course you can have whatever level
we're going to move to so we'll just say
new scene for instance and then we'll
put a semicolon on the end we'll save
that we'll go back in to unity and on
our trigger which is named cube you can
name that whatever you want if you add
move scene to that we're going to want
to do is we're going to want to create a
new scene so I'll just save this out for
now while do is I've created a new scene
there we'll save this scene as we'll
save this as new scene like we mentioned
in the script you can see it down there
what we need to do is go back into our
other scene that we just had and you can
see that we're still on it now if we go
to our build settings so file build
settings what we need to do is we need
to add a new scene into there because if
it's not I'd been to that it won't know
where to go so now if we play our game
with that script on the collider and we
walk into it it's going to take us to
that new scene but because that new
scene didn't really have anything that's
all it's done it's just taking us to a
new scene so as long as your new scene
is named exactly what it has or what is
named in the scripts our new scene
exactly the same and then you'll add it
to the build settings once you go on the
trigger
so they on trigger collision event if
it's tagged player then we'll load the
level that we want simple thing and
hopefully that clears a few things up
that people have been asking for and
we're getting onto the Survival Series
again in the coming days so thanks again
for watching Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
