tutorial today and this is going to be
looking at bloom and lens flares so
bloom a lens flare lets you make
brighter areas or brighter pixels on
your screen much brighter and it's an
image effect which allows you to do that
quite easily really and there's three
different actual image effects that we
could possibly use and each is slightly
different some more optimized than
others now all you need to do for this
scene is you need to bring in a
first-person controller you can bring
that in if you've got any standard
assets you can right click in the
project panel import package and bring
in characters if not you can get it from
the unity asset style so once you've
brought in the character and put it in
your scene as you've got here I've got
mine here you want to click on your
first person character which will be
classed as your main camera you can see
the preview here now once then go to
component image effects bloom and glow
and we've got one of three choices so
what we'll do is we'll add each of the
three choices to our camera and I'll
skip on okay so we're in my just the
game view tab here so we can actually
see what's going on just out of the box
without having to play the year scene so
if I uncheck all of them and we've got
each of the three so we'll first go
through the sort of bloom and it just
briefly is a bloom and lens flare to
sort of brighten up the screen pixels or
everything that's there on the screen so
if we enable bloom you can already see
the sort of edges of things start to get
a little bit brighter we can set the
quality so the cheaper it is the better
for performance the higher the better
quality it will all be you can have
different modes you can have basic and
complex and they just add some more
features if you need them will keep on
basic you can the mods which are blend
are screen and like if you'd seen my
other tutorial the other day is that
screen keeps it based on sort of the
colors that you've got an add a lot an
extra sort of layer to it and we've got
HDL which stands for high dynamic range
rendering and this can be used to try
and solve simulate a more real-world
value based on something that you can do
within your scene if you've enameled the
HDR HD out on your actual camera it can
sometimes be used to make so if I set it
on and off it doesn't really make much
of a difference for this scene in
particular because I haven't really
tweaked any settings you can read all
about in the unity documentation about
image effects and balloon you can set
the intensity higher which we get much
brighter to all the very bright areas it
adds another layer of contrast to
everything we can change it lower the
threshold which will make it more
intense so we can almost visualize a
dreamlike State or something if you were
dreaming or you can just do it sort of
emphasize to make it more photorealistic
I guess but this is a little bit too far
in this instance blur iterations and we
can just add more blur effect to the
object and sample distance is how far
the sort of bloom effect does work so
then we can play the game and we can
look around at the very bright objects
and it's maybe a little bit too crazy
for now but it sort of has that nice
effect similarly we'll leave the bloom
script for now we'll look at the bloom
and flares which is a slightly older
version I think and that was the
component image effects bloom and glow
and the bloom of flares there is this is
similarly where high dynamic rendering
is actually also detected and ignore
alpha channels and detects the sort of
glow information for you again we can
use basic or complex we can do the
screen modes the blend modes so we'll
leave it on add I can put a hitch down
on off I'll have it as also we can turn
the intensity down maybe I'll leave it
up again threshold
there's a similar thing yet for this
instance in so we've got HDR doesn't
make much of a difference and we can
change the blur iterations again and
similar light before we can uncheck that
and we'll look at the bloom optimized
which is pole of them are optimized of
the three and we can because it's not
got as many particular options to do
with blending and having more complex
sort of functionality is that you can
again lower the threshold to make it
bigger increase intensity to achieve the
same sort of effect again increase the
blur size if you need to and the blur
iterations to make it more so if you
were looking directly in the sunlight
you might see that sort of thing and you
can have the blood type and we keep our
standard and then you can look around
and you see you again it might be if you
were solve well maybe at the sort of the
effective
you've been really bright and you're
looking directly at the sunlight and you
can have image effects combining with a
two but really it's depend on what you
looking for usually laughing the bloom
actual effect is quite good as long as
you don't overdo the intensity you can
just bring out a little bit of the areas
which might need a little bit of extra
help light because you can just add a
very nice sort of elements you seen in
every different light every different
cloud will be affected by it and get
that sort of added effect so it's a nice
thing to mess around with and you know
you can go as far and advanced as you
need to so really that's pretty much it
I'm going through basically the three
bloomin lens flare effects and so thanks
