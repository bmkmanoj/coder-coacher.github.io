how to make a footstep sound in unity
and it's going to work for different
things it could work for walking water
going on concrete things like that and
it just depends what you want to do it
fine depends what sound you want to
change up so I'll start off by tell you
what summer seen so I've got a cube
which is just going to access my
collider going inside and I've got a box
Collider on it and it's is tape ticked
to is trigger I've got a directional
light at my first-person controller so
nothing fancy nothing out of the
ordinary which work seen before now what
are actually I'm going to have to do is
start writing some script actually so
what we're going to do is we're going to
I'm going to create two scripts and
unity one called on water and one cold
player footsteps and so I'll open both
scripts in London up and on the on water
script will write a variable will say
private variable footsteps as player
footsteps and that's just referring to
this script appear and then we're going
to say function start and then inside
our color back it's going to say
footsteps equals game object dot find
first-person controller cause the speech
marks and the brackets a dark out
component and then open brackets and say
player footsteps close the brackets in
the semicolon and we're just trying to
find this script here so then we're
going to write a trigger entering the
trigger exits or
function on trigger enter on will say
call and then call on Collider and then
we write two curly brackets underneath
and set if call dot game object dot tag
is equal to lair close it up and then
we'll have to color back its again and
more safe footsteps dot but what we need
to do is actually create a variable
inside our other script so if we go to
the other script and we actually say
that variable in water call on boolean
equals false so then we can say that I
narrow the script we can say footsteps
dot in water is equal to true and then
we'll copy this paste it underneath and
say trigger exit and then we'll say the
in water is equal to false one thing I
made a mistake is that didn't keep
everything consistently named so if I
just change that upper case to a lower
case and what I can do is go to the Miss
and set on water on here and if I'm on
the first-person troller
I like the player footsteps I've got
back into monodevelop with we're okay
with this script now because it just
means that if we enter the collider it's
going to set up in what's true and if we
exit and set to false and we're going to
reference that in this other script so
what we're going to do is we're going to
write another variable here called
variable water step sound we're going to
set that as type audio clip and then
we're going to create two more variables
water timer set up to flow say equal to
zero then we're going to create another
variable and call it water cool and set
that flow equal to not point zero the
semicolon then we're going to create two
private variables one called chmod and
set is type character Marta another
variable called controller and refresh
write a column and set that to character
controller and then what I'll do is
write function start with my curly
brackets and say CH Marta is equal to
get component that will say character
Marta and controller is equal to get
component character control because I
was doing here is seen as though we've
attached this to the first web person
controller you can find the character
controlling the character Marta all at
once so we're just initially in that and
what I'm going to do now is write and
function there is a function of dead and
if we add the two curly brackets we're
going to actually do some things to
actually make the water work so first of
all we're going to actually add these
lines to make you actually be able to
spring now you don't have to have this
and you can do this a different way but
this is just an adjust cover this
quickly like I've done another tutorial
added for my GUI one so if controller
dot velocity don't magnitude is greater
than 0 and and input dot get key
it's keycard dot left shift close the
two rackets put the curly brackets
underneath and say CH mortar dot
movement dot max forward speed is equal
to ten while do is copy this line and
then CH mark movement MUX side where
speed side where speed equals to 10 and
then under here I'll set else up the two
curly brackets and copy these two lines
or those two lines paste them in there
and make them equal to six
so that's going to mean that if we're
actually moving and we're pressing shift
we're going to be able to sprint if not
or just be walking now we're going to
actually do something now we got to do
something to make the sound and start
working so we're going to write if
controller dot velocity dot magnitude is
greater than zero and in water is set to
true so if we're in that Collider like
we won't near the script like the two
curly brackets and say we'll set
function called water sound and then
here underneath water sound will set if
controller dot velocity dot magnitude
again is greater than zero and import
dot get key key code dot left shift
brackets and and again in water set to
true
then we'll say water cool is equal to
nine point six and water sound will play
so we'll use that function so what we're
doing here is if we're actually moving
and it's it's set to true we'll play the
sound effect but if we're moving we're
pressing shift and it's true we'll also
play the water sound but we'll actually
do a cool down so we can actually play
the sound too quickly so in case of
sprinting and walking it'll speed up and
slow down and conveniently then we'll
set else and we'll put the together
brackets and we'll say water cool is
equal to not point six then we'll say if
water timer is greater than zero then
inside the curly brackets will say water
timer is minus minus equals to time dot
delta time with a semicolon at the end
and then we'll set if water timer is
less than zero then we'll have the two
curly brackets and say water timer is
equal to zero so what this means is that
if we're moving or pressing shift and
we're in it will do the sound if not the
cool down will still be not point sick
actually I've made a mistake here if we
sprint in the cool down needs to be less
time so we'll say not point four seconds
if we're just walk-in the cooldown of a
nought point six cuz it'll be a slower
time and then what we're doing is that
if the time is always above zero we're
going to count down and then if if the
actual timer ever gets below zero or set
it to zero and then the last thing we
need to write we need to add that of the
function
we'll save function water sound as we
set above and add the two curly brackets
and we'll say if water timer is equal to
zero then we'll add the two color
brackets and set or dr dot play one shot
up and brackets water step sound close
that off but semicolon and then what
we'll do is set water timer equal to
water cool so we'll set it so it calls
down every time so when we go back into
unity you'll notice that on water to
that side trigger on our play will need
to add a sound effect and it forgot to
sounds and then we go to war to step
then now I play it again you'll notice
that if you watch my variables on this
side you'll notice that I always forget
to do that on the character control we
need to actually add a audio source so
if you are component audio audio source
then press Plex it won't work otherwise
and this is my Collider you can make it
you'll notice you can hear the sound in
the six in the North Point six second
duration and nice oppression has had the
value to not point wrong
and you can notice the UPS print and you
can change that actual those values up
you can change these values here so not
point four for spring to not point six
for walk and you can change the loop
depending on what you want your
character to do so realistically this
was just a simple way using colliders to
make something that's getting the sounds
to simulate when you're on different
objects of water and you could just
change this script up to make different
sounds so thanks very much for watching
this tutorial and there's a don't forget
