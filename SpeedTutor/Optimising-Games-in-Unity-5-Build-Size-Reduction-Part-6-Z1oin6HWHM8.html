optimization series and this is going to
be looking at find out how much all your
textures and objects within your game
are actually worth and how you can
adjust and scale down accordingly and
you can build out a log file which is
also just a text file when you build
your game and it will just tell you how
much space each of the textures are
using all the models all the shaders and
gives you an idea of if say you've got
one massive texture which is so far care
resolution and you don't realize why
your build is becoming so big it might
point out that specific textures taking
up a lot of space so I'll quickly go
through this this is just a basic scene
and it's just so we can build this out
more quickly you'll be finishing the
game do whatever you can go fail build
settings and I'm just going to put the
Mycenae which is optimization scene here
and I'm going to build out to Windows
Mac and it doesn't really matter what
settings we choose to use I'm just going
to save to my desktop and then build it
out and once it's built then we will
have a look at the file that it's
produced so it's built my game to the
desktop and that's all well and good now
but we need to go to window and console
and you might have already had this up
but if you don't it's just that and from
the console well however it pops up or
if you've got it doc down the bottom you
can click on the little solve very much
in this corner a little drop down and
you can open something called the editor
log and you can see here we get a lot of
different things we get a lot of
information about what's going on and
wise built out and what the version of
unity is and we want to scroll on down
we want to scroll and down them and
pretty much quite far down our log and
we want to find out the total sort of
allocation it will give you some
information of how much memory things
have taken them but here you can see
that it'll give an idea of how much
space my textures are taking up in the
build how much space the meshes are
animations sounds shared as other assets
level scripts and and things like that
and then it will give you an idea of how
much these are taking on where these are
located so you can see that from a
textures for this and sort of metallic
photo frame you can see each of these
materials that I've got a taking up null
point to not point one kilobytes
respectively and if you've got a whole
host of materials models textures
anything like that you can see that how
much memory it's going to be taking up
and then you can do something
accordingly so say if I have realized
that the metallic smoothness of my
picture holder here that maybe it was a
little bit large I can go in to find
that model and I can see the metallic
smoothness and I can go well it's
currently set to 2k I could probably set
that down to one and I probably half the
size of the load on the at the game and
the file size when it's built out so a
little bit little you can sort of work
towards you know slowly fine-tuning
build size your optimization for
everything that you've got the smaller
the textures and the faster everything
all run the biggest thing for you build
size will be textures because especially
the higher the resolution and more
detailed having obviously if you're
using a PBR sort of setup you will have
a lot more textures usually but you know
just it takes you to sit down take some
time and have a look you know as you go
through your project just to keep it
manageable so you just got to remember
that you want to build your game out
file build and then went across a window
console unless you've got it up and and
then in the corner you can go there and
open up the log and every time you build
down it will produce another log file
for you so you can keep on you know
managing and be on top of all these
sizes so hopefully this helped you out
