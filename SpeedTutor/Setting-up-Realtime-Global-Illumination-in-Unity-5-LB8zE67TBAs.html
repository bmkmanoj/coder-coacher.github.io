today and this is going to be another
unity 5 tutorial it's going to focus on
maybe setting up your lighting or your
global illumination lighting within
unity 5 for the first time I'm not an
expert of running everything in unity 5
I'm still learning myself having an
awful lot of time to focus on anything
because as I've said too a lot of people
have still got projects going in unity 4
so this is just going to be a basic sort
of overview and quick look about setting
up your environment lighting within
unity 5 so when you start a new scene
file new scene you'll get a main camera
and a directional light now a
directional light will be directional L
be real-time it'll have more of a sort
of warmish color the intensity will be 1
and the bounce intensity will also be 1
it'll have soft shadows enabled now
that's all well and good that's fine for
this what you might also want to do well
you will need to do is you want this
lighting tab now what you want to do to
get that is you go to window and
lighting if you don't already have it
and I drag it over to this right-hand
side so it makes easy to see now what
I'll do is I'll start by creating some
cubes and I'll skip through this cuz
some are but I'm going to do is just
build a little scene so that you can see
everything inside and if you look back
on this you can see that if we rotate
the directional light we can obviously
affect the shadows that we've got I'm
going to apply a quick texture to my
models so I will select all my models
that I want to apply my texture to and
just drag it on
so we can zoom in and we get the texture
that you may well have seen before now
what I'll also are what you might want
to do is drag your first bus controller
prefab into the scene
so we'll just drop that in here and then
we can run around within our scene now
nothing really that exciting is actually
going on at the moment within unity now
I'm going to hide the grid because it's
a bit annoying when I don't really need
it now on the lighting tab you'll notice
that we've got the different things so
we're going to set a skybox we're going
to set the normal skybox so we'll click
on it and we'll search for the default
skybox and the default skybox will be
added to us seeing once we add it now
we're going to add the directional light
as our Sun over here I'm going to have
the ambient source as the skybox we
don't actually turn the ambient light
down because in real life we don't
actually have ambient light we'll have
the real-time global numeration on
skybox is going to be our reflection
source for this I'm just going to turn
both reflection intensity and bounces
down I'm going to keep precomputed
global illumination the real-time
resolution the high you set that was the
old way of light mapping so the more how
you put that mount the more detail
you're going to get in your light map
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
unpick big global illumination because
we don't want that yet we'll keep the
general gi2 directional
the intensity and the bounce boost I'll
keep intensity one and maybe up the
bounce booster 2 now what I'd like to
also do is continuous baking doesn't
need to be on but for real time so it
needs to be updated every time you
change something yourself we need to
have that enabled now you can see that
nothing really has actually done
anything and it looks to do the same now
what you need to do for all your objects
that are never going to move is that you
need to select them so all my cubes that
I've got in my scene or all your objects
you might
you seen they're not going to be
eliminated we want to be able to make
sure that we take them as static so in
the box at the top corner is the box
called static and you'll then notice
that the precomputing global
illumination starts running in the
background so of course this will be
more taxing on your computer if it's not
you know up to spec I said but that's
why there's still the Baked global
illumination you can still achieve but
this is using the real-time now that
will just take as long as it needs to to
compute its global illumination and then
you will see it once it's completed one
thing you might want to do in the
meantime is get rid of your main camera
so you want to have a first-person
controller what you can also do is if
you set your directional light to static
so if that's not going to move either we
can set that I'm not sure if that makes
a difference entirely but for lights
that are not moving and not going to
rotate believe that by itself because
you can adjust all these settings like
the intensity of the directional light
itself the bounce intensity of it itself
I just need to wait for the global
illumination to finish calculating and
we can turn the Atlas size down to make
this process a bit quicker one thing
I'll mention here is you can set the CPU
usage to calculate the global
illumination so if you want it to render
as fast as possible you can set that to
high or unlimited so it'll just add the
scram low in the background and you'll
notice that it increased some settings
so from the light mapped area to not we
get and the baked in global illumination
so the shadows are more soft from where
the Sun hasn't hit over in one
particular direction and we can
obviously move particular values so we
can move that and it will then
recalculate the global illumination
according to what we're setting the
distance aware of the directional light
does not actually matter so what can
change this and it all them back once
it's baked once it will work far more
efficiently then it won't take as long
you can see that the bounce intensity if
I turn that up it'll turn up the overall
brightness of the scene that I've got so
if I put it to about a two you don't
really want to take the intensity of
your particular light beyond one because
that sort of real-world setting so in
the general GI you can up the indirect
intensity so indirect light is something
that say our Suns pointing this way and
we don't actually have any light
directly hitting this surface from the
Sun set off from a light source it will
when my light bounces around
that's indirect light is light that's
not directly facing a particular surface
and while that was baking a couple of
Optima a couple of optimization tips you
can as I said increases CPU usage up you
can reduce the resolution of your light
maps so if you set it to one if you set
it to less it'll be quicker the higher
as the same more resolution it's going
to take longer to compute now this is
just a literally a little scene inside a
red flower gray sort of walls green roof
now you can see with the global
illumination baked out you can see that
we get different shades of a particular
object emitting onto the surfaces so say
this red we can see that with the
real-time global illumination we can see
that the red hue has been added to the
object along with the green from the
roof as sort of faded into the gray
areas of the walls now you don't get
that unless you did some my advanced
baking within unity for now you get this
out of the box within unity fire this is
just a really basic example so some
cubes with some literally some materials
which adjust the albedo is set to
to a particular color strand and that's
what you get and if I give you an
example and I move or delete one of
these cubes we'll get more light
bleeding in and then the global
illumination again as long as continuous
bacon is on it will pre-compute
everything again and it will just run in
real time always in the background of
your game so anything you chop and
change it will always rebec the lighting
obviously like I said you can still do
the baked so it doesn't require the real
time because real time probably wouldn't
run on low-end mobile devices I don't
even know if they run on high-end mobile
devices I suppose it's more for viz but
see more light came in and then we still
got the green hues on the walls but we
got a lot more light computed inside of
the room just based on whatever we're
going for so that's just the sort of
really basic tips of setting up the
initial part of your global illumination
and there's far more advanced things
that you can go onto and I'll cover in
the future it will it be reflection
bulbs all the different texture types
that you can use and so on and so on but
just remember you've need to have a
skybox a son or a directional light or a
light that has the real time
functionality you set the ambient sauce
you can use ambient light if you want
but as I said it's not required
reflection bounces in intensity and are
not really required because they affect
other things you can take the pre
computed real-time GI you can affect the
general settings now from your overall
settings and then you can make the
desired look of what you're after and
that's pretty much the overall basis so
