this is not gonna be focused on unity
depth we're gonna try something a little
bit different so I'm gonna sort of show
you the sort of ins and outs of Unreal
Engine 4 and the differences that we
might find between unity and this engine
now this is a slight differentiation
that I usually do to unity
now I thought if you've ever wanted to
get into Unreal 4 because I don't know
if they had a little battle amid both
engines unity 5 and Unreal Engine 4 they
became free so it's readily available
for everybody obviously unreal is a bit
more taxing but other than that it's
pretty straightforward to use and it has
a lot of similarities with unity so I'll
go through those now to help everybody
out if they wanted to have a little
experiment so initially when you start
up the epic game sort of Unreal launcher
you'll get this sort of interface and
it's slightly different to unity in a
sense that you get the marketplace you
can find how to learn how to use it you
can use unreal and you can look at their
games the epic games will be bringing
out in the future now on your library
down here you might have things that
you've downloaded from the marketplace
and up here is where you'll be able to
launch your version of unreal for now
I've got it to the latest version so all
you need to do is just click on launch
and once you've clicked on launch
obviously it's gonna load up the editor
and once you've launched the editor it's
gonna be again very similar to unity 5
you can open an old project that you may
have been working on or you can look at
opening a brand new project within the
actual editor itself
now it comes with a few different things
obviously if you followed my tutorials
we've always looked at JavaScript too
maybe a tiny bit of c-sharp now unreal
or the Unreal Engine does in either
c-sharp if it's gonna be written
scripting it uses blueprints of a sort
of visual scripting where you connect
nodes to each other now I'm still
learning along with you guys so it's a
nice sort of step in this
direction now with the blueprints that
sort of your best way to start because
if you're not 100% competent on writing
script you can use the blueprints and
that's a nice handy way to get started
so it's got a whole host of different
scenes that you can start where whether
it's with the first person flying puzzle
creating a rollerball different types of
probably 2d platformer sort of games and
all that so if we click on first person
because and it'll give you a little
brief description of why it's going to
add to begin with then you can choose
what output you want it to be what
quality and if you want to include the
starter pack which will include some
models and some assets and things like
that to get you started now down here
you can choose where to save your file
and you can choose what to name it now
I'll just create a project so now we're
sort of looking at the initial workspace
of Unreal Engine 4 now you may think
well this looks a bit crazy but
realistically if you break it down into
what you might have remembered in unity
and things like that you might be quite
happy with how it looks you're gonna be
able to do the similar sort of things
you hold alt you end hold left click and
you can just sort of rotate the camera
around you can scroll in and out with
your mouse wheel if you use the hold the
right mouse click you can again look
around with the camera if you hold alt
and hold your middle mouse button in you
can sort of pan around and look around
the scene but that's just basic controls
that you could probably work out
yourself on the left hand side here
we've got the different actors that we
can bring in so it's like the different
game objects and things we could bring
in with unity so we could bring in a
cube a sphere whatever we need to bring
in into I see down here is where we'd
have all our assets so so be the project
panel where we can bring things in so we
can have folders and import new assets
into there all you have to do is click
import to bring new things in I will
actually make maybe make another
tutorial to show you how to import
assets and bring them in and create
materials but this is just a brief
overview of everything that's going on
you can just do the same click on your
objects in your scene view rarely then
on this right-hand side if you imagine
this being your hierarchy with
everything that's in your game you can
create folders which is slightly easier
than in unity yet to making it empty
game object but these are clusters
folders you can create right-click and
create new sub folders new folders here
if you select an object in unity on the
right hand side it was the inspector but
this is details about the particular
object choose in what material that it
has physics and anything you need to
deal with there there's a lot of again
if we go back to the left hand side
we've got lights effects volumes for
triggers and such we've got a few things
up at this top min by you can go to the
marketplace blueprints for your visual
scripting a matinee as for making
cutscenes and such building so you can
build them run your game player is just
to play and test it so if we play in
test now you'll notice that I can run
around and do whatever we need to do in
there you've got a series of actual
gizmos at the top so at the top you've
got move which is just like as you would
expect to move it around
you've got rotate which is just as you
would expect and scale if you've used
any sort of game engine or 3d program
before you'll be familiar to those here
you've got your world and local axes
transforms so if you need to look at
that you've got snapping which you can
air an able so if we click that we can
enable surface we can have rotation
snapping we have to hold control in
unity but if we have the snapping you
can see it snaps every 10 degrees we can
just all these values by adjusting the
values there again you can do the
snapping for the scale and you can do
grid placement for things that you might
want to pull in one less thing really to
mention just as this brief overview is
to look
the modes at the top so you've got here
to place all year standard sort of actor
abilities here to pin different
materials and textures here's one way
you'd probably money you'll manage your
landscapes are creating a terrain and
environments they're adding foliage of
meshes which is compared on to your
terrain and then a geometry editing in
case you need to optimize some geometry
with it which is in your game but all in
all it's really very similar except
there's more sort of user interface
actually in your face for the time being
so really it's just based around if you
imagine if you used to using unity the
imagine it being all your assets towards
the bottom you use standard primitive
objects on the left the things that you
need to do to build player test the game
up at the top and the things on the
right for the inspector and the things
that you'd find directly in your scene
so really it's quite straightforward and
I'll be doing a few more tutorials to
show you how to impart and work around
with Unreal Engine 4 so I'm hopefully
this was helpful to some people
hopefully everybody can look into making
some things in here so again thanks very
much for watching don't forget to Like
