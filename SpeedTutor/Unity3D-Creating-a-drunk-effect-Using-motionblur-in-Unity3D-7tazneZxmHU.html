today and this is gonna be about almost
creating a drunk effect or you know
getting to grips with the use of motion
blurring inside of unity now as I said
this can be used in a few different ways
and you'll see it in a lot of sort of
games which add motion blur to the solve
edges of year okay and character of the
camera when you move about and there is
an effect like that in unity and that's
the camera motion blur button we're
going to use the motion blur which
affects the whole from the camera and
we're going to make it so you can almost
have a drunk effect now what you need to
do is go to your main camera and then go
component image effects and motion blur
now it might be slightly different in
yours but this is a unity process so
he'll only work inside of that area so
if I play the game now with that motion
blur on you'll notice you know there's a
motion blur all around it looks you know
sort of a drum car itself being taking
drugs style effect now we're going to do
it in a couple of different ways to make
this actually work now first way is
going to be a Collider maybe you go
through some small custom particles and
it might make your vision blurred or I'm
going to show you another way where you
press a button and it's a there for a
period of time it could be when you've
taken some pills or a drink or something
like that but first what we'll do the
Collider create a new JavaScript and
call this Martian blur trigger open that
up in one develop
and then what we want to do is create a
private variable called M blur and set
that as type motion blur put a semicolon
then write function start add two curly
brackets and say that M blur equals game
object dot find open brackets add quarts
min camera close that up dot
getcomponent open brackets motion blur
close that up or semicolon then we'll
set M blur e dot enabled equals false
that just means when the script starts
motion blur will be equal to false and
we can't see it and then we'll say
function on trigger enter up and
brackets call call on Collider close
that up at 2 semicolon will set if call
dot tag is equal to player then add the
two color bracket salute and set M blur
dot enabled equals true will copy this
exact same function paste it in and
instead of on trigger enter will change
it to on trigger exit and then we'll set
em below done Evald equals false now if
we save that go back into unity go on to
the Collider that I've got and add the
script make sure that it's trigger
I'll make the collider a lot bigger so
you can see when I walk into it now at
first there's no motion blur and you can
see on the main camera it's not ticked
knife a walk towards the Collider you'll
notice that when we're inside the
Collider you get the motion blur and
then when you're out of it again
there's nothing there so only when
you're inside you actually see it
now that's that for that example I'll
just get rid of that trigger for now
then what we're going to do is create
another script and this is going to be
controlling it on a button press now
it's going to be very very similar to
the other one but we'll call this I
don't know drunk open this up in on
develop again and then what we'll
actually do is copy this entire first
part because we're going to keep this
the same you know we're going to use
this to reference what we're doing and
then under here also function up there
then add two curly brackets and said
that if input dot get key down open
brackets whatever button you want solid
T add two closing brackets then add two
curly brackets and set em blur dot
enabled equals true and then we match
you want to have the timer so we don't
want it to last forever so we'll set if
M M blur dot enabled is equal to true
then what we'll do is we'll say that
will create a new variable called timer
drunk and say minus equals time dot
Delta time and then up here what we can
do is say variable time a drunk as type
slot and what we'll do actually is set
this to like about five seconds maybe
three seconds for the sake of the demo
three seconds this if abortion blur is
equal to true when we press T then it'll
start counting down then we'll say that
if time a drunk is less than or equal to
zero so that's when the time is reached
zero will add two color brackets and say
time a drunk then equal zero so it sets
it back and sets it back to its own
amount and
and motion blur em blurred I enabled
equals false so now if we go into unity
and go to the main camera the drunk
script then I would press play now see
that nothing all have happened we press
T the motion blur comes on you can see
it counting down at that side and then
it gets set to normal
one thing I forgot to do is instead of
making that timer drunk equal to zero
set that to five again
well actually set that to set to the
same value as your timer drunk as well
press T you know it counts down where
again press T again and it counts down
for the period of seconds that you want
so that's pretty much the basis of using
the motion blur and then have been two
different instances of where you can
actually use that where it's in trigger
or whether you've pressed a button or
something like that
but that just shows you the basics of an
effect that you can use to create
something you know a bit more
interesting so if you liked the tutorial
