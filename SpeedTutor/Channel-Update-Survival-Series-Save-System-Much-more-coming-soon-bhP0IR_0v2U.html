quite some time but i'll be getting
right on track with that this is going
to be a shot just update video to help
fill everybody in with what's been going
on on what i plan to be doing with the
channel for the future because i know a
lot of people have been waiting a long
while for the survival series and such
so as a lot of you know and the people
who follow the channel more rigorously
will know that i was creating a game
called left alone it's out on Steam and
to those who have you know supported me
and my friend who also is the core
developer on the game were very grateful
and if anybody's sees the videos that I
make and you feel that they've helped
you a lot feel free to buy left alone
you know just to support the channel and
you know help everything move along we'd
really appreciate if you could leave
some positive feedback for the game now
as for the actual channel itself and
there's a few things that I want to
finish off so i'll be finishing off the
optimization series in unity 5 because
as much as people might find that boring
i think that's really important for a
lot of people so we're finishing off
with light mapping occlusion calling a
lot of interesting things with soft
finish off and solve put it all together
as a neat little package i also want to
finish off the beginner c-sharp series
because that one was a good one for a
lot of people and there's just a few
more episodes from there to tie up all
the loose ends and help you get the most
out of programming in C sharp as a
beginner now as well as those two things
I'll be mixing other things as well I'll
be doing all my general tutorials that
I've got a big list of stuff to cover
I'm going to be actually doing one that
people have asked me for a long time is
a serving system i will be using another
asset which is available on the unity
staff a reasonable price and it's very
much beneficial to grub the asset and
i'll show you how to make implement your
own safe system whether out the auto
saving saving seed and serving you
different scripts all the things that
you need to do to then load your game
and you know the things that i had to
spend a long time do
and learning myself you've got to
remember that I will still be doing the
Survival Series i know a lot of you have
been asking that for a long long time
and i promised that will be coming back
but just want to make sure that
everybody understands they just take me
a long time it takes hundreds of hours
of development to put that together and
even though they're only short videos
say 20 minutes it might look like
there's nothing much going on but it
takes a long time for me to put those
together so i appreciate everybody
taking the time to wait I may do tips
and tricks for uploading to steam
getting your game on steam may be
uploading to steam with a steam pipe
process because there's an old video by
steam and it's very very outdated so
that might be something that cover I may
think about making a Patrian so people
who avidly follow the channel can you
know spare anything that you can to
maybe help me out in the long run and
help make the channel a little bit more
bigger and maybe get some more and
tutorials every week rather than just
one a week we might be able to dig any
other series going more tutorials speed
everything up because you know I do all
this for free and you know it takes a
lot of time and if I'm taking the time
to make this I'm not making my own game
so therefore need another way to have
some sort of income so I appreciate and
I thank everybody for I'm supporting the
channel if you've liked the channel
please feel free to have a look pick up
left alone and maybe give some positive
feedback on steam so thanks very much
