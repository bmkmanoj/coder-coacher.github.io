to twelve today and this is going to be
one that people have been asking me
about to just read update and cover it's
going to be creating a UI and making it
pop-up or appear on a trigger so all you
need to do is when you start a new scene
now you want to have an FPS controller
you want to have the standard assets and
if you don't already you can bring those
in you can right click import custom and
bring the characters or you can download
them from the store I just got a plane
here which you can see so we can walk
around on it so you want to be able to
create a trigger so we can make this
happen so you want to go game object 3d
object and maybe create a cube it
doesn't really matter what primitive
shape you use you can use anything you
want I'll make this a little bit bigger
so that we can see it so that's all I'm
good with positioned it now see we want
to go on the right-hand side and
inspector and go out and set this to is
trigger and then from there what we want
to do is click back on our FPS
controller if you've made you've dragged
down and you want to make sure that it's
got a tag of player and all you do is
click the drop-down and choose player
unless you need to add the tag to create
it because we're going to reference that
in the script so that's that for the
trigger what you might want to do is
also you know create the UI elements or
you nc5 will can go game object UI and
we can add an image
this will automatically add our canvas
and our event system now the canvas is
just the main thing the controls the
rate changes on resolution and things
like that
but the image is what we're going to be
able to change and make appear so if we
at the top in the unity we go to 2d and
we just press f when once you select
them image it'll zoom all the way in to
what we have in the sort of to D UI
space so we can do on this image it's
just we want to reset it to the middle
so what we can do on the rectangle
transforms is in the drop down the top
want to right click and press reset and
it will reset the positions to zero zero
zero so in our game you can see it's
directly in
Center now you can add your own that the
source image sprite whatever you need to
because you can bring in an image and
just make sure it's the UI our sprite
and then you can add it anywhere you
like
so once we've got this that's absolutely
fine we can gone and start making the
script so we can right click in the
project panel go career and choose
c-sharp script and we can call this UI
appear once you've done that we can open
that up in Visual Studio now in our
class that we've got here we can start
by writing the script we need to do but
first of all if we want to reference
something from the unity UI
we need to use an m-space we can add
using unity engine dot UI with a
semicolon on the end at the top and then
within our class here what we can do is
we could start by writing in square
brackets serialized field then we can
write private image and we can have this
called custom image and what all this
means is that we've got a private
variable an image we needed to use this
namespace appear to get access to this
element because it wouldn't would have
to write it in a longer more my
long-winded way otherwise and we're just
in a minute custom image and serialize
field just means that we'll make it
visible in the inspector without making
a public variable so now what we're
going to do is we're about simple
ontriggerenter s'alright void
ontriggerenter
and then in brackets will write collider
with the capital and then i other after
that it can be come back whatever you
want instead of other but I'll write
other for the sake of this thing we want
to say that if other dot compare tag and
then in brackets in quotes player and it
should do all your syntax for you
so you just need to make sure that you
have these in brackets and have the
player in brackets then what we're going
to say is that custom image start
enabled equals true so when we actually
enter the trigger we want to enable a
custom image or we can do is we can
cover this entire function and then just
below second-to-last
curly braket we can press that in again
and instead of it being on the trigger
enter we can change this to on trigger
exit and when we exit it we want the
custom image to equal to false so we're
going to turn it off so all it's doing
is that when we enter the trigger we're
looking for the player if the players
found we're going to enable the custom
image that we want when we exit it's
going to look for the say do is the
player there know so we'll turn it off
so what we'll do is we will go on to our
cube that we created if I go back into
3d space and I press F I'll zoom back
into my cube I can add the UI appear on
there and you can see that it's asking
for a custom image and the one that we
had on the canvas here we can have this
image you can rename it to something I
want you know I want this to appear just
to make it obvious so we go to the cube
and I'll drag this on what you want to
do is on that M image what we can do is
we can make sure we can uh Nick it so
it's actually not visible when we play
so if you see we'll press play and you
can see that when we start you can't
actually see anything and we'll walk
towards our trigger and you say with
that when we're inside the trigger you
can see the UI that will appeared and
then if we walk away it'll disappear
again so just very simpler like that and
you can add this to as many game objects
as you need to and you can as I said you
can change the image based on that
whatever you need so if I give you an
example we can click the little m arrow
and I can change this to change this to
one of the standard assets from unity
which is the robot crouching so then you
can see it that so you can change it to
whatever you need to if you want to
bring it so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial
this shows you how to simply make a UI
appear on a trigger event so thanks very
much for watching don't forget to Like
