how to do and render an actual wireframe
in free rare
I searched quite a while to find this
but once had found out how to do it was
pretty simple I've set my v-ray scene
with the v-ray camera and just some
basic lights I'll show that in another
tutorial how a light sail bowl I've got
is a plane and a cube with some edge
loops on it so you can see actually
what's going on so if I show you what
the scene looks like now you can see
it's AB light blue plane in a darker
blue plane box with some shadowing so
really all we want to do is press M to
bring up the material editor and it
collapse all the tabs or anything we
want to find the diffuse color under
maps you can open it up if it isn't
already open and if you click on none
we're going to choose a shared it to use
you want to find something called veer
edges Tex and you know double click that
to open up the shared and what you can
do is you can drag this onto each of
your objects and you've seen what I like
to do often is change the color actually
to black so you can see the wireframe a
bit more you could change the pixel
amount to two that just means the the
thicker line you get so the more you add
the thicker line you get so if we render
this out now so as you see from my
render here we just get a basic
wireframe of the cube and the plane so
anything that's got an edge in will be
rendered so really that's that's all you
need to do and it will work with any
object any scene all right thanks very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
