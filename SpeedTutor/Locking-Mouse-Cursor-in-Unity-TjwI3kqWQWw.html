tutorial today and this is going to be
showing you how to lock your mouse
cursor within unity 5 now this has
changed a little bit since the lights of
unity fall it's only really a couple of
lines you've got to understand to be
able to do it if you use the standard
assets characters and use an FPS
controller it will have an option to
turn it on are off but if you've got
your own custom controller in making
yourself are you're trying to make a
manager which might control how many
things you disable when you know you
need to disable if you've got to a pause
menu or anything like that you want to
understand how it works in its entirety
so all you need to do is create a new
script so in right-click you project
panel go create c-sharp and then we can
go and write something else lock then
open that up in Visual Studio so once
you're in Visual Studio you can get rid
of the two starting methods but you've
got to begin with and we can start by
writing the concept now we can just
start by writing a quick avoid update
just so we can you know give the example
that's me been able to turn it on and
off depending when you need it you start
by writing that cursor dot lock state
equals cursor lock mode dot locked with
a semicolon and what you can do is you
can highlight all the different elements
of this statement that we've written and
it will tell you so it'll access the
cursor API it will look at the lock
state and it will set the Lock and Load
to lock so be set into the middle of the
screen so you can move out of them then
often that goes hand-in-hand we want to
get rid of the mouse cursor so we don't
need it maybe in game play so we can say
a cursor dot with visible equals false
so there you go so we're setting and
locking the cursor to the very middle
then we're saying we don't want to show
the cursor because you might be in game
play and you don't need that to be
visible in the game so all well and good
so that's great if you want to lock and
hide it so what if you want to actually
unhide it after you've done that so we
can do the same so we'll say cursor
lock state equals cursor lock mode dot
none and that just means you ever not
going to do anything to the cursor so we
can freely move it around the screen and
similar as you might guess we can write
cursor dot visible equals true and that
will make the cursor visible again so we
can see it now if we want to have a sort
of thing where we can realize this will
just write a lot less damage control and
a button press and then it's going to
control what we want to do so it will
say that if import dot gets key down in
brackets in quotes I will register one
for and the number one on my keyboard
I'll just encapsulate this stem and then
I'm also going to write another if stem
for number two so once we've written
these these two sort of statements we
expect that when we press one it's going
to lock the cursor I'm gonna press two
it's going to unhide it again you can go
back into unity and you can put it on an
empty game object if you wish but I'm
just going to put it on my main camera
for the sake of this now we can hit play
now we can hit play and you can see that
I can see my mouse cursor and I can
wobble it around in this scene this
isn't an FPS can follow so I can look
around it's just the main camera now
what we do is we expect when I press one
LLL hide so what we do it's a pressure
one and you can see that the key the the
mouse disappeared and I can't believe it
for press two it'll hide it and say I
move it over here and I press one again
you can see that it was in the top sort
of left hand corner and I press two it
will be on hidden to the centre where it
was originally set so say I'm up here if
you can see my mouse first one I'll set
its middle if I press two it's over here
again so that's just a simple way to do
a lock of the mouse to the bound to the
view screen and also hide the cursor
when you don't need to use it so you can
remember that I only need to do we don't
worry about the lock state and the
visibility of your cursor and once
you've done those two things to us so
hopefully this helped you out thanks
very much for watching don't forget to
