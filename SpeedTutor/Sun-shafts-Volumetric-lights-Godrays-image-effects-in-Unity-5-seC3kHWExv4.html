tutorial today and now we're going to be
looking at the Sun shaft image effect
now because it was all added to unity
free with the introduction of unity 5
you get all the image effects with it so
what we first need in our scene is a
first-person control you can import that
from Europe with your standard assets
and you'll also need the effects pack
which will be the image effects you can
usually right click that in the project
panel choose import package choose
characters and effects if not you'll be
able to download it from the asset store
through the client of the game engine
now what I'm going to do is once we've
imported your first first controller
will select the first person character
and that will be our character in the
inspector you'll see it looks like a
normal character if we go component
image effects rendering and some shafts
now we'll go through the things that all
of these do now basically the resolution
is how high-quality Sun shafts will be
so we'll have those on high for now
because we're working on PC high-end and
the blend mode which will be blend with
the screen or which is the sort of
consistent colors that are there are add
sort of over the top for a bit more
contrast to the scene and it's like the
blend modes in Photoshop if you've seen
the shafts caster is going to be is
choose where the actual pauline of the
Sun shafts will be coming from so we'll
choose the directional light or whatever
sudden you've gone and then what we'll
do is we'll change the shafts color or
the Sun shafts color to sort of maybe a
a nice yellow and then we'll leave all
the settings as they are because I'll
test it in-game now so if I now press
play and I just run around in my scene
you can see that's where the Sun is you
can see the sort of Sun shafts coming
through where they need to be so if I
leave the camera here you can see them
very subtly there and I'll just click
out of my scene so we can just have a
quick preview of the settings you can
rely on the z-buffer nice sometimes when
things are rendered in front of other
objects or textures
really cleared up on it totally but
sometimes the z-buffer when things are
rendered first so often alpha maps and
stuff need to be rendered before other
things because you're going to see those
and it's sometimes when you get a
flickering if a plans are objects too
close to others and it's the z-buffer
which is causing the issue so it's
really dependent on your scene the
resolution see if we change the quality
you can't really see it there if we go
to blend mode we can add and it will
solve add an extra layer of effect to it
we can change the threshold color so
that will make the color a little bit
crazy so what we could do is maybe just
tone it down by making it a bit closer
to white we can add the distance
fall-off so if we make the actual
fall-off lower you will get more sort of
Ray coming through if we change the blur
size and increase that we'll get much
larger blur that falls all the way down
through our see the blur iteration just
blurs the whole edging and stuff just to
make it more less less sharp cuz softs
on the shaft is not very sharp and the
intensity would obviously increase the
actual overall how it tends the actual
sun shaft is now if we press play you'll
notice that yeah we get some Sun shafts
some of them look a little bit odd you
might need to change the direction of
your way directional light is facing but
it just sort of gives you an effect of
where the Sun shafts and how you could
possibly create them with the image
effects that you've got out of the box
in unity but obviously this is just a
really simple way to set it up and it
takes you some messing around to do it
for scenes that you've got for the
future now hopefully this sort of helps
everybody get a step closer to you know
adding those image effects into you
again so thanks again for watching don't
