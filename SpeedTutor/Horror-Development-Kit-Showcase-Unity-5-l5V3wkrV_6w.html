showcase video today no I don't usually
do things like this but I thought I'll
make an exception because this is a
really good asset for I don't know how
many people who make horror games
anything like that and I wish I'd have
had something like this when I started
making left alone if you've seen
anything on that game now this is an
asset by John's art on the unity asset
store I'll put some links in the
description but here to just give it a
shout-out because I think that it is
possibly one of the best assets that I
have seen on the star and it's called
the horror development kit now you might
think how does it rarely set itself
aside against other things of similar
ilk let's say but really it comes down
to being a system with pretty much
absolutely everything that you'd want
from you know conventional horror games
that you see and these days I'll give a
quick demo of the things that you will
find in the asset but without a doubt
it's got the best array of features that
you've ever seen for getting started
with a horror game so you've really got
a good head start
it comes with a you know a great rare
cast system with various optimizations
in the code crosshair it's got a little
stamina meter you can peek use doors
it's got flashlights you can use a
camera similar to outlast it's got areas
where you can easily add jump scares
it's got dynamic lights turning lights
on and off examining items and it's
fully documented and ready to use in 5.4
and above and possibly earlier versions
but you might need to message the
developer about that if you're
interested so for the Fox $5 asking
price depending what currency is is
really a drop in the ocean for what you
get so what you can do is when you bring
the core development kit into unity when
you've imported in from the ssstop you
can run the actual just the scenes and
you can either go from the menu because
it includes a menu or you can run the
Sun box version which will show
everything in the
set back together and you could even use
this as say a base to whatever you want
to do hopefully the the volume of the
game or do you want over power and the
voice of but when we drop in it I'll
have footsteps and all things like that
and I'll give you a quick rundown of
what we're gonna be seeing so first of
all we get in here
we've got the crosshair like we'd expect
we've got a character controller which
is a little bit more interesting than
you would just see the default unity FPS
controller because when you move it'll
have a slight sway and a wobble to make
it feel more realistic when you decide
to sprint you have that wobble again and
you get the fading bar which i think is
quite nice and you could probably
position that lower down if you didn't
want it there we've gone a little FPS
counter which you could potentially get
rid of but good for testing to see what
you're going for when you go towards
different things you can set things up
like reading paper and you've got little
notifications on the right-hand side for
examining and interacting there's two
different types when you interrupt you
can left-click and it will just fade in
a nice you know could be notes pieces of
paper or anything that you need to think
of the pictures and it'll just show them
nicely those things for interacting with
keys of picking up a camera and a
flashlight what we can actually do is
say I use this camera as an example as
long as it's an examinable object we can
right-click on it and we'll be able to
rotate that you camera around so we can
look at the object which is quite
popular in a lot of new horror games and
you can right-click to put it down we
can left-click again pick it up we can
pick up the key and we can also pick up
the flashlight now the flashlight has an
animation for turning off putting it
away and pulling it out again which is
quite nice because you don't see that a
lot of times similar with the
flashlights you can right-click examine
left-click to scrub around it you can
put it back down with a right click and
you can left-click to pick up when we
have another animation with the opposite
arm to show you picking something up
you can press F to get rid of the
flashlight again if we don't want it
similar with this table which is just
about object interaction so you can
touch it
interact with it ie picking up and put
into an inventory but you can
right-click and just examine the object
as you might want just similar with the
pictures we get a nice rotation all
things like that really good we can
switch lights on and off and these two
flickering lights and we've got just
functional normal lights which you can
turn on and off we've got chests of
drawers which we can left-click and we
get an animation drawers will open close
you know you've got a little at all to
you I used to say whether it's jammed
you might need a key or you might be
able to open it and then you might be
able to find things inside we've got
normal flickering lights we've got a
selection of dolls which is a jamb dog
when you left-click it'll say it's
jammed we'll have a doll which is locked
and I opened it because I had a key and
just normal does that everything has an
interaction to highlight to show and
that what we're doing and similarly how
I said before with light with a note we
can get something to pop up on the
screen and these things nicely fade in
and out to making sure that it isn't
abrupt we've got different footsteps so
you can add your pub I drew an already
offer and wood concrete whatever you
need to do and it'll affect it when
sprinting and walking we've got a few
different things we've got a 2d
jump-scare which will be a picture in
front of the character a sound
jump-scare which is just a jumble scale
I'm not going to play those because it
might just blast your eardrums out and
it not be very good we've got another
thing that we can use is like I said in
outlast you can press C and you can
bring out a camera and you can right
click and you get a zoom with the audio
and you can go in and you can see the
cave when you walk into this collision
you get a broken camera effects so
you've been hit so you've fallen down
something's broken but you still need to
use as part of you can press C again to
actually get rid of it and other time
but get rid of it we can walk towards
the animated jump-scare and we'll get
something watch just you know where
those sort of basic jump scares where
you see something
flight paths and you get a piece of
audio but like I said this is just this
is base to be able to create a fully
fledged horror game with these with all
the interaction that you could possibly
ask for and it comes with its own
inventory if we press I you can see what
we've collected in the bottom corner so
we have a battery we have a flashlight
helm we have a camera and like with many
of that if you've ever bought a NASA
make sure that if you have any problems
you check the documentation you can send
emails to the developer and if you've
got any ideas or things that you might
want to include in the future or you
feel this pack could you know benefit
from send him a little message and I'm
sure that it'd be happy to take any
suggestions that you might have so that
was just a quick rundown of everything
that you might find for your own horror
again so I can't recommend this enough
and it's a great thing to get you
started on your own horror game for
rarely a small price for the amount of
quality program in this in it so again
thanks very much for watching don't
