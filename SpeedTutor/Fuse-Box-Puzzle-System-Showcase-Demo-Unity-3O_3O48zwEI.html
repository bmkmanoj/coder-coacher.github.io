of my new system which is going to be
the fuse box puzzle system and this is
something that you'll find in adventure
first person horror games and things
like that
and allows you to collect a bunch of
fuses and put them in any order into the
actual fuse box that you might have and
have a way to change the colors and then
do some interaction once you've found
those particular items themselves now
you can see with the asset it comes with
the PBR models made to quite a high
detail you can see that the fuse box is
here you've got a collectible fuse which
you can then as an item to collect and
then put them into the boxes it comes
with all the textures up to 2k with the
models all prefabbed with scripts and
documentation you can check the
controller out on each of the actual
fuse boxes for the main controller and
you can tick which objects should be
visible at the time so like here we
select that if fuse one should be
available and fuse far should be
available they'll appear in one and four
and we'll get green lights to say
they're collected and will only need to
collect two more to complete this puzzle
now we can go to the other fuse box and
you can see that to a technic I'll on
take them all and you can see that you
just need to attach the game objects
appropriately you can press play and you
will drop in you can see the if I go up
to this fuse box you can see that we can
see that this one's green and this one's
green because we take two one and four
to be available on this side you can see
that it is nothing's available so we
need to add four fuses to this there is
sound effects for each interaction
whether that be our selecting the boxes
are they actual fuses themselves so you
could pick as many fuses as you need to
up so I'll pick up a selection you can
see in the bottom corner this is just a
basic UI so you can see we now have six
fuses if I interact with this press II I
can add one fuse the second the next
views and then if as long as you've got
some code behind that you can do some
functionality whether that be open a
door or activate a generator whatever it
needs to be to activate when this
happens and then when we click nothing
else happens so we can actually
accidentally apply more than we can then
with this box we can interact and we
you can add the fuses to this box and
you can see that the in the bottom
corner the fuses went to zero so we've
got an Omaha we can use and all the
lights have gone green and again if
you've got some functionality available
you can do whatever is required in your
game so it's just a basic breaker system
which will find the objects that you
require you can specify how many fuses
you've already got in your inventory you
can set these in any order you like so
if you only need to find one in your
game that's what you can do if you need
to find a whole set of fuses to activate
the a fuse box
that's fine it's totally entirely up to
you so hopefully this gave you a nice
rundown of just this of the fuse box
puzzle system and you can check this out
in the unity asset star so thanks very
much for watching don't forget to Like
