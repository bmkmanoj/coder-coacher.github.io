tutorial and today we're going to be
looking at audio and how to play audio
within unity 5 now I'm going to show you
four different examples of how to
actually play different types of audio 1
is going to be just using audio play the
next is going to be audio play one shot
the one's going to be playing a one shot
sound on a trigger and then I'm going to
show you one without having to actually
write any code we'll just enable the
game object and then it'll play the
sound on awake and I'll show you all the
ins and outs and I'll put a little some
sort of annotations on this video so you
can click through to the different parts
that you want to see so we'll start off
with the first one which is audio play
so we need to set up a few things in the
scene I'm going to create a new game
object I'm going to call it sound it's
just an empty game object which is just
going to exist in the game now I'm going
to right click in the project panel and
go create and JavaScript and I'm going
to call this audio play and we're going
to sort base it all in this script so
I'm going to open up in monodevelop
and once we're there I'm just going to
zoom in I'm going to delete the starting
functions and we're going to start by
doing the audio play so which means that
all audio play does it might find a
piece of audio that exists and plays it
whenever you want to so what we can
start by doing is same function start
two brackets two curly brackets below
then in unity 5 it's changed slightly we
can see variable audio as type audio
source equals getcomponent dot then
we're going to need a angled bracket to
the left or less than and then we'll say
audio source then we'll close that angle
bracket over the other side and then
we'll add two brackets and a semicolon
so this is just saying that we're
creating a variable which is our deal
it's going to be looking for an audio
source and it's going to get the
component audio source so we're going to
put this on our game object and then
under there we can see it audio dot play
with two brackets and a semicolon
so now we'll test this out and I'll save
that and now from here what we'll do is
we'll go to our sound game object he'll
have nothing on at the moment we'll add
a component and what we're going to do
is we're going to add audio play so the
script that we just made you can drag it
on or you can just add it there
we're going to add a component and you
must make sure that it's got an audio
source on it so what we going to do is
we're going to go on tick play on awake
or anything like that I'm going to add
an audio clip to there so I'm going to
just put in my explosion clip and I'm
going to turn it down a little bit
because I think this what this explosion
is quite loud so now when we play the
game it will just play that audio
because it's on function start if we
press play you will have heard it play
that sound and it didn't play it
automatically because play on awake is
on ticked so we know the script works if
I disabled the script and press play you
can see that you didn't hear the
explosion so that's just number one
number two I'm going to show you how to
do and play one shot so we're going to
do somewhat the same I'm just going to
literally comment out these lines here
so we don't have them in anymore
then we're going to say get component
and then dot then two angled brackets
like we did before and we'll say audio
source again then two brackets dot play
one shot and then open brackets is who
I'm going to write in sound and what
want to do up here is I want to write my
own variable and I'm going to have
variable sound as type
audio clip where the semicolon so that
means that it's going to find the
component audio source and it's going to
play the sound which I specify up here
so it's slightly changed in unity 5 and
it has to find the audio source for it
to work and it's similar to c-sharp in a
way with the way that this is arranged
so again on my sound you'll notice that
now we've got a sound which is appeared
so what I can do in this audio source to
make sure that you know it works is that
I can choose numb in there so it's got
nothing in the audio source until we
give it something up here so I need to
add at the explosion again into my sound
I need to make sure that I retake the
script so we can play again then you
will have heard it slightly in the
background so I might turn the volume up
so you can hear I don't know how loud it
is you can hear that it audio dot play
one shot make sure that it only plays
once so that's another thing that we can
do now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to comment out I'm going to go for the
third example and I'm going to write
function on trigger enter upper brackets
call call on Collider close that up add
two curly brackets below if cold dot
compare tag open brackets in quotes
player close two brackets up and then
we'll have two curly brackets below and
what we'll do is we'll add the same
thing we'll add the get component line
so get component audio source dot play
launch ice sound and then we'll click
Save and what we'll do from here is I
will create my own trigger so I'm going
to create a game object or a 3d object
which is a cube and from there I'll just
apply this cube to the floor I'll make
it a little bit bigger so we're
definitely going to walk into this what
I'll make sure that my trigger is is
trigger now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to disable the empty game object
that GOx I don't need that anymore so
I've got my cube which is acting as my
trigger
I'm going to add audio player to that so
this is going to be my trigger now you
need to make sure your player is all
your FPS controller is tagged player so
that I've tagged it as player so make
sure it'll work now when we collide with
the object now we need a sound in the
explosion again so I'm going to add that
but again you need to remember that we
need to add an audio source and I'll
take play on awake because we want to do
it via script so we don't want it to
happen if I left play on awake on it
would apply that as soon as I started
the game because this trigger exists now
as long as I own tick that I press play
and nothing happened at the first I
walked through that Collider and then we
played the sound once once every time we
walk through that trigger and that's
that bit for part three now for part
four what I was going to say is I will
disable the trigger I will you're back
onto the sound we can remove the script
now from our object now I only have the
audio source on the object that exists
in the world now what I'll do in here is
I will add explosion and then I will
make sure play on awake is on so as soon
as I start the game now because this
actual sound when I enable it this game
object exists in the world as soon as it
plays the game just like function start
it will play it so there you got an
obviously you can put loop on if you say
you had some background audio
that sound effect over and over and over
so I'll quickly go over what I'd we've
done before is we've got four different
types we've got one which is just our
deal play and you need to set a variable
of our deal look for an audio source
component and then you can play whatever
audio you want for as long as you need
it to be or you can have one which is
getcomponent
looking for an audio source and we play
the one shot so we play it one time you
can do that on a trigger event yeah and
as long as you play a hit set or play at
once and then you can disable it with a
piece of script or like I said that you
could even have this game object here
which has the sound on which players on
awake you could enable and disable it as
many times as you wanted so say when you
enable it it will play that sound you
disable it again it will not play if you
label it again it will play that sound
again so that's aware that you could
possibly work with you sound but anyway
this was just four ways that in unity 5
you can make sure that you've got your
sound working you just need to make sure
that you've always got an audio source
on something that plays the audio or it
will throw up an error so thanks again
for watching and I hope this helped you
