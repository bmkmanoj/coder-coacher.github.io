in tutorial which is more about creating
an effect and something that you'd see
in another game or a part of a game
which can be used in maybe different
ways depending on how you feel like you
want to use it because so I'm gonna show
you is to use the trail renderer and
what it does is leaves a trail behind a
specific object depending on its
movement so I think the place you may
notice it if you've come across a few
games if you've come across battlefield
3 you'll see some of its out work or
maybe some of the trailers you'll see an
orange line that follows
maybe characters and stuff like that
that's what we're doing a different
program like Adobe After Effects or
something similar but if you want to
create say you're making an RPG and you
wanted a character to produce a trail
that you could follow or even a trail to
follow on an invisible game object as
such and then that might work
to what you want so I'll first of all
I'll show you on my first-person
controller so I've got nothing in the
scene that you know you wouldn't have
access to so if I go to component
effects and a girl trail renderer what
you'll get you'll just get the basic
trail render options you don't really
need to change much but you may need to
download a few things you may want to
download the standard particle pack so
if you right click on your project panel
going impaul and import particles or
what you could do is you can download
the simple particle pack which is
available on the unity assets star and
that's really good for giving you some
basic particles but you can create your
own so what I'm going to show you is on
materials
you'll notice that you need to add a
natural material for this it does work
with just general colors but say we add
the flame not to material from the
simple particle back what we'll do is
we'll play the game and then we'll just
run about and you'll see
what follows behind is an actual flame
dependent on how you've moved and where
you've moved it or crossover and do you
know some interesting things say if
you're making a multiplayer game and you
wanted somebody to follow something
quite simple something really easy to do
you can increase the time which then
increases the actual length of the trail
itself so it doesn't fade off quite as
quickly so you can leave a much longer
trail on the screen before it fades away
but one thing I will show is that I've
got a cube here and this cube is
animated to move in a sort of square
radius and it just loops on the basic
animation if you want to know how to
animate with the legacy animation system
in unity which is window and animation I
could make a tutorial on that and I may
do later on but you can do the same
thing you can occur to component effects
trail render do the same thing so if
you're wired flames not to to the
materials and if we play the game now
and you see that box that's just
animated around you'll see that it just
produces that sort of effect that you
would see in the outfield trailers and
things like that
and you can create something that's
quite simple but can be used in many
different ways if you've not come across
it before so really that was just the
real basics of that function unity but
that's all I'm gonna show unless
something you know more advanced is
needed so thanks very much if you liked
the tutorial don't forget to Like
