and this is gonna be all about
correcting a fixed sort of camera system
so if you imagine that this is in my
game view right now and my cameras
looking in this direction towards my
player obviously this is a first-person
controller so nothing crazy is going on
at all I've done is positioned my camera
as you can see in my scene view my
camera is positioned if i zoom in a
little bit just flirtin in this corner
just looking directly across to the
first-person controller what we're going
to do is we're going to make it so that
when we play the game you'll notice it
now that the camera doesn't track the
player so we can move around and do
whatever we want to do within your game
but I want the another camera to be able
to track what we're doing so we get the
player to come really close
we can track them so really all it takes
is a relative or script so we're gonna
do is go career JavaScript and I'm gonna
say this hold this camera track open up
in monodevelop and once you've often
want to develop what we'll do is delete
those two starting functions then we're
gonna say variable target as type
transform with a semicolon
then we're going to start our right and
function update to brackets than two
curly brackets below and then what we're
going to say is transform dot a look at
it open open brackets vector three open
the bracket again target dot position
but unity auto corrects this every time
target dot position dot X with a comma
so what we need to do is make sure that
target is lowercase like my variable
name because unity seems to like to
autocorrect all my videos that I try and
make we're gonna piss that same one in
again and then we're gonna say target
position dot y
and then of this side will say target
dot position dot Zed
and then delete that comma a to brackets
to end it and add a semicolon so this
means is effective three is direct in
the transform or any of the transform
units that we can have to move the
player around and all that needs is
three values an x y&amp;amp;z value but all
we're doing is we're telling the we're
going to be telling the camera to look
at the position of whatever your tag is
so obviously our tag it's going to be
the player so it's going to look at the
X Y and the Z position and it's gonna
follow it based on that so what we'll do
is we'll go back into unity we'll go on
to our main camera we'll add the camera
track and then once we've added it what
we can do is we can add our first person
controller to the target and then you
know Emily four plus play what we can
see is the actual camera tracks the
movement of the player no matter where
we happen to go so wherever we go it'll
track it as long as your position is
moving obviously to a certain extent
depending how far you go away maybe this
can help you create something that's
slightly less of the common f PS
controller but it actually lets you
create something a little bit more
dynamic so as ever thanks very much for
watching and don't forget to Like
