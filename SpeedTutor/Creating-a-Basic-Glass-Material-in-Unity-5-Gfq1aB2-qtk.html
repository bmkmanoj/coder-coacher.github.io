today and this is going to be showing
you how to make a simple glass light
material which you can use to sort of
simulate having a window or even a
mirror if you would just the settings
accordingly now all we're going to need
to do is I just got playing here and
it's got a cube in front and behind it
and I've just got a skybox to simulate
what we're going to do so in your
project panel you can right click and
create material and we'll call this a
new material and we can call it whatever
we want we can call it glass now all I'm
going to do is use the standard shader
and what we're going to do on the stand
agenda is set the rendering mode to
transparent so then we can hold some
kind of transparency now what we can do
is on the albedo is a solid color what
we'll do is you've got RGB and you've
got alpha all do is we'll knock the
alpha all the way down till on until
it's a zero so you put it all the way
into the black and you can see your
material change on the right will close
that what we can do is we can add the
glass material now to our plan that
we've got and we can almost we've almost
got a sort of materials that we could
potentially use as a sort of foggy
frosted glass now what you can do is
knock your smoothness all the way up so
you get some reflectivity because you
can see it in the object we can see more
through it and we'll see some
reflectivity what you can see is we can
set the metallic all the way down to
zero if it's not already and you'll be
able to see if you look into this corner
you can see a reflection of this guy
behind it if you want to make this
slightly more realistic you can go to
game objects or light and you can add a
reflection probe into your scene and
reflection probe just helps you make the
reflections more realistic because you
wouldn't be able to see this cube in it
otherwise and what you could do is you
could back out if you're going to back
out or you can just set it to real time
and you can just set it to update
reflections on awake and what you could
even do on your last material
if you wanted something more as a sort
of mirror you could move the metallic
value all the way to the top and you
will get something that looks just like
a sort of mirrored material and then you
can do the similar sort of thing by
putting Liam the salt reflection probes
in the way so thanks very much for
watching and don't get to like on the
subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
