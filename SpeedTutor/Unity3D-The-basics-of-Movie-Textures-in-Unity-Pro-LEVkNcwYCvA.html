the basics of using video text inside of
unity and all I've got in my scene is
I've got a cube which I made renamed at
big screen I've got a first-person
controller tagged player as you can see
there and I've just got two point lights
in my room that I created so initially
when you wanted to use video textures it
only works in units of pro and not in
units of free so you have to make sure
you get that you can get the trial if
you need it now the thing about this it
always plagues me when I try and import
videos into unity is the case that
sometimes codecs that use you might
render out your footage and stuff and
things like that it may not work now I
think I've realized myself that I've got
a video here which is just my
introduction to my videos
and all that is was an mp4 but it was
rendered in the h.264 codec farmer and
so to compress it a little bit more but
if you actually render out and just R
convert it with another converting
program and compare convert it straight
to an mp4 and import it into unity it'll
be fine
so it's just your case of some things to
look out for but realistically what I'm
going to show you the basics today is
that with the marker with the screen
here you need to do a few things you
need to actually apply your video to
that screen so you can drag it on you
see it just applies itself like a normal
texture you need to add your audio by
just dragging that onto the same one and
add an audio source to this and that's
pretty much the basics for starting out
if we play that nothing will happen so
we need to write a little script to make
it do something so I want to create a
new JavaScript and Carlee play a movie
anything you want but just for that and
then we want to open monodevelop so once
mono develops up and we can delete the
update function because we don't really
need it for now and what we want to do
is we want to create a variable called
move tech
could be anything you want but for the
sake of this will keep and what I set it
as an actual movie texture type so we
can actually reference the video an
inside the actual start function we need
to write renderer dot material dot min
texture equals our variable that were
created which was called move Tex and
then we one move Tex dot player and it
calls it and it plays so if we save that
out and we drag this onto our big-screen
TV whatever we want to call it C and
it'll ask us to wear our movie texture
is and all we need to do is drag
whatever your videos called so intra not
one and then we'll for hit play now
there's other things you can do with
with this and things of that Bob Rouen
and really gonna cover this year basics
today but what you can do is you can
also add a another variable called loop
and set that as a boolean and then when
from in the function start we can say
move Tex dot u equals true so when movie
texture plays then it'll loop throughout
you player so if you wanted to have
something playing always in the
background and when you play again
see it starts on me and there's also a
couple of other things that we can use I
walked over it in this video but I'll
cover in another one when when I'm going
to talk about activating things with the
colliders but you can also use things
like move Tex dot pars so what that does
is that pauses you movie you can do move
text stop stop which takes your movie
and it stops and restarts in film
beginning but for the basis of this
we'll just keep it like this and we'll
save that out and I'll go over in
another tutorial of how it do this bits
but that's pretty much it for working
with video text it's pretty easy pretty
simple as long as you get your movie
file in so if you liked the tutorial
don't forget to like comment and
subscribe thanks very much Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
