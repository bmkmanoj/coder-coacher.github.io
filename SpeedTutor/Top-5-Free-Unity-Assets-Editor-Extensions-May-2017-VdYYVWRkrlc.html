assets from mid 2017 and this is going
to be looking at the top 5 free editor
extensions so for number one we've got
the universal rename tool at which one
we can go window rename tool and what
you can do here is you can find a
particular say an item an object within
your scene for instance so it's finding
everything with the word level in it and
what it's going to do is it's going to
replace that word or that particular
thing with anything I want so I can
write game in here
and click rename and you can see that up
here I mean mm to item underscore new
game 0 1 2 so will find everything and
replace that word with another
particular word and you have various
sort of functionality and you can read
the documentation for and number two is
the mark tags
extension which is a tag functionality
so immunity you can by default set game
objects with a particular sort of style
or a tag which will sort of fluff of
them and this allows you to tag objects
with multiple things you can manage this
in such a way so you can see here from
this picture from the tag manager you
can tag it all various different things
to sort of make sure that you can keep
an eye on you know what items do what
and what you know you can do yourself so
you can create your own tags find the
tags and help you search between game
objects within unity you can see if I
click on an object and you can see this
tag script you can see that it's a cube
and it's blue you can see that that
one's a capsule there's a whole host of
different ones and as I said you can
create your own number three is the
pixel character builder so it allows you
to create a pixel art character based on
three different types of the head the
body and the legs and you can define
different layers and styles and draw
over each and you can see from the image
below that you get a nice little UI and
you can draw between the two and then
you can create a selection of outcomes
which
you know if you want to be your pixel
characters you can see within unity we
get the UI on the right if we place the
pixel character scripts and we can open
up the shared creator to create our very
own style of character and you can mess
around with this and create it as you
work and number four is the UI sprite
manager and this is the purpose of
helping manage the game if it has a lot
of UI in sprites and help you sort of
choose things like re skinning game and
helping you you know performant on
sprite sheets and taking out the sort of
headaches for very large projects where
you might have a lot of things that you
need to change and keep your manager and
number five is the city tools editor
extension which helps you create a
selection of buildings using an array of
sort of models that you've already pre
created this as it comes with ground
buildings and roofs and it comes with
some streets and you can solve
approximate and create a lot of rooms
that you'd like and the amount of floors
so you can see that within this test
scene we've got a item called city tools
and we can choose a ground floor a slot
and a roof and when we do that we can
choose how high how tall it is the
maximum number of floors the minimum
number of floors and then we can hit
create and it will create an instance of
a new object for us without you really
having to doing it if you want to
quickly mock up a scene so those are the
five assets for the five editor
extensions for mid 2017 and I hope these
help you out so thanks so much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
