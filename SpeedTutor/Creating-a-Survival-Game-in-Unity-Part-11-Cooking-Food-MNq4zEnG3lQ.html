Survival Series tutorials now I
apologize for this taking a long while
to get out I've been a little bit ill
for the past week or so so it's gonna be
it's been a little bit delayed so I
apologize about that but hopefully again
we'll get back on track and I'll start
moving making some videos on c-sharp and
things like that for the future now
today we're going to be focusing on
cooking items or moving items that would
normally be in the inventory to another
slot or something like that so say we
have fish and we want to make it cooked
fish we're gonna need to take it to a
fire and then do something on the fire
now this is gonna be a very basic way of
doing it but it's just going to add
another layer of complexity to the game
and each of these elements sometimes not
always need a tutorial by itself but to
help everybody understand that you can
have elements or layers to your script
like a cake say you can do this very
simply by just adding a few simple lines
which you follow my instructions
you'll learn to do it for a lot of
different things now okay in our one of
our other tutorials we looked at
crafting so we can build a campfire now
for the sake of this tutorial to speed
it up I've got a cube here now this cube
is called campfire and I'm gonna
actually have a tag that I'm gonna make
and I'm gonna call this campfire and
then click back on my objects and go to
the tag and make sure is named as
campfire or make sure that the box
Collider is on our object because we
want to be able to detect a collision
with this so what we do our rear cast
now seen as we've got the campfire and
this is been on acts as the way that
we're gonna cook our item what we're
gonna need to do is we're gonna go on
the main camera and we're gonna open up
rare cast collect so open that up and
Walla development and in here we control
all the things that we do with a rare
curse so we pick up wood we deal with
coconuts
we look at picking up fish and we look
at dealing with the the berry bush now
for this one we're gonna look at taking
something from the infantry so the fish
that we may have collected and cooking
that up so we can use it elsewhere so
what we would do is you can see that
below the if step here for the bush fall
what we're gonna do is below this second
one we're actually just gonna put a
couple of line breaks in and then we're
gonna say like we did up here hit dot
Collider dart game object dot tag is
equal to now what we just made which was
campfire then we're gonna add two curly
brackets below there then we're gonna
say GUI fish is equal to true and this
is going to be Adria why we're gonna
make in a moment then we're going to say
that if input dot get key down up in
brackets in course e or whatever you
want to use close that up then we can
say and and player dot get component up
and brackets inventory close that up dot
fish is greater than or equal to one
close that up and then what we'll do is
we'll add two curly brackets below there
so I'll explain this off a so if we hit
a Collider with the game a wheel with
the tag called comfy it's going to show
a GUI and it's gonna show up GUI fish so
that's going to be something that pops
up in the screen for when we've
highlighted something that's comforting
when it's a campfire tag where we ever
show that now in the if statement here
so if for one we've got this and it says
yeah we've hit a campfire then if we
press E and we're finding the component
which is on our player now up here we've
got a player game object that we've
already added and what I'm going to do
is add the variable private variable
GUI fish eyes type boolean equal to
false for now so we've got all that
together up there now if we go back down
you'll notice that we're looking at the
infantry dot fish is the variable which
controls the fish you could check the
infantry script and we're checking to
see if it's if it's greater than or
equal to one because if not we won't be
able to do what I want to do ie cook the
food because we're not going to be able
to cook anything if we don't have
anything in the inventory so what we can
do from here if we've got enough and we
press E we can say player dot get
component open brackets inventory close
that up and we can say dot cooked fish
plus plus with a semicolon
so that means that will add water to the
cooked fish variable then we can do like
we did here all the bit above get
component inventory close that up put a
full-stop then we can say fish - - and
that just takes one away from the fish
and then the inventory script will
control so it never be able either our
can never go above or below a certain
amount of which you've set then what
we'll do is I'll save that
I'll take Gy fish here and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to pissed in
the else and then I'm going to set that
to false so that means that if we're not
looking come fair we're not when I want
to show this GUI specifically now what
we could also do is in here in our GUI
hit statement we can copy that whole if
statement and take that back a little
bit and we'll call this one GUI fish is
equal to true we'll leave everything the
same as what we did and then instead of
having pick up we can say cook fish this
is can be changed but this is just to
show you you know the sort of simplicity
of how you could possibly go about
creating it all now in your else
statement
what we could have is we're going to
need to put two curly brackets below and
we can say our show edgy wise to
indicate that we don't have enough fish
so if we press E and we've got enough
fish we'll do this if we haven't if we
do anything else we want to show that
we've not got enough fish so we can say
debug log not enough fish this is just
gonna output in the log but you can just
add another GUI if you need to so you
could have one cold fish empty and you
can have another if fish empty equals
true here and have it whatever you like
but for the sake of this I'll just show
you we're working so if I go to my first
person controller we look at the
infantry we've got three fish and if I
press play or maximize on player this
time if i press i you'll notice that
this fish in the infantry and i go
towards my campfire we can cook the fish
if i can leave the infantry open at the
same time we can press e' and you can
see that the normal fish move to the
cooked fish and we can press it and it
will change and when we look away we'll
take that GUI aware so realistically all
it was was a simple way to detect the
game objects with the tag of campfire we
can show a GUI if we want to you can oh
you can go more advanced if you need to
and then if we press e and we're having
a fish will convert the two and if not
we want to do something else to it but
all in all very simple we're and you can
do that with any of the items that we've
got within our game you could convert
the water to boil to burn say if this
was water and then boiled water we could
boil it on the campfire and do any
amount of things it just really
dependent on what you're gonna do for
you game so I'm just showing you
that is aware that you can look at an
object and convert to items really
without doing too much to your card so
all in all really simple way to do it
