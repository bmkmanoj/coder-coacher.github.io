tutorial today and this is going to be
this restart to the Survival Series in
unity 5 and we're going to be covering
from Stan's finished so whether it be
creating the terrain and the UIs and all
the good stuff like that in the first
part of this video we're going to be
creating the terrain with all the assets
we're going to be using free assets
which include the nature starter pack a
prefab brush and the object - terrain
and we're going to be showing I'm going
to be showing you how to and start by
designing the terrain and adding the
foliage textures trees even show you how
to go by adding your own image effects
to make it look a little bit more
interesting and we'll look into making a
mesh design within a 3d program then
bringing it in and using it from there
so without further ado we'll get
straight on so we're going to start by
looking at creating the design of the
shape of the island that we want to
create now it's different for different
3d programs but I'm going to be using
3ds max to just sort of simulate this
idea and you can use whatever you want
like blender and things like that so if
you've built 3ds max are you used to
that we're just going to add a viewport
background to the top so we're just
going to configure the viewport go to
the background tab we're going to use a
file that we're going to be looking for
we're going to search for that file and
I've got on my desktop and it is just
something to do with it's an overhead
thing that I got from Google and then
what we'll do is that how much rendering
output and apply it to the that view pot
and then it matches it roughly well to
the view poll we'll just press ok and
you could attach this texture to Anna
plane and then do it the same way but
I'm going to turn it like this for the
sake of just drawing over it I'm going
to go to these shapes tab and I'm just
going to select the line and I'm just
going to use the default settings for a
corner and Bezier line and I'm just
going to literally click and draw around
this island just basically like this so
we're doing is getting
really just matching the solve outline
you could be a lot more specific with
this but for the sake of this tutorial
I'm just going to go around it really
quick and basically and I'm just going
to skip on once I've gone all the way
around so I've gone all the way around
the object and you can see that in my
perspective viewport down here that it's
made the rough shape I'm all want to do
is I want to select the white line on a
right-click and convert to a deport
editable poly and once I've done that I
want to use vertex selection now you can
seal the vertexes that I made up and
it's just one big sort of polygon and
that's not very good I mean unity will
triangulate it but for the sake of this
we're just going to use the cut tool and
it might be different in other programs
and I'm just going to literally cut the
lines into the shape so I'm just
matching it up so each of the polygons
that we have are either going to be a
far sighted or three sided triangle
because it doesn't really matter we're
only going to use this for a certain
amount of time but I'm just going to
match up just like this by selecting the
line and matching it up to a
corresponding line on the other side
doesn't matter if it doesn't entirely
match up and it's absolutely fine we're
only doing this is a rough thing so
we're going to use only users for a
second and then once I've got all the
things that I think I've got I'll start
by going all the way across and matching
up to these sides it doesn't matter as
long as we've got mostly quads and
triangles we'll be fine with this and
now you can see that it's finished up
and you can see my object just there
with it all fairly closed off now what
we can do is we can just select this
object because we've already got it
currently selected we can go off that
easy you can move that around what we'll
do is we'll set it to on the bottom
coordinates we'll just set it to zero
zero zero just so it's in the centre I
will go and go to file export X bar
selected and I will go to the desktop
and then I will just save it now as we
can save our Island
design and you can save a life be
X dot or BJ depending what program
you've gotten we'll save that out and
we'll get some export settings for the
geometry we can export smoothing groups
you don't need turbosmooth and make sure
we don't have animations we don't need
any cameras we don't need any lights we
don't need to embed mediax we're not
bring anything with us we can leave the
units like that we could change it and
that should be fine and we can just
press ok and export that out and now
I'll move on in the next part of this
video to choosing it's creating your own
scene okay so we're going to get right
into making the new scene and starting
the new project so I'm just going to
choose the location of where to save
this game and I'm just going to call it
survival hat one and then we're gonna
have it as a 3d project and I'm using
five point file for this so it's got all
the new features and all the fancy
things and you can add a new asset to go
with it you can add the characters but I
won't add anything else in and I'll show
you how to get all the assets that we
might need and one more inside the game
so I'll do it I'll create this now once
you're inside unity and you can see
we've got an entirely blank scene what
we can do is we can import the mesh that
we had created we'll call it island
design FBX and you can see it there it's
only just a plain search one side we can
just take the box to say that we
generate light mapping movies we can go
on animation to make sure we on tick
animation so that will be off we don't
want a rig on it and they'll all be fine
we want to create the object to terrain
script so I will show you I'll give you
all the links in the description all the
assets that we're going to use and it's
going to be on the unify community sort
of wiki page and it's going to be the
object is around you can search that on
YouTube or you look for yourself now I
am going to be doing this tutorial
series in c-sharp
but I tried to c-sharp version and it
doesn't really work
as intended for me so I'm just going to
get the JavaScript version I'm going to
copy it all and I'm going to go back
into unity right click create JavaScript
and call it object to terrain what I'm
going to do is I'm going to quickly drop
this into my editor folder and that's
where it I don't think it has to be in
there but I think for the sake of this
we'll keep in there we'll open it up in
whatever editing program you have for
your programming we will get rid of all
the things that are starting in there or
just copying paste all that in control
via in whatever you want to do and then
we'll press save and we'll minimize that
if it asks for you to convert some old
ap is say yes I've made a backup and you
want and we want unity to do that far as
else a little finish compiling the
scripts it might have a couple of them
yellow warnings but that doesn't matter
now when we look at the top in the
terrain we'll have object around on our
men menu at the top now what we can do
from here is we can go a game object 3d
object and terrain on what I can do is
if I got into the scene view and I just
press F to scale out you can see it's
there
pretty big terrain probably bigger than
we want we can go to the Settings tab
whilst clicked to the realm which is on
the far right and we can decrease the
width and the length and for now we'll
put the height at 100 and that will have
scaled our terrain down a little bit now
what we need to do from here is that
once we've got our terrain in we can
drag our island design in and it doesn't
matter that it's so tiny in comparison
to this terrain we can change that and
while it'll do it when we do the object
rain so we'll select the island design
we'll go up to terrain click the object
to terrain button and it will
automatically find the
terrain we have and morph it to that
thing and what we can do is we can
delete the island design out and we've
got this here this terrain it's now made
into the ship that which we designed we
can take the terrain height down to
maybe 20 just so we keep it like that
maybe and that'll be fine what we can do
is we can go to our standard assets
characters first-person controller
prefabs and drop and FPS control on
there we can go to the move tool press F
and we can zoom in and just pull it
slightly above that terrain we can press
play and you'll notice that we'll be on
the terrain so that's fine what it will
say is that it doesn't like having a
second audio listener so we can get rid
of the old main camera that we have
because we don't need that anymore we'll
just close everything this in the
console and once we've done that
everything set up for us to import the
sort of next selection of assets that
we're going to use so that's all well
and good for now we've got already got a
directional light there what we can do
is we go window I'm going to go to the
asset store now so when we're at the
asset store we want to get a few things
we want to get the nature starter packs
I'll type in nature starter and you can
see that nature starter kit 2 is there
I've already downloaded it so you can
just click import or if you need to
download it download it it's a free
asset and it's the one by shapes you can
click import and it will import that
into your unity project once you've done
that you can then look at getting the a
prefab brush and this is going to also
be a free asset that we're going to use
and we're going to use the prefab brush
by Jordan Ellis and we can also download
and import that and won't take very long
to import at all it's a very small file
and then we can look at getting the
cinematic image effects which are for
unity 5.4 so you've got this version
you use old and the old image effects
but these are pretty good because
they've updated the mall for this recent
version so you can download these I'll
just get the normal standard assets from
the asset store if you're missing out on
any of the characters already the fat
end you know the effects you might need
so we can close the asset star up now
because we've imported everything that
we need
it might complain a couple of things but
it doesn't matter you can see that the M
and the prefab brush is in the editor we
can see that we have the and nature
starter pack already and in our standard
assets we now have effects and we have
some of the stuff when the cinematic
image effect and folder so we're going
to start by doing something on the
terrain so seeing as though were here
we'll select the terrain we'll go to the
painting option which is just the
paintbrush and we'll click paint texture
we'll go to edit textures we'll add a
texture and we'll select a texture and
in this pack you can look at yourself
but it has ground so it has ground one
and what we can do is click just add and
it will paint that ground texture onto
our terrain for us so we can actually
see them it's not just so blown out and
makes it unnecessary what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go to click on the y
so I'll go to the very top so I'm
looking down on the entire terrain and
I'm going to see where my first-person
controller is just there we're going to
add a new texture because we're going to
make some paths so if we add a new
texture select and then I will type in G
or gr for ground and I will choose this
sort of more earthy sandy looking I'll
add map
I will leave my brush size about that
big make sure it's some and a soft brush
make sure you click on your and thing
that you want to paint with and we'll
just start by making some random paths
in the terrain just to make it look
a little bit more interesting so we'll
just do you know things like this it
doesn't really matter I'm just showing
you an example so you can do yeah that
that will do I just add one like that
and from the game view what I'll do is
we'll select the first person controller
again and I will rotate it on to what we
just made so you can see out like that
very nice and now from here um you know
it's not looking very interesting and
it's looking a bit flat and bowling and
not to writing is usually or anything in
the world is usually entirely flat so
what we could do and this happens in a
lot of games is that the edges of any
terrain is going to have maybe a
mountain or something that blocks your
view so you can actually you don't
actually notice that the world
you know maybe ends at a certain point
or it doesn't look like you know there's
something amiss you want to create the
illusion that it does go on forever so
what we can do is we can pin and raise
high of the terrain with the first icon
in the terrain selection what we can do
is we can increase the brush size make
sure the opacity is at full we can do is
we can just pull the terrain up on all
of the edges so it makes it look like
we've got some maybe some mountains and
things I've round the actual terrain so
it gives the illusion that you're not
just looking out into nothing so you
know you can do whatever you want with
this but I'm just showing you one
example of a small solve sandbox the
area that we can play around in for this
series but then I'll just pull that up
if I look at the game view you can see
that we've got some sort of Hills I'm
not really taking much time to do this
it's really up to you with what you want
to do then what we can do from here is
weaken and maybe start adding some grass
and things like that so what we could do
is we can go to the little flowers
option which is pin details what we can
do is we can add a grass texture and
it's the one with the love sort of
picture of flowers when we do that we
want to select maybe grass no one
we can add that and then we can change
the color to maybe more of a a darker
green and if you ever happen to click
off it like I did just then you can
click back on the Edit details and click
Edit again and what I'll do is I'll
change the color of that texture as well
to salt match it up so it's roughly the
same will add another grass texture and
type in and go like get grass not too
I'll make this darker again and
accidentally flicked off it again we'll
click Edit and we will change it to
green once again that green roughly like
that then what we could potentially do
is we could add another grass and
texture and we could add potentially the
same one on the end but this time rather
than doing that we can add the healthy
color to something like and an orange so
it might look like some flowers and we
can change that onto an orange as well
so this first one can be the main body
of grass that we're going to have and
I'll make the brush size quite big and
you can see I can start painting that
onto a terrain
I'll keep the target strength quite high
I'll keep the target strength relatively
low I'll take the opacity down slightly
so the opacity makes it less thick in
certain areas
I'll keep it maybe towards the middle
because we can rent repin this as we
need I might select a more solid brush
here so then I don't I can just pin
right up to the edges I'll maybe take
the opacity down a little bit more again
I'll go right up to the edge and I'll
just start painting around with what we
have and I could possibly select grass
too and start painting in these are the
details that we might have if you feel
like you've gone over the path far over
the edges you might have wanted to you
can
decrease the brush size and you can hold
shift i was shoulder shift and you can
just start deleting things that are in
there what I could do is I could just
grab this again and start painting in
grab not to just pin some of that in you
know just getting this around and then
what I could do is I could take the
opacity down quite a lot
grab this one at the end and we can just
add some sort of highlights in the areas
that we have so it looks like we've
maybe got some flowers in there you can
take the opacity back up again and maybe
stamp painting it a little bit more I
mean this is a lot of grass but you can
experiment with this I'm just showing
you while maybe do is take the give the
brush size large tip opacity down quite
a lot and I could pick up a hint you
know in the areas in the distance by
just doing single clicks rather than
holding it down and you can see when we
press play we start getting you know
some build up in the areas that we might
want it yeah that's all well and good
but that's not very interesting we want
to add some maybe some large trees to
the area so we're going to use the
prefab brush so what I'll do with the
pre-flood brush it doesn't actually add
it to the terrain it actually just and
adds it to you know just here in your
hierarchy so what we're going to do is
we're going to right click in the
hierarchy and select create empty and
then we're going to create an empty game
object where the trees are going to go
inside so click trees and what I'll do
is I will do just save this scene out
and I will call this how one just so if
we have any problems we're fine with it
you know keeping this as it is so what
we can do is we can go to window and we
can go to prefabs brush and what we can
do is I can drag the prefab brush to
this side so it just snaps to this edge
so we've got two here what we can do is
we can add a new prefab slot if it does
bring up a red error
it doesn't really matter
it's just complaining about this and
what we can do is we can add a new game
object so what we can do is we can look
for one of the tree prefabs that's in
the pack so we can add tree one and we
can select number slot and add three too
and even add another slot and add tree
not three so we've got three different
trees there we can uncheck the two that
we don't want and what you can see here
is I might have accidentally painted two
trees there but that doesn't matter we
can start by painting some trees on this
terrain and you might need to click a
few times for it to actually place the
object into the scene because sometimes
it's trying to place it in areas where
the actual unity doesn't like it to do
it this is a good three little asset and
I don't fully know how to you know use
it properly but you might have some
problems with it but you want to just
mess around so we're just gonna we're
just adding a few trees around things
like that just in the areas where we
might want it what we can do is we can
uncheck this option select the next tree
that we have add some more trees in and
around the areas we need the trees like
this so I will be able to cut them down
within one of the few next tutorials
that I'm going to do and then we can
select the last section so it's this
tree so now I'm just randomly put the
trees around in the areas now if you're
not careful it'll end up painting more
trees with this selected so we can just
right click up here and close the tab
then we'll get our normal selector back
now like I said these we've got a lot of
trees that just been placed as a
separate game object we can drag that
down into the trees game object and we
can just close that up to me
you know look better now we've got a few
trees on terrain it's looking a little
bit better you might have a few errors
there but it doesn't matter because we
just get rid of those because we're not
going to place anymore once we've you
know decided what to do
you can obviously pass these trees by
hand if you wanted to but it doesn't and
you know matter too much will click back
on the terrain that we've got and I'll
show you how to sort of more add more
details and bushes and things so what we
can do is click on the picture of like
two or three little trees and it'll be
the place
tree section what we can do is we click
add tree bush one will click Add we'll
add a new tree we'll select brush two
we'll click Add we'll select another one
or click wash far and click Add and now
we've got a big big big brush size we'll
take the brush side all the way down
we'll take the tree density down so we
don't want to place too many or select
brush one and if you do you see we'll
place a couple of and just bushes around
in areas where we might want them you
know we can increase it as we need to we
can create a few more bushes in areas we
might want to take density down even
more bush for we just want to populate
the area with things that you know we
could potentially see that going on in
the area so make it a little bit more
interesting than might have been
previously so we're just adding in
random bits like I said I'm not taking
much time in doing this I'm just off
spotting it around doing things like
that what we could even do if you want
to do that if you don't want to be able
to chop certain trees down and lock them
down is that we can click on the terrain
and like we just did with bushes
you can click add tree and we can select
a tree that we might have not already
used so sorry for that we might not want
to be able to say cut down we can select
tree for and once we increase the
density we can start painting
will decrease the size quite a lot so we
just have one place for it and then we
can just start adding that in areas
where it might look a little bit blank
and we could always put you know
selection of trees at the back to make
it look like the world goes on for a
little bit longer than it actually does
you know to spread them around in areas
where it might look a little bit bland
and boring you can do this from the top
view and things like that so you know
you have it say something going on like
this and what we can do it still looks a
little bit uninteresting and we can make
this you know spruce it up a little bit
by selecting and adding some image
effects to our main camera so if we
click on our firstpersoncharacter which
is our camera we can click add an effect
so what I want to do first off is add
I'll type in screen so I want to add
screen space ambient occlusion and this
just adds soft darkened areas between
objects that sits up near each other and
as you would see in real life and it
just adds that sort of hint of realism
to the world before I actually do this
we can go to the lighting tab we can
leave that sky box like that or we can
use the sky box that's given for us with
this pack so if we type in sky we can
add thee it's not that one
it's the other one called Sky box add
that to our scene which also can add a
little bit more realism we can set the
GI to non Becht what I can do is we can
set the pre computed GI to not point
naught 5 and get it to sort of start
doing something I'll turn the resolution
down to very low so we can get it
through to start doing something
interesting we can add the direct light
to the Sun we can keep without all doing
things that's doing what we can do is we
could potentially add some fog to the
edges or to the very much the background
see it appear that what we can do is it
change that to exponential and we can
maybe match the horizon that we've got
back here so we've got maybe an orange
going on so we can maybe try and get
that to match up something like that
and we can maybe make that fog not point
now I'll leave at an odd point once then
we don't see quite as far in the
distance so we've got that all working I
can another component and we can look
through the image effects by going and
component image effects also the
cinematic image effects that you know we
brought in comes with it's on ones that
it has so we can do with the cinematic
we can add we've added the ambient
occlusion we can add bloom and what
bloom does is it highlights bright areas
and makes them a little bit more
interesting we can add a color
correction so we can have a color
correction saturation and curves and
what we can do is we can change this
curve to the curve that curves from the
bottom all the way around to the top and
it's just the preset ones you can change
this by adding keys in and points that
you want and we can just do it like that
so I take that off it'll just make it a
little bit more bright and interesting
we can also add a vignette and chromatic
aberration and we can add that and it
just darkens the very edges of our scene
that we've got so we can just take off a
little bit of edge that we've got and
darken those areas up we can add
something called global fog which might
just bring a little bit of fog more
towards the camera and make it seem a
little bit more interesting we can
reduce the heights and slightly we can
make the density a little bit
less we can increase the start distance
so it doesn't come quite as high up to
the camera so we can leave it about
there that might be quite interesting we
can also add things like at the top of
regard to the image effects again and we
choose say depth of field we can blur
things out in the background that we
might not want em in focus
we can also add you know we can go on
forever
and add cool things we can add
anti-aliasing so it makes everything
just a little bit more sharper in areas
where we wouldn't have it before we can
add some Sun shafts and what we can do
is we can add our directional light to
the shafts caster and you will notice
that it's wool and maybe make some Sun
shafts come through areas where it
wouldn't normally be full and what we
can also do when I was looking this this
patch here looked a little bit
uninteresting and didn't have anything
really going on so what do is I could
select the trees and I could paint in
some trees to make it look a little bit
more dense in the areas that were
wanting to look so you know I've added a
lot bit master it looks like we've got a
more of a dense area and we could all
obviously paint more trees in duplicate
more trees whatever we need to do and
you know you can go on forever just
tweaking settings with the image effects
and adding new things in and you want to
make sure that things like terrain and
maybe trees that won't move you set
those to static if they're not going to
move and the lighting will bake out
something a little bit more interesting
now you can you can take this further
and say you need to adjust things which
you thought alright I don't really like
the size of the grass I don't really
like the color of the grass I don't
really like things like that so if we
select on the terrain again go back to
the game view we'll go back to the pen
details and you know we've selected the
grass not one and we'll click Edit
we say that we want to adjust the say
the max height so we're going to have a
lot bit more of overgrowth in there
we can increase the min height which
will take it even further we can
increase the width and things like that
you can have really thin graphs thick
grass whatever you need it to be we can
then edit the you know that orange
colored grass to maybe make that come
out a little bit more so it looks a
little bit more interesting in our scene
we hit apply you can select our second
set of grass click Edit and maybe make
this height incredibly big so again you
know a lot of difference in height which
makes it look in itself more interesting
what we can do here is if I played the
game now as an example you can see that
it's all going on but the grass is
moving a bit and realistically in swing
hour I don't really like that don't
really like our unity sort of over does
it what I'm going to do for this I'm
just going to get rid of the audio
source on the controller see done let's
hear it drop down we'll go to the
terrain again we'll go to settings which
can go to any point and you can look at
the grass settings so we can if we press
or if we take all the settings down to a
modest amount we press play then you can
see that moves very very subtly what we
can do while it's still playing we can
pull these sliders up and you can just
adjust it so maybe it has a little bit
of mirror I don't want so much bend in
it I just want to subtle solve movement
in the tops of it when the wind blows
maybe we get a little bit more Bend take
the size down take the bend up
and then when we on player it will
remember those settings because it's the
terrain what I'll do is I'll take the
bend down and I'll leave it like that
now you might ask that the trees don't
really move now we can add something to
make that happen we can add another get
an object 3d object and we can add a
wind zone and now wind zone I've shown
another tutorial on how to sort of go
about using your in zone you in zone is
normally directional so it will go in
one direction only it will just affect
it in one specific way if I select my
first class controller and just got back
to you can select on your winds own and
you can set it to spherical so say you
wanted a helicopter that came down and
just affected in a certain area you
could use that but directional will
affect and everything all in the same
direction so when we press play you will
notice that the trees begin to move as
well at the same time and while the game
is playing we can test by taking the men
down we can take the turbulence down or
we can increase it we can increase that
the magnitude or even the pulse
magnitude so it looks like you know
we've got really crazy sort of storm
going on but I don't really like how it
displaces the trees because it looks a
bit weird so if we just go back up and
on play it it will take our settings
back to normal or maybe take the men
down to not 0.5 and the turbulence down
to not point 5 and now we can press play
again and we get much more solve very
subtle breeze that's coming through the
trees and you can have you know look at
all the things that you've made and you
might want to you know edit and adjust
accordingly however you want you get to
look and feel
but really this is just some sort of
ideas some ways to you know add some
elements to you to rent you might not
have seen before add the wind zones look
at different ways to place your objects
and look at different methods to
applying a little bit of more depth to
you seen using a various array of image
effects and I can take all these image
effects off because you don't need them
on at all and it looks a bit plain and
boring but you add each bit that you add
to your game can sometimes add you know
a great more feel to the sort of
atmosphere to the game so that's pretty
much it other than if you the last thing
I'll probably cover is only terrain you
can look at the different settings that
come with it and you can set the draw
distance and how many trees am shown in
the distance or how far away the
rendered and you can even adjust the
detail distance so how far away the
grass is rendered so when I start
pulling the detail the detailed distance
away you can see that the grass is
called away and the further I put that
up the you know further that it will go
and you know you do this for
optimization sake and things like that
you can also have the density of which
it's rendered you know all the way up
close is going to be all the way or is
it going to be back a little bit you
know it's all all up to you and you can
change the Billboard stamp which is when
trees start getting sort of placed in
all things like that and you just adjust
and tweak as you need to for performance
and you know we'll go from here so this
is it for the very beginning of the
Survival Series so thanks for much for
watching and don't forget to Like
