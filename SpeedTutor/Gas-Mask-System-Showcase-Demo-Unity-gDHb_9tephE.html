video of the gas masks system for unity
and this is a featured gas mask system
which includes particles and other
elements for implementing a system with
a basic health UI filters and collecting
the items with a rare cast
now you'll see included is a bunch of
prefabs which include the models of the
gas masks and the filters along with all
the prefabs and scripts collected so you
can set up this really easily you can
add multiple versions of the filters if
you say you want it as a gameplay
element to collect more the gas masks to
be able to pick up and use it and it's
got specific button presses that you can
change all with fully featured
documentation to show you how it works
so when were in our scene you'll see the
little you write at the bottom and
you'll see so the particles that I've
added for free in this pack you can
choose to use them or not you can see
that we can highlight some of the
objects that we can pick up and you'll
see the crosshair turn red we can then
press E to collect an item and you'll
get a sound effects and you can see at
the bottom that the gas might turn to
white to suggest that we've got it you
can hold G and you will have been able
to hear a sound effect for putting on
the goods button we'll get a filter it
uses some of the legacy image effects
which you need to import and it allows
us to do a screen overlay which is just
a texture or you could do it another way
to pick up you'd like to do it and
you'll see that the gas mask filter
ticks down and you can edit this and
I'll show you all this you can see that
it's green currently because we've got
the gas mask on technology again and you
would have heard the sound effect of
taking the gas mark off and you can see
that it's not lit up in the UI anymore
and the Andy filter stops counting down
you can pick up multiple other filters
from here and you can see that we've now
got three and we can hold G and I've
made sure that you have its ecology so
you can accidentally put the gas mask on
take it off and you say it's a gameplay
mechanic
and we've gotten indication and you can
choose within the indication suggest
that you need to replace your filter you
have a bottom press to be able to
replace it or I'll automatically do it
for you if you choose it for you we can
run around in the gas as we would expect
to with the gas mask on but if the gas
pumps off we can hold you to take it off
and then we can walk into here see the
screens gone blurry and you will see
that the vision will have some blur just
to suggest that you're in there and just
similar with to put your gas mask back
on and then you would be able to do
everything normally again does decrease
as you're inside the particles and it's
all it is is just a box Collider on each
of the elements so that you can see it
really easily you've got something which
is you've got a bunch of controllers to
control your audio health and other
things we've got something that controls
the gas masks here and it we can choose
that how long it takes to equip the gas
mask what our normal walking and speed
should be in the gas what our what our
sprinting speed should be the max time
that we should have the filter the fall
rate of the filter the percentage at
which time your filter should bleep and
tell you when you should change it and
what the vineya of the filter should be
and that will decrease an increase over
time as you take more damage and what
was filters you start off with and just
some simple elements to our reference
sort of the UI elements and you can
change all of this because it's all in
the canvas you could see it comes with
other models particles prefab scripts
sounds textures and documentation for
helping you along with whatever you need
to getting started and if you have any
problems you can let me know thanks very
