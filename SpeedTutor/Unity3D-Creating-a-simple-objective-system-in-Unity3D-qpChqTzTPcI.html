something that people have been asking
for quite a while now and it's something
to do with an objective system now the
way I'm going to show you it's going to
be a very simple you know as I would
normally show something and could be an
expanded on in any way you know you see
fit but it's going to show you something
you know which is going to have five
different textures sure GUI is appearing
changing when you go across different
colliders and it will just you know I'll
show you some simplicity so what I've
got on my scene is I've got some
particles and these particles have only
been you know created to show this it
doesn't have to be particles it can be
an object that you've picked up it could
be something that you've walked so it
could be when you've walked into a new
area but all these particles have got a
box Collider with is triggered them tick
so they're exactly the same but just put
in different areas because I can just
show it working I've got five different
textures so I've got objective up to
four which in turn just changed so shows
objective objective one two three four
and they're all set to was type GUI and
this is what we're going to use to you
know make it appear in the top of the
screen so realistically all we're going
to do to start off we're going to create
a new JavaScript and call this object
objective manager what we'll do is open
this up in want to develop and then
we'll get the new option so we'll delete
the two functions and all so far
variable objective one as type boolean
equal to false now I'm going to copy
this another four times say 1 2 and then
5 times and then change it to objective
2 objective 3 objective 4 and then
objective 5 and similar so write a new
variable call it texture 1 as type
texture and then other did we're going
to copy that
and we're going to paste this in the
four times and then we're going to in
turn James these two texture one two
three four and five and then underneath
here we're going to say function on gy+
brackets open the curly brackets and set
if objective one oops
objective one is equal to true then
we'll close off the brackets open the
curly brackets and say gee why dot draw
oops
dot draw texture open rackets rect open
up another bracket so ten comma 10 comma
750 comma 150 close that comma right
texture 1 close the brackets and put a
semicolon now all this does is draws the
texture that we've added in the 1 will
add it to the inspector turn across 10
down and then whatever size of the image
that you want it to be somewhere in 750
across 150 down now what we want to do
is actually as we've copied fewer but
we're just going to do again we're going
to copy it paste it in another four
times and change that objective to
objective 3 objective 4 and objective 5
and similarly with this we're going to
say texture to texture 3 text your far
and texture 5 and then we'll save that
out and this is all we're doing for the
management side so we'll go back into
unity we've gone to your first birth
control or wherever you want wherever
you want to add it then drag objective
manage it onto there also while we're
he'll make sure that you play it is
tagged player while your first go
centrioles tags play and then what we
want to do we want to add all our
textures here obviously however many
textures you've got you want to create
and you can you know delete as
appropriate
just got 5 to show it works with as many
as you want to add and you've added all
your um urn textures in that's all we
need to do for that I'll just add this
to my objectives folder for now and what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a new Java Script and we will
call this objective 1 and then what
we'll do is we'll open up objective 1 in
monodevelop I'll delete these two
functions and ask write private variable
objective manager as type objective
manager other would spell in the script
and we'll say function start closer to
brackets open the curly brackets and say
object manager is equal to game object
dot find up brackets quartz first-person
controller close that upset dark
getcomponent open brackets objective
manager close that up add a semicolon
then under there we'll say function on
the trigger enter up brackets call
column collider close those brackets add
to curly brackets and say if call dot
tag is equal to player will add to
brackets under there and then say
destroy open brackets game object close
the output semicolon and then what we'll
say is object manager dot objective make
sure it's lowercase objective 1 is equal
to true and what this does it just finds
the other script that we've created and
whatever variable what variable we had
we're just going to change the value
from false to true now what I'm going to
do here is like before paste in another
four times change this to object to
object is three objects of foreign
object
five so when we've gone over a
particular Collider it key you know it
sets the values accordingly so we don't
make any of the GUI appear at any one
time and with changing all these to
false because we don't want the others
to appear so we'll save that and what
we'll do is we'll keep hold of this one
and what we're going to do is duplicate
this four more times so you just
compress I select the object and press
ctrl D once twice three times four times
and I'll pretty much create what you
want so then we can open objective two
in monodevelop and we want to keep keep
everything exactly the same except we
just each time we're going to change the
one that we won according to what the
actual objective is sort of objective
two equals true everything else is false
I'll do one more then I'll pause the
video on you know just to speed this up
then we're going to change that back to
false and we're going to make three
equal to true so you get what I'm doing
I'm just adding making one equal to show
every time so now I've done all my
objectives what we'll do is I'm going to
add each of my objectives to my actual
objects they're going to do something so
I'll add it to each of one of my
particle effects so each one a card and
litter how I want it to happen so now
when we press play you'll notice that
nothing happens and I've got all the
particle effects going on now I'll walk
into the one I want
and obviously that gets destroyed we've
got a new objective and then you can you
know you have this appearing fade in
whatever you like then we walk into the
other you know we'll get a new objective
and the other one goes aware well walk
it's the other we get another objective
walk it to the other or we get another
and you know as you expect we walk into
it again and we've got our last
objective now obviously you can you know
make change these two anywhere that you
particular see fit
now that's pretty much the entirety of
what I was going to show but something
I've just thought about is what you
could change if you didn't want the
objectives to last forever so what we
what we can do is actually create a new
font call this object to this four
disappear and we'll add two and
semicolons I mean two brackets in a
semicolon them also function objective
this to color brackets then we can say
yield wait four seconds open bracket say
two seconds add a semicolon then we'll
say objective 1 is equal to false and
then what we can do is minimize that
play the game go back into here we'll
walk into our texture and then after two
seconds it disappears again because we
can't actually use a yield inside a GUI
object so you have to do it outside you
can make a timer but for ease and
simplicity I've just used it here and
what you could do to make this work for
any texture you could add that function
to each of these and make sure you turn
them all to false
after you've wait two seconds so you
know you'd have to write loads of
functions for each one's so that's
pretty much just a simplicity of making
an objective system nothing crazy
nothing too complex but hopefully
that'll help you want all right as ever
