on the unity asset star for May 2017 so
asset one is the character Monster one
Ark which can find on the start which is
a pretty cool-looking orcish character
which is a range of different defuse
materials so you can change your texture
a codling tell you wanted to look and
asset two is the rocky hills environment
light pack and this is a pack which
contains a variety of the tree assets
that you will see in this sea caves
rocks and pieces where you can add a
sort of a rocky Cavey environment and
number three is the love Polly Ansley
characters a life limb this is a small
package which would be of a much larger
package which includes a low poly
character where you can change the
textures available and to change the
style of your character now it comes
with a simple attack animation and some
sort of idle animation and asset for is
the high detail truck f15 or 2016 and
this is a fairly and detailed truck
which comes with separate sort of
modular pieces which will make up the
sort of entirety of this vehicle and it
even comes with some sort of special
effects with the use of light shafts
includes all outside and interiors of
the model and number five is the sci-fi
gun light and this is a range of assault
rifle and looking sci-fi weapons which
are PBR models and it comes with a range
of materials to change the look of your
material and what are you trying to
achieve within your game and these are
very nice detailed assets with really
nice textures so it's a really cool
asset if you want to just bring up the
quality of your sci-fi game number six
is the tactical axe and this is quite a
nice simple model a fairly cool looking
axe which could be used for multiple
purposes whether it be a weapon
or something that's more of a utility
weapon and number seven is the 19 it 11
pistol pack which comes in a sort of
modular parts which you can see you can
pull apart the object and it comes with
and different things that you would be
able to animate different parts
accordingly to what you needed to you
know make feasible for your game and it
comes with solve a range of bullets and
number eight is the tinned canned food
and this is a bit of funny one because
it might look fairly basic but this
might be a really good item to just fill
up your sieve and put things on the back
of shelves and things like that and you
can see that it's got just a range of
their cans of soup and things like that
just to stock up again and number nine
is the modular rod lock free and this is
a really and quite a cool asset and you
would not really notice it at first
glance but like the name suggests it's a
modular asset so each of these pieces
that make up the model is entirely
separate so you can make a variation
based on the one areas and make up a and
sort of concrete barrier which can be
out of your you know fairly on creation
and you can just very so they don't all
look the same and then percent is the
mini cartoon 63 and this is as you can
see a very small selection of buildings
which can make up a solve streets or a
block with fairly low poly assets in a
sort of cartoon so which I think these
look quite nice if you're going to
achieve them with a range of other
prefabs which include the trees the
lamppost
the roads and the different styles of
buildings all collided and ready to use
and you can check out all the assets

the assets that I found for free on the
