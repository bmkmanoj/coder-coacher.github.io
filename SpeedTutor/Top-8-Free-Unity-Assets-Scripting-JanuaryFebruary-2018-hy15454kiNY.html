scripting assets for January 2018
lamorne is an asset called quick save
and is essentially just a plugin which
allows you to easily save and load
content from files which are inside
unity games cross-platform support and
you can encrypt files and you can save
them securely with the data it's got
fast serialization and compatible with
most types of data and you can see that
it has a wide selection of supported
platforms just out of the box and all
the code is fully documented so if this
is a sort of safe solution that you
might want to check out and see how it
works for you and number two is a
character stats and this is just as you
would suspect is a sort of stats or an
attributes type of thing which can be
affected by items spells skills and
other things and it's just um you can
mix and match modifiers and things to
sort of cooperate these stats are we
character in set different modifiers
with a lot of different functionality
with depends what you want to do I mean
I probably couldn't do this justice so
you might want to check it out if you're
looking to incorporate a RPG style
status system where you want to be able
to modify things where when you pick up
an item if you need to do more damage
less damage just check it I want to see
what you think and number three is the
simple health bar and this is for unity
5 and above and it's simple health bar
that's being built for the ground to
make it easy to use so developers can
quickly get health back and implemented
within seconds you don't have to mess
around you know dragon UI elements ow
and soft position it and working through
all that and it's not limited just by
displaying the health of players it can
be used for a wide range of different
status values if you've got a survival
game you could use it for different
implementations and you can check out
all the documentation available and it
contains the UI textures a custom
inspector as you can see down here and
it comes with it allows you to edit that
really easy and number four is quite a
nice one and it's called a low poly
water and it's a package it allows you
to generate what
wave effects on sort of plane meshes
with a low poly self-generated styling
you can apply this effect on a son
playing game object which has a loft
sort of polygons in it and then you can
create your own custom plane meshes and
use the system included so if you're
looking to create lists out I mean what
can I say it looks like some a lot Bali
water so give this a try if it's
something for you but looks quite good
the fifth one is the D ad inventory and
it's specifically an infantry system
which is built for mobile games and it's
a drag-and-drop interface so you can
choose to select stuff from the infantry
and drag and drop it into specific slots
whether it be the equipment or whatever
it may be
and change stats accordingly you can
have cells specifically designed to
specific items you can have cell
highlighting to have you be able to
assign the dropped items you can trade
with a price we are for automatically
calculated and the items can be picked
up and destroyed and it can be quick
equipped with a double click so it's got
a lot of functionality in there and the
next one is the easy main menu free and
this is a free demo of the actual bigger
of the actual easy main menu which isn't
the demo this actually comes with the
full animated main menu but it just is
without the sort of graphics settings
and game settings sound settings or
stuff like that
so you can get that in the paid version
but this just allows you to maybe see
how it's built look at some elevation
animations and the next one is called
light LOD and this one is quite a nice
one might not be one for everybody but
if you are somebody who uses real-time
lights you use that and real-time lights
can be quite a big taxing overhead now
this type of asset allows you to take
the real-time lights and give them
functionality or customisation so the
further away that you get from the
real-time light from your player you can
set a level of detail so you reduce the
quality according to how far away from
that particular light your player may be
so if it's not very important like any
one time and it was still a real-time
light you could say it's LOD so as soon
as the player gets a certain distance it
just caused a shadow so we don't have to
that anymore so it can sometimes be you
know a good optimization especially if
you've got such an overhead with lots of
lights and the final asset here is
called easy population allows you to
take a group of models which might be
animated and these characters will be
allowed to give an solve AI behaviors
and they will do different behaviors
like walking walking side by side
stopping and chatting arguing flirting
and maybe even children following adults
and it's allowed to create rare random
behavior on these soft static characters
that wouldn't be doing anything without
you giving them you know specific tasks
and it's just built around behaviors of
you have these characters and you give
them a specific points of interest our
locations that they might want to walk
to walk around and things like that and
you can have a look at the demo and you
can have a look at where it's been
simulated but check this one out if you
feel that is something that you'd like
so these were the best free scripting
assets for January 2018 I will leave a
link in the description for you to check
all these out on your skin for watching
delicate so like comment subscribe Jesus
