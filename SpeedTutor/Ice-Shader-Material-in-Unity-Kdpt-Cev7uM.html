tutorial today and this is going to be
showing you how to use yourself on MEC
and I shed and this will be an asset
we're going to use from the star which
is completely free it's a it's a really
good shed and looks quite realistic and
nice and there's a lot of different
settings with it so without further ado
what we could do is we can go with one
year in unity are outside of unity
because the asset store usually you've
got a tab there you can go to the search
bar and you can type in ice shed and
what I normally like to do is there's
other ice shed is available but if you
filter by free only you can see that the
ice shed I just show this in one of my
other videos for the top 10 assets but
all we need to do is you need to click
download and you can press import and
then you get a selection of things with
in what you want to bring with it you
don't have to bring everything with it
you don't need the skybox and things
that's just you know the test themes and
whatnot but for the sake of this I'm
just going to pop all the assets things
when you see and once we've done that
you will see it at the bottom in the
actual project panel and you will see it
here and we can open up the scene and we
can go to say the frozen sushi shop and
you can see a bunch of the actual assets
working in their current state so you
can apply this you know it's a shared to
any particular material that you might
have within your game you can create
various different levels of sort of ice
whether it's ice from a cube or a glass
bottle which might be slightly frosted
and you can create various different
things if I give you a pure example and
we go to game object through the object
and cube and I've created a new cube
here I'll just scale it up so you can
see it really big so you can see it
there and with the actual asset we only
really need the shared so what you could
potentially do is right-click create and
choose to create a new material I just
called it ice cube 2 we can go to the
top which is the shader we can switch it
from standard to the one toward the
middle which is or Lanigan or however
you choose to pronounce it and you can
choose glass or ice break the boss
fairly similar but you might want to
just test each different instance so if
we choose eye
broke for instance and I've already
applied this material to my cuban you
can see it's already applied some sort
of firm and ice normal maps and things
like that to it you can increase to say
the metallic value because when we get
sort of a reflective almost a glassy
service like ice is it's usually quite
reflective we can increase the gloss
amount and you'll get gloss so you can
see it actually on the shader here you
can actually increase the ice Fresnel
and then you will be able to start by
seeing through the actual ice itself
which gives some distortion to the
things that there you can increase or
decrease the transparency depending on
how you make maybe want it to look you
can adjust the freeze effect so you see
how frozen that the material is on and
or how little you might want it and you
can increase the amount of snow effect
you might have in areas where you've got
the missing parts of the ice then you
can of course change the color and
things like that so you can have some
soft colored ice or something like that
it doesn't work fantastic on a cube it's
not great but that's just an example of
just setting up a really simple material
and you can adjust any of the parameters
where you need to remove the normal max
maps or change them to your own and you
know just adjust the settings
accordingly so you can just give it a
mess around and see what you want to
make so again this is just a simple way
I'm using this really good asset from
the asset store so thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
