fit to them and this is about showing
you how to make an explosive sort of
mine in unity so I've just got my scene
that's really basic so I've got a
directional light first plus control and
just playing with the grass texture on
so what we want to do first is decide
what things we're gonna have to make
this actually work so what we'll need
and what I've already got is my game
object which is a mine here so I'll
place that down we need this simple
particle pack you can make your own
particles it doesn't really matter but
you can get the simple particle packed
from if you go to window and then click
assets start from Unity game engine
itself and when unity appears if you
just type in simple at the top press
ENTER you can just search by price and
there's the simple particle pack so you
could just download that and use that I
have also got a couple of sounds for an
explosion and a sort of hurt sound as if
you were getting hurt by the explosion
and then we're gonna create a script to
actually make our work so if I get into
it straight away here's mine I'll drag
my mind into my scene as you can see it
there and then what I want to do from
there is then choose an actual particle
effect that I want so if I go into the
simple particle pack go to resources and
I usually like explosion not one air
doesn't matter you can chew it I have a
look at a lot of them and if you go and
drag that and parent it to your mind so
from here what you want to do then is
we're gonna want to actually add a
Collider so you can detect when you're
actually close to this particle system
so what we want to do is add component
physics then box Collider and we'll just
set the box Collider
zero zero zero
and then we'll make the size 1 1 1 and
then you can see it so if we change the
set amount make it go up bit of width
just met the Collider appropriate also I
want to add sound to it so I want to go
component audio and audio sauce this is
for later so we don't need to worry
about that what we want to do now is
make sure the box Collider is triggered
if we're going to actually make it work
with our script so now we're going to
make a scripts you will from the right
click on your project window god creator
c-sharp and then just call it mine
explode and then we're going to open it
up in modern development and start
writing a little bit of script so once
monodevelop opens then we're gonna start
writing the code so we one really we
want three variables and the variables
are going to be two public audio clips
and one's gonna be called hurt with a
semicolon and then another public audio
clip that one's going to be called
explosion and then a private game object
mine which is actually going to be our
mind so we can detect where that is in
the scene so now I forgot to the
function start we want to say that the
particle system dot stop and then semi
and then bracket semicolon because it is
a component of the particle system so
it's almost like a function so all this
does it it's when we actually apply this
script we're going to put it on the
particle system so it knows that when
it's on the particle system it just
tells that particle system to stop at
the beginning of the game because we
don't on its player unless we get close
to it
so what we want to do now is wanted to
delete this update function really we
don't need that and then we're gonna do
is type on trigger and
and then in the bar in the brackets we
need collider over doesn't matter you
could use anything other than other and
then we're gonna write an if statement
if and over from our Collider is tagged
as player because that's what our first
person control is gonna be tagged then
if we could put in two more curly
brackets for the if statement then
particle system dot player and then two
brackets and then you semicolon as I
said cut the calls itself its own
function so that'll make the particle
system player once the player enters
that Collider that we created which was
the Box Collider I'll show you what
happens from this script now so if we
click on the mine and we just apply that
just leave the audio sources for now see
what happens when I walk over to the
game object
yep the particle system explodes when we
get near but nothing else happens that
still stairs there we can do it an
infinite amount of times so unless you
wanted something like that then it's not
actually apparent so we'll go back into
our script and we'll go back into our
ontriggerenter then we're gonna make a
new line and we're gonna actually add
the audio now to make it do something
interesting so play one shot and then
what I want to do interpret our box is
typing our variable which was hurt with
a semicolon
and then walk up with the same line here
you don't have to have these two pieces
of audio there's a math you can one
explosion you can nothing you can have a
different a different type and then play
one shot explosion just like we've
gotten the audio clips above so we're
gonna drag those into the inspector
later and what else would we want to do
is actually once we've gone to that
Collider we don't have that explosion
anymore so what we could write is
destroy in brackets
particle system which means that on when
we enter that trigger it plays the
animation then plays the sounds because
it just it just uses each line one after
each other so then it will destroy the
particle system so if you enter that
trigger again it wouldn't do anything it
wouldn't play a particle effect and also
what we want to do is destroy that mine
once it's been there if that's what you
wanted if that's how you want to you
know use it again so I mine I'm going to
write mine equals the game object dot
find and then we're gonna find what it's
actually called
so mine is called mine that's what I
actually named it or if we seen if we
see in my hierarchy here and again it's
called mine and then we're gonna create
a new line mine dot getcomponent then
we're gonna create two side brackets and
type mesh renderer and then we're going
to put in two brackets again dart
enabled equals false so I'll explain
what this line does so all this does is
it finds the game object which are
reference up here the game object it
finds it which is called mine which is
here and then and it will forget the
component and it's mesh renderer and
will hide its mesh renderer so actually
when we go over the explosion it hides
that game object so you can't see it
anymore so essentially be out of the
game once it's running once you've gone
over it so if a closed monodevelop
but what I forgot to do was add a
semicolon there after the main I so
brought up an error so now when we click
on the explosion what we'll do is we'll
add two sound effects from here so I'll
go into my sounds folder
an explosion where this explosion the
jumps actually why I've got heard that
sound but I just named it differently
those two things everything set up if I
press play and see MA my mind walk over
to it and that was a bit loud that's all
you saw there was we walked into the
mine with the trigger from our player
that's tagged player and I'll show you
here the first person trailers tagged
player the mine and we entered that
collided the particle system played and
not before the sounds played the
particle system stopped so we couldn't
do it again and then the object got
hidden so that's all really so if you
