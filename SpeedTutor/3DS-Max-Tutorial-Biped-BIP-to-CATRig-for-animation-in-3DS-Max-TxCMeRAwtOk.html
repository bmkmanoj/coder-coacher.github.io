video I'm gonna show you how to import
your newly converted CSM to biped motion
capture footage onto a cat rig
specifically for use in animating
characters because that's how I usually
like to do it so if you go down to if
you're on your main palette on the right
hand side and you go towards helpers on
that side and you click on you drop down
list you got a cat objects you click cat
pair and you can choose as a whole range
of pre-med rigs you can build your own
but I used to just like to stick with
the base human so if you select go near
one of your viewports click and drag you
can drag your cat rig straight out I'm
just gonna set mine to a ratio of nine
point three so you can see it there as
long as you select in the base platform
and you now click on the motion tab you
can see layer manager and lots of
different as things but if you go to the
clip manager and there's a little folder
which says browse for cat or motion
capture and you want to click that and
if you don't see anything wherever
you've saved you files you want to go to
biped BIP and click on the file that you
want
there's my flinch that I exported
earlier so if I click open so you want
to see that you want to set you biped
out sometimes any biped height will
differ from your cat rig height so it'll
make the knees Bend too much so if
that's the case I'll give you an example
if I set that to 50 and I just click OK
you'll see that the knees almost been
too far so if I close that and just
collapse the animation down so we don't
have any layers and I reopen it again
you said you height to about 70 you can
see this is some bend in the knees see
the start and end time these starts at 0
frames and ends at 451
I've saw at the bottom of your max you
would concede time configuration so you
can see you start and end times if you
change that to 455 you'll see your time
lines change to the full range motion so
if then you click capture the animation
it will run through that time line with
the animation that you've got and you
just have to give it a second to run
through it all and once it's captured it
you kill stop itself and you can close
the dialog box so it's got to the end
and it ask you whether you want to
delete the sauce and remove the mapping
layer after don't think it matters which
I usually click yes so you can just see
the collapsed layer and now you can
scrub through your timeline and you see
the actual motion capture on the cat rig
which makes a lot easier for animating
and things like that because the cat rig
is more the updated version in 3ds max
from the old style biped okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
