tutorial and this is gonna be a bow
something that somebody suggested you
know a while back now but I've been
working through things people have asked
and it was about changing my GUI sort of
survival system to use images or PNG s
instead of actually using the sort of
bar system that I'd originally shown now
this is gonna be very very simple I'm
going to keep the car script and
obviously you can download that from a
website but from the car scripts we're
gonna actually you know delete a few
components add a few more which you're
going to control you know when we see
each actual PNG image you know depending
on you know when your help flow when you
you know you need to eat and you don't
stuff like that and it'll change it
accordingly so all I have in my scene
as normal is my first first controller
I've got the GUI I'm a GUI survival
script attached but I've just renamed it
fry cons just for the sake of this
tutorial now I've got three of each sort
of whatsit GUI element really it looks a
bit funny on this such well side because
I don't know unit has changed it when I
changed it to a GUI option but anyway
I've got you know like health is bad
health the neutral health good for green
black and red and that's the same for
hunger and that's the same thirst so
thirsty just a bottle hunger is like a
knife and fork so you know when it's red
you know you need to eat black is
neutral and green is good so we'll get
straight into it so there what you can
career all you need to do is create you
know three different of each image in
Photoshop or whatever you want and then
import those in to unity now I'll start
off by showing you what I've done in the
script now I've added a couple of new
variables which I didn't previously have
in the actual erm script and now that
it's called
a thirst folder and hunger for it and
they've just been added to
the rate at which you lose your current
thirst and current hunger so instead of
me putting a number there so you can
divide it by a number it's just gonna be
something so you can edit that within
just the editor here so if you set the
lower you know the number you set it to
the quicker you know your thirst or
hunger will actually deplete obviously
you can times it you can times it and
then add a number to make it go quicker
but it depends which way you want to do
it
now we'll get straight on to the topic
in hand and this is doing the actual GUI
elements now what I'll do is our stack
so we're going to start and need to
write some actual variables now we're
gonna have I'm just gonna take this from
a script that I did earlier sawed off
the type as much Alex it's gonna be a
lot of copy and paste and I'm going to
need to do and to keep this shorter what
I'll do is paste in an L explained so
we're going to create three variables
called health good health neutral health
pad and they're all going to be set to
as type texture we're gonna do the exact
same thing and then we're gonna paste
three more so first good thirst neutral
and thirst bad all is texture and then
we're gonna do exactly the same thing
again but obviously you may have guessed
the hunger good neutral and bad now
we'll just I'll just put a little note
and call these you know GUI textures and
then I like a little note here so you
know what's going on with this one and
add this to fall rate fall rates so you
know what's going on there now that's
pretty simple we've just added nine new
textures that were going to be able to
add now we're gonna do something very
very similar and what we're gonna have
is we're gonna call this GUI boolean's
and this is just going to be true or
false values for what we're gonna set so
I'm just gonna pair season so I've made
nine private variables
three of them called GUI health got GUI
health normal neutral GUI health bad and
similarly like I did before GUI thirst
good GUI thirst neutral GUI thirst but
all set to false at the beginning now
that's pretty much the entirety of the
boolean's that we're gonna add now what
we're gonna add is actually a new
section to the code so under here the
once you know maybe leave few spaces and
then we can put new section just so
everybody doesn't get confused with
what's going on then we're gonna do a
few things and it's gonna be very
similar to what we did with all those
billions that we set we're going to have
very much a constant sort of rather than
of them but we'll say that if current
health is less than or equal to 100 then
we'll add two curly brackets in and
we're gonna have to type in these
boolean examples so so what we're going
to do is that if the m health is equal
to our below 100 it's gonna be equal to
you know true so he's going to show the
yum the good PNG and that's what we're 1
until it falls and to another rate so
i've you know written this earlier and
what I'll do is well you know you'll do
exactly the same or you'll be able to
download this script from our website
now if current health is below 50 then
you won't see the good image anymore you
will see the neutral image because
obviously 50 is halfway so you know
that's what it's going to show the
neutral image now you may well be able
to guess you know you can change all
these values now if it's below or equal
to 25 you'll notice that now bad is
equal to true so we actually see will
actually come to see the red image and
the others are set to false so we don't
see them anymore now we're gonna do
exactly the same thing
for the first section so what I'll show
you now is I've just pasted that in so
I've you know i we are added a new
comments in the new first section so
exactly the same as we did for health if
it's ever below 100 yeah it's gonna be
good thirst if it's below 50 will set
neutral to true and then if it's less
than 25 all set but to true and
everything else is false
now again as you may have worked out I'm
gonna do the same thing but it's gonna
and from the hunger section you know as
I said before if it's less than 100 then
set to true all the way across just very
simply just changing the values of each
of the you know set billions at the top
now from there everything is gonna and
that's pretty much the entirety of it
but we need to actually add something to
our Gy section to be able to display
these actual icons so then we'll look
say if GUI health god is equal to true
then we'll add two curly brackets
underneath and say that GUI dot draw
texture open brackets rect
open back it's again 5 comma 30 comma 2
22 point 5 comma 30 3.75 close our
brackets comma and then pop health I'm
good and then add a semicolon now that
you can see that health code is the
texture and we're just referring to what
we've set in the boolean's so that's
pretty much essentially what we're going
to do for each of the cases so now if i
pissed
these two in familiar the script and
what I'm saying that is that if health
is every culture neutral or bad will
change the textures accordingly and they
all sit in the same place essentially
and what I'll do is I will add another
note to say that their health icons and
what we'll do is I will copy my
previously written items in here and
you'll see that the first icons so if
GUI first is ever equal to true will
change the position slightly to lower
I've just got these down here as
reference because I could see that I set
that to 30 55 and 18 and I mentioned
that twenty two point five and thirty
three point seven five is just there
specifically for the fact that that's
what size I wanted to scale me images so
x and y over the images so that I am
width and you know if any of these are
set to true I'll change the options and
then what I'll say is down here is the
hunger icons and will Pierce those in
and if any of those are equal to true it
changes its position five across eighty
down size of the image and then change
is the actual image in itself now we'll
save this out go back in to unity and
you'll notice that all of the texture
slots above Piatt have appeared so now
I'll need to change it so health bad
health good health
oops health good health neutral and
obviously just match up and I'll stop
this and you know so we can speed it up
and when you've added all your own
elements in you'll notice that as long
as you've got it attached to your first
person controller you'll notice in my
top corner I've got my icons and the
first in hunger is counting down at the
the exact same rear and obviously
because it is and you know not below 50
yet or equal to 50 we've not changed any
icons at all so you know we have to wait
till we get to that specific
but with this I'll just speed this up in
my script so we don't have to watch it
you know going really slow so obviously
if he times it by that um these amounts
ad times instead of dividing go back
into unity and I'll put five and five
and then play you'll notice that he
comes down a lot faster so obviously you
know we're above 50 now you know we're
getting all the way down we're getting
towards 50 and both the icons change now
you can obviously changes to make the
items bigger you know position them
differently now for blood 25 you'll
notice that obviously yeah they've gone
to red and then your health starts going
down and then you'll notice that and the
face changes as well but obviously you
just need to check you've got all the
elements so I'll quickly go through it
you know that health good you've got all
your textures health first neutral I
mean health first and hunger and the
ball got good neutral and bad all as
well so very similarly with the billions
you've got the private variables all
sets GUI health thirst hunger good
neutral and bad all set to false
everything's the same except we'll have
a new section that if your current
health or you can't thirst or your
current hunger is ever below 100 you
know you'll set the good one to true if
it's below 50 will set the neutral to
true and the rest false and then if it's
below 25 set the bad to true and the
rest of false and all we're doing in the
GUI section is that if any of those
actually equal true it will display the
image that we're looking for obviously
you can delete this section down at the
bottom but that's pretty much just for
debugging so we can see what's going on
and now I'll change this back to how it
was before and then you must just
remember in unity to add your images and
you can change whatever rate you want
stuff to fall down by but that's pretty
much just covering the very basics of
sheer simplicity of adding images
you know showing them in a Saab G or Y
sort of way so thanks very much for
watching and as ever if you liked the
tutorial don't forget to like comment
