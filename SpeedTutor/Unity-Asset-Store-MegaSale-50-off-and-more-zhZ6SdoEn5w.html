sure to check out the unity asset store
mega sale which runs from the 27th of
November 2017 to the 8th of December
2017 and it's just come on and it's all
the way running up to like I said the
8th of December and you can get up to
50% off all the major assets and also
thousands of assets are on sale this is
a perfect time to check all of these out
and if you didn't already know I'm a
publisher on the unity asset store and
all my assets are on sale currently up
to 20% off which include various puzzle
systems asset packs and more most of the
assets are suitable for a wide range of
games whether it be horror survival any
type of 3d or little puzzles that you
want to add in there and of the puzzle
systems that I've got for sale is my
digital input keypad system which
includes a keypad and all the inner
workings of this so you input a valid
code with a particular string length
that you want you can use numbers or
letters and it will allow you to do
whatever functionality you desire
whether that be open a door open the
chest whatever it may be for the type of
game that you're creating and the next
one is the padlock puzzle system which
is an interactive on padlock which can
be interacted in use to open up a door
just like with the previous system but
instead of it being a code this is a
code which is on a physical object which
has spinners and this is a really cool
one if you again you're doing a sort of
puzzle a horror game the next puzzle
system is the lever system where you
have a number of levers you can add as
many as you actually want and you pull
them in a particular order and then you
can press buttons whether to reset it
press to test it to open a doll and do
things very similar to the previous
assets you can also check out the
examine system and this is just a system
where you would see in a lot of
interactable horror games where you can
look at a set
pick it up almost spin it around in
front of the player and you know be able
to interact it if you've done an
intricate detail and then put it away
and carry on with the gameplay I sell a
bunch of assets and model packs
and one of them includes the 20
cardboard box pack which includes which
includes a range of cardboard boxes
decals Alfa's you know just to spread
around and sort of add a bit of variety
to ICI and I have also got a bigger pack
which is an assorted prop pack which is
had been actually used in unities neon
demo which they did in their most recent
sort of press conference and you can
check it out and you can see all the
assets here which includes the pack from
the actual cardboard boxes but it
includes a wide variety of other sort of
bits of debris trash containers and all
sorts of things which you can go and
fill up your seams really easily and the
final thing is a very simple sort of
industrial sign pack with a bunch of
signs markings and things that you can
use to throw out just to fill up little
areas where it might look a little bit
better and you can add signs on roads
buildings wherever it needs to be and
just remember that all my assets are 20%
off so you can check these out now and
all the other assets are available in
the assets store and all my assets are
five studs so they all work efficiently
and easily so feel free to give me any
suggestions feedback and if you need
