best assets that you can possibly find
on the asset store which can pretty much
help in any number of actual projects
that you start whether it be you know
any type of FPS MMO RPG anything are
absolutely at all even if it's 2d 3d
whatever it is so the first one I'm
going to mention is easy safe this is
one that I personally always use and the
developer offers absolutely fantastic
support special and I was getting
started it's one I've got a few
tutorials on just to get you started and
it's pretty much a complete saving and
loading system so you can it's got a
whole host of documentation API examples
just to show you how to get it working
and it just allows you to simply write
some shorthand and it allows you to save
whatever you need whether that be
billions integers arrays whatever it
requires and lets you load that really
easily with just some simple
functionality so it's really one if
you're looking to integrate a subsystem
as it suggests easy save this is really
long the one you want to look at it's
around $30 depending on your currency
which it might fluctuate but it's
something really to put your money down
on if you're looking to just save a bit
of time I'm the second asset that I'm
going to mention is rewired and this is
another one I install from the very
beginning because unity is just default
input manager isn't very good and
doesn't have a lot of functionality out
of the box now rewired along with
another asset called in control in
control slightly cheaper but I've not
really used that one but pre-wired is
the one that I use again great support
from the developer if you need and lots
of documentation a whole host of
documentation to help you get started
along with tutorials on getting it set
up but once you get this set up it works
you literally you can write in just some
shorthand to reference the input manager
that this rewired is and it allows you
to use absolutely any controller as long
as you specify the specific maps and the
specific set of commands that you want
to give to each one and once you've set
it up say we do a button for firing a
button for jumping crouching
whatever that will transfer to
absolutely anything else whether that be
ps4 Xbox controllers mouse keyboard
touch controls wheels as support for
literally everything which is around
forty five dollars are there there
abouts depending on your currency and I
have mentioned this in another video but
my third one is gonna be the universal
sound FX pack which is around $40 and it
comes with over 5,000 high-quality
sounds and again you deploy thousands
and thousands to get something like this
if you were to make it be sparkly and
this is just one that you need to
purchase if you're looking to make your
own sound effects and things like that
because it comes with a whole host of
whether it be you know noises grunts
explosions just everything you can look
at some examples but it's definitely you
want something you want to look at and
you get all the updates when they add
more music to the package you can
download that and add that to your
collection and the fourth one I'm going
to mention is amplify the amplify shader
editor this has been given awards by
unity themselves for being such a
fantastic asset and that isn't a solid
how do we say so I've shared a redditor
within unity directly I mean you can do
the sort of shared programming but this
helps you almost in a sort of flood chat
diagram kind of style to make your own
shared as whether it be for desktop
mobile Xbox Playstation 4 across all
platforms and has to plot part for the
other assets on the star and it is just
another great asset which helps you
extend the sort of visuals or depending
what you're trying to create in your
game allows you to create custom shaders
with you know whatever functionality you
really desire you can see some of the
examples with a custom outline and
tooten shared as examples and it has all
support for terrains and across many
different platforms and you can just
take your games to the next level by
creating your own custom shaders that
you will see in a lot of top top games
and the final one that I'm going to
mention how can I not mention it is you
FPS the ultimate FPS sort of controller
system and this is one that's been out
on the store for a very very long time
and has continued and continue to get
support throughout the time it's been
here and it's one of the most popular
assets you will actually find she's
around seventy dollars give or take and
they
is just an all-in-one FPS system and it
just has so many things thrown into one
place whether it'll be the system for
shooting collecting items interaction
and the swaying realistically the body
Swaney of the weapons ammunition
infantry absolutely everything it
classes a full body support and has all
the HUDs input support interactions for
dars platforms and advanced moving
supports got slow motion effects and
just even supports stuff from other
assets and it has all the full
documentation and high quality assets
that you might be looking for I think
there's also one more that I wanted to
throw in here which is called ultimate
survival I've done a few survival series
on the channel per I think this is one
worth mentioning which is a modest price
of $35 roughly and it is just a survival
system which has a hell of a lot of
different features just thrown into one
whether that's player stats tools guns
and inventory crafting building
workstations equipment mining tree
chopping animals AI just enemies of
humanoid characters just everything
thrown into one great package and if
you're looking to get started on a
survival game this might be one for you
to check out so these were just my top
assets so far you know a wide range of
games some that you could probably use
in every single game that you over
career and some more specific but
they're absolutely fantastic examples if
you're looking for unbelievable quality
that you can find on the assets top so
hopefully these helps you out remember
you can put some of these on your sort
of wish list and usually the assets go
on sale all year round so you want to
look out for maybe one of your favorite
ones on sale at one point if you're
looking to save a little bit down the
road hopefully you check these out
