about the chrome dev tools and the
console tricks hope you know some of
them but I'm gonna show you some
interesting and cool stuff in this video
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you
few console tricks which you might not
know which you might not seen yet but in
this video I'm going to show that so
let's get started so I have created an
object with the names and I have passed
two fields in this and those are name
and age so I have three objects inside
my array as you can see here
so in this regular expression in this
regular form I'm going to type console
that log
console dot log some text right I am
our text right so let's actually run
this inside the browser to see how it
looks let's refresh this file and let's
open the console to see
right it is appearing in the console as
you can see here right I'll make it
short here so that you can see two
screens parallely right so
when it comes to es6 a string
interpolation you might know you might
know about the string interpolation in
es6 previously we do
string interpolation using the modulus
division sign and s it means string
right I'm going to show you how you can
do that I am a programmer right now not
just here
modulus division s and then say comma
and then C programmer right so let's
save and let's hit refresh right I am a
program as you can see here this was a
previous method before es6 interpolation
feature
came in came to this language
javascript' right it is using year six
standards now what we do is we do like
this we don't need this
but we don't need this is a string s
form we just need the backticks so I'll
show you how you can do that all you
need to do is you need to use backticks
here and you can find this symbol to the
left of the one at the top of the
keyboard as you can see on your keyboard
these back ticks are very important for
string interpolation in magma script six
so I'll just use the same line and say I
am
dollar and I'll say this curly braces
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy
this programmer I'm gonna paste it I'm
gonna store that value
inside one variable right and I'm gonna
use that variable inside the curly
braces and let's see the output so let's
just comment out this line
right
save it and let's see the rift let's
refresh the browser
programmer is not defined okay all right
so we need to use this in a string
format let's refresh this and as you can
see here I am a program is appearing on
the console
so using this way you can interpolate
your string in ACMA script 6 right
before it came before it comes
the previous method was this one the
above one modulus division s so using
this way you can do but I prefer this
backticks method es6 method because this
method is very simple and you can use
any variable or any value inside this
curly braces this is very simple right
comment out these two lines let's
actually leave this and let's see how we
can actually style our text inside the
console you might be wondering how you
can do that let me show you how you can
actually style your text inside the
console let's use console dot log
and let's see here you can style me
right this is just text let's use comma
and then say font size
should be let's actually make this right
connect tipped 50px let's save and let's
see the preview
it is not appearing
let me see what I did wrong here no it
isn't still not appearing oh actually I
forgot to write modulus division see
this is the symbol for styling your text
like the modulus Division s it means for
string interpolation previously but all
you need to do is you need to remember
these symbols these are very important
if you really want to text your style
inside the console then you need to use
modulus Division C it means it
represents you are going to style your
text inside the console let's refresh it
and you can see here he here you can
style me and you can also give the color
for this text let's use blue
let's refresh the browser and you can
see it is appearing in the blue color
right
so let's comment out this line and hope
you are enjoying this video and the next
one is the next trick is warning machine
it's how you can actually show a warning
message inside the console this is very
simple all you need to do is console dot
one this is a function you can use to
give warnings in the console right is is
wrong I'm gonna use this text for the
wrong machine the warning message as you
can see here warning this is wrong it is
appearing this in the stack trace so it
is just a simple trick to display the
warning message in the console right so
let's copy this and let's see how we can
actually if the error message inside the
console right error
and and let's give some text like oh

right oh this is going to give an
error message inside the conference
tract trees as you can see here the
error is appearing in the console right
the error is appearing in the console
and similarly you can also give the
information message in the console in
the stack trace using the method info
right you got me you got me
right - got me correct
let's actually make this right and let's
refresh it yeah it is appearing
you got me correct it is not giving any
symbol for the info actually I'm doing
something wrong here that would be
console dot info right
no it is still not giving any
information symbol
in full
let's change this to info or info let's
actually copy this and let's paste it
here and see what we can see
undefined console dot info
oh sorry info and let's give over text
Hey
right
it's copy let's see yeah it is not
giving any symbol I was wrong it is just
giving the information message and that
is a simple text right it is not giving
any symbol like the warning and the
error it is just displaying text the
text which is given inside the info man
inside the info function so it is giving
any text using this way you can give any
information in the console and this one
is about a third function how you can
actually test your conditions inside the
console let me show you how you can do
this how you can do this console dot
assert
sorry assert right if you want to check
anything or if you want to test any
condition then you can use it like this
one triple equals to one right then this
is wrong
right
let's see let's actually close this all
let's save it let's refresh it right it
is not showing any message this is wrong
below oh the error message right
let's commit all these all lines that we
have used above right
the assert function is not displaying
any message this is wrong message
because if this is true then is then it
is not going to give you a display
message right what you have given inside
the second parameter in assert function
if you are not giving a correct
condition here then it is going to give
you an error
one equals two one let me use this right
invalid left hand in assignment okay one
equals two
let's use this condition right assertion
fail and this is wrong as you can see
here this is wrong is appearing inside
in the console it only shows the message
which is wrong if your condition is
wrong if your condition is false then it
is going to error it is going to display
an error on the console hope you got
this right
so let's comment out this line and let's
move to the next trick that is the clear
function console dot clear function it
is going to clear everything inside the
console let's refresh it not here close
this let's refresh it here yeah the
console was cleared you can see the
message on the console let's copy let's
actually comment out this line and view
Dom elements using dir and log functions
right
so you can you can see dom elements
using dirt and log functions let me show
you how you can actually do that right
so we have created one P tag paragraph
tag HTML element and we can access it
here P equals two document dot query
selector right this way you can access
the P tag right so let me use this P tag
inside my console dot log function to
see sorry to see the P tag in the
console right so let's save it and let's
sorry refresh it you can see here the P
tag is appearing in the console along
with the class and all all attributes
right you can access this but let me
show you one more thing one more way how
you can actually access the HTML element
inside the console is using dir function
their function right if you use dir
function then you would get some
different result right you can see the
drop down along with the class and even
you are getting extra boots that's
awesome and you can see everything
related to del P tag and if you scroll
down you can also see the owner document
parent element and all stuff you can
explore more about this
so dir is a wonderful function if you
really want to access the HTML element
right so these are the two functions let
me comment out these two functions and
let's move on to the next thing to the
next console trick and that is group
things using group and group and
function right I have created an array
here an object an error of objects you
can see here I have defined three
inside disarray so let me use this array
let's loop this area here
names dot for each right forest name and
this is I'm using the arrow function
this is if this is the ESC key s6
standard arrow function right so you can
actually use console dot log right to
console to console dot log and let me
use the backticks here backticks the
name is the name is dollar curly braces
the name of the person dot name my
object value right so let's use let's
see the console let's clear the console
first to see the output right you can
see here the name is saya the name is
Mohamad and the name is Honda mere three
names are defined in that array and that
array of objects you can actually see
inside the console right and even you
can access the different properties of
that array of that array like the age
let me show you how how you can actually
do that let's use console dot log again
but sorry name is this one right
of age of age right of age name dot age
name is my object you can see here of
age right let's use this and let's say
let's refresh it before it we have to
clear the console and you can see here
the name is Sahn meet the name name is
saya of 863 name is mohamed of age 60
and on me is of age 60 as you can see
here the output in the console right
hope you got this and I hope you like it
right let me show you how you can
actually define this all stuff in a
group we are actually going to see how
we can combine things in a group let me
show you how you can actually do that
console dot group is a function right
and in this you need to say this these
are names right let's close this and
let's copy this and let's say let's use
another function group and it represents
it is the starting point of group and it
is the ending point of group these are
names names are completed or you can say
anything here it's your wish so let's
use and let's clear console refresh it
you can see here these are names it is
appearing in a drop-down manner the name
is Mahmood name is saya
and the name is Hana mean everything is
in a object manner as you can see here
in object everything is in object three
objects we have three objects and those
three objects are in group name and the
age by default these dropdowns are open
if
you really want to make it as a clothes
or if you want to close this drop-down
by default then you can use another
function for that and that is group
collapsed right by default it will be
collapsed right and I'd see in the text
to people name or famous people famous
people right let's use the same thing
here famous people let's close let's
clear the console and let's see the reef
let's see the output by refreshing it
famous people right the tea the three
objects are in drop down and those three
are collapsed by default and the
attributes and the name and age are
appearing in a group wise manner so this
is the way you can do it right let me
just comment out this all stuff and let
me show you one more trick here and that
is count number of times it is used if
you really want to count the number of
times which you are using things inside
your program then definitely you can do
that using a function that is console
dot count this function actually you can
use it and I'll say epic op and ll see I
will copy this for five times let's save
it clear the console let's refresh it
but you can see here I pick up one two
three four five right it is giving the
number of times which we have used this
thing right so you can comment out this
and the final one is the timing and the
end fung time end functions if you want
to calculate the amount of time a
specific piece of code is taking then
definitely you can calculate the time
but for that you need
a function that is timing right timing
in this you can define fetching data
right so you can use the fetch function
here to fetch data let's clear the
function of console first you can say
fetch right fetch and all you need to
pass all you need to do is you need to
pass the URL from visual you are going
to fetch the data I'm gonna use JSON
placeholder this URL and it fetches all
things for us right so then and I will
say data my arrow function and the
console dot time end right time and
represents the end of time let me change
this from timing to time I was doing
wrong right let's see the output here
let's in output here let's pass the same
next same message inside this time and
function let's see an output inside the
browser and I am forgetting right I'm
forgetting one thing here console dot
log data right so let's refresh not here
nothing is happening yeah you can see
here fetching data and it is it took one
six six eight point eight three blah
blah blah milliseconds right if you
refresh it again you can see it took two
to one point zero six to zero
milliseconds right and even you are
getting the response in a JSON format so
this way you can actually use this way
you can calculate the amount of time
reach
for your piece of code a block of what
is taking how much time you can
calculate the amount of time and you can
also specify the end of time by
displaying this message and it is even
displaying the data in a JSON format so
hope you enjoy this video and hope you
understand all cool console tricks and
the death tolls right so don't miss my
previous videos on ionic and please
