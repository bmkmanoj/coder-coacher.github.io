moussaka Liam from epic op and I'm back
with another video and if you're new
here make sure to subscribe my channel
to stay tuned with my latest videos
about ionic and angular and more about
JavaScript so in this video I'm gonna
discuss about cloud fire store which is
a new database that has been designed by
firebase team and this is actually a
flexible scalable no sequel database
that allows you to store data in the
form of collections and documents so let
me tell you about this new database
there is cloud file store from firebase
actually the two major components of
this file store database are documents
and collections so if you have worked
with MongoDB or some database like that
then you must have come across with the
term and that is document and document
is a collection of key-value page and it
allows you to store data in the well in
the form of key value pairs so it's it's
small and scalable and it allows you to
store data in the form of collection in
the form of key value pairs and then
next word then another term of this
database file store is collections
collections is just simple meaning of
the connections is it's a collection of
documents right if you have ten
documents similar kind of documents then
you can collect that documents in one
collection so it's a group of similar
kind of documents so this is all about
the cloud file store and also I'm gonna
show you how to integrate the cloud file
store in ionic and angular project
easily and for this I'm going to use one
beautiful website that is stack bliss to
create a small project because I'm using
it for test purpose you can use it
easily without installing any modules on
your local machine so you can do it
easily it's online ID for web
application
powered by BS code so this is the
documentation you can refer this
documentation to know more about cloud
file store and this is currently in beta
release but you can use it in production
and the development mode as well so
let's get started
so all we need to do is we need to
create a new ionic project you can you
can create react application as well or
angular application as well but I am
using am integrating cloud file store in
ionic project so you need to click this
button to create a new ionic project on
stack bliss it's an online IDE and if
you don't know about stack this then
make sure to watch my previous tutorial
about stack base I'll link that video in
my video so in this video so you can
watch it and it is bundling our app
right all we need to do is we need to
install the dependency so we have to
head over to the documentation when you
scroll down then you can see the
dependency modules let me check
getting started right when you click
getting get started what happened it is
not working for where we write for where
we are creating right when you scroll
down you need to use you need to follow
these instructions we need to head over
to the firebase console to create our
new project you can see here add
firebase to a JavaScript project we need
to head over to the firebase dashboard
we need to create a new application so
here I'll create our new application
bismillah ybm is my new project new
firebase project when I click create
project it creates a new project with a
unique ID so when you scroll down and
then you can see we need to add this
config object inside AB dot module or TS
so for this we need to install the
dependency right we are not developed
this application on our local machine so
we need to install the dependency on
stackless if you are developing this
application on your local machine then
you need to install the node module and
for this we have a command and this
command can be found on this right you
can see here npm install' G firebase not
these tools you need to type I - - safe
this this is mica a similar kind of node
module command you can which you can run
on your local machine to install the
firebase module so I'll just type in the
name of this module dependency so I'll
click I'll hit enter firebase enter it
installs the dependency of firebase in
our ionic project till then I'll head
over to the firebase dashboard and I
will continue with this and you can see
here if you want to add your firebase
configuration object to your web app
then you need to select this option this
will actually give you the config object
so we need to copy this and head over to
the app dot module or TS file and copy
paste this code so for this we need to
import the firebase yeah firebase not
this one we need to remove this single
quotations firebase right so this is the
import statement of firebase which you
need to use to import the firebase in
your ionic project so paste this code
paste the firebase object configuration
object code inside abdominal dot ES file
you are done with this then the next
thing which you need to do in your ionic
project is you need to head over to the
home node TS file to actually
get started with the integration of
firebase with ionic application so head
over to the closest dependency drop-down
head over to the pages and home dot ts
file right here we need to import the
firebase and file store both statements
firebase slash fat store right so these
two things which we need inside our
ionic project so let's dive into the
constructor part and let's say let D be
equals to D be equals to firebase dot
fat store what I am what I am doing here
is I am just creating an instance of
firebase right so now I'm going to
create a collection as I said as I said
earlier that file store is a database
which has two major components
collections and documents so collections
is a set of documents and documents is
actually your data right all your data
all your application data will get saved
inside the documentation in inside the
document in the form of key value pair
so I'm gonna give the name of this
collection as persons and I would like
to add a new document and let me tell
you one thing here that this add method
allows only JSON object and this add
method actually saves your document this
is your documentation document part
inside your collection and it only
allows JSON object so the thing which we
are giving in the form of key value pair
will get saved inside your document so
I'm gonna give first name as
Hamid and the next name and the last
name as Mehdi Mohammed Mehdi right so
this is our document inside the
collection persons right and I'm gonna
say then data what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna console dot log this data so that
we can see the data right data and if we
get any errors then we can catch it
using this catch statement right console
dot log the error statement right so
this is just a simple application which
we are using for test purpose to see the
file store database in firebase so we
are done with this all we need to do is
we need to head over to the database
part inside firebase dashboard and if
you are using it for first time then you
can select the database right real time
database is a database this old database
which may get deprecated in future and
this cloud file store is a new database
which which will come in right so try
file store beta and typhoid store beta
so we need to use it for test mode so we
need to select this option and we need
to enable this file store right this may
take some time so no need to worry so we
are done with this and if you head over
to this documentation then you can see
the step by step instruction and the
guide so that you can follow and create
your own ionic or angular project and
you can integrate file store easily so
it is taking some time so let's save it
let's save the home dot ts file
let's save the home dot ts file let's
save it
and let's also open the console of this
project right
inside this inside the console dot log
statement it is giving me some error in
turbo module so I was getting the issue
the turbo module issued because I have
not imported this statement so my bad I
I forgot to import this statement so I
was getting that issue anyhow I have
imported this statement from the app dot
model dot TS file this statement import
statement in home dot es file so we need
to import these two statements so
remember this point don't get confused
the import these two statements to make
your file store work so we are getting
the console log statement here our
application works fine now if when we
make it when we make the console large
we can see the file store object with
the ID
with the unique ID let me show you the
ID right so this is the object file
store client right we can see here the
database ID you have you can see here
the database ID the the fibrous project
ID here the database is default so our
details the document and the collection
has been saved to the database so let's
head over to the firebase dashboard and
you can see here the person's collection
with and with a document of unique ID
then first name is Mohamed and the last
name is Maddy so you can see here and
this is the random ID generated by
firebase file store if you want to use
your custom ID for your document then
you can do it easy let me show you how
you can do that head over to the home
row ts file and let's use talk right
right and inside this dog you can
specify your document name custom
document name first person and you need
to use set method right so put dot here
so this is the method which you can do
it to use your custom document name
I have connection with the name persons
and I want the document as first person
and I want to set the first name and
last name in the document and let's save
it and let's see the preview inside the
browser not in the browser now let's see
the preview inside the firebase console
but it is refreshing right let's head
over to the you can see here first
person with the name Muhammad and Mehdi
then if you want to update this names
this document then you need to use the
update method instead of using set
method update
right let's use syed mohammed and say
yet mohammed maybe so we have two
objects key value pairs inside our
document let's save it and let's
reference application unstack this you
are seeing the beauty of stylus right it
feels like you are working on visual
studio code and it is very easy to debug
the errors right you can see here the
sayeth Mohammed and Sayed Mohammed Maddy
has been appeared inside the document
first person so we have a collection
with the named persons and we have two
documents first person and the next one
is it a unique ID so hope you understand
about the cloud store and hope you enjoy
