from epic op and today we are going to
see how we can build a simple ionic 2
app in Visual Studio 2015 15 before we
dive in I would like to walk you through
the architecture of ionic app how you
can create files and how you can manage
pages in your application and how you
can create a simple ionic 2 app in
Visual Studio 2015 so let's get started
with this so I'm going to open in a
solution Explorer and I would like to
show you how the how is the architecture
of ionic 2 looks like in the visual
studio 2015 so you are observing here
that there are some folders called
dependencies so if you are a beginner
then you have to know about the NPM and
Bauer as well and you have to know about
how dependencies works in ionic 2 and I
angular 2 applications so this folders
for the dependencies you can manage the
packages using nuget package manager in
your application so this folder is for
the MPN and this is for the power so
inside you can see that ionic one point
3.0 it's a bower dependency package
which is installed in this application
so we gonna explore this file this
folder called app this is your route
component of your root file of your
ionic 2 app this file will be called
first and this file will holds will
contain the entire typescript format of
your application so this is stabbed OTS
file and inside this hooks you can
some files for your applications which
are being important for your for this
application so we will talk about this
later and this is the folder for merges
and this folder holds all the plugins
which you want to use in your ionic 2
app as in my case I have few plugins
installed in my application you can see
here Cordova plug-in console Cordova
plug-in device splash screen splash
screen status bar whitelist and all so
we have different plugins installed in
this application and as I only provides
native functionality it also provides
native functionality plugins as well you
can explore the camera you can explore
the file system file explorer system all
stuff you can manage at you all stuff
you can manage in your ionic 2
application else as you can see here it
provides and it provides entire native
functionality you can create this app
and you can run this app on all
platforms like iOS Android and Windows
so I have given a brief introduction on
ionic toe in my last video don't forget
to watch my previous video on
introduction to ionic 2 and we'll move
on and we'll see what these folders will
be useful and when we will use these
folders in your in our application and
how it is useful for us you can see here
these are some resources which contains
three sub folders for Android iOS and
for windows so we will talk about this
later this is not the part of this video
and you can see here scss so you might
have heard about SAS and less they are
CSS preprocessors which preprocessor
preprocess your CSS and will
this file dot SCSS a render CSS or you
can say preprocess CSS and it renders in
your application it gets rendered in
your application so what is the you
might be wondering what what's the
advantage of using SAS you can use SAS
and you can create some cool stuff in
SAS files like variables you can store
your you can store your CSS you can
store your stylings in variables so this
is the major advantage of using SAS in
your application as ionic 2 is
supporting SAS we have to use dot and
CSS format files in our application you
could also use CSS but SAS is most
preferable in ionic 2 apps and in
angular 2 apps as well so we will talk
about this later as and we'll move to
the next folder called Taipings inside
this we have a global folder and in www
folder we have one subfolder called CSS
inside that we have style dot CSS and
two more different files for CSS as well
so this is my index dot HTML inside this
I am going to create a simple
application as this index dot HTML file
will be called first by any project if
you are building any project then index
dot HTML will get call first so I am
going to create a simple application in
a way to this is our first
application in ionic as you're seeing
here we are building it from scratch and
we'll give the title of this application
as yvm after that I'm gonna give as you
can see here ion is the previous prefix
of all tags all custom tags so you can
easily differentiate that these tags I
on header I on nav bar I on title these
all tags are custom ionic tags which
looks like HTML tags but they are not
stable tax actually they are ionic tags
so this is the power of ionic you can
use HTML tags as custom tags to create
your application you can see here we
have different kinds of custom tags and
this header is the header and inside
this header we have in nav bar and we
have a tighter title under the nav bar
and this is the body content of the page
you can say inside this content i'm
gonna give I on list inside this list
I'm going to keep eye on item our first
item will be ionic toe as we are doing
it on ionic I'm going to copy this items
and we'll change this name to angular
and we'll change this name to node.js
and will give a new name to this what
you can say SAS react
you can see here we have different items
in this list so you may be asking what i
am doing here i am gonna am creating one
file i am creating one list not file i
am creating one list inside this index
dot HTML page and i am giving few items
in that list like ionic to angular to
notice as reactants and this one will be
mean stack so let's save this
application and let us run this
application on ripple Lexus Nexus S
emulator so our application is running
now we'll explore ionic framework docs
if you are a newbie if you are a
beginner then I would highly suggest you
to visit this website to get started
with ionic which is ionic framework calm
or you can also visit ionic dot IO so
this website provides all components of
ionic as you can see here we have
different kind of action sheets
different kinds of components in ionic
and also we have custom tags in ionic
you can see here alerts
so it is giving in a different way so if
you want this if you want a source code
of this ionic components then you can
click this demo source button open in a
new tab so this is the website for ionic
you can get started with ionic if you
are a beginner or if you are a newbie
then you can start from here so this
this on this page we have two files this
is this file this two files are on
github so you can open pages or TS 5 i'm
going to close this so these are the two
files which you can use to create alerts
like this the basic show alert show
basically if you want to create the show
basically message box then you can copy
this code from github as you can see
here our application is still running it
might take some time to get compiled so
i'm going to close this and i'm going to
move on to the next section called
prompt alerts you can see here prompt
alerts it is in green color and it has
some different functionality they can
see here when whenever user tries to log
in this kind of model boxes or this kind
of popups will be used we'll move to the
next one also confirm alert agree or
disagree so these are the basic
components or these are the basic
components of ionic you can use in your
ionic 2 app our application is ready now
we can
we can hop to the chrome and we'll see
how it looks like and you can see here I
have my list which I have given in the
application it is running in the Dom
Explorer index it is running in Dom
ann'dra Dom Explorer you can see here
the index dot HTML will be called forced
so we have created one header and one
ion content tag or container you could
say inside that I have given a list of
items and you can see here our
application is running fine on ripple
Nexus S emulator so you could use google
android emulator as well to run your
application but it needs and right and
you could also run your application you
could also run ionic up ABS on Mac as
well so this is the simple application
which we have created using ionic 2 hope
