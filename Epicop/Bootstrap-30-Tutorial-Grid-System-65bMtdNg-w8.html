tutorial of bootstrap in our previous
videos we have seen how to create nav
bars menus and lot more stuff about
bootstrap so in this video I would like
to show you basic bootstrap grid system
so let's get started what is a great
system a grid is basically a system that
is used to create make responsive web
pages a grid contains a container that
is wrapper for all rows and container
class is used for taking container div
tag element it's an HTML element div
element and container class contains
rows in columns let's talk about rows
and columns rows are the rare layers of
all the columns each row contains two
and different columns and rows can be
represented by row class column can be
identified by column class and column
can be of different sizes that are
excess extra small devices SM small
devices MD for medium devices and LG for
large devices I would like to show you
the screen resolutions of this classes
on this website that is get bootstrap
com it is version four it is in alpha so
visit this website to know more things
about bootstrap and this is the
container rows columns which I have
already shown you in this video let's
talk about the screen resolutions the
extra small devices are having screen
resolution which is less than 576 pixels
and the small devices are having greater
than or equals to 576 pixels medium
devices are of greater than 760
768 pixels large devices are of greater
than 992 pixels and extra large or of
greater than or equals to 1200 pixels so
this is the classes column sm4 small
column md for medium column LG for large
in column excel for extra large so these
are the basic things of rows and columns
in great system and how you can set the
column with this is the basic things if
you want to know more about bootstrap
you can visit this website and you can
get started with it this is the
important point break points break
points in the columns should be taken
exactly to avoid the next things towards
the errors this is the stacked or
horizontal column and rose so these are
some other things which are which I am
NOT going to cover in this video so now
I would like to show you how to create a
grid system that contains that contains
rows and columns let's start it let's
get started take container here in this
container I would like to take a row in
this row I would like to take a column
the column for extra small devices
column XS let's stay 3 now let's say
extra put extra small devices let's copy
this
column is sit down here as I am taking
each column is of three columns so and
we need to take only four columns
because each column is of three columns
you could take any other number also but
I am taking three columns so let's hop
to the browser changes this is next this
is for the extra small devices you can
see here this is this column is of three
columns and this one also this one and
the last one also so as I said in the
introduction part that each row contains
to our different columns you need to
divide in divide those columns you
divide those columns equally so let's
change this extra small devices too
small hope you understand about the
small devices now I am showing about
extra small devices remove extra from
here H save hop to the browser refresh
you can see here it is showing small
devices this is for the small devices
and let's take em d for medium devices
here to understand how medium devices
will work let's change this me small to
medium copy down this text paste it down
here replay small with medium it's safe
up to the browser and hit refresh button
yeah it is showing that this is for the
medium devices and this page
is the response if you can see here all
the columns are responsive and the text
also the text is not overlapping with
each other it is working fine as we are
using medium device so this could be the
screen resolution for medium device
which is greater than or equals to 768
pixels which I have shown you in the
earlier part of this lesson so let's
change this medium to LG for large
devices to see how large devices will
work this we are using to make it more
responsive copy down this text paste it
here it's safe safe the changes up to
the browser refresh yeah you can see
your large devices it is showing let's
minimize this browser the columns are
also fine this is the size of small
devices smartphones you can say this
could be the screen resolution for
smartphones and this is for the medium
devices for the tablets smart tablets
maximizes and this would be the this
could be the screen resolution for large
devices for the desktops hope you
understand about the grid system if you
want to know more about bootstrap visit
this website get bootstrap calm to get
started with it hope you like this video
