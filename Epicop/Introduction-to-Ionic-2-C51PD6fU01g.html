Sakhalin and today I'm gonna give you a
brief introduction on ionic 2 so you may
be asking what is I only 2 and what it
is used to create which type which kind
of mobile apps you will be will using
ionic 2 so you can create hybrid mobile
apps using ionic it's a popular
framework hybrid mobile framework you
you could create mobile apps which runs
on all operating systems like Android
Windows and iOS so we will see the brief
introduction of it basically you can
build apps with web technology like HTML
CSS and JavaScript and you know and love
it is free and open source and it is
fully cross-platform and it has premiere
native plugins like camera the file
system of phones all things all native
things are present in ionic framework
you could access those native plugins
easily and it has a first class
documentation as well this is the ionic
2 stats 8.5 millions in funding 8.5
million dollars in funding that's a lot
of money and there are almost 4 million
million apps running on ionic framework
and there are 29 thousand stars on
github top 40 OSS project and we'll see
a quick introduction to ionic 2 ionic 2
is built on top of angular angular is a
popular framework by Google to create
cross-platform web applications so it is
build on top of angular code your apps
in J's JavaScript that is ACMA script
fight which uses the standard of Equus
es 5 or typescript and it leverages with
all popular task runners like gulp grunt
and lot more and it suppose it supports
all CSS pre compilers like sass less s
CSS and it has a custom HTML tags with
full control I will show you in the next
video how we can use the custom and
steamin tags in ionic 2 and it
integrates with Apache Cordova whenever
you run your ionic app Apache Cordova
will run your app in the backend so
aperture Cordova it's it is like
compiler between your application and
the hardware so it runs your ionic app
on the machine now we will see you might
be wondering what is typescript
typescript is a superset of JavaScript
and it has a standard it has standard
sets of attributes like classes
functions and all it is a superset of
JavaScript it compiles J's to the clean
J's output and it will be easier with
typescript to build fully functional
apps typescript is being used in ionic
apps nowadays so typescript is a best
language to get started with ionic now
we'll see how we can code in typescript
and what is the syntax of typescript so
this is the difference between
typescript and JavaScript so on the left
side you can see here this is the
typescript part and this one is the
JavaScript part so if you are a web
developer then you must know about the
JavaScript if you know JavaScript then
easily you can understand what is
typescript and how it works and what are
the main objectives of typescript
so using this way you can create your
class in typescript class demo I have
created one class called demo here and I
am giving a variable called message
which is of type string
this colon represents the type of the
variable which is string now and I am
creating a pun constructor in the class
and I'm giving a parameter called info
which is of type string again and this
dot message in this message I am storing
this information and now I am calling a
function called show and I am returning
hello plus this dot message so this way
you can write your code in typescript so
this is all up this was all about the
type script now let's move on to the
JavaScript part I am creating one
variable called demo inside that
variable I am calling an anonymous
function and inside this function and
inside that anonymous function I am
calling a function called show and this
dot message equals to info this is the
normal variable in JavaScript and I am
returning
hello plus this dot message so this is
the difference between JavaScript and
typescript so this is the little
introduction to typescript we'll see
later how it works and how we can use
typescript in our ionic applications so
let's move on and we'll talk about the
Cordova plugins as I have said that
Cordova has a native functionality of
all operating systems like Android iOS
and Windows you could access the camera
you could access the file system of
mobiles it has a native API as well
these are some features of Cordova
plugins like these are few plugins of
Cordova which which covers battery
camera contacts GPS and file system and
there are a lot more plugins available
in a patch of Cordova and you can also
push notifications which is native
notifications and it has some different
functionality as well like vibration and
in-app purchases let's move on to the
next slide and we'll talk about ionic
tools ionic tools have two major tools I
have any creator and another
is ionic cloud using ionic creator you
can create your ionic apps online which
is present at the website called ionic
creator com just simply you need to drag
and drop all the native elements are
present in ionic creator after creating
your ionic app on ionic creator you
could download and you could zip that
file and you could import that zip file
to the Visual Studio 2015 and you could
you could get started with that so this
was about the ionic creator ionic cloud
ionic cloud host your ionic apps to the
cloud you could run your ionic apps to
the iron on the ionic cloud as well so
these are the two major import these are
the two major ionic tools which you
could use while creating your ionic apps
so let's move on to the next slide and
we will see the app which is built on
ionic this is one application called
pixie Phi which is build using ionic and
we will see the architecture of ionic
app in Visual Studio 2015 as you can see
here this is index dot HTML which will
which will be the entry point for your
ionic application so I'm gonna open the
solution Explorer and I'm going to show
the architecture of ionic app as you can
see here all dependencies which is
divided in two sub categories called
Bower and n p.m. so this is the part of
dependencies you could plug your
dependency under this section and you
can see here the app folder inside this
app folder you have one file called ab
dot TS this is the main file of your
application which runs or which will be
called first so this is your root file
of your project you can say so these are
some hooks we'll talk about this later
these are the mergers and as I have
shown you in the introduction part about
the plugins so plugins folder contains
all plugins which is installed in this
project so I have this plugins installed
in my project you can see here plug-in
console plug-in device plugins splash
screen status bar whitelist and keyboard
ionic plug-in keyboard so these are few
plugins which I have installed in my
project and these are this is the
resource resources folder inside this
you can see three different sub folders
one for Android and another for iOS and
the last one is for the windows so as
ionic creates hybrid mobile apps this
resources maintains all those three
folders which needs to be run on all
operating systems and this is the folder
of scss and inside this we have our CSS
of this ionic app and this is the
Taipings folder and under that we have
one folder called Global's and inside
that flow folder I have angular Cordova
co2 ionic ionic and jQuery jQuery this
folder is the jQuery Mobile framework
which is used to create responsive
dynamic and fully functional mobile apps
so dub-dub root this is the main folder
which will be called first for the CSS
for the images and for the J's as you
can see here we have four different
folders inside this
ww root folder and inside this also we
have a folder called index dot HTML as I
have said this will be called first and
this will be the entry point of your
application as well and these files are
pretty important for your project to run
you
project on the mobile app ball dot Jason
this file also contains the dependencies
which will be needed for this project
and the Equador Jason this one is pretty
important for your project as this file
contains dependencies and Cordova CLI
version part so for our CLI command line
interface you can create Cordova apps
using command line as well which is
called over CLI so this tack or adjacent
file contains that version of Cordova
CLI and we have package dot Jason inside
this we have all dependencies installed
if you want to install any dependencies
just go ahead to this file and give the
name of that dependency and select the
version of that so this is the package
dot JSON file and also we have Cordova
plugins installed here and the Cordova
platforms as well Android iOS and
Windows and so this is the architecture
