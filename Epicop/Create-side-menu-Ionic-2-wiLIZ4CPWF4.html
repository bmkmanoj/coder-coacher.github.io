I am selfish a claim and today I'm going
to show you how to create side menu in
ionic 2 so before we get started we have
the two pages that are home page and the
contact page as you can see here this is
the home dot HTML and another one is
contact on HTML so these are the two
pages which I am going to put in my side
menu and I'm going to show you how to
create a side menu so this is the
official ionic website called ionic
framework calm and here you can see that
you have starter templates when you
first create your app then you should
use this command called ionic start your
app name and start the template in this
starter template we have the side menu
starter template as well but we are not
going to do in this way we are going to
create a side menu in our anak 2 app but
not using the starter template so let's
get started so here are the two files
home dot HTML and the contact dot HTML
so if you want to create the side menu
then the three important files you need
to remember and that files are add dot
HTML your root file of your ionic app
and another one is f dot module
tortillas and the third one is a block
component or T's so these are the three
important files you need to use for
creating the side menu in your ionic 2
ad so as you can see here I have iron
app the root page is set to the home
page inside Abdur component of tea as
you can see here and I have also
imported the contact page in AB dot
component of TS and also in AB dot
module dot es here are the two pages
page and contact page important inside
these two files so if you create a new
page then you need to import your page
inside these two files it is necessary
to it is necessary to import or include
this pages inside these two files for
creating your side menu so after
importing these two pages I have
assigned these two pages in the enve
module decorator and also in the entry
components added as you can see here so
after importing all these pages you need
to set the view child you might be
wondering what is view child view child
is a property which is used to set the
child of a navigation bar or a lap bar
here I can show you how you can do that
add delete view child and inside this
you are passing your nap create nap of
type nap so this way you can use the
view child for the side menu after
giving this save and then back to the
has a broad HTML file in this AB dot
HTML file I'm going to create my menu
using a own menu
side equals to write the side of the
menu will be position to left but it
opens from the right side and the
content should be equals to content then
I'm going to show you in the later part
of this video and inside this a on menu
let's create an on header and inside
this I on header let's create an on to
log and inside this and put bar let's
create I on title and inside this I am
title you could give your title called
side menu
after completing with the I on header
part
let's move towards the eye on content
our main content will be present inside
this ion content element inside this
create I'm going to create a on list and
inside this ion list let's create a on
item
and give the click event and say go to
home and let's leave the item name as
home page or home you would give
anything let's copy this ion item and
paste it down here and say go to contact
and let's rename this to contact as you
can see here I have two items present
inside my eye on list because I am going
to put these two faces inside my side
menu so I am taking only two items you
could take any number of items inside
your side menu but here in my case I am
taking only two pages and I am assigning
those two items with the two methods
called go to home and go to contact so
hit safe and soft the Abdur component or
TS and make sure that you have imported
the two pages before creating side menu
in these two files and that files are AB
dot component or T's and F not AB dot
module dot es these are the two
important files which in which you need
to import the pages before creating side
menu and finally I'm going to create go
to method and I'm going to pass page and
I'm going to say this dot NASA dot set
route
homepage as you can see here when the
user clicks this item that is home item
inside the side menu this method will
get called which is present right here
in the app door component or TS and root
page will be set to the home page and if
the user clicks the contact item inside
the side menu
let's change is to contact and let's
remove this page as well because I am
not watching any parameter let's assign
this with contact page as you can see
here the green squiggle has gone away
because we have used this contact page
inside this method called go to contact
page when the user hits this item that
is contact item inside the side menu
this method will get cold and the nav
bar will be set to the contact page
let's save this all files and let's talk
to the project folder and let's use git
bash to run over ionic where I to run
our ionic app on ionic labs ionic serve
n - L this command will help you to run
your ionic app this might take some time
to run on the browser if you haven't
watched my previous video on
introduction to ionic then make sure to
watch that video and also I have shown
the components of ionic 2 and I have
ionic 2 tutorial CD playlist as well on
my youtube channel please subscribe and
share my videos as you can see our
application is compiling now and webpack
started will hop to the browser and
we'll see
so this is the official website for
Ayane if you want to get started and
then you kill me then you could visit
this website here are the dogs as well
it is still compiling the two dogs
present here framework and ionic
services if you are a big nerd and visit
this framework dogs for knowing the
components you have application is ready
now and it is running on ionic lab as
you can see here in the URL ionic - lab
this come on called ionic surf - L will
run your ionic app on ionic lab you can
see here I have side menu it is opening
from the right side as you can notice
here our our homepage this is our
homepage and when we click this contact
page will be redirect to the contact
page as you can see here I have a model
inside this and I have list of items so
is showing on all three platforms and
Windows Android and iOS and see here it
