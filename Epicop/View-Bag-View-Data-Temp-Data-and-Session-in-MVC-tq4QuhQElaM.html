today's video in this video I'm going to
show you some powerful features of
asp.net MVC application that are view
back view data temp data and session so
let's get started
firstly we gonna see what is view back
so I'll give you over view of view back
view back in MVC is a dynamic property
of controller base class which is used
to hold data it's a dynamic property
which is used to hold temporary data so
you can store any kind of temporary data
in this view back property and it is
used to pass information between a
controller and a view and it can be
accessed by a razor on a view page as
you can see here in the example given
below this is the example how you are
retrieving the data from a controller to
a view through you back view back so
this is all about Blueback let's move to
the next slide and let's talk about view
data it's a dictionary object it's not a
dynamic property as view back it's a
dictionary object which is also used to
store temporary data and it also uses to
pass data between a controller and a
view and it is similar to view back but
there is one difference between a view
back and a view data that is view back
doesn't require typecasting you don't
need to be typecast view back but view
data requires typecasting and view data
contains a string value pair which I
will show you in the example program
let's move to the next slide now we will
talk about temporary data M data it's
also a term a dictionary type derived
temp data dictionary class and temp data
in asp.net MVC is used to store
temporary data but there's one
difference between a view data and a
temp data the view data is used to pass
data from controller to a view but temp
data is used to pass data between two
controllers of as well as it works with
the redirects also if you want to
redirect to any particular action method
then them data you can use them data now
we will talk about session session is
similar to temp data session and temp
data are similar they both used to pass
data between two controllers and it also
works with redirects also so let's see
in the demo application firstly I'm
gonna create view back property in my
index action in home controller
let's give name as John in the next line
I will give you data property it's a
dictionary object as you can see here
string key you have to give string value
pair so let's give info as these objects
contains temporary data which is used to
pass from a controller to a view you can
give the email no not email some
information
Tony's a good person you can use this
view back property and view data on our
index view page
let's take temporary data and let's say
contact of John contact number I will
give one two three four five six and
I'll take the session now because this
is also a part of our chapter today's
tutorial so what we gonna take is let's
take an email ID off John and let's say
John at the rate gmail.com so we have
taken these all properties in our action
method now we will try to access these
properties on our view page because we
are in index action method so we need to
write we need to access these properties
on old index view page it is here let's
take a div tag let's say a container
bootstrap class and let's take h1 tag
and this is raiser at the rate symbol
represents razor razor so we are
accessing those objects those properties
from a controller to the view using this
razor
let's take view back dot name because we
have given this name here you can see
here view back dot name this one
let's take another has to tag another
hashtag that is has to tag and it's
access view data what we have given here
info copy this and paste it here and
let's run this application and let's see
how it looks on our browser will it
access on a view page or not let's see
it may take some time to load to get
compiled then till then I would like to
show you some interesting stuff to get
started with asp.net some of you may not
know about asp.net so if you want to
start with if you want to get started
with asp.net you can visit this site
asp.net its official website from
Microsoft you can download Visual Studio
from here and dotnet core is also
available you can get started with here
and this is also a good site C sharp
corner calm and MSDN is one of the
greatest sights I would like to suggest
you and this is my personal block that
is like geek m dot tech block tech dog
block I used to upload my new videos and
I used to post everything about asp.net
so you can visit this and you can follow
me on this block so our application is
ready by default it's on our home page
the asp.net runs the home page that is
index action here you can see below we
have
viewbag dot name property John and view
data info that is John is a good person
we can easily access that to properties
let's stop this application and I will
show you this I will I will show you
about the stem data and session because
stem data and session can't be accessed
on an index page because we are in we
are currently in index action method as
I said this time data and session walks
with redirects so it doesn't appear on
the index page so I I would like to
redirect this action method to an
another action that is contact
save this let's go to the contact action
method which is down here and what I'm
going to do is when I try to route my
application when I when I try to visit
to this index action method it redirects
to the contact page because of this line
it redirects to the action contact page
contact action method which is here and
our contact page
our contact view page is here so let's
try to access those temporary data
properties on this view page the name
should must match which I have given in
our controller that is contact and in
the next line I would like to access
session this as this is a spirited MVC
application we can access temporary data
and session properties with redirects
easily in asp.net core application we
may not we need to inherit some classes
so let's save this and let us run this
application
as it takes some time let's close this
previous tab
and I was showing you my personal block
you can visit this I have recently
uploaded one new post for is p.net core
and if you are a newbie then you can
visit this block and you can get started
with it and I have also given a quick
introduction on asp.net core you can see
this video let's we are currently on a
contact page and it is not showing our
temporary data and session data here
after the view back dot message these
lines are not rendering because we have
given those two properties temp data in
session in an action method in an index
action method so firstly we need to
redirect our application to the index
action method then afterwards it will it
will redirect to the contact page then
we can see the properties on our contact
view page so let's give index here and
it will redirect to our page as you can
see here before it is not showing it was
not showing now it is showing that the
contact number and email id which we
have given on our contact view page the
contact and an email ID so this is all
about the view back view data temporary
data and session in asp.net MVC
