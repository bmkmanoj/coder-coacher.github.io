the first asp.net code 1 point 0 MVC
application so that kids let's get start
the first MVC application now we'd like
to tell you something about MVC how the
structure of mbc is firstly we are going
to create a controller in this
application and then we'll create a
model at last we are going to create a
MVC view page let me explain you what is
MVC and how it works when we c stands
for Model View and controller as you all
know and let me explain you what the
controller model and view works how it
works so controller is used to handle
all incoming browser and user requests
when the user requests or the browser
when the user requests for something to
a browser that request is going to be
handled by the controller and the
incoming browser requests will also be
handled by the controller class and
model represents your application data
it holds all your business logic of your
application and view displays or show
data on the web page it is used to
display the data to the users so these
are some basic functionalities of MVC
app so let's explore this in the further
section of the video let's go down
now let's jump into the visual studio
and let's see how we can create
controller model and view so this is the
basic MVC application asp.net core 1.2
MVC app in this app I'm going to create
a controller first as you can see here
this is the controller's part so this is
the controller folder we need to create
a controller here just right click on
this folder and add
new item
as you can see here home controller is
also available in that folder let's
create another controller called them
demo controller you might be wondering
why I am giving controller along with
demo so let me clear this point here we
need to take controller if we are giving
the name of a controller we need to a
line or we need to merge the name
controller with the controller name
because of the naming convention it's a
naming convention you need to follow
this let's add this
in that demo controller one action
method will be there yeah you can see
here index method this is the action
method this demo controller is being
inherited from controller base class
this is the main class for all
controllers this is the controller and
this is inherited from controller class
and inside this controller you can see
here index action method and in inside
this index action method it is returning
a view it represents or it displays the
index view page on the browser so this
method is inherited from I actionresult
interface as you can see here when you
hover on this I actionresult you can see
it defines a contact that represent the
result of an action method it represents
the result of an action method this is
the view method means I am returning the
view of the page you can do other things
like you can redirect to another page or
you can redirect to some other action as
well redirect to action
he direct to action you can see here
just you need to give the name of that
action inside this quotations so in my
case I am giving view just because I
want to display the view of this index
page and you also have noticed that
inside this controller class we are
getting the index action method by
default just because every web
application first runs or first displays
the index page so this is the reason the
controller class is consist of index
method already so this part is the
controller part now I would like to show
you how to create a model in MVC
application go to the solution Explorer
and the controller the model folder is
not available in this application so we
need to create that by clicking the
source then add new no not new we need
to create a new folder hop to the
solution Explorer and rightly this Bank
app at
new folder you can see here give model
yeah this is the model folder inside
this i'm going to rename this model two
models inside this model folder i would
like to add my model let's add that
model you can see here class model it
model is just a class it represents your
application data I have said already
this point in my previous videos if you
forgot to watch my previous videos then
be sure and we'll watch my previous
videos like introduction to asp.net core
MVC and lot more stuff about entity
framework or as well so I'm going to
give my model name as contact or you can
give details yeah inside this model I
would like to create some properties
like and I have already shown this
feature in my previous videos of how to
create properties how what is the short
cut off creating properties in a model
just you need to tie prop and tap double
tap tap tap yeah you can create this
let's name this property as name let's
hear another property
called email let's read another property
called contact
save this and hop to the controller part
now I would like to call I would like to
access that model that details model in
my controller in my controller action
this is the index action method so I
want to access that detailed model so
type details here detail equals two new
details is showing error just because we
have to insert or we have to include the
using statement of them for the model
folders you can see here the yellow bulb
is displaying here click that yellow
bulb and include the using statement you
can see here using bank ab dot models we
need to include that using statement so
that our is gone now let's give property
names here like name equals to John
kana email equals two let's give john @
gmail.com comma contact equals to 1 2 3
4 5 6 so we have created the object for
details model and we have also assign
the variables are available also
assigned data to the properties of model
so now i would like to display this
model object this detail object in our
view so you need to pass that details
object inside this view method and you
have to create your view let's hop to
the solution Explorer now click the view
section add new folder called demo you
might be wondering why I am creating
this new folder called demo does because
we have created this action method
inside the demo controller class so we
need to give the demo view folder we
need to follow the naming convention
here the controller name and the view
name should match should be matched
should be similar it's a naming
convention I have created demo view
folder successfully and now I am going
to create view page inside this demo
folder right click on this folder add
new item
click asp.net here select MVC view page
you can see here the extension is see as
HTML just because it's a razor view page
it represents razor view page CSS demon
represents razor view page now I would
like to give details dot CSS tml my view
page is details or CSS HTML you can see
here already this file consists at the
rate symbol at the rate symbol
represents razor it's a part of razor it
represents razor now I would like to
call my models here model here that is
details model just you need to give
addie rate bank at dot models dot
details that's it now you can use this
model inside your view page to access
those properties those properties like
name email and contact which we have
created in the details model let's say
let's take a diff container here glass
container it's a bootstrap class I have
already shown this part in my previous
videos like introduction to bootstrap 3
don't forget to watch that videos and
inside this I would like to take another
div tag inside this tag let's take
classes row
it is showing some error here just
because we have given the folder name s
models model it should be modeled
mods details
at the rate bang cap dot is not showing
we have to rename this folder to models
Bank app dot
dot models not
it is not displaying the model folder
here we haven't saved this I think so
let's give the application name bank
have dot nod is displaying models dot
details details details the model

slap a semicolon not semicolon inside
this row I would like to display h1 tag
and inside this I would like to say my
name is my name is

it's April ID rate symbol represents
razor it is a part of razor engine model
I am doing some mistake here there're is
gone now we need to what i was doing
here is I was not including the model
part this is the model name this is the
model variable using this we can access
the details model add great model Bank
app this is the application name you can
see here Bank ab dot model fold models
inside this models we have only one
ordinary that is details now I would
like to display the name of that name

tag hey my name is Adelaide name and
irate model dot name you can see here
hey my name is Adelaide model dot name
this model using this model we can
access the name inside this quadrille
flush here you can see we have created a
name property
and now I would like to display email
address my email address is at the eight
model dot you can see here the
intelligence it's a beautiful and the
wonderful feature of asp.net actually
this is the feature of visual studio it
gives intelligence from that you can
select email property below this line i
would like to display the contact number
call me on at the gate model dot contact
so let's save this application and let's
run this application using i I s Express
it's a local host web server which is
used by visual studio to run the web
applications or to run the applications
on a local host machine so this was the
part of creating Model View and
controller and getting started with the
basic MVC app if you are a fresher if
you are a beginner then do follow my
steps to create a basic MVC application
and hope you understand the basic
structure or the basic architecture of
MVC application it is running on local
host port number double 538 to can see
here
I would like to give my controller name
/ details
we need to give controller name and
action name index demo demo and index
demo index
I did one mistake here while I was
creating the view page I have given the
name of the view page as details but in
my controller I have even index so it
will not work we need to rename the
details view page here to the index now
it will work let's run this application
again let's see how it will work or not
let's see if the controller named Emma
index action method hit enter then this
application will be redirected to the
index view page you can see here this is
the footer part which I have given in my
layout this is the layout of the entire
web app you can set up your basic things
which you are going to access in your
entire web application so for that you
need to give some thing inside this
layout dot CSS HTML it represents the
layout structure for your web app so you
can see here my name is John which I
have given in my controller and my email
address John @ d @ gmail.com and the
contact number hope you understand the
MVC application architecture and how to
create your first MVC app so please
