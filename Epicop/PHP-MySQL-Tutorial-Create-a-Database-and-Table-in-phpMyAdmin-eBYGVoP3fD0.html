mousseline from epic op and now I'm
gonna show you how to create database in
PHP my admin dashboard and how you can
insert data in to your data tables so
let's get started so I have easy PHP
installed on my localhost as you can see
it works like Sam or ramp server and
this is very flexible and it is very
easy to use easy PHP you can visit easy
PHP website to get started with easy PHP
so this is the site is easy PHP dot or
you can visit this website and you can
download easy PHP localhost web server
from this website so I have installed
easy PHP on my local host and this these
are few working directories on my list
so I have created one project called
MySQL app in this project I'm going to
show you how you can create your
database and how you can insert data
into a database database tables so this
is the PHP my admin dashboard which is
present here at the bottom of this page
my sequel administration so I have
opened this in a new tab there you can
see here I have one database called
client script so I have created this
earlier if you want to create a new one
you could you could click a new there
you can give your database name and
inside this you can select you you fc8
utf-8 yeah you can see here utf-8 you
can select so I haven't I have created
one database here called client script
so inside this client script I'm gonna
create a new table called forced table
you could give any name but I am giving
here first table hit go so yeah you can
see here we have to give the column
names in this data table so obviously
the first column name would be ID and
the data type of this ID would be
integer and the default type should be
none here should be select you should
select none here and here not here here
you should select in the null in this
value right you you have to select
primary that yeah it means that you are
indicating this column as your primary
key in this data table it is of type
integer and it is a primary key in this
table don't forget to click or don't
forget to check this box this represents
auto increment as you can see here when
you hover on this it it is showing that
it is it auto increments the value of
this ID column don't forget to check
this box and here I'm gonna give name
and I'm gonna select where care and the
length you might you may give any value
but in my case I'm giving 64 and select
null only the value of your primary key
called ID should be selected none here
in the default tab section but in other
columns it should be none the default
value should be null remember this
important point while creating your
database tables so leave this all fields
as it is next we'll create another
column called H and select integer as it
is integer or you could select any data
type called worker also but in my case I
am selecting I am giving integer value
and the size of this is 12 let's give
another email another column name called
email and select this as we're cat and
the size of this would be 64 and you're
all done now I have four field or have
four columns in my database in in this
data table called
force table and the four fields and the
four columns are ID name age and email
ID is the primary key and it is auto
incremented and the next column is name
age next columns are name age email and
heat-safe so it will save your data
table you can see here when you click
this first table this is the structure
we have four keys or four values for
fields in this dinner table now we have
created our table successfully let's hop
to the sublime text editor there we can
create or there we can establish
connection with the database called
client script and the table is first
table so I have my details in this file
like server username password database
name so
I'm just copying this all fields here
and I am pasting in my in my file called
index dot PHP let's comment out these
all statements so let me explain you
this so server this represents your
localhost server in my case this is my
server one twenty seven point zero point
zero point one this is my server
localhost webserver and the user is
ruled in my case and if you have given
any user name then you could use your
given username in this variable called
user and the password I didn't set any
password to my database or to my PHP my
admin so I am giving null and my
database name DB name is client script
you can see here I have given my
database name as client script and
finally we are creating one variable for
connecting to the database this is the
variable connect and inside this
variable we are passing four parameters
using MySQL I procedure so if you want
to know more about MySQL MySQL I you
could visi w3schools for the brief
introduction of MySQL there are lot of
ways to connect to the database but I am
using my SQLite you could also use MySQL
so w3schools is the best place for you
if you are a newbie or if you are a
beginner then do follow this website for
creating your databases so in my case I
am using MySQL I procedure and I'm
passing four parameters inside this
MySQL object called server user password
and the last is database name so after
passing is all parameters and
the connection is established or not if
connect has if the connect object has
some errors then I'm displaying that
connection field if our connection gets
established to the if our connection
gets established to the database then I
am displaying success message
successfully established so let's save
this and let's run this in the browser
and we'll see how it works yes you can
see here let me give on break time here
and let's refresh this again yeah as you
can see here our connection gets
successfully established to the database
called client script now it's time for
inserting some data into the first table
database table which we have created in
client script database so after checking
the connection of the database will
write one curie called on Curie for the
insert insert into table name your table
name is our table name in in our case is
first table and let me give name age
comma the last one is email we have
three fields we have three columns we
are giving three columns inside the
first table and we are assigning these
all values with the values which we are
which we are going to give you call the
name is ybm
we can give any name like John the age
will be 15 and the email address
let's give it as John at the rate
gmail.com
so let's store this query inside SQL
variable and let's say if this connector
variable one object is there called
query inside this I am checking that
this if this query is executed
successfully then we can display one
message called successfully inserted
true it is true if over connect I'm
executing my query here connect query
this is the object of connect object
inside this object I am passing my query
called SQL if it is equals to true if it
is equals to true
pretty girls too true then we will
display one message called successfully
inserted
if we got or if we get any errors then
we'll display the SQL error
or we can say error inserting data error
inserting data let's save this and let's
hop to the browser and we'll see it is
working fine or not yes our data gets
successfully and inserted now we'll hop
to the PHP my admin dashboard and we'll
see if there is an if there any data is
there yes we have the ID is 1 and the
name of of the person is John and the
ages 15 and email address is John
Adelaide gmail.com
we have successfully inserted our data
in this table let's run this query again
by dealing some different values called
mark and the age will be 20 let's remove
John from here and let's give Margaret
gmail.com let's save this and let's swap
to the browser and we'll refresh it
again to see that the message the work
the query is executing fine or not yes
it is executing successfully inserted
now we'll hop to the PHP my admin
dashboard will refresh now you can see
here our ID is auto incrementing you can
see here the ID gets changed to 2 in the
next row the IDS to name is marked and
the age is 20 and email addresses mark
at the red gmail.com so hope you
understand about the database in PHP
myadmin and how you can insert data data
into your data tables or database tables
using easy PHP web server or you can you
you can create database in your example
ramp servers a vamp servers as well
but in my case I have installed easy PHP
because I love easy PHP so this way you
can create your databases and you can
insert
and you can insert data into database
tables so don't forget to subscribe my
