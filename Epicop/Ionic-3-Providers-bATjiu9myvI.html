Musa column from a pickup and today I'm
going to show you how you can create
providers in ionic 3 so before we get
started I would like to give a quick
introduction of providers and how you
can use providers where you can and how
it is helpful for you while developing
your ionic app provider means it just
provides you the services if you need
any operation if you need any particular
operation in your app then you could use
providers so we will see one simple
example of it in our ionic application
and how you can use this I'll show you
in the later part of this video first
let me create a simple method called
Lord contacts right in this method I'm
gonna load I'm gonna give a list of
contacts that we can use on our template
home rod sgml so we are doing this
without without VR dude we are doing
this without using any provider I will
show you how you can use providers for
doing this operation in the later part
of this video first we'll do without
providers right so let's create contacts
array here of type any sorry I need to
give
right so this is our array contacts
array and we can use this inside our
array inside this array inside this
method so we'll give title as anything
you can give like right let me give on
contact number here we'll give it as
seven eight six
let's give let's copy this object paste
it here one more time one more time
right so this is our simple array
contacts array in which we have given
title and contact as two objects right
so let's change this to some other name
like north you can give this and you can
give this name vanish right so we have
given four titles here let's change the
number to one two three four five six
seven eight and let's change this to
nine one zero two right so let's save
this and we'll see how we can use this
inside the home dot HTML file so let's
create one ion list let's remove this
part here inside this I unless I'm gonna
use an item oh sorry
so I'm gonna use one structural
directive as you know that we have to
loop here so definitely we need to use
structural directive let contact of
contacts
contacts now we'll use the binding part
here contact dot title let's copy this
and let's paste it here
contact dot contact as you can see here
we have created one simple method load
contacts and which and we have also
created one an array in which we have
given 2 objects title and contact this
thing these two things we are loading
here in our template using structural
directive in z4 and let's save this and
let's run in our browser to see the
preview of this application and you can
use this in your providers as well
I'll show you how you can do this using
provider so after seeing the preview of
this application we can go ahead and we
can see about providers and services so
I'm not going to use any service or I am
not calling any service from using HTTP
module because it's just a simple
example of providers you can explore
more about providers on documentation of
angular or ionic so I would suggest you
to visit the documentation let's see the
preview of our application first it is
running now and it might take some time
to load my laptop is bit slow right so
this is just a simple example you know I
have created right it is running now and
webpack started
so you can generate your provider your
custom provider using one command called
ionic ji provider and your provider name
these times for generate so I'll use
that command in the way in the next step
of the video and I'll show you again how
you can generate provider it is almost
done and now it will start rendering on
ionic labs
copy finish as you can see here on git
bash CLI now a local host is ready now
our application is running angular that
IO is the beautiful documentation you
know you need to visit if you are a
beginner as you can see here ma I have I
have selected only one platform that is
Android it is not loading you know I did
a simple mistake here I have created
that method but I did not use one method
called I on view did load whenever our
view is ready this method will get
called first we need to save this so
that it will render all things inside
load contacts method so we need to save
this I was showing you the documentation
part of angular you can visit this
documentation to know more about
providers components and more about
angular right you can see in the modules
syllabic line routing navigation there
are bunch of tutorials or as well
of angular it is taking much time it
might take some time and I really
appreciate your patience it is taking
time right
our ready our application is ready here
you can see here we can see the title
and the phone number in the list form
which we have given in ohms or HTML file
in this file so let's just create a
provider for doing the same operation
let's stop this let's create ionic G
provider contacts right let's hit enter
now so it will generate a new provider
for us inside our project we can see a
separate folder for providers in our
solution Explorer right after using
after generating provider we need to
give we need to import that provider
inside app dot module or TS file because
it's a root module of your application
of your ionic application yeah it is
generated now and we can see providers
right inside providers we have contacts
so as we are not dealing with the server
part as we are not calling anything from
server so we do not need a SCDP
module so we need to get rid of this
right so let's remove this comment part
as well
let's remove this
parameter from constructor save this and
let's open app dot module dot ES and
there we can import our from providers
slash contacts it is not showing we need
to open this file
yeah contacts provider you know in an ik
tree we need to give this but in ionic
to yeah it is already present you know
we need yeah we have imported our
contacts provider inside app dot module
dot ES file let's save this and let's
copy this method which is load contacts
method and let's head the contact or TS
file let's copy this here and let's copy
this contacts array let's give it here
above constructor we need to import
provider inside home dot html' horn or
TS file as well as we are using it to
load the provider you know providers
slash contacts it is not showing I think
we need to use it is not showing we need
to use provider right so we can use this
provider inside home dirtiest file so
all right actually I need to give this
same statement inside this so that we
can use yeah you can see here we need to
enter to direct enter into two
directories and after entering we can
use providers contacts and also contacts
so using this method we can import our
contacts provider inside home rod st a
home not es file and also we need to
create an instance using this method
using this way public contacts service
of type contacts provider so we can use
this and you can use this here right so
we have imported our provider inside
Umbra ts file and also we have created
in we have created an instance we have
passed a parameter in constructor and we
can use this inside ion viewdidload
right
so after doing these all things we need
to save this we need to save this let's
head to home dot HTML file and let's
make some changes right because it did
not it might not load on the screen
because we have changed the way as we
are using provider here so we need to
use this contact service dot contacts
right let contact of contact service
which is our in sense of provider dot
contacts means this array so let's save
this all files and let's run this
application yeah as you can notice here
we are doing this using provider but
earlier we did not use any provider to
do that operation to perform that
operation so let's see how we can use
provider how we can perform this
operation using this provider so our
application is running now and it is
still running because web packs has been
started now so it might take some time
to load on the screen yeah copy finish
now our localhost server will start
right now we will see the list of
contacts which we have created inside an
array in provider yeah you can see here
we can see a list of contacts which we
have given in our provider so this is
the simple way of using provider in your
application and you can perform any
operation because providers provide
and service to you so you can use that
service inside your era kneecap so hope
you understand about providers in ionic
3 because I have just shown you the
simple example toy of how you can use
providers thanks for watching this video
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
