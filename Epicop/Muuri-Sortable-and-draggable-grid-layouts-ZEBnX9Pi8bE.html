are doing great today and it is Sunday
so I would like to show you some
interesting and cool cool thing and cool
stuff and that is Marie you might be
wondering what is this it it allows you
to create responsive sortable filterable
and draggable grid layouts
it's a beautiful library let me show you
the demo here the grid demo you can see
here the grid layout
it is beautifully placed on the screen
and if you want to sort it out if you
just want only the red color grid boxes
then you can select red it only shows
the red boxes and if you want blue then
it will show you blue and it is green so
you can also sort it by the title wise
or by the color wise right right the
color is disabled the drag is disabled
you can see here we have selected color
drag disabled if you want this grid
boxes to be draggable then you can
select drag so that you can drag it
anywhere on the screen it it allows you
to drag the grid boxes and you can also
sort this grid layout durst
from the left top or from the left top
fill gaps right and even you can select
some different options so you can
explore more about this on this side on
this side of movie right let me show you
the another demo of Marie it allows you
to create kind of to-do lists which you
can create inside your application or
anything if you are building a cool
project right it'll it allows you to
create a to-do list and even you can
place the items of one list into another
right to do working and done you can see
here it's a beautiful library and the
features are very easy and you can
understand it allows customizable layout
and it also allows us
drag and drop facility as we can as we
have seen above this drag and drop
facility right but it needs it needs
some dependencies like hammers yes right
and even it provides the extensive API
so that we can use inside our project
right and the next feature is the fast
animations and it also needs one
dependency one library that is web
animations so basically it needs two
dependencies the first one is hammer JS
for drag-and-drop capability for
drag-and-drop feature and the next one
is fast animations it needs web
animations dependency and it it is it
provides good browser support and it is
fully response ORS and MIT licensed
right so let me show you how you can use
this movie library inside your project
so let's jump over to the github
documentation of Marie you can see it is
a beautiful magical JavaScript layout
engine that allows you to build all kind
of layouts so we'll see how we can use
that right if you want to use inside
your project then you can use this
Syrian links right the Syrian links or
you can install Murray using NPM or
Bower but I would suggest you to use NPM
not Bower right so we'll use the Syrian
link here inside our application first
right let me let me oh sorry
script so we are not going to use this
type attribute we'll use source equals
to the CDN link source equals to not
source equals to this we'll paste this
script tag because we have already
copied from the from the Murray
documentation so it is a cen link of
Murray now the next step is we have to
install two dependencies and there are
hammer JS and web
nations we can it is showing us to
include this three script tags in our
application because we have not
installed and we have not installed
these two dependencies through NPM we'll
use these two dependencies from CDN zsy
first one is the first one is web
animation CDN right we can find it web
animations CDN on CD and GS calm it is a
beautiful side that divides everything
every CDN link so we'll use the minified
version this one CD and GS minified
version will copy this link and we'll
paste it above the movie script will you
will remove this type attribute and
we'll say source equals to this one
right the first one is web animations
and in the middle we'll paste the hammer
JS dependency so let's close this tab
and let's find the hammer J's CDN right
we can find it here we'll use the
minified version hammer j as it is not
showing the hammer j as it is hammer
time probably and we have surged hammer
j s CDN right hammer yes here we can
find the link and we'll paste it here in
this script tag right source equals to
the minified version this one the second
link right let's paste it here so we
have three dependent we have three links
the first one is web animation serial
link the second one is hyper JS and the
last is the Mori serial link so now we
will see how we can get started with
Maree on the documentation let's close
these tabs here you can see here after
this all-star script tags inside our
application we can see how we can get
started with this we need to add this
markup in our HTML file and that is this
grid right so let's copy and paste it
here as you can see here it is a class
of the DIF with the class of great and
inside item we have item content and
this is the text right let's save this
and let's see the preview inside the
browser it is showing but it is not the
draggable or some sort able items so we
need to create that so let's remove this
and let's say first first write we can
say first this is our first grid right
let's remove this one and let's say
second so copy this items create five
right let's change this to third and
this one to fourth and the last one to
fifth right so we have three items
inside our grid as you can see here let
me see let me check yeah I got this I
got this here so here we were doing
wrong let's refresh this and it is not
showing so we have five items in our
grid so let's make it draggable and
sortable right let's make it draggable
using marie so on the documentation you
can see here after adding this markup we
need to add these tiles inside our CSS
so I am copying this CSS and I'm gonna
paste it here inside my style dot CSS
file so let's change this to 150 pixels
and the height should be 160 pixels
let's remove the background color and
all things from this item
it is 100 big hundred person and the
background I'm using this background
color I'll use this background color
from the another file and let's say
let's save it and let's see the preview
inside the browser here right you can
see here the the boxes the fifth box
only because we have created five boxes
five grid boxes five grid items we have
created and it is showing the fifth one
because we have not fired up the Murray
instance in JavaScript so let me show
you how you can do that so let's change
the text align should be centered in the
CSS and here as well inside the item
content class center font size should be
35 pixels and also we need to use the
line height as well
we'll say 150 pixels right so let's save
it and let's see the preview inside the
browser right it is showing the box is
showing and we need to use our script we
need to write our script JavaScript
inside the HTML file and on the
documentation you can find how we can
fire it up so this is the way we can
fire it up the Murray let's change this
to constant right the constant grid
equals to new movie it is it creates the
instance of mui and it takes the class
name of this grid so let's save it and
let's see the preview inside the browser
right you can see here the five boxes
are appearing on the screen and it is
completely responsive as you can see
here when you minimize the browser
it is completely responsive and show you
how you can check it is responsive or
not it is not showing let me write it is
responsive no it is not showing for any
for some reason so it is responsive you
can check inside your project right it
is responsive and also we can use some
images in this item content let me show
you how you can use it right below this
fifth box we'll use the image attribute
the image tag along with the source
attribute and we'll paste this link
lauren pixel right so let's use some
image images with with the cat images
right let's change this to five or eight
this to twelve let's save it and let's
check inside the browser right you can
see here the images are appearing and we
can remove this item because the image
is not appearing the twelfth one right
we can use two images here right the two
cat images right and you can fire it you
can use this you can check the
documentation part the under the API
section you can find the syntax mori
element and options so the element is
great as we have taken the grid class
right
it takes the element grid and the
options we need to pass the options
under default options you can check
items show duration to be honest I
I have not explored this much but you
can explore on your end using this
library inside your project inside your
own project but let me show you some
options some basic options so that you
can get started with movie that is the
drag enabled option right it is default
lis set to false bit but it did it does
not allow you to drag the elements
inside your grid we need to set it to
false right drag enabled should be true
so lets you let's save it and let's see
the preview inside the browser right it
is responsive and it is the elements are
draggable you can see here the cat
images and you can check the images are
not properly aligned but you can use it
inside your project by defining some CSS
and also you can drag this grid items so
this is the way you can use moody to
create some cool games or some cool
applications as your own project and you
can explore more about great murray on
the documentation part and let me use
one style here inside the item content
class that is cursor should be pointer
right let's refresh it right when we
hover on this it is in the form of
cursor the cursor is pointer right and
also the another option which I would
like to show you in this video is the
drag axis the drag axis is basically
allows you to drag the items inside the
grid in either X form or either or or in
either Y form right y axis so I would
just like to drag the elements in the
x-axis
so I'll say drag axis X right let's see
the preview refresh it and you can see
here we can drag the elements in just
the X in the x-axis form but we cannot
in the y-axis and if you set it to
y-axis and let's save it let's check in
the browser you cannot in the X you
cannot drag the elements in the x-axis
but you can in the y-axis so you can add
more great items inside this grid by
replacing these two cat images let's say
this 2/6 and this 2/7 right and this to
8 refresh it and you can see here let me
use two more grid items so it comes in
the next line 9th and this to 10 so we
have 10 boxes basically inside this grid
right we can drag this in the XY form in
the indie wife y axis only but we cannot
in the x axis because we have defined
the drag axis should be set to y so it
does not it it cannot drag the elements
in the x axis if we define X Y then
definitely we can drag the elements in
both axis that is the x axis and the y
axis let's save it and let's check in
the browser right if you want to drag
the elements in the y axis then you can
and if you want to drag in the y axis
and you can it allows both axes right
inside this options so you need to pass
the options we have different options
like drag sort or the drag shot
predicate and it takes two values
threshold and action
you can explore more about this on the
documentation I'll paste these two links
