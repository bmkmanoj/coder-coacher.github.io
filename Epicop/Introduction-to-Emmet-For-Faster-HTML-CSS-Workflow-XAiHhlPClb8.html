Moussa column from a pickup and today
I'm going to give a quick introduction
to M it
it's a beautiful plugin and you should
use this essential toolkit if you are a
web developer so I am on the
documentation of Emmet now you can see
I'm ma dot IO and here you can watch
demo as well how you could use it in
inside your code editor so I'm going to
use this beautiful toolkit in my
favorite code editor that is Visual
Studio code so if you want to download
this then visit this documentation and
there you can find a bunch of
coordinators sublime Adam coda there are
many other code editors are there on
this documentation choose any one of
these editors and you can go ahead with
this so - Visual Studio code so in
Visual Studio code already we have a
mint
so let's get started so I'll show you
how you can enable few settings inside
Visual Studio code as I said idea it is
already installed in Visual Studio code
editor and so you do know you do not
need to install it again first go to the
Preferences there you can find settings
inside user settings
you can find settings of Emmet as I have
type here Emmet and you can see right
show abbreviation suggestions it is set
to true what I want here is I want to
enable few settings like this one
so show suggestions as snippet so I will
change this too
I'll change this to true yeah you can
see here it is true
and also I want some other things like
yeah so every Asians suggestions is
already set to true so expanded
abbreviation let me search about tab no
I I need to search about this one I met
only I think of we have we are done with
the settings part yeah trigger
expansions on tab we need to set this to
true because when we enable this every
reputations are expanded on when
pressing that so said this so true now
we are done with the settings part let's
jump to the HTML file and let's see the
power of Emmet inside this right so let
us think that let me show you one thing
here that if you want to create it is
with the class Midas then you could do
it easily diff - my div you can see here
Emmet Emmet abbreviation is giving you
intelligence like if you press tab then
you could find this diff created for you
right you have created if with the class
wide if all you need to do is just type
this dot might've which is your class
name then press tab it just creates a
div with the class might've let me show
you one thing here that if you want to
create a div with the ID my div my full
width is
you could give anything am i full wait
this this is your ID right tres tap then
it is done for you right
and also you are you might have noticed
one thing in here when we have created
an element an STM L element with some ID
or a class the Emmet is focusing on the
text part of an element right if you if
you are noticing here our text cursor
our cursor is blinking at the text part
right we good time anything here right
or we could insert any text inside this
development right so we do not need any
kind of attributes in this if you want
to use some attributes as well then you
could use using image which I will show
you in the later part of this video so
hope you understand about class and if
let me show you nested elements right
inside them I want to create a P tag and
inside P tag I want to create one strand
AK right if you see the intelligence of
Emmett then you can notice one thing
here inside dev we have one P tag and
inside P tag we have one span tag when
we hit tab yeah you can see here we have
created this part and let me show you
one more thing one more thing here is if
you want to create elements one by one
means simultaneously then you could use
this method this plus P plus pan right
when you hit enter then you can see that
first you have created if second is P
and the last one is span tag right what
if you want to create
a div tag with the P tag along with the
class along with the class small Peres
when you reach enter you can see here
you have created a one div tag and one t
tag with the with the class name
paragraph right so this is all about IDs
classes and the nesting of HTML elements
and how you can create this elements
simultaneously one by one right let me
show you about the UL an ordered list
inside we have one list item right when
we hit enter you can see here that
inside you will you have we have created
one list item element right what if I
want to create one you will element and
also inside the jeweler element I want
for list item elements so what I need to
do here is I just need to give an aspect
which is a sign of multiplication and
then give for and hit enter yeah you can
see here you have created on the
unordered list item and inside that we
have created for list item elements
right so this is the power of Emmet and
I would highly suggest you to use this
because it saves your time and also it
increases your productivity while
developing something right so this is
all about the nestings and the
multiplication
let me show you about form right I'll
create one form with the ID my form and
also with the class same form right when
we enter you can see here that we have
created one form with the idea my form
in the class sent form so let me show
you about the dollar power right if you
want to create four hits heading
elements right H 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 what
you need to do is you just need to give
edge along with the sign dollar into
means a stick symbol just give 4 right
yeah you can see here H 1 s 2 s 3 and s
4 you have created we have created four
headings by giving dollar sign it's just
the sign for the number right 1 2 or 1 2
3 or 4 right if you want to create a
nest element H for element along with
the attribute name size equals to 10
right if you hit Enter
then you can see you have created one h4
tag along with the attribute size of 10
you can see here if you want to give
some attribute then definitely you have
to use air alikes
syntax it's a sign it's a syntax of
array you know if you want to create
four heading elements
for adding elements with the size
right into five right you can see here
we have created h1 element of the size
one has two with the size two is three
with the size three and all right what I
have done here is I just gave H dollar
symbol which is a sign of the number and
also have given size equals two dollar
sign means we are setting it for
different numbers and into five when we
hit trap then you can see
then you can see we have five heading
elements along with the snip along with
different sizes right and this is all
about attributes but how you can give
attributes you just need to give
attributes in the form of in the form of
array let me show you about the next
part the content but how you can put
some content inside HTML element right
if you want to give some content then
you should give in you should give
content in the curly braces hello world
is my content then I will hit enter you
can see here I have created one h1
element with the content with the text
hello world so curly braces is the
syntax for giving text or content inside
an HTML element inside an HTML element
and for creating multiple multiple
numbers of elements you need to use
dollar sign and if you want to multiply
with some number then definitely you
should use a strict sign and for
creating for using attributes inside and
as inside an HTML element then
definitely you have to use are alike
syntax right hope you understand about
Amit in HTML let me show you some
interesting things in CSS as well
because like I said like I said earlier
it is essential tool kit for web
developer you can you can use omit
abbreviation omit intelligence for HTML
CSS
so I will show you the power of Emmet in
CSS right let me give you one let me
show you the power of Emmet like if you
want to use position:relative then you
have to type this POS : related then you
can see here it in intelligence we are
getting an option we are getting an
option that is emit abbreviation when we
hit enter or when we tap then it is
giving position:relative attribute right
if you want to give margin with 20
pixels then you should give em 20 pixels
then hit enter it is working now it is
it is showing you on screen right if you
want to Eve padding with 30 pixels then
you have to give P 30 pixels then hit
tab right this way you can give margin
margin padding or anything you could
give let me show you about the display
part display attribute D none right if
you want to make display attribute as
none then you need to type T none then
hit tab right
the show are the visible
d-block display:block means it just show
you in a blog right if you want to give
display:inline then you could give the
iin a lie then hit tab this train line
so this is the power of Emmet for HTML
and CSS and I would highly recommend you
