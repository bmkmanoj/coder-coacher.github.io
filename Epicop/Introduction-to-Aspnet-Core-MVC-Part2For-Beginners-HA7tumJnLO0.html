Sakhalin and in this video I'm gonna
create a simple MVC application asp.net
Kovach MVC application so let's get
started in Visual Studio 2015 I'm gonna
create a new project in the template I'm
going to select asp.net core web
application as you can see in template
we have three different options
it runs on full dot and framework and it
runs on complete dotnet core framework
and it runs on dotnet framework as well
so I'm gonna select this is p.net core
web application on dotnet framework
let's give the application name as demo
app hit enter so this is the
authentication part I'm going to select
web application as you can see here
change change authentication have
selected no authentication so I'm going
to click OK
I'm gonna cancel this app services so it
is creating our new project demo my
project so if you want to know more
about the MVC see my previous video in
my previous video I have shown you how
you can get started with asp.net core
MVC app so this is the part 2 for that
video this is the template Welcome
template to asp.net core in the solution
Explorer we have different folders you
can see here it is restoring packages
these packages are restoring in the
project dot JSON folder I will show you
later what is project dot JSON and let's
see what kind of folders are present in
this solution folder we can see here ww
root in www root we have different
folders for CSS for images for
JavaScript and one is for library in
library we have different libraries like
bootstrap jQuery and all so this is the
controller folder and this is for the
view folder we can add views different
views in this view folder and in
controller we can add different
controllers so what model folder is
missing here because we are doing on MVC
platform so model folder is missing here
let's add the model folder in this
application so I'm gonna click this demo
app and add a new folder called models
that varies over add option here our new
folder models
click okay and a model folder I'm gonna
create a new model for this demo
application I'm gonna select a class as
you know a model represents our
application data so this is usually a
class I'm going to create some
properties under this class like name it
is usually a string type string data
type name I'm gonna create another
property called
age for H we can take integer age and
create another property called
you mean email ID so this is our model
let's create our action in the
controller this model represents our
application data so I will show you what
is controller and the controller folder
we have one controller for home this
controller is for this view folder view
home view folder and the views you can
see here home folder and under this home
folder we have three different views and
the extension of that three views are
dot CSS daemon because it's a RZR file
you can see we have three different view
folders in under home so for these three
views we have created this home
controller and the home controller you
can see first action is for index it's a
default one when we run our application
of what home controller will call and
under that our index action method will
get called so you can see in the home
folder this is our index page and this
is our about page as you can see here
and this is our contact page and last
one is for error so I'm gonna create a
new view under this home view folder I'm
gonna give that
named as MVC view pitch I'm gonna select
MVC view page you can see your extension
is coming dot CSS tml it's a razor file
you can merge code and markup together
I'm gonna give details because this is
pretty important it's a naming
convention we have given this model name
as details so we are giving exactly the
name which Matt which matches to over
model and in under controller home
controller I'm going to create another
action property action method sorry
so this is our action method our action
method should matches our model name and
the view name too I'm gonna return a
view
it's return type you can see action
result I have given the name same name
as our model and the view and in this
view I'm gonna access this model and did
it using demo app dot models dot details
so I'm gonna give the title of this
webpage demo page yeah you can see here
you might be wondering about this view
back it's a dynamic property you can see
when we hover on that view back property
it's a dynamic property it contains some
dynamic stuff so this model now we can
access the details model on overview so
let's create a table under this table
I'm going to create table row and under
this I'm going to create a table head
first table head ass table name and
second will be for each and last one
will be for email ID so this is the
first row of our table now let's create
the second row for the table
at the 8th model dot you can see here
when we axis when we are accessing that
model this details model using at the
rate symbol now we are in the mark-up
section now we are in the mark-up State
razor state under this razor state we
can access all the dynamic stuff from
the class server from the server side so
from this idea - I'm gonna access this
name force because we are showing the
name first then after that I'm gonna
access age of the user this age I delete
symbol represents the razor path now we
are in the razor part it's not the mark
up under mark up we can use razor it's a
cool feature of asp.net MVC let's do it
for email address and I'm gonna take
this entire table under the diff
container diff class is a container you
can see on in the intelligence we are
getting options here you can see it's a
bootstrap class container and container
fluid these both are bootstrap classes
so I'm going to access this under this
container I'm gonna create a row and I'm
gonna give the class name as a row under
this row I'm gonna give another diff for
the column you can see here these are
some columns I'm going to give 12 in
each row we have two 12 different
columns I'll show you data and I'll give
you the brief introduction on bootstrap
3
in the upcoming videos so this is our
view part let's go to the controller
part and access our view you can see
here our detail model is not showing the
type or name space name details could
not be found
are you missing using directive or an
assembly reference so because we have
not included the name space using
namespace for this model problem model
class so let's hit control + dot and it
will show you that you can see here
using demo app dot models it that model
is present under this name so click OK
the using statement has been added on
the top of our class you can see here
using demo app dot models so let's go
give a name
I'm gonna give names ass
name equals to John and age will be 20
and email ID should be John gmail.com so
I'm gonna return this detail variable
detail object to the view and we are
assigning these values in the controller
part and we can access them on our view
so let's save this application and run
that application and let's see how it
will show on the screen
remember this part under the home
controller we have given the details as
our action method so this is important
while giving the URL part because I am
running the application it will default
reader default lis redirect to the home
controller index action method so we
have to specify to which action method
we have to specify while running so it
is running on localhost 6 for 1 double 1
6 so this is one basic application demo
application for the MVC in my previous
video I have already described about
asp.net core and VC and I have even a
brief introduction on that if you have
not seen then go through with that I'm
gonna give home I am giving only home
you can see here I am not giving my
controller name as home controller
because it's a naming convention you
have to give only home not this
controller word in your home controller
only give your home part and I'll give
my action name as details click you can
see here our name age and email id is
showing name is John age is 20 and email
id is John at the gmail.com so you can
see here on our view we have accessed
that model properties exactly as we have
created in our model so this is all
about the demo application for asp.net
core MVC developers and this is all for
the beginners and I would highly
recommend you to go through with my
previous videos if you want to learn
more
