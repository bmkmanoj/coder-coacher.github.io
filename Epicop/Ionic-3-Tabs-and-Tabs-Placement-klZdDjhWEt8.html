Liam from AP cop and today I'm gonna
show you how you can create tabs in
ionic tree and also I'm gonna show you
how you can place your tabs at the top
of the page so before we get started I
would like to show you the documentation
ionic framework calm and here under the
component section you have tabs there
are different kinds of tabs text icon
text an icon badge steps so these are
the different tabs you which you could
use in your ionic app and here it is
explained briefly so you can visit this
document to know more about tabs so
we'll see how we can create the tabs how
we can create tabs in ionic 3 so let's
get started so as you can see here this
is my page dot HTML page and inside this
page I'm going to take I on tabs element
and inside this I'm going to take
element called I on tap and I'm gonna
say that if this tab gets clicked then
we will be redirected to the tavern
group page which will which I will show
you later in the video in this video
first we will see how we can use how we
can assign the attributes to eye on tab
so I'm gonna give a title to this tab as
form and the type icon will be home so
let's copy this eye on tab and paste it
down here so I'm going to take three
tabs in see inside eye on tabs let's
change this to IR let's change this to
tab to root this tooth
three root and change the text as well
I'm gonna give about and this one will
be context context let's change this to
information circle because we most of
the time we see that about page comes
with a information circle icon change
this to friends the Contacts tab show
other at the top it shows the friends
icon so we are done now with the HTML
part and now we'll see how we can assign
pages to the tabs I mean to say that if
if anyone clicks the tab then some page
needs to be or some data needs to be
present inside the page so for that I'm
gonna take home page and I'm going to
change this to home copy this home and
paste it here
so now we'll see tab 1 root equals to
home page tab to root equals to start
page and I'm not going to assign a page
for tab 3 root as you can see heaven
this tab when this tap gets clicked this
tab on route will assign the home page
to the content and when this tab to root
this root this tab root gets flicked the
start page will assigned to the tab to
root page so let's save these two files
and now we'll
see how it looks on our browser on ionic
lab it is running now it might take some
time to and we'll see yeah it is ready
you could visit this documentation it's
a beautiful documentation and you can
also explore other things like the
options for tabs you can see here inside
the template the different ways it shows
different ways how you can create tabs
in ionic app so I am just showing the
basic one these all are the options this
is the toggle part which is not the
topic of this video so we will focus on
the tabs and also you can visit the API
section as well if you visit
documentation then you will get an
option for API for an API here you can
see below the component section and
inside API you have tabs element as well
tab compute ABS component as well so
basically it shows on all three
platforms it is taking more time here it
is ready now our home page will appear
now
yeah it is ready now we'll see the tabs
when we click this button it is not
showing because of this error yeah you
can see here we did we did one mistake
here we'll remove the string part and
we'll save it again we don't have to
give the page names as a string we just
need to pass it as a page name itself
yes you know yeah this is the tab these
are the tabs three tabs recent favorites
and settings you can also add some more
stuff here you can see we have different
icons with different options and with
beautiful design as well so you can also
contribute to this using improve this
document option it is running our
application is running we will see this
part now you can see here you can also
contribute in this part which is the
tabs part on github so my laptop is a
bit slow so it is taking more time to
compile and to load when we click this
page yeah you can see here we have three
different options at bottom home about
and contacts I haven't given any option
on contacts because I have to generate
one more page for that if you want to
use if you want to assign a new page to
contact section then you can give these
are the two
pages these are three tabs which you
could use inside your tab section so
what if you want to place this tab
section at the top of the page here
below the nav bar I'll show you that how
you can place your tab section at the
top of the page so let's do it now what
you need to do is you need to go to the
app dot module or TS file and inside
imports array you just need to give all
you just need to pass a parameter and
that parameter will be tabs placement of
top comma this tabs placement which is a
which is of type top I'm assigning top
so it it brings your tab section at the
top of the page so let's save this and
we'll see
will it work or not probably it work
because the tabs placement attribute is
used to place your tab section in the
page so default it takes at the bottom
but if you want to place your tab
section at the top of the page then you
could use this method now we'll see the
placement of tab on our page so I was
showing you this you can contribute on
github using the improve this document
option and also you can read about
different options which is present right
here on the documentation as you can see
here the indexes are also available for
tab section or application is ready now
we will see the placement of our tab
section yeah it is ready
we'll jump to the page yeah it is not
working
we'll see yeah I have given top the I
have given T the first letter of top t
as caps one but we don't need to give
any capital letter here we just need to
give the small top word though I was
doing that mistake I have saved it and
now we'll see the changes so remember
this part if you want to place your tabs
at the top of the page then you could
use this method and also if you don't
want your nav bar here in the header you
can also remove this so that your tab
section will fully will occupy the above
space than ever space if you don't want
this then you can remove this ion nav
bar part from your header now we will
see the placement of tab it is ready now
we'll jump right to the page and we'll
see the changes which we have done in
app dot module dot TS you can play
around with your tab section about the
placement I am talking about the
placement you can place a top and by
default it takes the bottom position so
it is ready now we will jump to the page
and we'll see yeah it is working now you
can see here the three tabs are showing
at the top of the page using this
placement tabs placement you can assign
you can place your tab section at the
top of the page hope you understand
about
and the placement of tabs in ionic three
you can use this method to place your
tabs at the top of the page by default
it takes bottom position so I hope you
