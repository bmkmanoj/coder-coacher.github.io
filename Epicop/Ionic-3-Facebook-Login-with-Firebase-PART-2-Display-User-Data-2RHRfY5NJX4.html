column from a pickup and today we will
see how we can show the data which we
are getting from Facebook so we have
seen in the part one of this video that
is how we can integrate facebook login
in ionic 3 and we have integrated so if
you miss that video then please make
sure that you watch that video you won't
be understand this video until unless
you watch that video so we have
integrated facebook login in ionic 3 and
now I'm going to show you how you can
display that data in your application so
I'm going to display only 4 fields or
the 4 things of which we are getting
from Facebook and that 4 things are the
name of the user name the name of the
user and email address and the display
and the photo URL and we can show
anything like the phone number as well
so this way these three things will
display on our page so as you can see
here I have I got a response from
Facebook and it is an object inside this
we have one user object and you can see
here we have this day name which is mine
email address that is also mine and the
photo URL here you can see here the
photo URL so these three things will
display in one card and will displayed
on our page
so let's get started so this is the card
which I have selected to display my data
which we are getting from Facebook so
you can copy this I'm going to stay only
the image user name and the email
address these three things will show so
I will paste it here from the ionic Docs
you can see yeah so
this is our simple card and you can see
here I'm not going to display this image
because we don't have any image and then
displaying the thumbnail image here
which is my profile picture of Facebook
and here I will show my username of
Facebook and you can see here the email
address so first we will create one
object to see that whether the user has
been logged in successfully or not so we
will create one simple object here
Facebook and we'll see logged in and
we'll set this to false because by
default we have to set this to false you
have to give any here our string boolean
you can see here I am getting an issue
only refers to a type but it is being
used as a value here so you don't have
to give any type sorry I have to give
comma here because I can I cannot give
yeah so I was giving a equals to sign
that was not correct logged in is set to
false and name should be empty and email
will also be empty we'll leave these
things and profile picture and we will
set this to empty as well so we'll give
semicolon here we have created an object
here and as we are displaying our data
which we are getting from Facebook in
the console so we will remove we will
remove this
we'll set this dot Facebook dot dot in
equals two through and this dot Facebook
dot in a equals two response dot user
you might be wondering how I am giving
this right so we are getting response
and in that response we are getting one
user object you can see here one user
object here so inside this we have the
email like you see here email we have to
copy this and we have to paste it here
semicolon and now we'll store this or
Facebook dot
equals to response dot user dot display
name you can see here the user name of
the Facebook this dot Facebook dot
mhm so this response dot user dot we are
getting when object here you can see
here photo URL this is our profile
picture of Facebook so we are storing it
inside profile picture so we are all
done now and also I am going to set this
logout message with the login equals to
false because once we logged in it it
will be set to false and it is set to
true by default it should be set to
false so we have to save this and we
have to move to home dot HTML to display
this all data which we are getting from
book so this is my login with Facebook
button and also I'm going to check here
with the structural directive called ng
if ng F equals 2 if Facebook dot logged
in what I am Telling here is what I am
trying to show here is if the user is
not logged in then only we are going to
allow the user to log in to log into the
Facebook to login into our app using
Facebook using Facebook the user can be
able to log in if the user is not
actually logged in so by default it is
set to false and now we are thinking he
read that if not Facebook dot logged in
generally user can be able to login in
to our application and I'm going to also
I am going to give one ng decorator here
that if Facebook dot logged in if he is
logged in then only we are going to
display the data right so we are
allowing users to see the data in this
card we are checking here before
displaying data if he is if the user is
logged in then only we are going to
display the data so we have to remove
this source as we are not using any
local image here we use two-way binding
here and we'll say actually we have to
give some space Facebook dot dot profile
picture right profile picture and inside
is I'm going to show
Facebook dot the username right username
is our name which you have stored in our
in an object here and also I'm going to
display the email address of user right
so we have to use Facebook dot female so
as you can see if we are not using any
big picture here so we may remove this
so it is it is better to remove this so
I'm going to display this dummy content
from in the endcard content so let's
save this and let's see our overdue the
details which we have logged in here I
have even my Facebook credentials so
probably I may get my profile picture my
user name and my email address in your
case you can log in with any ID so that
you can be able to see the users data
inside your page so it was just a simple
example which I have shown you in this
video this is just a simple card social
card you could use any one you could
also use this background images card or
you can use anything here so I have used
only a social card simple card since we
are not dealing with this image so I
have removed this in my application but
you can use we have map cards as well
you can see here once you scroll down
yeah you can see here the map and some
icons are there beautiful icons with the
text you can create or you can you
in your application to display users
data right so it is running and it might
take some time so if you missed my
previous video on so I may get the
response here yeah I have done all
things correct so probably I will get
logout it's not a function okay all
right I have used some another method
yeah you can see here so I have to use
oh I have to remove this parentheses
yeah so once we have to log out and then
only we can able to log in in our
application so that we can see our data
inside the card so it is taking more
time to load because my laptop is bit
slow and you can see the response in the
console itself and you can play around
with the data you can show and at any
element air or in any form as well so
this was just a simple example which I
have given you and if you missed my
previous video that is the part one how
we can integrate Facebook log in in your
ionic free application and then make
sure to watch that because I have shown
you how you can integrate Facebook login
in that video yeah yeah the pop-up has
been opened for us and we'll get a
response here
it might days we have done something
wrong here so we have to wait for this I
have given one decorator here when one
directive here yeah you can see here I
have I got the my data inside the card
you can see here say it Musa column is
my username and Sayed Musa dot column at
the rate yahoo.com is my email address
of Facebook and you can also see the
Demi data so in this way you can show
your you can display your data you can
display users data in the form of sky in
the form of social card and hope you
