i am back with my another video and in
this video for the next few minutes
we're gonna talk about razor so let's
get started rachel is a asp.net
programming syntax for creating dynamic
web pages so it's a programming syntax
used to create dynamic web pages with
the C sharp or visual basic Reza was
firstly introducing asp.net MVC 3 in
January 2011 and it was released with
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and this is
the razor syntax three basic rules are
there and razor is usually used to write
the code and mark up together and
activate symbol represents razor and you
could also use the standard language
keywords like if-else for each or all
other standard language keywords in the
reserved so let's see the keywords these
are the these are some keywords which
you can use in our webpages so a delayed
opening tag closing tag and that we can
write some content if you want to
comment that session you can use this so
let's see one demo application for razor
so I'm gonna create one model here of
movies and this model we are having some
properties like title writer producer
and director so I'm gonna call this in
my home controller because this views
present in home folder home view folder
so in the home controller I have created
one action method for the movie here it
is retaining the view so let's see how
you will look like it's our view and you
can see at the root symbol here this
entire section is a razor part in your
webpage you can see this a view backdoor
title equals to movie page and taking
one variable and I'm calling that model
movie in the view and I am assigning the
property names of title writer producer
and director I'm gonna show these
property names in the mark of tax right
here below in the page so let's see how
we can see how we can show these
property names in the markup so I have
created one table for this content to
show this content so for in that table I
have given title writer producer and
director and I'm gonna show you how we
can access these properties in the
mark-up as you can see here at the net
if movie dot title not equals to null
and if yes it shows movies or tidal and
movie dot write a movie producer movie
dot director which we have given here
the title of the movie is pair
passengers writer is Chris Pratt
producer is Columbia presentation and
director sniffing mark
so let's run this application and let's
see how we can show the content of razor
on overview
this is the basic and simple example of
razor let's give the controller name and
action name here yeah you can see the
title passengers to respect Columbia
presentation and stiffen mark so we are
getting that property names on our view
in the mock-up yeah this is very simple
elegant and very powerful for asp.net
developers so this is all about razor
