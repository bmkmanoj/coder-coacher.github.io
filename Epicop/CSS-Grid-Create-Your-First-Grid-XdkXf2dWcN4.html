you how you can create your first grid
in CSS so we'll take a look how we can
define our grid by defining rows and
columns and
for the grid there are two main items
for grids and that items are the
container and the items or you can say
the elements inside the grid as you can
see here I have created a simple grid in
my video
one two three four these are four items
in my grid and this container is microd
so we'll see how we can do that so it's
just a static HTML file and I'm writing
CSS in the head in the head tag of the
HTML file as you can see here HTML and
body given the background color and the
margin tank ten pixels so let's get
let's dive into this and let's see how
we can actually create our first CSS
grid let's get started so what I have
done here is I have taken four elements
four items inside my grid there is my
container class
and I'll use this continual class here
and I'll say display rate right
the second attribute we need to use for
defining our grades is grid template
rows and I'll say 100 pixels and the
second one should be Auto so it should
not rows it should be columns sorry for
that right what I'm saying here is I've
warned two columns inside my grid as you
can see here this the two columns have
been can be shown can be see on the
screen right there are two columns and
there are four boxes and there are two
rules so I warned the first column to be
hundred pixels the width should be
hundred pixels of the first column and
the second one should be Auto right so
the next attribute the next thing which
we need to use inside our brady's grid
template
Rose right you are saying that you want
to rose and how much gap you are going
to provide between these two rows in my
case I am providing only 50 pixels of
space between these two rows of my grid
as you can see here the first column
should be hundred pixels wide and the
second one should be auto you can see
here the second end for our auto and I
want the 50% fifty pixels width between
the two rows right so and I also want
the grid gap right the gap you can see
here between columns and the rows right
between the columns you can see here
grid gap I'm using three pixels as a gap
between the two items inside my grid
inside my CSS grid so this is all about
the container with let's move to the
next thing
and that is the container
the div inside the container right
so I'll say display flex and I'll say
justify
content or line items
line items to the center
not content center
and justify content should also be set
to center right
and also I want the font size to be 2e m
and the color should be let me copy from
here the color should be this one right
so let's copy this day this style let's
paste it here so what I'm telling here
what I'm driving here is what I'm giving
here is this place reflects for the diff
for the diff this diff inside the
container great and I am saying that the
justify content should be centered and
aligned item should be all should also
be said to Center for font size is to e
m and the color is this one so
this is all about the DIF item inside
our grid and let's actually give the
background colors to these four items
right so for that we can give contain a
cone container
and
and child
right so my you might be wondering what
I am doing here is I'm using the CSS
technique to give the background color
to the items inside our grid right what
I'm defining here is I'm saying that
inside my container I born the first
item the Tiff's item and child of one
right so for this I'm gonna use the
background color
this one right hash this one
so let's actually copy down this
container this technique the CSS
paste it here four times because we have
four elements for items inside our grid
let's change this to second that is that
is for the second element third
and the last one should be for let's
change the colors right for the second
one I am using this color background
color and third one and last but not
least this one right so let's save it
and let's run inside the browser to see
it works or not right when I hit refresh
it is working and even it is responsive
as you can see here if I minimize my
browser the first column the first
column is set to hundred pixels and the
second one is set to auto and the
template rose gap is 50 pixels we can
see here and if I set 200 pixels you may
seen some change you may see some
changes as you can see here the Rose
right 50 pixels between here it is 100
pixels now right and I use 50 pixels
here for the first row and for the
second row I will use 200 pixels that is
the height of the column that is the
height of the row right
so save it and let's see in the browser
you can see here the first row is 50
pixels and the second row is 200 pixels
so I'll use only 50 50 pixels means both
rows will be off 50 pixels right and the
grid gap is 3 pixels I'll I can make it
10 pixels and let's see preview inside
the browser you can see here the 10
pixels can be seen between the grid
items I'll make it to 3 right it should
be flex the div item the element inside
the grid inside the grid container and
this is all about the CSS grid which we
have created this is our fault CSS grid
