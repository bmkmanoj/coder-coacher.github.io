live website using html5 and css3 so I
would like to show you how to create a
static part for the website in the
upcoming videos I will show you how to
create dynamic part as well so let's get
started with the static part first so
this is our first page actually I am
working on a live project that is for a
company which is based in Oman in Gulf
so this is the domain for that company
electronic calm oh em so the domain has
not been registered so the live website
will be uploaded here after the
development process complete so let's
get started with the first page there is
our home page so this is the first page
I have created called home page so I
will show you from top to bottom and I
have included the links and the script
folders here you can see here and the
title of the project is tetra niché's
the company name and after that after
the head tag this is our head tag under
this head tag I have included all the
link and script tags and some CSS in the
style tag
have closed this hashtag here under the
body I have added a navbar this is the
navbar comment you can see here so I
have created a default navbar and it is
obviously a static top one the client
requirement was the static top navbar so
I have created that number at the top of
the webpage and the role of this the
role of this nav bar is navigation under
this I have taken it div tag like the
class has container under that I have
taken a row under that I have taken a
column for extra small devices small
devices medium devices and for the last
devices and this is the toggle button
for the responsive layout this button is
pretty important you have to give this
button for the toggle when the browser
when you minimize the browser you can
see our website is present on the live
domain this is subdomain not the
original one so this is the toggle
button we can see it is working fine
let's get back to the page and this is
the navbar here it is the ending tag for
the navbar after that I have given some
hat what you can say this is the high
street type high tag for displaying
the process of that company the book of
that company so I've included that line
developing products and methods to
satisfy our clients with engineering
polymers under that I have given this
one bowl of possibilities and I have
given a carousel here you can see here
the carousel is working fine on the
images so this is the client this was
the client requirement before starting
the project the client requirement this
we have we got that client requirement
like this PSD file so we have developed
this website according to that
requirements so let's move on and see
this you can see here this is the h2 tag
mission means it is showing that what is
the actual mission of the company to
provide good quality products and
services establishing and relationship
of honesty and trust with our customers
and employees so this is all about the
mission this is the vision and this for
this part is for the values so this was
the clarity let's move on and explore
more about this website as it is the
live website running on a sub-domain
within few days we are going to make
this website life so we need to do some
we have to do some little bit
modifications to this website
so this is the second row encouraged row
which you can see here this one was the
first row and this one is the second row
social activities we have put some
images in this row you can see this is
the responsive footer all the images and
all you can see here so this is the
first page let's move to the next page
called projects and let's open projects
in our text editor this one
so this is our second page the carousel
is same as as the first page as on the
fourth page so this one it is still
loading techtronic projects some content
and one image is here these are some key
points of the website means what kind of
development they are doing or what kind
of work they are providing so this is
all about the company which type of
projects they are doing so this one is
for the projects part
so you can see here these are some list
items which I have created under UN
tagged unordered list ul means unordered
list you can see here ally means list
items and oil means ordered list so I
have created this list items under ul
tag so this is the second page let's
move to the next page called our
services page and you can see here our
services means there's some stuff some
cool stuff about the companies here you
can see here all types of books provided
by the company has been given in this
page
this is our third page let's move and
explore our fourth page called social
activities
at the end of this video I will show you
how to upload these files on a hosting I
have already signed in sign in my
GoDaddy account you can see here so
under this after signing in this GoDaddy
hosting account you will find a file
manager under this file manager I have
already opened this tab under this file
manager under public HTML folder I have
created a subdomain called demo under
this demo I have created all folders for
bootstrap CSS files HTML files PHP files
and all you might be wondering how to
create a subdomain in a domain in a
hosting so let me show you how to create
a subdomain you can see here domains
this part domains under this you can see
subdomains so click on that it will
redirect you to the subdomain creation
page and under that page you can create
subdomains easily so using this
subdomain I have uploaded all my files

time the ID is opening fine yeah you can
see here you can give subdomain name

after that a dot is dead and the tonic
dot-com dot which is the domain name the
actual domain name so you could have you
could type anything it's your wish after
giving the subdomain name just click on

using this process I have created a
subdomain on hosting page and under this
subdomain I have uploaded all the files
using this upload button you can see
here upload you could move some file if
you want to move some files to any other
location you could you can use this move
file option and you can also create a
new folder for uploading a new content
on this hosting and you can also
download the source code and you can

iframe tag in a div in a column or extra
