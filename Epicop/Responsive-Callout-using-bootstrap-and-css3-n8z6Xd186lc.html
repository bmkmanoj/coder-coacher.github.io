peacock and say Musa column and today
I'm going to show you how to create a
big call-out using bootstrap 3 so let's
get started and I have created this file
and in this file I have an app bat a
navigation bar as you can see here at
the top of the page and below this page
I'm going to create a big call-out and
you can see here this is our navigation
bar present at the top of the page so we
will create we will start creating our
big call-out using bootstrap 3 so here
we go let's take a div tag and let's
give the class called container fluid as
you all know that continuous fluid is a
class which takes the full width 100%
width it takes the full width in your
browser as you can see here if this
navigation bar is taking full width the
width is up to 100% if you take
container class then you might get 15
per pixel padding from left and right so
I would suggest you to take container
fluid and inside this container fluid
I'm going to take another class called
row and let's take another div tag and
let's say column excess means extra
small devices and inside this column I'm
going to take a div tag and I'm going to
see well as the well is a bootstrap
class predefined class which you could
use to create a call-out so we have
taken a well class inside this where
class I am going to take another div tag
and let's say page header
and inside this page header a I'm going
to take a h1 tag or you could take h2
and let's say call out header and now I
am going to display a small text so I
would take small tags which is a
histamine element small inside the small
tags I'm going to I'm going to give some
text called fancy header fancy well with
some style with some style let's save
this and let's talk to the browser and
refresh the page and you can see here
this is our well and this is the page
header which we have given inside the
pages your class so now I'm going to
Center align this text so for that we
need to use text center class this is
also a bootstrap class now you can see
here the text is Center aligned now and
below this now I'm going to give one
PETA gear outside the page header and
I'm going to say a leap flash to this P
tag this is also a bootstrap class you
need to remember while using bootstrap 3
solely is mostly used with P tags so
we'll say we have created
if when using bootstrap three bootstrap
three let's save this and refresh the
browser again now you can see here the P
tag is showing here and also you can see
below the page header below this heading
we have the divider as well so it is
also a it is also given by the bootstrap
because we have used repeated and after
the page header class the HR deck is
given here in the browser so let's take
another P tag and let's say let's give
the same class called lead and let's add
some dummy content in the speed AK lorem
ipsum refresh the page again and after
the P tag let's take a and tag and let's
give the class button button primary as
you can see here we have different kinds
of burdening boots set button primary
button success and button block which
which could take the entire block size
entire block width and button danger
button warning these are the different
kinds of boots these are the different
kinds of buttons which is present inside
bootstrap so if you want explore more
about bootstrap then you should visit
this site get bootstrap dot form inside
components you will get all components
here as navbar you can see here button
button groups yeah you can see your
button default is also a type of button
which is present in bootstrap
button there are different kinds of
burden which is given here if you want
to explore then you could explore on
this website default primary success
info warning danger these are the
different kinds of button so let's give
button primary button MD and let's give
Explorer role and we'll give this link
in the HR tag here and let's say this
will refresh the page again you can see
here when we click this button then
we'll be redirected to that giving link
so let's save this now I'm going to add
a well which will be invisible on large
devices I mean to say that this well
which we are going to create will be
visible on the specific screen size you
might be wondering how we could do that
let's see now let's take another div tag
at the top of this well and let's say
well well small visible only on medium
sized devices inside this well I'm going
to take a button tag here and I'm going
to say flash equals to close and we'll
take one data attribute data dismiss
equals to close and the type of the
button should be button and let's give
amperes time
time's let's save this and let's take a
hedge for tag inside this small Bell
which will be visible only on medium
sized screen size small well using
bootstrap 3 let's save this and let's
talk to the browser and we'll refreshed
again yeah you can see here we are not
able to see that small well on the large
screen size if we want to see that then
we should maximize this and you can see
here our Smallville is now showing on
the browser Smallville using bootstrap
and also we could add anything in my
case I am adding one button button
success button block let's say show
let's refresh the page again as you can
see here button block will take the
entire column width as you can see here
so if I click this
it will go off so I'm going to add a
class called fading to this small well
so this way you could add this way you
could show all hide your HTML elements
on different screen sizes so inside this
big call-out I have given a small well
which would be seen only on this medium
screen sizes so this was all about the
well a small big call-out so inside this
big call-out I am going to create a
alert alert block or alert box you could
see alert alert success under block and
inside this I'm going to take and you
can see here data business ah yeah I
have one alert box here so I would copy
down this and I would paste in my row
instead of P instead of giving inside
the well I would like to give inside the
row so what I have given here is I have
given one alert box
alert and it's success alert doc and
fading and I have also taken taken one
burden to close that alert box and same
as like this the small well I have given
a class close to the button data dismiss
would be alert and the type of this
button would be button and I have also
taken one edge for tag and I have given
wall inside the h4 tag and inside the P
tag I have given some content so let's
save this and let's talk to the browser
and let's refresh the page that you can
see here our alert box is showing now
with the content which we have given
inside alert box and we could also give
danger instead of giving success let's
refresh it again you can see here we
have different kind of alert classes as
well in bootstrap similarly we have
different kinds of classes for buttons
as well which I have shown you here and
if you want to explore more about the
alert or any component about bootstrap
then you just need to visit this website
called get bootstrap comm slash
components and inside this you have
different kind of components core as
bread crumbs Jumbotron
and thumbnails alerts we have alert
boxes as well here and we could also use
primary primary alert and will refresh
the page that you can see here it is not
showing anything the color is not
showing anything and we could also use
info info class alert info this will
appear in a light blue color area you
can see here this is appearing in a
small in a sky-blue color so we have
different kind of different kinds of
classes for red boxes so this way you
can create a big call-out using
bootstrap 3 which is nothing but a well
a big well and also you can hide or show
different elements using bootstrap and
on different side down on different
screen sizes you can show or hide
different elements of HTML so and also
you can create alert boxes using
bootstrap so hope you understand about
