weekend and as you know on weekend I
create some videos that are small and
funny and today I'm gonna show you how
you can create a simple converter app
using javascript and bootstrap 4 so
we'll see we'll convert pounds into
grams kilograms and ounces so we'll see
how we can convert using the
calculations and we'll use bootstrap for
for UI so let's get started
so here is my simple HTML file weight
converter dot HTML inside this I'm gonna
take one div tag with the class with the
class container right and if you don't
know how you can use bootstrap for let
me show you how you can use it actually
just you need to type boot chef for CDN
right here we can find a CDN so that you
can use bootstrap for remotely you do
not have to install it on your local
host machine you just need to use this
CDN link this link is copied and we can
paste it here by removing this font
awesome CDN let's paste it here now we
can use the bootstrap for it isn't it is
in beta version so we can use it right
let me take one more dip tank with a
class a row and inside this we will take
another div tag with the class column
md6 MD for MDC sorry so we can use this
let me take off set
medium three right so inside this
let's take h1 tag with the class with
the class sorry display 4 and also text
Center because we need that text in the
center and let's give let's copy the
same text which we have given in a world
title right that space and let's see the
preview in the browser yeah it is
displaying and the text is appearing in
two lines because it is a little bit
more right simple weight converter app
it is a lengthy text so it is appearing
in two lines now let's take one form
with the class from group no we can take
form and inside this we can take one div
tag with the class form group right
inside this form group we will take one
input element with the class form
control and let's take another class
that is form control LG right place
holder should be equals to enter pounds
as we are converting pounds into grams
kilograms announces then we will use
enter pounds here or we can give type
pounds here right we can use this
placeholder and we will give one ID to
this input field and that is pound input
right let's see the preview yeah it is
appearing and now we will take one mold
if tag for displaying the results of
this pounds in two grams kilograms
announces let's see and let's give a one
ID to this distich and that is output
right inside this div tag I'm gonna use
three districts three subdiv tags with
the class card right card and right let
me take this first card danger we cannot
use two classes at a time this is the
Emmett abbreviation just you need to
type this with the class name and when
you hit tab it will create a div with
the class card if you don't know about
them and then don't forget to watch my
previous video on Emmett which I have
shown you in by installing it in the
visual school Visual Studio code editor
right let's give this class card danger
and let's take one more dip tag and
let's say card block right inside this
I'm gonna use one h4 element and I'm
gonna say grams below this I'm gonna use
one I'm gonna use one div tag with the
class grams output right once we convert
our pounds then we will display our add
till then we will display our result the
grams output result inside this div tag
so let's use this same card and give it
here and let's change this to success
and this one to primary and this should
be kilograms right
and let's remove this and let's say kg
output right and this should be ounces
and change this to ounce output right
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use
one style a style tag here to apply some
CSS to our simple convert simple body we
will apply some simple CSS to the body
of this HTML file and that is margin top
will be 80 pixels and the background
color will be 3 3 3 it is in the dark it
is the dark color and the color should
be white let's save and let's hit
refresh yeah the three fields are not
appearing the the the 3 blocks are not
appearing the text is not appearing
because it is in white color so let's
let's use mb 3 that is margin-bottom 3
let's use it here and here also yeah it
is now appearing what I'm missing here
is actually I'm missing something let me
check what I'm missing here god card
success card block Oh
let me check one more time ID output and
this is the crumbs div tag let's paste
it here let's see if let's save this and
let's preview still not appearing
actually
I was doing one mistake here while
copying the link of bootstrap for and
that is this link right when we go to
alpha dot bootstrap get boot sub calm it
is in alpha stage so we need to copy
this all tags the link tag the end this
three script tags so I forgot to copy
these three tags so let me copy this
three tags and let me paste it here I
have copied only the link tag that is
not going to happen right so we need to
copy this link tags link tag and the
skip tag as well so it is going to work
now let's save this and let's see the
preview in the browser and the cards are
not appearing in a color format so let's
refresh it now right you can see here
the cards are in the color format the
cards are showing their colors dangerous
success and the primary color right so
let's give some margin to this right mg
M B means margin modern three let's copy
the same merge into this card block and
to the last one as well let's give the
same margin to this text right it looks
more beautiful now right we just need to
type the pound's here the amount of
fonts we have and it will convert into
grams kilograms announces and let's see
that functionality now let's create one
script tag here for the java script and
let's say document dot get
document dot get element by ID right so
let's use this ID this ID found ID it
should be pounds right pounds ID dot add
event listener when we type something
right we will use a callback function we
are trying to listen the events when the
user types something in the input field
will will call a callback function
function and will pass one parameter and
let's leave here and let's see console
dot log let's say pounds right so let's
save this and let's see the console
first let's refresh it and let's let's
type something here one two three as you
can see here the pounds is appearing in
the console and even it is showing the
number of times right so let's remove
this from the code and let's say let
pounds equals to e dot target dot of
value right and let's display this value
inside the console right let's pause
this in the console dot log and let's
see the value refresh this and let's say
one it is not it is showing some error
so let us remove this and let's refresh
it the value is just an object yeah you
can see here the values are appear in
the console I was trying to use
the value as a functions but I was wrong
so we need to use Eid or target not
value and it is showing the values once
we type in the input field right let's
remove this and let's clear the console
now and let's give the input field type
as a number so that user can only type
numbers not letters and all right let's
save this and let's say document dot get
element by ID right let's use this grams
output here inside this dot inner HTML
equals to this pounds right we are
trying to convert the pounds into grams
here right pounds divided by zero point
zero point zero zero two two zero four
six let me check this value first here
yeah zero point zero zero two two two
zero four six let's use this number zero
point zero zero two two zero four six so
this will convert the pounds into grams
now let's write the same thing for
kilograms let's change this to kg output
and let's use this to point let's remove
this all things zero point zero zero
pounds divided by two point two zero
four six so this will give you the
result for the kilograms and let's say
this 1/2 ounce output and for this we
need to multiply the pounds with 16 so
this will this
give the conversion of pounds into
ounces so let's save this and let's see
the preview in the browser let's close
this con so let's get rid of this
right
once we type 1 it is showing right you
can see here the grams kilograms in
ounces and even this application is
responsive yeah you can see here when I
minimize my browser you can see here
right it is a responsive it is in the
center of the screen right it is
responsive so it is working fine right I
hope you got it and you can try this
inside your projects and you can use it
freely and I'll paste the source code
link of github and you can find the code
on github you can find the code on
github I'll paste in the description you
can get from there and let me show you
one thing here right when the user
starts typing it then only I'm gonna
display the 3 blocks 3 cards till then
I'll keep it as hidden right let's use
document dot get element by ID let's use
output dot style dot visibility
visibility visibility equals to hidden
right and let's save and let's see the
preview yeah once we type once we type
it is not displaying the car
it is not displaying the cards right so
for that we need to use we need to
display the card we need to display the
cards when the user starts typing in the
input field and we need to give the
style dot visibility as visible but
inside the callback function remember
this point
let's save it right the cards are not
appearing anymore once we start typing
it
the cards are appearing on the screen so
this way you can create a simple and a
basic weight converter app using
javascript and bootstrap for hope you
enjoy it and hope you like it thanks for
