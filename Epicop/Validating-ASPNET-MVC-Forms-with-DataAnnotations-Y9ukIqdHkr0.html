today we are going to talk about the
model validation in MVC so let's get
started i'm going to create one model in
our model folders called register let's
add it here and give the name register
I'm going to add some properties in that
like email address
leave this property name as user name
and let's take it as password
I'm gonna give some attributes to these
properties like this one is required
it is showing me that error there so we
need to solve that by clicking
controlled and dot yeah you can use
using system dot component model dot
data annotations let's click enter and
add some message here this this field
kind p.m. okay and let's take a data
type attribute here since it is email
address we are going to take this
stereotype as email address and add one
error message in that if the user tries
to enter the strain which is not email
email address so I'm going to show you
how to add the error message in that
email address and this email is valid
please
chick and try again
let's add required field attribute to
this username and error message will be
same as of email address property let's
copy and paste it here
I'm going to give required field here
also and then i'm going to copy this
error message I'm the username copy here
I am going to create view for this model
called register in our home folder here
it is add new view new item MVC view
page
this view name should match the name of
the model it's a convention h1 tag here
let's add action in our home controller
let's open this controller folder open
home controller
add an action here called register like
I said this action name should match the
name of the view and the model it is
giving mirror because i am not returning
anything from this action you have to
return view here as you can see there
goes from here and what I'm going to do
is I'm gonna return the view here which
is of form which I have not created yet
the controller our controller is let's
close this one our controller is home
and is the action our action is
registered method is should be post
because we are posting the role of the
form is far and is peer out
you are SB you are and I think so is not
sure let's leave it take on diff attack
here call farm horizontal because we are
going to create horizontal form in this
view and add a div tag for the
validation is P evaluation somebody
equals to model only ok and I'm going to
create a fun group here
for rope let's add labeling it for our
email address i have not included our
model here in our view let's include of
a model for stays pico dot models dot
register here it is let's take sm is
before and we have to match this SP for
attribute to our property we are
matching this property to the email
address yeah you can see that it is
showing it showing the email address in
the intelligence this is the power of
visual studio let's take a class here
called form control no it's a
controllable item so ya can see
and to make it responsive i'm going to
take column medium device 2 i'm going to
take another div tag
call a medium 10 let's open this div tag
and add input tag in that is before same
as the buff label take a class it should
be form control take span SP validation
for email address let's close this
we have created a form group for the
email address like this we have to
create more three more two fun groups
for username and password so let's copy
this paste it here let's copy this user
name in this input tag and in this I
forgot to mention the class of this pan
should be text danger let's add this
class attribute to this span tag also it
is necessary
copy this stiff tag paste it here change
this user name to password because we
are done with email address and username
take this password stood here and here
also we are done let's go to controller
add attribute here
you
and we are checking that model state is
valid or not if it is valid then
redirect to redirect the action cheese
index
and this view I am returning a model
which is register model so let's save
this and run our application
that is when now
yeah it is running on the local host as
you can see 52 double 94 this is our
local host which is is Express we are
running this application on iis Express
which is our local web server let's give
the controller name post and give action
name now so that it can read
I'm getting an issue you
I have to include another action for the
get a tribute it should be similar to
the previous one
add this and add attribute here HTTP GET
this action is for HTTP GET means if the
user wants to see the view and this
action is for post has to DB post when
users submit some or enter some details
let's stop debugging this and run
equation now
let's eat will work or not
the controller name an action name
yeah it is showing me we haven't
improved our submit button there let's
add a submit button in that view button
in that type should be submit and the
value of the button I'm giving it as
register
giving this input tag class goes to form
control
to make it responsive okay let's run it
again
I forward to give the input input button
there I have given
let's eat the controller name and action
name is registered yeah you can see i'm
going to add email address name mark
password
yeah as you can see it is redirecting to
the index page because this statements
this if statements returns true let's
try with some different values
let's try to submit this form without
any values yeah it is giving me an error
this field cannot be empty which we have
given in our register model as you can
see I have given this required attribute
here and the error message this
attributes are showing the error on the
view so this is all about MVC model
validation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
