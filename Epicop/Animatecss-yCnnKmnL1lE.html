we're gonna take a look at animate dot
CSS which is a CSS toolkit or library
whatever you want to call it and it
allows you to create some really nice
animations using just CSS and it also
allow allow us to implement event events
using javascript and jQuery so we are
not going to go in depth in this video
I'm going to show you how to get started
with this and how to implement this
library using just the Sirian link and
you can play around with this library so
here is the link you can see here
animate dot CSS and we have different
animations in the drop-down list this is
the bounce and you can see jello this is
a swing animation this all are just CSS
animations without going in-depth or
without writing some custom CSS
animations so we can use this library
and it is very easy and handy library as
you can see here so we'll see how we can
use it inside our project so here is the
get up page and you can find all the
class names which you need to use inside
the project so here is just my HTML page
and you can see here I have included two
links in this head section right you can
see here first is the bootstrap for CDN
link and the next one is the anime dot
CSS that is 3.5 point to version and you
can get this serial link from the getter
page you can see here you can
use this link or you can use this one
you can use any one right so this is
just a simple way to get started with
this library now we will write some HTML
right I'm gonna take one div tag with
the class container and I'm gonna say
header I'm gonna take next Center text
white these all are bootstrap four
classes so don't get confused inverse
you can say P 5 P 5 means padding 5
right so in this header I'm gonna take
one h1 tag with the class display 3 and
I'm gonna say animate CSS
animate or css sorry so let's save it
and let's see the preview inside the
browser how it is looking as you can see
here it looks beautiful
right the background is inverse but you
can change it to primary or you can use
any color you want using bootstrap so
let me take one section here below this
header and I'm gonna give some class now
I'm gonna give the ID section 1 sorry
section 1 and also I'm going to use some
classes like
b:g faded
busy faded p5 and I want margin top and
bottom to be three pixels so I'll use my
three pixels inside this I'm gonna use
one h1 tag
and I'm gonna say section 1 below this
h1 tag I'm gonna use P tag lorem
if some
tap no it is not working Lauren right it
is working now I'm gonna remove these
three the last three lines
right so this is our first section
inside the container and here is the
header right and you can see here
so let's save it let's see the preview
inside the browser as you can see here
section 1 with the dummy content so I'm
gonna use one more section inside the
HTML inside this HTML file and I'm gonna
say section 2 and this one to be section
to save it and let's see write the two
sections along with the header are
appearing on the screen and let me use
or buttons here
right and let's give the name of the
button to button button primary
and let's see
get started here or you can say get
started only right save it
see in the browser it is appearing here
you can see here so this is just a
simple HTML file with some simple CSS
now I'm gonna use animate dot CSS
library so already we have imported the
Sirian link you can see here at the top
in the head section now I'm gonna show
you how you can do it here is just a
simple example all you need to do is you
need to include this animated class
first and then your animation actual
animation class so we have a bunch of
different classes here you can see here
there are different classes you which
you can use it inside your project so
let me use this animated class for the
header section
and along with this I'm gonna use
sliding down class
right save it and let's see the preview
how it is looking right it is looking
fantastic and it is sliding in down the
hazard section in this in this page
right so let's use some different
classes as well for these two sections
so let's use the same class animated
here for the section 1 and also use the
sliding left class for the first section
and let's refresh it and it is sliding
in from the left side
we're gonna use the same class but with
different direction for the
second section that is sliding right
save it so you save it and let's see
yeah the three sections are the header
and the two sections are using anime dot
CSS library and they are showing some
nice animations so we will look now we
will take a look now how we can modify
some properties how we can manipulate
some properties CSS properties in this
is animate dot CSS library so for this
we need one style or CSS file so that we
can play around with so here is my style
dot CSS file and I'm gonna use section 1
ID and I'm gonna use some properties
like animation delay you might have
heard about this properties if you were
building custom CSS animations without
using animated CSS library so these are
some beautiful properties which you
could use inside your CSS file to delay
the animation for a few seconds
animation delay 3 seconds right
animation
duration I want this animation deviation
for five seconds let me change this to
two and let's change this to one to see
the initial preview
let's save it yeah you can see here it
takes one minute of delay let me use
three seconds here and let's use the
duration for five seconds or five
seconds let's refresh it no it is still
not working let me use the correct
I D here
right
i D
save it and let's refresh it you can see
here it stucks
and it takes three seconds and it takes
five seconds to come in right it gives
the three seconds delay and it takes all
five seconds for the duration for the
animation and we have one more beautiful
property called animation iteration
count iteration count of three I want
this animation to be iterated four three
times so let's refresh it
and you can see here
one
this is the first animation and it is
the second animation and
the third one you can say you can see
here so we have beautiful properties
custom CSS properties which you can play
around with so I'm gonna change this to
0 and I'm gonna change this to 1 so
let's use the same properties except the
an animation iteration gone for the
second section right so let's remove
this
and let's change this to two three
seconds right let's save it
yeah
you can see here also we can give
infinite as well so it it continuously
animates yeah you can see here it is
animating infinitely right you can see
here we can stop here using just by
giving number two so I'm gonna refresh
it one two right it stops so here is
teacher here I have shown you just a
simple demo of animate dot CSS and I've
also shown you how to get started with
this library hope you understand and
