another video and in this video I'm
gonna say I'm gonna show you something
interesting and that is a frame and you
might have heard about this a web
framework that allows you to create
virtual reality experiences with HTML
yes you heard it right it's a web
framework for building virtual reality
experiences and you can make web VR with
HTML and if you have oculus rift or
Google cardboard then you can actually
be in this environment let me show you
some examples to understand and I'll
also show you how to get started with
this framework so let's get started
so here is the basic example hello web
VR it's a virtual reality web experience
and you can see you can create this kind
of experiences using this framework you
just have to include this library this
beautiful framework then you can get
started with this so it's a beautiful
and if you click this cardboard then you
can be in this environment in the full
screen so it's it's kind of spear and
the box and one cylinder so we'll also
see some more examples of this framework
we can actually create some beautiful
things like this one 360 image right
it's a 360 mage you can see and the text
is appearing at the bottom it is in
France right so let's see some more
examples like 360 image gallery yeah
this kind of experiences you can create
using this a frame framework let's move
to the next part of this next example of
this framework is animation so it's
beautiful and the lovely environment
virtual reality experience so if you
move around if you
go along with this you can see the
colors the different color of Spears are
appearing on our screen and when we
enter into the full mode we can see some
beautiful animation is going on on the
screen so let's dive in and let's get
started and I'll show you how to get
started with this so all you need to do
is you need to get started with this I
have already created already opened the
page on my tab if you want to build a
basic scene of virtual reality with HTML
then you can get started with this
documentation so here you can find
building a basic scene you have to start
from here so that you can understand
clearly it it starts by building a basic
a-frame scene so for now we have we
should have a basic understanding of
HTML if we really want to create virtual
reality experiences using this framework
so when we scroll down we can actually
see some HTML here so it's a basic HTML
all we need to do is we need to include
this script tag it's Syrian script tag
in our HTML file I have created one
simple HTML file and I have already
included bootstrap but in your case you
don't need a bootstrap and found awesome
you just need to include this script tag
in your head of the HTML file and you
just need to include the a scene a scene
is actually a virtual reality scene
inside your HTML file that allows you to
create some virtual reality entities so
that you can see some beautiful
animations and you can experience
virtual reality on your screen so let's
copy this a scene and include this
inside the body of the HTML so let's
save it and let's move to the file let's
refresh it to see the preview yeah you
can actually see it it it is working
fine our cardboard is appearing at the
bottom of the of the screen right so
let's move ahead
let's create an entity I already said
you that if we create a scene then we
need to include some entities like spear
plane or sky or we have boxes as well so
we have to include one entity inside the
a scene
so in in this example we are going to
include a box which is of color red so
inside this a scene let's copy this and
let's see the preview inside the browser
the box is appearing but it is not
showing me on the screen something is
happening here let's refresh it one more
time no it is not appearing let's move
to the documentation part and yeah we
need to include this box right
this a box means a frame box which is of
color red and we have some we have some
attributes like rotation and scale but
let me show you this attributes later so
first we need to include the position of
this box and if you want to understand
about the position you can see this
example transforming it and three and
entity in 3d right we have three
dimensions the x axis the y axis and the
z axis so these are the three axis so we
need to pass the value here we can pass
it using this position attribute 0 comma
1 comma minus 5 let's refresh it and
let's yeah the box is appearing on the
screen and it is in the virtual reality
experience woohoo yeah you can see here
on the screen so if we give position
like this x axis Z a y and z axis then
we can see the box the red color box on
our screen previously we have not used
this position attribute so it was not
appearing
on the screen but it is now appearing on
the screen so let's take one more thing
on the screen let's say a spear a spear
right so let's use this and let's say
color equals to blue and I want the
position of this spear as 2 comma 1
comma minus 5 right you can learn more
about the position dimensions of this
entity box and spear or any entity on
the documentation but you can see this
kind of things on the documentation
let's refresh it and let's check the
preview yeah the spear is appearing on
the screen right and it is in the
virtual reality experience right you can
see here so if you understand about
these 3 dimensions let's move towards
the beautiful things and we have some
more beautiful attributes like rotation
and the scale let me tell you about the
scale scale means if you want your your
entity to be off like if you want this
entity this prnt to be more than this
box yeah if you want some big spear on
the screen of double size than the box
then you can use this scale attribute so
let's use it and let's refresh the
browser yeah you can see here the the
spear is of double size from the box
right so let's remove it for now let's
refresh it and the rotation attribute is
used for transforming your entity in 3d
in 3d right let me show you how you can
use this rotation attribute so let's use
this rotation attribute for the box this
box
yeah you can see here it is in the 3d
farm and we have passed three values X Y
Z zero 45 and 45 so it is showing in the
3d form and it looks beautiful so hope
you understand about the position
rotation and scale position is used just
for positioning the entity positioning
an entity and rotation is used for
showing the showing an entity in 3d form
and scale attribute is used for making
it large or if you want to show it in a
small form then you can use scale
attribute basically it defines the size
of an entity so hope you understand
about these three attributes so I'm not
going in depth and you can explore more
about this on the documentation and I
will provide this link a frame link in
the description you can get it from
there so let's move to the next part and
let's use this entire scene this is the
ready-made scene on the documentation
which you can include inside your HTML
file and you can see the virtual reality
experience with HTML so let's indent our
code right it's just a scene with the
box with position rotation and color
attributes we have one more entity
called Spears cylinder and plane and the
last one is sky so let's use this
entities inside our HTML file and let's
refresh it and see the preview inside
the browser
it looks amazing we have spear cylinder
and the plane and we have also a box
right so if we change the value of this
box the rotation value of this box to 75
and we'll refresh it and you'll see the
preview right it is transforming and it
is rotating in the 3d form
and you can see this in a beautiful form
so if you click this like I have already
shown you if you click this you can
enter into the full mode and if you have
oculus rift or Google cardboard you can
actually be in this environment and you
can enjoy this beautiful and lovely
virtual reality experience so hope you
understand about the a-frame that is a
web framework that allows you to create
a virtual reality experiences with just
HTML with just few lines of HTML so and
I hope you really like this video and
thanks for watching this video and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
