tag helper so in our previous video we
have created forms using HTML helpers
using some razors index and another way
we can create forms the we can create
forms is tag helpers using tag helpers
we can create forms in the previous
video as you have seen that I have
created forms using HTML helpers and now
in this video I am going to show you how
to create forms using estimate AG
helpers so basically what are tagged
helpers we're gonna see little bit
introduction to tag helpers and later on
we can code and let and we'll see how we
can create forms using tag helper so
let's get started
so in this video I would like to show
you how to play give the tag helpers
basically tackle parts are like regular
HTML helpers they are used to create
forms dynamically and it uses his tml
tax not razor syntax as i have said HTML
helpers uses head razor syntax but not
the tag helpers tag helpers are more
flexible and they are dynamic what are
the differences between the tag helpers
and the HTML helpers we are going to see
few of the differences between them the
false difference is the HTML helpers
uses the results in tax and it is taken
by razor view engine to get processed
whenever we create forms using esteem
and helpers that HTML helpers is going
to be processed by razor engine because
HTML helpers uses reserve syntax tag
helper looks like a regular HTML tags
they won't get processed by razor engine
and HTML helpers are not flexible and it
depends on razor engine as I have said
they are depend they are dependent on
razor engine so obviously razor engine
is going to process HTML helpers tackle
birds are flexible they are more
flexible and more dynamic and it doesn't
require any engine it is going to be
processed by like a regular HTML tag so
some of the tag helpers which we are
going to see in this video while coding
a our form tag forum asp controller you
can see here this is the form tag and
this is the attribute asp controller
this indicates that this form is going
to submit under the home controller and
which action is going to call to be
called that is
index action how we are indicating that
using these attributes that are SP
controller and asp action so like form
tag we have another tags for label and
for input and for validation label tag
it is used for a property which is
present inside the model so this
indicates or this is linked to a
particular property what about this
input tag this input input tag is for a
particular property like I said for the
label tag this input tag is similar to a
label tag is before it represents that
it is linked to a particular property
and the validation does the same as like
label and input this validation tag is
used to indicate the error messages or
warning messages this is also linked to
a particular property inside the model
oh let's code now and let's see how we
can create the forms using tag helpers
so this is the home controller inside
this home controller I would like to
give one action method that is for is
for the tag helpers return view I am
returning the view if this action gets
called save this and let's create a view
for a tag helper from the phone if tag
helpers page so inside this home folder
I am going to add a new item that is the
MVC view page copy the same name you can
see here tag helpers if you are giving
the action method name as
helpers then you need to give the same
to the view page it's a convention like
I said before in my earlier videos so i
am going to delete all this stuff and
this is the view page for the tag
helpers in this view page we are going
to create forms using tag helpers but
before that i would like to create a
model that model is going to present
inside this models folder right click on
this model folder add a new item or a
class model is just a class let's take
the model name as contacts hit enter
this creates your model inside this
model I am going to take some properties
prop tap tap it's a shortcut or it's a
short way to create the properties i am
going to take the string and the name
another property is for the email and
the last property is for the mobile
number let's save this model and let's
hop to the tag helpers view page what
i'm going to do is I'm going to access
this model folder i am going to access
this model that that model contacts
model inside this tag helpers view page
how we can do this by taking added
symbol it represents razor then type
model then the application name bang cap
dot models.com tax so this way you can
access all the properties of contacts
model and now you can create your form
but before doing that I would like to
take one h1 tag and let's say
let's create forms using tag helpers
save this and if you are a newbie to
asp.net code I would like to suggest one
website that is talks dot microsoft.com
/ a speed or / en US / asp net core this
is the website to get started with
asp.net core and you can find all stuff
related to MVC and other domains or
other platforms of dotnet dotnet core so
this is the wonderful place to get
started with asp.net core you can visit
this website and this website also
consists the introduction to tag helpers
and HTML helpers so on the basic on the
first page you are able to see the MVC
pattern the structure of MVC how MVC
works all stuff related to asp.net code
so visit this website if you are a
newbie so in before doing the forms
before creating the forms with HTML help
which ties with using tag helpers I
would like to save this and I would like
to give some attributes to these
properties like display
so it is giving me an issue and you can
see here if I press escape the red
squiggly I can see here that's because I
haven't include the using statement of
this attributes the short way the
shortcut to key to include the using
statements of any attributes is
controlled dot control dot gives you the
intelligence you can see here using
system.componentmodel of data
annotations inside this using statement
these attributes are present display
name equals to your name
copy down this attribute and paste it
for all properties of this model and
also I would like to give error message
uh
message it is not showing
you can
use any one of these attributes to this
property's display I have taken already
this active you display comma error
message
comma
error you can display the error message
for these attributes for these
properties using one attribute called
error message and for that you have to
include the error message attribute here
and the error message attribute using
statement here at the top of the page in
this using statement section so let's
create the form and let's say ASP you
can see when i type asp it is giving me
some options it is giving me some kind
of options if i hit enter you can see
here asp action is we all wrote all
route data anti forgery area controller
this is the controller when i hit enter
if i take asp controller attribute in my
form it get the color gets changed to
dark purple it gets purple in color it
indicates that this tag this entire form
tag is using a tag helper so it
indicates tag helpers so I'm going to
take my controller name inside this a
speed controller and asp action will be
tagged Alpert's let's save this and
let's say the method of the form should
be post inside this form I'll take one
div tag and let's say ESP validation
somebody for model only
and below this tag I would like to take
a label but before that I would like to
take a div tag and let's take a class
called form group inside this form group
I would like to take a label and let's
say is before this label is for a
particular property that is for the name
you can see here when i type name it is
showing the property names which I have
given in my model so this is for the
name and let's take input and the class
for this should be the form control and
SP for name this input field is for the
name property so you can see here when I
give a SP for or HP controller action
any kind of attributes any kind of time
helpers that entire tag gets in purple
color so this indicates the tag helper
when you see this curl it simply
represents the tag helpers so I am going
to change this email to I am going to
change this name to email property and
let's change this name to email it safe
and let's take another form group for
mobile noble let's copy this so we are
we all we are done with this three
properties which we have given in the
contacts model now we have to take a
button tag here the class of the button
will be button success
and we can give the name of the botanist
submit hit save and let's hop to the
controller and let's say return view if
the user submits the form then this form
is going to return the view because i am
not writing any logic here i just simply
return the view and they're simply
returning the view the because i don't
want any kind of logic in my controller
part in my action part i just want you
to create i just want you to learn how
to create forms using tag helpers and
also i want to show you some of the
differences between tag helpers and the
HTML helpers so you can see here if I
hop to the HTML helpers part this was
the part which i have shown you in my
previous video and this is the new part
this is the new part you can see here
there are lot of differences between
this htmlhelper HTML helpers represents
you estimate helpers represents by razor
at the rate using HTML dot begin form
this begin form is a method which starts
the form so in this begin form method we
give our controller name action name and
all the stuff about the HTML forms HTML
helpers so this represents the razor and
also we have taken many more HTML helper
tags to represent our form so this way
you can create the forms using HTML
helpers and also you could create the
forms using tag helpers from my point of
view tag helpers are more dynamic and
they are more flexible so this this is
all about the tag helpers using this you
can create the forms dynamically and
they are more flexible hope you enjoy
