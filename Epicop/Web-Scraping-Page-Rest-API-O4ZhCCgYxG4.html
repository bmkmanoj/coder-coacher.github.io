column from a pickup and today I'm going
to share one interesting topic with you
and that is page dot REST API yeah it is
a awesome API and if you love scraping
then definitely we would love this API
because it allows you to extract content
from any web page as Jason and it is
just only four five dollars and it's it
is a it's validity period is for one
year you can buy this API on this page
and that is page dot rest it's generally
a nest stdp api and you can extract
content as I said earlier and you can
get any attributes like title
description and even it allows you to
scrape open graphs content and embedded
content as well so this is a beautiful
API so I am gonna show you how you can
use it to scrape any web page so let's
get started
this is the pace tourists main homepage
you can visit this page and you can
follow the instructions to use this API
and if you if you want to buy this API
then you can use this link and access
token if you open this then definitely
we - you need to fill this form and your
credit card number and you can get your
access token and is as I said earlier it
is one-time fee of five dollars and it
is valid for one year and let me tell
you you can call one lakh you can make
one lakh calls per day to scrape any web
page or you can escape any n number of
web pages but you can only make one lakh
calls per day so this is a limitation of
this API so we will see how we can use
this in this video so this is my website
my company website which I am working as
a web developer that is plug matter calm
and we create plugins WordPress plugins
and we also give 24 into seven WordPress
support as well so this is the website
of my company you can visit this if you
need any wordpress support so I am going
to scrape this website and I'm going to
show you show you how you can use page
REST API using this website and also let
me show you the support team we are 13
members and you can see here these two
are cofounders of my company Namath and
Akram
and here you can see my photo Musa
developer so this is my photo on the
wordpress support page we as I said
earlier VR 13 we have a team of 13 these
two are managers so let's scrape this
home page first and we will see how we
can scrape using the basic method the
first one is the basic method you can
request a basic call to that website and
you can extract title description logo
fav icons and canonical URL as well so
let's give the URL here let's paste it
here and let's let me explain you this
code you need to add your token here
after getting an access token you need
to add in this variable and you need to
pass inside the token attribute as you
can see here paste dot rest
fetch token equals with token and URL
equals to URL this is the query simple
query which you need to use in order to
ask in order to extract content from any
web page so let's run this and let's see
the output to your output here on the
right side as you can see here title is
plug matter home when we hover on this
page as you can see plug mater home is
the title description is null canonical
URL and the status is 200 we got every
information it's just a basic default
request from page REST API let's see
some more advanced queries in order to
as in order to scrape some content like
I'll show you we will see we will see
the content of this button will scrape
this will scrape the content of this
button let's click and inspect this
button and let's use this class
let's use this class call home CTA
buttons let's copy these class and give
it inside the selector right
you have to give your token here your
URL and your query pays REST API fetch
token and URL in inside selectors you
need to give your class or ID you could
also give ID la ID attribute as well and
I'm in my case I am taking class
so let's hit dot and paste that class
let's change the URL as well that is
plug matter com
let's paste it here
and let's see the content of that button
this button get opt-in feature box
plugin let's run this yeah you can see
here the title description and inside
the selectors as we have selected home
CTA buttons we can see the text get
opt-in feature box plugin which is this
button and also we can see the HF of
this button feature box as you can see
here right and the class as well so this
is just a simple JSON which we get as an
output from this URL and using this
selector so this is just a selector
query you can use any selector like it
is also mention here that it is a
documentation from Mozilla you can learn
more about CSS selectors in this
documentation class IDs and also we can
give attributes as well like if you have
a CH ref attribute inside your anchor
tag then you could use that right and
even if you have some more HTML
attributes then you can use that
attributes easily to scrape the content
of that particular HTML element right
simple selectors attribute pseudo
classes pseudo elements as well
combinators and even you can use
multiple selectors as well so let's use
the multiple selector here we have view
we have seen how we can use only one
selector now we will see we can you how
we can use multiple selectors let's give
an equals and selector equals two let's
see some other thing like this we can
use this button get pricing table right
when we inspect this element no it is
also same class we can use this contact
support right real green CTA buttons
right so let's use this class as a
multiple selector in our case let's hit
run and we'll see contact support text
get rising table yeah you can see here
contact support inside our JSON output
and HF is support and even we can see a
real green CTA buttons as our class
which we have even inside our selector
so even also we can scrape the style as
well as you can see here margin top is
10 pixels
let's see the next part of this API that
is pre render content I'm gonna use
another URL for this pre render content
it generally extract content from pages
that render on client site using
JavaScript you as you can see here it
pre renders the content of a web page
which is getting rendered on client side
using javascript let's see the example
of this page I have another website open
on my browser here that is seismic comp
which is also owned by my company that
is plug matter we have another website
that is make will paste it here and
we'll see the pre-rendered content all
you need to do is you need to write the
same query and also you need to pass
pre-render equals to 1 means you are
telling that you are going to pre render
the content of that page that then
definitely you need to pass it as one so
lets hit run and will see the output as
jason on the right side box
it is taking much time
next we will see the embedded embedded
content embedded content as well I think
it is taking more time
let's hit let's use this URL as well
the default URL which is given inside
that I you can see here title
description canonical URL selectors
listing title it is M it is an empty
array let's use this Tesla comm URL /
curriers / departments so we'll use this
URL and run to see the pre-rendered
content of this webpage
it is taking much time I don't know why
yeah it is running now that we got the
Jason response search for jobs and Tesla
is the title description is given is
also given here as you can see here we
have a lot of Jason response the big
Jason response in that case we got a
listing title has an empty array because
listing title is not there on Sesame
claps so I did something wrong here
while using seismic calm URL so anyhow
we got Jason response this is a
pre-rendered content which you can give
which you can get by passing pre-render
request one you can know more about pre
render content on this page rest API
documentation let's move to the embedded
content yeah if you need to use if you
want to use embedded content from any
page then you need to pass imbed equals
to one as we are doing pre-render equals
to one
inside the pre render content section so
all you need to do is you need to pass
your query page REST API query fetch and
you need to pass imbed equals to one you
need to give a medic worst one this is a
YouTube URL when we open this we'll see
one video
we'll see this first
as you can see here this is an this is a
video
right so we'll close this
what we are doing here is wheelchair we
are using embedded equals to one and we
are getting all the response as in
adjacent format title description and
even the URL canonical URL as well and
also we are getting icons logos
everything we are getting and even you
can see here the embed embedded
attribute we are getting an iframe which
we can use it in any HTML page to get
that video on our page so this is the
use of embed embedded content in page
list API you can easily get an iframe
tag from embedded content of any video
so this is all about embedded content
let's move to the Open Graph so it is
given here New York Times technology
will use another URL to understand about
Open Graph and if you need to know more
if you want to know more about Open
Graph then you can visit this URL that
is ogp dot me it enables any web page to
become a rich object in social graph so
you can explore this web page to know
more about Open Graph so in this video
we are not going to show you about Open
Graph let's use this BBC
website for Open Graph will use this URL
and we'll see how we can use how we can
scrape this URL using open graphs method
lets it run you need to pass Oh G equals
to 1 for open graph remember this right
we are getting everything Spain expected
to imposed direct direct rule right we
are getting this URL
to remove Catalan powers here we can see
yeah Spain expected to remove Catalan
powers this is a text which we are
getting here inside our title and the
description the description the Spanish
cabinet we are getting everything and
also we are getting canonical URL as
well right so this is the use of Open
Graph now let's see the response headers
response headers means you can power you
can get any has TDP headers defining the
response in this case in this example it
is given here that it is using github
URL to get HTTP headers define in the
response all you need to do is you need
to pass header equals to X frame options
and header equals to x x SS x cross site
scripting prediction and the content
security policy these three headers you
need to pass inside your query to get
any HTTP headers of any webpage in this
case it is using it is given here get up
get up web page get up home page so we
are getting as a response and even we
are getting headers part as well x frame
options x access protection cont content
security policy
so using this way you can use this page
rest api
to scrape any webpage and it is only
just for $5 and it is valid for one year
so go ahead and buy this beautiful and
wonderful API to scrape any webpage open
is clear so far and I hope you
