epic op and in this video i would like
to show you
nested object d structuring in
javascript and also i would like to show
you the nested LED structuring as well
so basically we can see how we can be
structured the long objects and how we
can retrieve a particular and a specific
value from an object so here I have
created two functions so what I'm going
to show you is destruction of objects
destruction of arrays nested object
destructuring nested array destructuring
and the d structuring and renaming of
objects as well while retrieving the
value so i have created one function
called make item here you can see here
it returns an object that is there is a
data object and here inside this data
object we have one more object called
item and inside this item we have two
properties called name and size and
sizes again a an object size is also an
object inside the item parent object so
we have two different properties called
US and EU inside the size object so this
is actually a nested object so now I
would like to show you how you can D
structure this object this nested object
and how you can retrieve a specific
value from this object so the basic
method of retrieving a value from an
object is by creating an instance of an
object right by creating an instance of
the function
so let's remove these all lines from
here Const response equals to make item
our function so this is an instance
which we are creating right what if I
want the data from the response right
response dot data and if I want the
status object status property from the
response I would like to use this
response dot status but before that I
would like to show you the the output of
this result object response so let's
save it sorry
let's save it and let's see one more
time we have two different objects
inside this function data and status and
inside data we have sub objects as well
nested objects as well so we are console
logging this response here and we can
see the preview here you can see here we
got two objects from the response data
and status if we if we open this we can
see here the item name and the size
object as well but what if I want the
particular objects from this a written
statement from that function so I would
like to use this statements data and
status so that I can display inside the
console right cons data response door
data save it so it will console.log this
console log statement or will only show
the data object you can see here item
and pant size as well so we have to
write this three lines for calling for
retrieving two different objects but I
want to retrieve it in one line so for
that let's remove this
let's create data commas Terrace right
so using these two things we can using
this to stay using these two objects we
can retrieve the data right I would like
to use the curly braces here for
displaying these two objects of the
response save it and let's see the
preview yeah you can see here we are
getting data and status as well this is
just a simple way we are not using we
are not destructuring the object yet but
soon we will see how we can restructure
the object and array as well in in this
in this video so this is a simple way of
retrieving two objects from this make
item function because it returns to
objects data and status so now what I
would like to show you is how we can
destructure the object right so here you
can see that I want only data item so I
can see I can use the status if I want
the status object from the from and make
item function so that I can edit it here
status right so it alert Z in stock
because it contains in stock in status
right here I want the data item I want
data item but I want only this item this
item right so we can restructure this
data into an item and we can console dot
log the data
so let's see the error first right I
have this structure here the nested
object destructuring starts here this
data object contains this item object
this nested object and I want this item
nested object from this data object so I
have these structured here using this :
and these brackets this curly brackets
now I want to display this item here but
I am displaying the data item let's see
the error first if i refresh this then
you can see here unexpected uncut
reference error data is not defined
obviously we have changed the data I
data object to the item object now it
becomes item we cannot access or we
cannot reduce the value of data this is
the way how we can restructure the
object in JavaScript so this is one of
the best parts of es6 which I really
like and which I personally think that
is that is wonderful about es6 you can
see here I have console.log the item
nested object and I got the output
inside the console named pants size and
eu-us you can see here but I want the
name property of nested item object so
here we can further this structure as
much as you want if you go deep then you
can restructure the items then you can
destruction the objects and arrays as
well in JavaScript this is the beauty of
es6 I want the name of the item right if
I console.log if I want to display this
item we cannot again it gives the same
error I have to use this name here sorry
I have to save this refresh it you can
see here the
when you scroll up you can see the item
this nested object item has the property
called name right
I want the size as well along with the
name so for that we need to use this
size commas comma size right and I would
like to display this size as well so for
this we need to use curly braces comma
size so let's save it and let's see the
preview inside the browser you can see
here it looks wonderful
the name is appearing and the size is
appearing again the size is also a
nested object so that we can restructure
it further it looks beautiful
so let's go ahead and destructure the
object so let's do structure the size
object nested object further and let's
say us comma EU right save it now we
cannot display the console or we cannot
display or we cannot also lock this size
object because it is no more present
inside our response so let's save it and
let's try to insulate again we got the
same error we can display it u.s. comma
EU right let's save it and you can see
here the name is appearing pants and you
is 34 and US is 32 right let me show you
the quick thing about renaming inside
the restructuring of objects this is the
beauty of es6 again you can rename the
objects right easily without having any
problem or without thinking much about
it right
what if you want to name this US
property to something called normal
and if you want to rename this EU
property or the size object to something
called difficult right so you can rename
it easily so US and EU properties are no
more available in this response let's
save it and let's try to retrieve the
value again you can see here US is not
defined it is now normal
u.s. becomes normal and u becomes
difficult yes you can see here when i
refresh it it gives this exact result
named pants normal 32 difficult 34 yeah
you can see here so this is the beauty
of es6 is the beauty of javascript you
can rename it you can restructure it you
can do everything you want right so
let's head over to the IRA items right
what if you want to restructure the
array right so we can see here let me
create one variable for this array of
items is the function it returns an
object this data object and again this
data object consists one items array and
also we have one more object called
status out of stock right so let's
consider the same thing which I have
shown you above before starting
destructuring the objects in es6 so
let's cancel out log
dot log the response you can see here
the data the data and the status here
again data consists of items we have two
items right so I want this data comas
Terrace and I would like to D structure
the data object into an item right so I
want
item right item
sorry items so I want to display these
items first here inside this console dot
log statement I hope you are really
enjoying this video and I hope you are
getting my points what I am trying to
explain you here we have two items here
you can see here this first object is
t-shirt with the price is 100 right
again we have two items so I want this
item 1 comma item 2 I want to display
the first item here oh no it is not it
is not showing me because I was doing
wrong I was missing one thing here
because we cannot be structure arrays as
we have be structured objects the syntax
is different so for this for
destructuring
arrays you need to use the curly braces
right item 1 comma item 2 this is the
beauty of a data structuring in
JavaScript so here I would like to
display the item 1 first yeah you can
see here the name teacher and the price
hundred what if you want the two items
in the same console dot log statement so
for that we need to use curly braces
item 1 comma item 2 it is simple it is
very simple yeah you can see here the
item 1 and the item 2 in the same object
so this way you can restructure the
items of an array and this way you can
destructor the objects and the
properties so hope you really enjoy this
video and hope you like this video and
if you don't know about arrays
restructuring and object destruction in
JavaScript you can head over to some
dogs and you can
read more about it so that you can
understand easily because it is it is
difficult to understand for beginners I
can understand it is something different
so we need to practice it for
understanding more about D structuring
of objects and arrays in JavaScript so
