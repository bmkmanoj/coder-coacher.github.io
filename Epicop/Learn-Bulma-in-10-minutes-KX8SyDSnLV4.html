are doing good today and in this video
we are going to learn Bulma in just 10
minutes this is an introductory tutorial
to the popular CSS framework so Bulma is
a popular CSS framework it is similar to
bootstrap if you have bootstrap then you
can easily understand this framework and
you can get started with this it's a
simple elegant and modern CSS framework
with a bunch of different and beautiful
UI components and lot of developers
prefer this bull more em work over
bootstrap so we can see how we can get
started with this so let's jump to the
documentation of bulma that is bull
murat io if you visit this documentation
then you can see the installation
process first if you want to get started
with this then you need to run this
command this npm command on your
terminal or if if you want to use a CDN
link for this and you can grab the link
from here so I have taken the serial
link in my HTML file here I have pasted
it here you can see the minified version
of Bulma so in this video I'm gonna show
you how we can create some beautiful
different UI components it is similar to
bootstrap as I said earlier so we have
different things like columns layouts
forms and and you can use mix-ins
functions as well so we are not going in
depth we can see the overview of Bulma
and we can see how we can actually get
started with this framework so in
Willmar we have two main things that are
modifier classes if you see the modifier
section here right here you can see two
modifier classes that are is and has
I'll show you what it is so let's get
started with the Bulmer framework so now
I'm going to create a simple button with
the class button so if we hit tab and
let's just say click here save it and
let's see
view inside the browser as you can see
here click here button appears on the
screen and we have different classes
like if you want to give some colors
some background colors to the button you
can use its success as I said earlier is
and has are modified classes so its
success means let's just reference this
and you can see the green color button
appears on the screen so it gives the
background color or green background
color to the button
this is success class this is a modified
class right now I want this to be a
large button so I'll just say is large
so that it so it it is large button
right now I want this to be in the round
shape let's say is round it save it and
you can see the rounded button has
appear on the screen now let's move
forward and let's see the columns inside
the bulma so columns and rows are the
important part of a responsive design so
let's just create a column right with
the diff columns I'm gonna say columns
and inside these columns I want four
columns so div with the class column I'm
gonna say this is as a first column
sorry first column and I want four
columns so I'll just pay a copy this
same column and I'll just paste it four
times so let's change it to second and s
to third and this to fold save it and
let's see the preview inside the browser
as you can see here only the text is
appearing and we cannot even see the
outline of the columns and the width of
the columns so for that we need a
special class of bulma that is
notification
if you head over to the documentation if
you go in-depth you can see the
notification notification class so let's
remove this text from here let's take a
pee tag a paragraph tag and let's give a
notification class to this P and you can
say is success
I want this column this first column to
be in green color so that's why I am
using the success class modifiers of
Bulma let's remove this text second
column and let's say let's just say is
info and I will change this first column
to the second and I want this I want to
change this for success class to the
warning class so we have different
colors and we have different
multicolored columns on the screen
finally we have a danger class let's
just say fourth column save it and let's
see the preview inside the browser as
you can see here we have four different
color columns so success info warning
and danger so here we have a
notification class that is actually
making the columns larger and it looks
beautiful on the screen so let's move
forward and let's see the hero how we
can create a hero in bulma hero is just
a simple section with a color and we
have also a text inside the hero so for
that we need to take a section tag of
HTML and let's give hero class and take
one div tag and let's say hero body
right inside this hero body you can say
this is a hero I'd save it
and you can see it the text is appearing
on the screen but I want before going
further I want to show you something
important about columns you can make the
columns larger or you can give any width
to the column by using the classes we
have different classes like I want the
first column this first column to take
the half width of the screen of the row
so I'll use the class here is half save
it
let's see yeah you can see here it takes
the half of it of this row of the column
right you can see the first column is
taking half of it now I want the second
column to take the one-third width of
the row so let's save it and you can see
the two columns the third and the fourth
is not responsive because it is taking
much space if we if we remove this is
half from the first column the yeah you
can see here and the columns are
responsive if you make your browser
screen small you can see here the risk
these are responsive columns and you can
easily align these columns on mobile and
tablets so let's go further we have
different classes like is 2/3 or is
one-third is one color you can use it
and you can explore more about this on
the full more documentation I am NOT
going in-depth so let's remove this
classes this modified classes from the
columns and let's see the hero part now
so this is a hero it's just text right
I want this section this hero section to
be in green not in green I want this in
blue color so I'll use this is info
class here and I'll refresh the page you
can see here is info class is
has been applied to this hero section
and the blue color is appearing on the
section and now I want this to be a
medium sized hero right so let's save it
yeah you can see here this is a medium
sized hero it is very cool and you can
create responsive UI components and if
you head over to the documentation you
can get a bunch of UI beautiful UI
components now I want this to be a large
right so let's just save it yeah you can
see here the large hero is appearing on
the screen so let's change it change
this to medium and let's remove this
text here
I want the h1 tag with the class title
this is also a Bulma class title and
this is my hero right and I want the h2
tag with the class with the class
subtitle yeah this is also Bulmer class
sub heading you can say so let's rip
preview the change in the browser here
you can see here this is my hero and the
subheading is appearing as a subtitle so
this is all about
Bulma and I hope you guys really enjoy
