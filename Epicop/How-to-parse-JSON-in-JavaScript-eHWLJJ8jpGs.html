in this video I would like to show you
two methods of Jason that are parse and
stringify
let me explain you what are these
methods and how to use these methods
basically parse method is used to
retrieve or to access data from a web
server and stringify method is used to
send the json formatted text to the web
server so this was this little
introduction about these two methods now
we will see how we can use this method
in our scripting language called
JavaScript so let's give next year like
convert string written into JSON format
using parts
stringify so basically these are the two
methods which we are going to use a more
in our scripting language let's give one
Peter here this P tag this paragraph tag
I am taking for to display the JSON
formatted text so first we need to
create one script tag under this script
we are going to write some text here
like you can take the name property take
name as separator comma take another
property called email and XYZ interior
gmail.com
put separator and take another property
called contact one two three four five
six so this is the string written this
is an object this we need to parse using
Jason parse text let's take another
variable called politics here in this
variable I would like two parts dub of
Jason using this statement we can parse
the text variable spring written text
variable in Jason because this is in the
form of string so we need to pass first
after that we can display using Dom now
I am calling Dom its document object
model document dot get element by tag
name I would like to give ID here
because we have taken P tag and ID is
given as demo so call this ID inside
this single quotations dot inner HTML
equals to parse text dot you can call
any property here of the parse text you
can call name or you could call email or
you could call your contact so I would
like to call name here give semicolon
save this in the editor let's hop to the
browser
hit refresh you can see here we are
getting the json formatted string on our
HTML page now let's give email here see
if we can see that email is working so
this is about the parse method hope you
understand about the parse method where
we can use it is used to retrieve or
access data from a web server now we'll
show something more interesting
that is stringify method of jason so for
that i would like to create one
javascript object inside this object i
would like to give title as mathematics
put separator here and addition
sixth after the title give here also
2017 let's say 2017 2017 puts operator
here and put semicolon here now I would
like to stringify this string if i text
jason dot stringify
inside this stringify
I would like to give parameter as books
now I would like to display this books
variable JavaScript object sorry
it was it is a JavaScript object
so this javascript object I have to
convert in a JSON format and I am doing
this using stringify method and now I
would like to show how we can show the
stringify text on our page but here you
might be wondering why I have given plus
here to append this thing if I text
because in that demo paragraph parsed
text is already there so if we want to
display the stringify text we need to
append this one so it gets appended
let's save this let's see in the browser
you can see here all the properties of
JavaScript is showing title mathematics
year 2017 and Edition six so it is in
same line you can separate this in
another line by adding or by appending
break tag here
you can see here no our parts and
stringify methods are working fine so in
this way you can parse your text and
receive data from a web server in jason
and you can also you could also string
if I you can also use stringify method
in jason using this way you can send and
receive data from a web server using
json format
hope you understand about the json
parser parson stringify methods hope you
like this video thanks for watching this
