musically and I am back with my another
tutorial in this tutorial you're going
to talk about asp.net core MVC so let's
get started without any further delay
let me give you the quick introduction
on asp.net code MVC so next move to the
next slide what is asp.net it's open
source web framework for building modern
web applications web api's and web
services it was introduced in march 31
2009 and it has a real-time features
like you can create websites based on
html5 css3 and JavaScript and let me
tell you about the asp.net coil it's
significant redesign of asp.net and it
is also in open source platform and it
is completely cross-platform framework
and it runs on all operating systems
like windows linux and mac and it is
also used for building garden web
applications as same as like as asp.net
and a spirit net core apps runs on
dotnet core framework and dot net full
dotnet framework and let me tell you
about the MVC architecture what is MVC
it stands for Model View and controller
and we see is it one of the asp.net
programming models it's a framework for
building modern web applications using
MVC design let me tell you about the
model model represents the application
data for instance if you have any
database then model is going to
represent that data it is going to
manipulate that data view displays
displays the data on the web page and
controller is going to handle the
incoming browser requests to user
requests and is going to handle all
actions of model and views so as you can
see here if you have a database then
controller is going to
you played that data or a model and it
responds to the user as per the request
this is the MVC architecture as you can
see when a client or when a user or
browser is going to make a request to
the web server the web service on the
web server we have some routes that
routes will be dispatched to the
controller and controller is going to
handle that request it manipulates the
model if there any model is there it
checks whether any model is there and it
returns it to W so this is all about MVC
architecture let's explore this more
further in detail in depth with our demo
application I have created one demo
application here what I did here is I
just create a model of user details as
you can see this is our model I have
created three properties here email
address mobile number and password and I
have given this email address dated I
bass email address and the password is
is password these are the annotations
server-side annotations for see shop so
these are our three properties so let's
take a look at our demo view page this
is overview page I'm going to call the
model of user details on my web page and
I am giving this web page title as demo
page and I am going to create a form on
the webpage as you can see here these
tags are purple in color while the rest
of tags are light gray because these
purple tags are tagged helpers these are
smart tag helpers which is going to read
our model data and manipulates that data
so let's explore this I have created one
form for the ASP controller home for
this controller and SP action is them
for this action as you can see
below here this is our action this is
our controller home controller so this
is for this div tag is for the model
summary and these three diff tags are
for the email address and another is for
mobile number and another is for
password and the last button is for
submit button for the creation of
account as you can take so after
creating after submitting this form the
control or the data of this web page
goes directly to the controller in our
action method this two actions are there
in our home controller one is for get
for the get request it returns only the
view only the empty form for the post it
is going to submit that model data to
this action as you can see here we are
accessing the model data user details
this model so it is going to check all
the field fields are filled or not is
validate model state dot is validate and
far if it is true then it moves insolent
it takes the email address in this view
data it's a dynamic object I'll tell you
later what is the use of this dynamic
object and simply it returns the view
else if this value is false then it
returns the back request object as you
can see in many web pages for for not
for error respond for this bad request
object is used so let's show you this
three tags we have and after submitting
the form after creating the form the
form will display the name the email
address of that user with the
successfully registered message so let's
run this application
and have a look how it works in this
application we can see now it is running
on localhost five double 989 using iis
Express we are running this application
is express is a asp.net web server for
local host yeah our application is ready
let's give the controller name post and
then the action name our action is demo
let's enter it I'm going to give
gmail.com let's give a number here and a
password let's create this yeah as you
can see the message for the email
address sadface at delayed gmail com
successfully register so this is all
about introduction to asp.net call MVC
web application it is a demo application
