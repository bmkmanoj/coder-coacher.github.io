Colleen from epic pop and today I'm
going to show you how you can easily
deal with your database using easy SQL
so before we dive in I would like to
walk you through about the easy SQL so
this is these are the files which you
need to download if you want to get
started with easy to spin but before
downloading this I would like to give
you a quick introduction of either SQL
and this is the website Justin Vincent
comm / easy scale and there is the
description or the introduction of easy
to scale given here these are a scale is
it open source PHP database library or a
class and it has been used on over
100,000 websites and it is the backbone
of many open source projects such as
WordPress this class makes it really
ridiculously easy to use my sequel
Oracle 8 SQLite etc within your PHP
script so hope you understand about the
easier scale this provides you the bunch
of features so that you can easily deal
with your database so now we will dive
in and we'll see how we can get started
with either SQL so either SQL is a is
hosted it is provided on github then
from there you can install all files all
the necessary files of either a scale
and the link is given here
get up calm slashes at SQL slash easy
SQL so this is the link you can use this
link to download all these necessary
files if you really want to get started
with easier SQL so there is option here
clone or download I have downloaded on
my PC if you need to download if you
want to download then you can click this
button so these are this is the
structure of easier SQL I have installed
on my local host and show you what are
the necessary files
in either SQL open this client script
this month this is my project called
client client script and inside this I
have different folders and I have
created one folder called lips libraries
and inside this I have I have taken five
files five PHP files and the two files
are either SQL files either SQL code dot
PHP is a task where my sequel I dot PHP
these two files are really really
important for easier to squirrel if you
want to get started with either SQL then
you need to keep these two files safe in
your project directory so these are the
two files and this is the simple HTML
Dom I have taken this file for doing web
scraping and these are the two custom
files which I have created for leaving
database connections or database
usernames and passwords so these are the
need you need to save in your project
directory either SQL code dot PHP and
easier SQL
my sequel I dot PHP so we will see one
example how you can use either SQL in
your web project so this is one file
called coaching Jason dot PHP inside
this I have included all files here you
can see here include conflict dot PHP
inside this config I have given my
database configurations you can see here
database user root as this is the
localhost and the password is set to
null and my database name is client
script and it is hosted on the localhost
so this is the conflict or PHP and
another file is DV dot PHP inside this I
have provided two files that is either
SQL code and either SQL
SQL my sequel I this these are the two
files which I have provided in DV dot
PHP so these are the two files these are
the two important files for either SQL
so these two files config dot PHP and DV
dot PHP I have included in this coaching
Jason dot PHP and I have also used
simple HTML Dom for web scraping and I
have set the maximum execution time of
the script to 900 and as you can see
here after including these two files DV
dot PHP and conflict or PHP you need to
give your connection variable connect DV
and your database name my database name
is Klein script as you can see here I
have my database open client script
inside transcript I have two different
tables one is new client data and the
next the last one is Wellness dir so I
am dealing with this table - dir and I
have some data in this table so I want
here
I want this data to be printed in a JSON
format using this script so later I'll
show you how you can call data from that
table and how you can print in a JSON
format for now I am showing you how you
can connect your connect to your
database using either SQL so after
including these two files you need to
give connect DB and your database name
and I am taking one variable called
results inside this result and I am
calling get results function in the
database DV variable you can see here
this is the global variable for either
SQL DB if you are using easy easier to
scale in your web projects then this
variable is very important as you you
need to fetch as you as if you want to
first or if you want to retrieve data
from your database tables then you need
to use this variable global variable of
easy rescuing DB and I am calling get
results select URLs from well as dir
with status equals to completed I have
given this query inside is get results
and I am taken one array called websites
inside that array I am getting those all
values from Vilnius dir and I am
printing this values in a JSON format
this using JSON encode function so let's
hop to the browser and let's click this
file coaching Jason dot PHP as you can
see here this is for this data is in a
JSON format you can see here these these
are the URLs which I have in my database
table this is the these are the US and I
have printed in a JSON format so using
the either SQL I have fetched all data
from the table and I have printed in
JSON format so there is another way of
debugging your database issues or
database errors in easier SQL is DB
debug
there is a way to debug database errors
in either SQL and this is the most
popular method of debugging there are
issues in easier easier SQL you can see
here I have all 31 rows in DVD bed
this shows the entire table of your
fetch data so this is the data which I
am trying to fetch from the table so
this is all about easy SQL hope you
understand about easier SQL and please
