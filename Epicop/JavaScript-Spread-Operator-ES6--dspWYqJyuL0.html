I'm gonna show you JavaScript spread
operator and that is also called as es6
spread operator and we'll take a look
we'll take a look about the rest
parameters as well and how we can
actually create functions with the rest
parameter and I wish you a very happy
new year as the new year is coming so
let's see and how we can use spread
operator in JavaScript
we'll see in this tutorial so let's get
started so here is my HTML file and I
have taken one script tag to define
spread operator in JavaScript so let me
use let me define a function first
firstly I'm going to show you the
previous method before spread operator
that is this way we can use it that is
we have to define a function that should
be anything like I'm gonna use I'm using
my channel name I pick up as a function
name here and I'm just console dot log
I'm just giving one line in that
function console dot log and let's say
arguments or we can say X Y Z right I'm
um console dot logging three parameters
and I'm gonna pass it here right so
let's say create a an array right with
three elements one two three one two
three sorry so we can use this array
inside this function right we can pass
if you want to pass this array inside
this epic op defined function which we
have defined above
then previously right let me write one
comment here
previous methods before spread operator
right this was the previous method right
let's use apply function and let's say
null comma marks right let's save it and
let's see in the browser yeah you can
see here one two three the three
elements of an array the three values of
an array are printing on the console so
this was the previous method before
spread operator and let me show you how
you can use spread operator in
JavaScript right so you don't have to
use this apply function anymore right
let's remove this function and let's
also remove this null parameter and this
one also let's use three dots that
represents your spread operator in
JavaScript let's save this let's see in
the browser
yeah the output is coming on the console
and you can see the result of that
function that is epoch off which takes
three parameters and it is printing
these those three values in the console
right so let me show you how you can
concatenate your arrays using spread
operator I'm writing comments so that
you can understand easily and I hope you
are enjoying this video right so
concatenate arrays using spread operator
as the New Year is coming and everyone
is busy and I hope you guys will surely
enjoy this new year 2018 with all these
new features in JavaScript so let me use
one one array that is where array one
right let's see let's say let's give
another name of this to this added that
that should be vegetables right
vegetables let's use cumber comma
cabbage right tomato so for now it is
okay right we have given three values
inside this array let's take one more
array and let's call it as fruits right
and let's say apple mango and banana
let's make it very simple so that you
can understand easily these are two
arrays which I have created and finally
I'm going to concatenate these two
arrays using the spread operated syntax
in JavaScript let's say we're foot
equals to dot dot dot vegetables comma
dot dot dot and your fruits here it
comes the concatenation of this two
arrays inside the foot array let's use
console dot log to see the output in the
console right let's save it and let's
see in the browser yeah you can see here
the array it has six values cucumber
cabbage tomato apple mango and banana
so using this way you can concatenate
your arrays using spread operator let me
show you how you can use your arrays to
find the maximum number from an array
like let's take one re-let num array
equals to 1 comma 2 comma 3 sorry 3
4 comma 5 these are the five values
which I'm using which I am giving inside
my array and let's say Const
result equals to Matt dot max and if you
don't know about this function then
definitely you need to go search it on
google about the mad dog max function
basically it it finds the maximum value
from an array from a given value it
finds the maximum value and it returns
to the user right let's say Matt dot max
dot dot dot num array right it will
return the maximum value from an array
let's use console dot log console dot
log and let's see
result save it and let's see in let's
see the preview inside the browser and
you can find the Phi is appearing here
below the array the below the
concatenated array the Phi is the
maximum value from this array so using
this way you can find maximum value from
an ally right value sorry from an array
using spread operator spread operator
so let's comment out this line right and
also you can play around with the play
around there with this spirit operator
in many ways and you can find more about
spread operators on internet and I will
show you one more service one more
library that is babbled Jas it's a
beautiful library and basically it
compiles your year-old generation next
generation JavaScript to the browser
compatible JavaScript as you can see
here the demo which has been showing
the homescreen of Babel jeez dot IO
website right you can try it here in
this tab you can write your next
generation JavaScript and you can get
the browser compatible javascript and
the reverse version of Babel is lahbab
dot io and here you can you can get the
latest the next generation JavaScript
from browser compatible JavaScript it's
a reverse version of Babel it does
exactly the opposite of Babel and you
can find about this on Lee Bob that IO
these are the two beautiful libraries
two beautiful JavaScript libraries and I
hope you really enjoy this video thanks
for watching this video and I'll see you
soon in next videos thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
