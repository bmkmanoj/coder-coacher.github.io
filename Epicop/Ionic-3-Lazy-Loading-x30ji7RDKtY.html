column from epic op and today we're
gonna take a look at lazy loading in
ionic 3 let's get started
so here is my page you can see here home
dot HTML and home dot PS file is open on
my visual studio code so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna delete this page I'm
gonna delete this page and I'll generate
a new one because this home page does
not contain any home dot module dot ES
file that is module component which
helps in lazy loading so we'll create a
new home page by typing ionic G page
page name is form then hit enter this
command will generate a new home page
for us and it also brings the module
component along with the page so that
model component will help us to create
lazy loading you know to give or to use
lazy loading in our ionic project so
we'll say no it is asking me to update
my onyx CLI plug-in so I'll ahead no and
this will generate a new page here so
I'll show you how you can use lazy
loading in ionic 3 lazy loading let me
tell you about lazy loading lazy loading
is when when you use lazy loading it
brings the pages or the components when
you require it doesn't load the page
unnecessarily so this will increase your
performance or this will increase your
performance of your app and it also
optimized the app so we'll see it is
yeah it is generated and now we can see
here we have a home page along with home
modular TS you can see here let me tell
you about ionic page modules this ionic
page module helps in lazy loading and
this comes from ionic angular and it as
you can see here in imports are a ionic
page module dot fourth child this
injects the page inside the home dot
HTML in the inside the home brought TS
file which I'll show you here as you can
see here we have a decorator called
ionic page this decorator helps in lazy
loading too late to load this home dot
HTML page now what we'll do is we'll
create another page to understand lazy
loading and we will give the name of
that page called contact with this name
we can generate a new page and now we
can see here how we can navigate through
or between two pages using lazy loading
so yeah you can see here we have a
contact page and it also contains module
component and what we'll do here is
we'll create a new button or ion button
inside the home page to navigate from
this page to the contact page which we
have created just now we'll give this
one we'll say I'm on button and we'll
give clear attribute and we'll call a
click event navigate to contact page
this method will be called and we'll
give contact page inside the button and
we'll save this and now we'll go to the
home dot TS file and inside this will
create a method with this name and I'll
use the nav controller
Nath's controller dot push method to
navigate between two vases as you can
see here this to this push method takes
a parameter and you can see here it
takes a parameter of type string days of
type string or page of page now
in the previous version we have seen
that we will we were not using lazy
loading technique to navigate or to load
components but now we are going to use
so here we can do one thing we can give
our page name like this of type string
we are not going to use any physical
page components here we'll just use the
name of the page as a string this will
navigate our page so we'll save this
file then say these two files and we'll
run this inside the browser ionic lab
this ionic lab will run our application
so I'll show you one more thing here and
that is inside the app dot module dot
yes we have given home page inside the
declarations array and we have also
assigned home pages in entry components
so we'll remove later and we'll see how
we can load this page so I'll show you
later how we can load our home page as a
lazy loading or lazy loading page so
this will run the app and we'll see the
lazy loading technique and our
application is ready now as you could
see here it is running it might take
some time yeah you can see here it is
ready and
hope you understand about the lazy
loading so far and also I will show you
about the home page component how we can
remove the component from a blood mold
or TS and how we can use inside the
abroad component of TS with loose load
realizing lazy loading sorry so when you
click this button you can see here it is
navigating to the contact page you can
see here it is working fine now we'll
see we'll remove this home page from AB
dot module dot TS and also we'll remove
this one as well and what we'll do here
is we'll save this file and we'll open
app dot component or TS you might have
noticed that while creating ionic app
our home page or our root page is set to
the home page and here you can see here
in app dot component PS that root page
is set to home page know what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna remove this import
statement and I'm gonna make this as a
type of string and what I'll do here is
I'll just set my root page which is of
type string to home page now we will
save this file will save this to files I
have dot modular TS and app dot
component or tears this will also run
our home page you could see here you can
see here that our home page is running
after setting the root page to home and
if we click this button it is navigating
to the contact page so hope you
understand about the lazy Mod lazy
loading in ionic 3 and hope you got this
and also how we can also you have
understand how we can use lazy loading
in ionic 3 so this is the way you could
use this to lazy load your pages or
while calling them unnecessarily you can
load your pages lazy as a lazy one and
you can also you can also load your
components as well using lazy loading so
this was the concept of lazy load
loading and hope you understand hope you
like it please subscribe and share my
videos and thanks for watching this
video I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
