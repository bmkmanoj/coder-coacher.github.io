from a pickup and today we'll talk about
models in ionic 3 so before we get
started I would like to come on which is
used to create the new project you
probably know this command ionic start
and your project name and the template
starter in my case I am selecting Lange
so I have already created my project so
I'll jump into my project and I'll show
you
yeah you can see here I have my home dot
html' and home dirtiest open here so in
home dot HTML I'll create a button and
that button will be for the model button
and then let's give my own button
and also give the click event to this
button and it's called the method issue
model
and give the name as show model
and save this
save this
and let's hop to the home dot DA's file
and let's import the model controller as
we are creating the model so we need to
import this model controller from ionic
angular as you can see here after
importing after importing this from
ionic angular we need to pass the
parameter and that parameter will be my
model
which is of type model controller
so below this I'll create my method so
model and I will say firstly I will
create my object my data object you
could say data equals to the name which
the name which is of type string and I
am giving ybm comma
the number
which is of type number you could also
take string 786 and close this object
you might be wondering why I have
created why I created this object well I
want to pass this object along with the
model so this is the object so let's
create let's create a method or a let's
create this object this dot my model dot
create
this function will create your model
when you hover on this you can see here
that it does not match any signature of
the call target you need to
boss
you need to pass the component data
which is optional and the options model
options you can also pass so you need to
pass you can see here I'll give model
page the component so you might be
wondering what this page is well this
page is the model page which I have
created here module on HTML and Model Ts
as you can see here I have a model
folder and to generate or to create this
page you need to use ionic
gee page and your page name if you use
this command then you can easily
generate your page ionic G stands for
generate page and your page name that's
all about the generation of page so I
have created my model page and I'm
passing the component inside the options
you can see here model page previously
in ionic 2 or in the earlier version of
ionic you need to import the pages from
the directory or from the root but now
it is not it is not mandatory you can
use this model page which ultimately
automatically redirects you to the model
page model dot HTML file so this is the
advantage and after passing this
component when you be hover on this you
can see here the component which is of
type any data which is optional and it
is also type any and the options which
is all the options are also optional and
this extends or this options are of type
model options so these are the three
parameters ins in model controller dot
create method and when we give comma
when we give kama inside this
inside this you can also pass your
object you can see here which I have
created above the data object
data
data object
and also you can pass model options for
now it is okay I'm passing the data
object inside the create method now
we'll move to the model dot HTML file
which is present right beside this file
so if we save this and if we run is if
we run on ionic lab using command called
ionic lab hit enter this command will
run your application on ionic lab
previously the command was ionic serve -
L you might have noticed this command in
the earlier version of ionic but now you
could also use this command to to run
your ionic app on ionic lab and the
command is ion Nick ionic lab that's
the beauty of ionic ionic CLI beauty you
could use this
till then I'll show you the close button
of model will create a close button on
button
I on button
and we'll give a click event to this
button and we'll call a method closed
model and we'll give close
yeah you can see here it is running it
is compiling
we have to wait for this to be completed
so we have created a closed small closed
button and we have given a closed model
method inside the click event we are
calling that method on the closed event
so we can call it we can call it here
but it is running
I will show you within few minutes that
how we can now you can see here when we
click this it is not working
it is not working might be we are doing
something wrong
now I figure out my mistake what I am
doing wrong here we are creating the
model but we are not using the present
method to show to or to display it on
the screen let's save this and we will
run in the ionic lab and we'll see if it
works fine or not so this is the method
of creating a model in ionic 3 just you
you have to create an object if you want
to pass it along the parameter of if you
want to pass it as a parameter of create
method it is now running this create
method will open this model which is
empty now but I will show you how to
give the closing button for dismissing
the model you could also give the
closing button in the content but I
don't want to give show model it is
showing now but the closing my button is
not present at the moment and we need to
create that using my own buttons closing
tag inside this ion button tag will take
a button tag and will give my own button
ion - button and will give a click event
and will call a method called
closed model and will give the name of
the button has closed and now we'll use
this method inside model dot TS file for
closing or for dismissing the model you
need to import the view controller
ionic angular because you cannot close
the model until you import this view
controller so you have to import this
and you have to pass it as a parameter
inside inside your constructor view and
which is of type view controller and
this view can be used to close or can be
used to dismiss dismiss your model model
so you can dismiss your model using this
dismiss math hurt and now I'll show you
some more life cycle events of model
like I have shown you the kradin present
some more methods are there model dot on
dare dismiss now you can see here on the
dismiss on well dismiss these are two
more life cycle events you can use it
according to your situation but I'm not
gonna use this in my case so and not use
it yeah you can see here I have created
a model which is showing this model page
as I have said earlier this is the ionic
three type or you could see you could
tell the typescript a new rule of
defining the method of defining your
component you don't need to import
statement you don't need to include the
input statement at the above you can see
here like like like in the previous
version you just need to provide the
page name along with the page so it take
automatically takes your page and also
we are we have created in our
checked and we are passing passing it
and which is of type date I when we
hover on this create method you can see
here the first component and the second
data which is of type penny and eight is
optional
you can see here which is optional and
the third one is options model options
so we have passed this object in the
create method BR we are not you but we
are not using it in side the model page
but I'll show you how you can use that
take one variable constant get data and
before taking that you need to
understand about the naff patterns naff
atoms can be used to get data when the
page navigation occurs my data you can
see here parameter of type string you
can see here the same name of the data
should be provided and finally I'm going
to display it in my console dot log get
theta so this will show the object which
we are passing while creating the model
inside the console so that we can have a
quick look at the object and also I have
created a close button you can see here
that might take some time to run or to
refresh so this is the way you could
create models in ionic three and one
more thing I would like to tell you I
would like to show you and that thing is
the model options
you can explore more about that ionic
documentation when you click this button
you can see here our this one is not
working we have we need to save this and
we need to save this as well we need to
save all files so that we can so our app
can work or as our app can function
properly we don't have to bother about
the reloading because it's not our work
the browser may time or ionic lab may
time may take some time to run I have
selected two platforms
the first one is Android and the next
one is iOS you could also select Windows
from the platforms drop-down you as
you're seeing in the top right of this
page here it is beside the open full
screen option so this is our model it's
still not working because of I guess
because of this one public and we'll
save this
we'll save this method and we'll see it
is it works fine or not closed model is
a function is a method which we are
calling on a click event of close button
and after calling that function we are
dismissing over model that's it
let's see hi why it is not working
yeah our application is ready now it is
still not working it is not working
closed model model method this dot view
dot dismiss this dot view dot dismiss
you can see here the dismiss method is
of type view
let's see Fitz if it worked fine or not
all the options I have given I have
included in here I've included in this
file and we are getting this issue
because of some reason and I'm not
figuring it out now you can see but if
we give but if we give this button
inside our content we'll remove this
from the navbar and we'll give it in the
content and we'll see if it's work if it
is if we if it works or not we'll see I
have given the bar close more close
button for the model in the content
itself in the body itself now we'll see
the functionality of this app after this
I have one more thing to show you click
it's still not working because
yeah I got my point here I got my
mistake I get I got the solution for my
mistake what I was doing wrong here is I
haven't give the opening and the closing
braces yeah you can see here the closed
model method it is a method so we need
to give the parenthesis so yeah you can
see when we close when we close this
button now it is working it is
dismissing from the page the model is
dismissing from the page you could also
pass let's create an object constant
model options I'll show you I'm showing
you about the model options here let's
create an object which is of type model
options equals to this semicolon yeah
you can see here when we hover on model
options actually it's the interface when
we right-click on this and when we go to
definition you can see here it's an
interface and it has some properties it
has some options as well show backdrop
which is of type boolean enabled
backdrop boolean value and enter and
leave animations are also present in
this interface so that you can give your
animations and you can also give the
custom CSS class which is of type string
now we'll use the model option which is
enabled
backdrop Dismas which is of type falls
you can see here we are disabling the
backdrop dismiss if it is false then the
model will appear in in a new way so I
will pass this option inside here I can
see here options which is of type any so
I am passing this as model options model
options you can see here so here is the
model and how we have created you can
see this you can see that we have
created model using create method
firstly we have created a button - for
showing the model and in this method I
have created one concert object and I
have created using Create method and I
have given the model page name of the
page I have passed the data which is of
type data and the model options so model
dot present is used for displaying your
model and in the model dot HTML I have
created a button for dismissing the
model and you can see finally we have
used the view controller to dismiss it
and this is a this will appear in the
console dot log when we click this and
when we go to console you can see here
the object which is of which is
undefined you can see here the options
the the option is undefined you can
define it here in this braces

model how you can create model in ionic
