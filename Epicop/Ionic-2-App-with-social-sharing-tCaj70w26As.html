column from epic op and today i'm going
to show you how we can install social
media social sharing plugins in our
ionic app and how we can use that for
sharing the content on our social media
so before we get started I would like to
show you two commands that will be
useful for installing the social sharing
plugins in your ionic app and to know to
have that two commands you have to visit
the ionic framework documentation which
is the ionic framework comm slash talk
slash native slash social sharing so
here you can find the two commands which
you need to use for installing social
sharing plugins in your ionic app so
here are the commands ionic cordova
plugin add cordova plug in x social
sharing this social sharing plugin this
social sharing plugin can be installed
using this command and after running
this command you have to install you
have to run this command as well this
command will save your plug-in
configuration to the package dot JSON
file you can see here on the
documentation and after installing the
social sharing plug-in in your ionic app
using these two commands you need to
jump to the app dot module or PS file
which is present inside your project
structure here you can see here inside
the app folder we have AB dot module OTS
file and inside this file you need to
import the social shading from ionic
native slash social sharing this import
statement will bring the social sharing
plug-in in your any cap you would use
throughout your ionic app if you import
this in your app dot module or ts5
and after importing this statement
finally you have to assign the social
shading in your providers as you can see
here these your providers here you can
see that I have given the social sharing
inside these providers after doing this
it's safe and let's hop to the page
which in which you want to use the
social media icons for sharing here in
this file I'm going to show you how you
can use that this is the star dot HTML
page and this is the start of TS file in
this file I'm going to import the social
sharing similarly as I have import in my
app dot modulus ts file which I have
shown you you can see here at the rate I
on it native slash social - sharing
sorry this should be social and put
semicolon here this statement will bring
the social media in this file started by
star dot TS file and after importing
this statement in the star of T is file
you need to pass the parameter in your
constructor and that constructor would
be private and the name of the
constructor should could be anything in
my case I am giving sharing so : social
sharing you are done now you have passed
the parameter inside your constructor
and now you can use in this page this
sharing object this sharing parameter
you could use in this page and before
that I will jump the start
tastes a star dot HTML file and inside
this file I will create two buttons one
for whatsapp and another for Facebook so
here I'm going to show you how you can
create firstly I'm going to take one ion
row and inside this I am going to take
column oops it should be column and
inside the first column I'm going to
take the watsapp button you can see here
button and on fab I am taking ion fab
for the floating action buttons you
could find this type of buttons on the
ionic documentation under the components
you could find this floating AK floating
action buttons so I'm going to give
color equals to secondary because
whatsapp logo will be in green color so
it looks more attractive if we give
secondary color you could find this
colors and all inside this variable dot
s CSS file which is present right here
under the theme folder so here are my
colors primary secondary danger light
and dark you could find this so inside
this I am going to take an ion icon and
on iPhone icon and I'm going to give the
name or this icon should be logo
whatsapp so this is the logo this is the
icon for your whatsapp and finally let's
give the click event to this whatsapp
shading button
click if the user clicks this button
then it will go to this method whatsapp
shares and inside this I'm passing one
parameter called proof which is our
added you can see here English proofs so
I have three objects I have two objects
inside my English proofs array and I am
retrieving that error here you can see
here and default let proof of English
proofs so this is my array and I am
passing this entire array whenever the
user clicks this button and in whatsapp
share method so this is the whatsapp
share button now we'll create another
button for the Facebook shape here right
here we will remove this because it
takes default the primary color which is
in blue color so Facebook will be in
blue color let's rename this method let
us give the name another name for every
share and let's change this to Facebook
let's save this copy this watsapp share
method and write here create a new this
method will get called whenever the user
clicks the whatsapp share button and
whatsapp message that proof parameter
will be assigned to this variable so
this dot sharing our sharing I our
sharing parameter which we have a sign
in our constructor dot share wire
whatsapp as you can see here share share
via whatsapp share by whatsapp to
receiver and share by a Facebook with
paste
so I'm going to take the first method
which is shareware whatsapp hit enter
and give as you can see here this share
wall via whatsapp method which is a
default method from whatsapp whatsapp
this takes three parameters you can see
here when we hover on this it is showing
that the message which is of type string
and the image which is also of type
string and the URL which is also F which
is also of type string and after giving
or after passing these all parameters
then it returns promise which we'll see
later first we need to pass whatsapp
message dot translation this is a word
message you can see here the translation
this is the translation which is over
message and passing as a first parameter
comma whatsapp message dot icon which is
our second parameter the image parameter
and the third one will be null I am NOT
passing any what you could say I am not
passing any type of URL in this so after
passing these all three parameters
finally it returns to promise which we
are creating now you could see here then
console dot block console dot log
message send this level promise what if
we get any error here you can see catch
error
if the message is sent successfully
then this message will appear in the
console dot law in the console and if
our message is not send successfully
then we are going to read we are going
to give the error message in our console
you can see here it's safe
it returns promise if this all three
parameters are sent in this method then
this promise will return in the console
and if it is not working then the error
will appear in the console and similarly
we will create another method for the
Facebook shades it also accepts the same
thing same three parameters we need to
give Facebook message because we are
passing array here proof we need to give
here one parameter which is of type and
you could say when we cover on this we
are getting that it is of type any this
dot shearing dot share wire Facebook you
could see here we have two methods I am
going to use the first method share via
Facebook and it also uses three
parameters similar to whatsapp message
image and URL and in it and it also
retains the promise as well so we use
Facebook message dot translation comma
Facebook message dot icon comma Facebook
message dot no no I am NOT going to pass
any URL here your wish you could pass
anywhere but in my case I am giving null
no sorry
after passing these all parameters we
are going to return the promise similar
the above method console dot log post
posted successfully if this if this work
if this works fine then this message
will appear in the console dot in the
console you can see a posted
successfully successfully if it not work
if this not work we are going to give
the error inside the console console dot
block failed posting this one is not
working because I have and you can see
here now it works still not working
failed posting should be
it is not working we are missing
something here we need to remove this
then catch we need to give the error
here console dot log fail posting here
you can see here we are missing some
brackets here that's why it was not
showing finally we have to give
semicolon here now this will work it's
safe and save this all files a block
modulo TS and these two files and will
run using git bash ionic serve else this
command will run our ionic app on ionic
lab we have three options in ionic lab
windows Android and iOS so it is a life
testing it gives the life testing on
three platforms so using this method you
can implement the social sharing in your
ionic app hope you understand about this
social sharing plug-in installation and
how you can use in your ionic app you
can see here our our ionic app is
running on get back it might take some
time to run on the browser you can see
here this all are the supported
platforms for social sharing plug-in
Android Browser iOS Windows and Windows
Phone and here you can get a code
instance members and you have different
options here in social trading plugin
and shares and it takes three parameters
four parameters app name message subject
image you are five parameters so this is
the beautiful documentation if you want
to get started with native function if
for native functionality for your ionic
apps it is not working we need to save
this files again and we need to run it
again ionic serve - L you could also
test this on your life emulator using
Android studio but I am running this on
ionic lab you can see here web pack is
started we need to wait for this you can
see here hope it is clear so far first
you need to install the social sharing
plugin using those two commands which I
have shown you yeah it is running now it
is running on two platforms you might be
wondering why - because I have selected
two platforms here using this option
iPhone and Android you could also select
Windows but for now it is running on two
platforms Android and iOS the thing I
was showing you that first you need to
install the social sharing plugin then
you need to import in your app dot
module or TS and you need to assign to
the providers finally you can use
in your page or this is the entire
process of for using social shading
plug-in in your ionic app so our
application is ready this is the this is
the carousel or you could say slider on
my home page and will yeah you can see
here on the next page we have the two
buttons you can see here whatsapp and
Facebook will open the developer tools
because we are on the browser so we
cannot test this buttons we need to see
the console because we have given here
if this works then we will get this
message message sent if this not works
we'll get the error in the console this
is our console and we viewdidload page
when we click this button cordova not
available you can see here the error is
showing here because the Cordova is not
included on this when we click this
button failed posting you can see here
we are getting the error if we deploy on
the live device then surely we'll get
the success message since we are using
on the browser on any clab so this might
not work so if you want to view or if
you want to get this work then you need
to deploy it on the life browser so this
was all about the social sharing plug-in
in ionic app hope you understand and
hope it is clear to you thanks for
watching this video and see you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
