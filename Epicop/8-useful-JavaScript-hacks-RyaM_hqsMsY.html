are doing great today and in this video
I'm gonna show you eight useful
JavaScript hacks so that you can use
inside your code so let's dive into this
and let's get started so basically I
have created html5 and in this I open
when a script tag to write some
JavaScript to show you this beautiful 8
useful JavaScript hax right so here I
have created an object the name person
and I have taken some things in that
like name rule and phone and the last
one is likes YouTube that is set to true
these all are these three are the above
three values are string values and the
last one is the boolean value
so our first useful JavaScript hack is
we can check conditions with an and
operator so basically if you want to
check the condition then you would use
you could use if condition right person
there is our object dot name right if
this exists then it is going to give an
output in the console that is true right
so let's save this and let's see inside
the browser yeah you can see here let me
make it large let me make a let me make
it large so that you can see clearly
that is set to true the console dot log
this statement there is true if this
exists so you don't need to use if
statement to check conditions in
JavaScript but you can do this in one
line let me show you how you can do that
you just need to take your object name
your value and console dot log yeah
right let's use semicolon here and let's
save it let's see the browser let's see
in the browser you can see here the yeah
is appearing in the console BAM you can
see you can check conditions with and an
operator and I hope you got this point
right so let's move on to the next step
and let's see the next useful JavaScript
hack that is we can debug JavaScript
easily using the debugger key method
using the keep debugger keyword right
suppose if you have taken a variable a
equals to 1 right and you're saying that
a increments or you want to add 4 in it
so that you can use it with the
shorthand operator of the plus right and
if you want to debug the issue the the
issue which is causing your program to
stop then you can debug your code using
the debugger Kamath keyword right this
keyword will allow you to debug the
issue the problem which is getting in
your code which is stopping your code
from executing right debugger is a
method debugger is a keyword you can use
it to debug the issues right so hope you
got this so let me comment out this line
and let's move to the next beautiful and
useful JavaScript hack that is we can
convert to boolean using not not
operator right so you might be wondering
how you can do that so let me show you
with an example right if you define a
function called
bucket right and you're saying that
water equals to water or you can say
water right so you need to pass this
argument here to take the value as a
parameter so this
hot water equals to water right this dot
you can say this dot has water right so
if you want to check that this bucket
has water or not then you can say you
can use one function when anonymous
function and this to check the bucket
has water or not right so let's let me
show you how you can do that if water
greater than zero right
if water greater than zero then you can
say return true right else you are going
to return obviously false right so this
is your code right if your bucket has
water then you are going to return true
if it is not if the bucket doesn't have
any water then you are going to return
false so for this you need to write this
anonymous function to check the bucket
has water or not so it is the lengthy
one you can do this in one line to check
this bucket has water in it or not and
you can do do that using this one-line
statement that that is this dot has
water equals to not not water what it
does is it does it it converts the value
and it returns the boolean value that is
if it if the bucket has water then it is
going to return true so let me show you
how you can get an output from this
function by defining by creating an
object well W new off bucket and I'm
gonna pass three inside this bucket and
I'm gonna check W dot water W dot water
right I want to know the amount of water
which we are passing that is three
liters we are getting three right and I
want to check the value of has water
right
yeah we are getting true here you can
see if this bucket has water then it is
going to return the true if it's not
then it is going to return the false
let me tell or let me tell you one thing
here is this operator accept only the
positive values positive numbers which
are greater than zero and it is it will
not accept zero or negative numbers so
make sure you give proper values in it
right so let's move to the next step
that is convert string to number using
plus operator right I'm defining a
variable in a string one two three four
five six and what I'm do what I'm gonna
do here is I'm gonna convert this string
into the number a sorry a dot number or
you can say number of a this is the
correct way of converting string into
number right you can see one two three
four five six but you can do this in one
line and let me show you how you can do
that so cut this entire string from the
variable and delete this variable and
give it a give it inside the console dot
lock it will give you the exact string
you can see here and if you if you want
to if you want this string to be
converted in number then make sure to
give plus operator this indicates the
conversion of string into number right
so hit you can see the output and you
can also use a variable a and you can
pass it pass this string here by this
string here inside this variable and you
can say a right so let's save it let's
refresh in the browser to see an output
you can see here the one two three four
five six it is in in the number format
so hope you got this and let me show you
the next
hack of this video for JavaScript lovers
that is set default value using or
operator right
if a person has name and we can see if a
person has name right or doesn't have
doesn't have name right or doesn't have
you can say doesn't have only right so
let's use and you can store this value
inside one variable right what we are
doing here is we are taking a value if
this person has named the person which
we have created here don't get confused
we are getting this person dot name
value inside this variable
oh and we can console dot log this value
B right let's save it and let's see in
the browser right you can see here say
add Mouton Muir is there inside the
person dot name value or we can say if
we remove this name from this object and
let's save it and let's refresh in the
browser yeah you can see here does not
have right if you do not have if you if
you are not getting any value the value
the object while you're running or any
value then you can set the default value
using our operator hope you are getting
me and hope you are understanding the
beautiful hacks and the useful hacks of
JavaScript you can actually define the
default value if you are getting an
empty or or if you are getting a null
you can define it using the or operator
so let's revert back right so you can
use this operator so let's move to the
next hack
that is the template string this part
this hack is already shown in the late
in the previous tutorial of mine you can
find that tutorial on my channel that is
epic op so let me show you one more time
here right you can define bad c equals
to you can say hello I am plus plus and
a programmer right so let's use one more
variable my name my name equals to Musa
right so let's use this my name here
inside between these two plus operators
this will concatenate console dot log
sorry console dot log C right let's save
it and let's see in the browser
hello I am Musa a programmer right you
can see here
hello I am Musa let me give you let's
give a space here so it looks better you
can see hello a Musa a programmer right
so this will concatenate the variable
value but you can do this in one line so
let's remove this double quotations from
here this plus signs as well plus mark
this one and don't we don't need this
one right so let's use backticks here
sorry backticks here the backticks
are beautiful and they allow us to use
any variable inside our string that is
the power of JavaScript all we need to
do is we need to use dollar sign with
the curly braces right so
let's save this and let's see any
browser yeah we are still getting the
same value if we remove the double
quotation this backticks
allow us to embed or to use variables
inside our string so this is the old
trick you might know this but I have
shown you if you don't know then make
sure to use these template strings
inside your JavaScript code so let's
comment out this line and let's move to
the next hack of this video that is the
last item from an array using slice
method right if we define an array
equals to 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4
comma 5 right we have 5 elements inside
our array and we can get the last value
the last item from an array using this
slice method right and if we want the
last item of this array then we can use
the index as minus 1 it represents the
last value it returns the last value
from this array yeah you can see here
the value is 5 you can see here the last
value is 5 right we are getting the last
value inside this object 5 the index the
last value is 5 so you can get it using
this slice method so let's move to the
next hack and that is the last hack of
this video that is the HTML ID hack for
J's but I won't recommend you to use
inside your code inside your J's code
because it's a bribe it's a bad practice
so don't use it so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna use a paragraph inside my body
and I'm gonna say hello I pick up my
channel name right so I'm gonna define
I'm gonna give 1 ID to this paragraph
sorry paragraph let's use this ID to
style the color to give the color of
that paragraph right so basically what
you do is you do document dot get sorry
get element by ID right you do this
right you do in this way but you can do
this using paragraph dot style dot color
equals to blue BAM and you can see the
output here the hello epic op is
appearing in the blue color and you can
use it directly you don't need any
document dot get element by ID it's a
hat you can use it but I won't recommend
you it's a bad practice hope you enjoy
