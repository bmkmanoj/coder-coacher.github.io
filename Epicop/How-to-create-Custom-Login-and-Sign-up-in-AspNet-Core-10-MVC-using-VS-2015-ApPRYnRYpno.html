how to create custom sign up and login
in asp.net code 1.0 MVC so let's get
started so firstly what I am gonna do is
I'm gonna create a model for login for
signup so in this model I am taking some
properties like ID for the indication of
a row in the database table and the
another attribute the another property
is email address and the attributes I
have given for this property are
required attribute along with the error
message and display attribute it simply
displays the property name on our view
page and the data type this data type
represents the type of this property so
I am giving the data type of this
property as email address and also I am
giving the error message if the users if
the user tries to give the email address
without at the rate or dot symbol so
this message will get called on overview
page so this is the email address
property and this is the username
property so I have given only two
attributes for this property the
required attribute and the display
attribute and the last is the password
property and also I have given three
same properties as like an email address
to this password property that is
required this
and the data-type so you can give any
data type based upon your requirement
you could give the credit card currency
and date date time duration email there
are lot of types present in this data
annotations so I would like to give the
password here so I am saving this model
let's hop to the context model here
basically context represents your
database set as you can see here
database it I have two database sets in
this context detail context you can see
here it is representing from the
database context interface so this is
the constructor inside this constructor
I am giving a parameter as database
context options which is inheriting from
base and this is same as like this
constructor and below this constructors
I am giving to database sets one for the
contact which is not the part of this
section I am showing only about their
registration and the login so I am
taking another rate of a set for signup
model for this model which we have given
inside the models folder you can see
here in the solution Explorer inside
this model folder I have data detail
context dot CS and signup dot C S so
these are the two models so let's save
this detail context and let's hop to the
details controller for the login and for
the signup I have created another
controller a new controller called
details controller so inside this I have
my signup view page for the get request
for the post request I have another sign
of you page so this has TDP gets called
if the user given the if the user wants
to see or wants to display the view page
of sign up page so this action will get
called and for the post if the user
tries to submit the form using signup
page then this page will be called so I
have given STD be post and validate ante
forgery token as you know I have given
this attribute validate ante forgery
token to prevent our web app or website
from cross-site scripting and from the
potential hackers to prevent from the
predation potential hackers I have given
this token value date ante forgery token
so this is our action result and also
inside this I have given the parameter a
sign up which is our model and inside
this I have given if condition if model
state dot is valid if the user submits
all the fields of the signup model then
only this conditions will get called
then only this code will be executed if
this requirement is meet so I have taken
a details variable at the top of this
class here you can see here private
read-only I am calling the detail
context here and and I am accessing this
detail context here inside this if
condition dot sign up this sign up which
we have created as a database set so dot
add dot model so if the users sign up
for the view page or for this website
and that detail is going to store in
this database set signup and also after
saving or after adding any row or any
data inside the database set on a
database table don't forget to save that
changes so after adding that model what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna save all the
changes so this method you have to call
and you should call so after calling the
Save Changes method give model state dot
clear this line will clear the model
state which the user has submitted and
after clearing the model state I am
gonna store one temporary message inside
this view back dot message dynamic
property that is the username plus with
along with the successfully registered
message so this is the I action result
of sign up and now I would like to show
you the sign of view page here so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna access my
model signup you can see here using
razor I am accessing that model at the
rate model this is the first ASP core
application name dot model starts sign
up so I am accessing this model and I am
creating the form using tag helpers so
if you don't know about tag helpers if
you are a newbie to asp.net code then
don't forget to watch my previous videos
on asp.net code and on tag helpers as
well and I have given the introduction
part on HTML helpers as well so don't
forget to watch that videos so using
form tag helper
I'm creating the sign up view page this
is the ASP action it indicates that if
the user submits the form then this
action will get called which is present
inside the controller detail and also
this gives the return URL and the method
of the form should be post and the role
of the form obviously it should be the
form so this is the form horizontal
bootstrap class and inside this I am
giving ASP validation summary so this
attribute indicates that the validation
of this form will get called based on
the model which we have created inside
this signup model these are the
properties and these are the error
messages so let's hop to the view page
and let's see if view back dot message
not equals to null I am displaying this
message will come to it later but at the
moment I want to show you the form
groups this is a bootstrap class and
this is our first form group in this
signup form so the first property is
email even address label is before this
is also a tag helper label tag helper
you can see here wherever you see ASP
then you can think that it is a tag
helper so input is before email address
and the class for this input tag is form
control and what does it mean this pan
tag this pan tag is going to give all
the error message for that particular
property that email address property is
the validation for it validates and it
gives a real message and it displays an
error message of that particular
property
this is the next forum group which is
for the user name and this is the input
tag and this is for the ASP validation
and the next forum group is for the
password you can see here label input
tag and span tag at last I am giving a
button for submitting the for submitting
the users data through this form to the
controller and to the action method of
this kind of this view page so so this
is the signup page let's run this
application and let's see how it works
you can see here I am running this
application on my browser Google Chrome
and also I'll show you about this view
back message and what it displays I'll
show you later
and also I want to show you the login
view page how we can login
our application is running on localhost
5 to double nine-fold this is the login
page so first we will see the signup
page and how we can sign up how we can
register with this web app first we will
see that and later we'll come to the
login part how we can login and what is
the logic of login inside the detailed
controller you can see here this is the
login I action result and this is for
the what you can see for the get request
I comment it out this to data
annotations I steady Piggott and allow
anonymous and this login method will be
called for the HTTP POST you can give
your controller name and the action
method while giving this by giving the
names in the URL you should give it
correctly otherwise you will get a
internal server error I have given
controller name along with the signup
page as you can see here we can see the
sign up view page email address username
and the password so let's give the
username as marked at the head gmail.com
and the user name is mark one two three
the password is one two three four let's
sign up and we'll see you can see your
mark one two three successfully
registered this is the view back dot
message which we have given in our
controller in in our action method you
can see here view back dot message model
dot username + i'm concatenating that
username along with this successfully
miss a successfully registered message
and i am displaying it my am displaying
on my view page here if you back dot
message not equals to null then i am
displaying this message so this is all
about the sign apart and now i would
like to show you the login part
so this is the login view page and only
two fields are required here the email
address and the password and we'll see
how it works so this is the login page
and and given I have given the same form
inside the login view page but with
different attributes but with different
action as well you can see here ASP
action login and the controller is same
detail and this using this tag helpers I
am creating the login view page form and
I have given two properties here the
email address and the password at last I
am giving a submit button so if the user
submits if the user tries to login into
the website then this action will be
called this action then steady be post
login inside this I am taking two
parameters one for the model signup
model and next for the written URL and
this view data temporary dynamic
property or dynamic dictionary stores
the return URL and I'm checking my
checking the data of the submitted form
that these login details will exist in
our database or not that part I am
checking using this variable user this
is the context variable details dot
signup is the database set which we have
given in the detail context here and dot
where you means user you could weave any
variable name here and I am checking
using lambda expression you dot email
address equal equals two
dot address if the given email address
of this login form matches with the
email address of database which is
present the email address which is
present in our database so the email
address of this given submitted form and
the email address which is present in
our view form should get matched and
also I am giving and here the password
should get matched along with the email
address I am also checking for the
password that's why I have given and
between this two so the password should
get matched dot first all default this
is the method if this condition satisfy
if not mul state dot is valid and user
not equals to null then only our
application will be redirect to the
login logged in action result which is
present
which is present below the login login
action result and it will give the bad
request object result so you can login
with the given email address and
password using this login view page so
