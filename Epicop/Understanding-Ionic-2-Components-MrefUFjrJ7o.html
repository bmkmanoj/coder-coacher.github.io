up and said no chuckling and today I am
going to show you the components of
ionic 2 so in our previous video we have
seen the introduction part and also the
installation and the project setup now
we are going to see the components of
ionic 2 so before we dive in I would
like to show you the project creation of
an ionic 2 how you can create ionic 2
project which I have already shown you
in my previous video but still I want to
show you again this is the official
website of ionic 2 ionic framework calm
and there you can explore the ionic CLI
commands which is present right here if
you click get solid then you will get
this option code with CLI and there you
can see you can install ionic with
Cordova and you could also start your
new project using this command as I have
already shown you how you can create a
new project using commands in your
command prompt this is the command ionic
start and your app name and this is the
starter template it comes with the tabs
like this you can see here and if you
select blank template then you will get
a blank template of ionic 2 and if you
select the side menu starter template
then you make it you will get the ionic
2 project like this with along with the
side menu so if you want to serve or if
you want to run your ionic 2 app then
you should use this command called ionic
serve so this path I have shown you in
my previous video if you haven't watched
my previous video make sure to watch
that video now I am going to show you
the components of ionic 2 if you click
Docs then click framework dogs
and this document we have components
section here and we have different kinds
of components
you may select any component based upon
your project needs so we have many kinds
of components in ionic - like action
sheets the action sheet will look like
this in your mobile view in iOS it may
look like this when you click this it it
feels the Navy functionality it gives
you the native functionality as I have
already said you that ionic provides the
native mobile functionality it is a
hybrid mobile app development framework
for creating hybrid mobile apps and in
Android it looks like this and you click
this yeah it is it provides you the
native functionality in Windows it looks
like this so this is all about the
components we have different components
here as you can see here we have alerts
badges burdens cards and we have lot
more components present in ionic 2
components so we will start with the
basic one we will select the card this
is the basic card so if you want to
create this card then simply you just
need to click this demo source button
and on github you have you will be
redirected to the github page and inside
that you will get the code of that basic
card which is present right here in this
file called template dot HTML so we'll
jump to the Visual Studio code and we'll
start coding now so this is my project
and also I have shown you the project
structure of ionic apps in the previous
video so make sure to watch that video
this is my home dot HTML page and we
have form dot th home dot ts file as
well so inside this home dot HTML I have
comment out all this code as you can see
here I have I I had created the buttons
all the components together in this file
but now I'm going to show you the basic
card how you can create so you have the
file open here on github I on header
inside n-never your title will come
basic cards and inside I on content you
have the card class let us copy this and
paste it down here in the ion content
tag let's save this and let's serve it
on Iona class so we have goodbye git
bash installed here so I'm writing PL
c'mon
clear what is not working open it again
this is my project inside the local disk
C ionic playground is my project when we
open this project when we open this
folder and hit right right-click on this
in the inside this folder and we will
get this option get bash here and inside
the get bash I will write this command
to run my ionic app which is ionic surf
- L or / - hell you could say so this is
my command to serve the ionic app on on
ionic labs you could also write ionic
serve which will be which will run your
ionic web inside your browser but I
don't want to run my ionic app inside
the browser I would like to run it on
ionic labs so I have written ionic serve
- L when we hit enter our project will
start running our project will start
compiling as you can see here what
started transpired started our time our
typescript file will be transpired to
JavaScript file because it is a hybrid
app development mobile app development
framework so browser understands only
JavaScript so our type script file will
be transpired to the JavaScript it is it
might take some time to run on the
browser till then we will explore more
components of ionic - this is the basic
card so when we see we have different
kinds of cards as well we may write list
items inside the card as you can see
here we have different lists inside
inside the card and also we
we may use images inside the card as
well and this part is of the background
image as you can see here so now we are
only seeing how to create a basic card
if you want to know more components of
ionic - if you want to get the details
of components of ionic - then simply I
would suggest you to visit this website
called ionic framework slash talks slash
components inside this you have bunch of
components present here so our
application is ready now as you can see
here we have two different platforms
this is the iOS and this one is the
Android this is Android and this is the
iOS you can also select Windows as well
so now our application will look same on
all platforms that are Windows Android
and iOS it provides you the native
functionality so this is the basic card
which I have created inside the project
or and also you could also use I on hard
header this is also one element of ion
ion cloud element so in this you need to
provide the card title and we save this
our replication is really reloading now
this is a life reload option you can see
here basic card is showing here and also
I have side menu created inside this
application and this is the home page
which we are present now which you are
on present now this is the current page
called home page and this is the next
page called contact page when we click
this button we will be redirect to the
contact page I have my salt list present

the model button and we click this our
model will pop up
on the screen and you can also search in
this search bar Maharashtra yeah you can
see here our search list is working fine
so this is the contact page and now we
get back to the home page and we will
also see how we can add the buttons
inside the ion card content so this is
the button tag ion button and I unbutton
this is the attribute called block which
I will show you where we can use this
let's give this button name as high
ionic when we save this
our application will be reloaded on this
screen so I'll show you the different
kinds of button which is presenting
ionic components our buttons are present

one is the secondary danger and dark
this number of buttons we have you can
see here this is the button and when we
give color equals to this is the
attribute of ionic button color equals

for Android and these are the iOS
outline icons you can use this in your
project so this is not the part of our
today's video so I am NOT going to show
you how you can create that how you can
use that icons inside your project let's
open the action sheet component and we
will create this action sheet inside our
project
or we can also create the alert

save this this is the button simple
button iron on the click event I am
calling this simple alert function which
