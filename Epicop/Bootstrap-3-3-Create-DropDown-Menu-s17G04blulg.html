show you how to create drop downs in
bootstrap you might have heard about
drop downs in bootstrap and some of you
may not know about drop downs so I would
like to show you how to get started with
drop down oh let's get started firstly I
would like to take a div tag called
container inside this container div I
would like to take a h1 tag and give
class called text center and give some
text called
no guys now we'll create drop-down
bootstrap save this and let's take
another div tag for our actual drop down
let's take this is a bootstrap class
drop down plus you can see here this all
classes are bootstrap classes techcenter
container you don't need to write this
class is in his CSS externally the
bootstrap is a ready-made framework CSS
framework you can use this classes to
make the websites more responsive so if
you don't know about bootstrap don't
forget to watch my previous video on
introduction to bootstrap so now I would
like to give a comment here because
commenting is a good practice while
developing anything so i have read I i
have written drop down here and I want
this line to be commented so there is a
shortcut key in sublime text editor
called control backslash this way you
can comment your lines inside this
drop-down I would like to take a button
tag let's say tie button
and let's give some classes called BTW
and default you could you could choose a
different classes as well we've been
primarily btn-primary BDN success there
are a lot of classes for buttons and
even you can increase or decrease your
button sizes so this way you can choose
this button is for button drop-down
toggle and let's give the data toggle
as drop down inside this button tag I
would like to take span tag for the
carrot and let's give the button name
here called drop down save the changes
in the eater let's hop to the browser
and hit refresh you can see here it is
working now below this button tag I have
on my unordered list for the drop-down
items let's take class as drop-down menu
inside this unordered list I'll take my
list items inside this list item on my
anchor tag let's take this and let's
give a chav as hash because it's a
default value let's say our first markup
language HTML let's give some more list
items here
css3 and let's take JavaScript these are
the three basic web programming
languages refresh the browser see you
can have these three programming
languages in your drop-down menu html5
css3 and JavaScript what if I want to
give a divider between two list items or
two drop-down items let's see how you
can give now I would like to give a
divider between a javascript and PHP
let's copy down this paste it here
remove javascript and write PHP hit the
Save button in the editor up to the
browser and hit refresh button open your
drop-down menu you can see here this
small line between javascript and PHP
this line is called divider which we
have given it using the class divider
this is a bootstrap class divider which
divided the troop dog down menu items so
this way you can divide the two menu
items and you can also open your
drop-down menu at the right side of the
window using this class called drop-down
menu right
it's safe up to the brother head refresh
button you can see here it is opening in
a it is Rho opening at the right side of
the window using this way you can open
your drop-down menu at the right side of
the window and if you want to open your
drop-down add the above position in an
upward direction so you can give drop up
here and change this drop down to drop
up and here to drop up and here also
change all drop down to drop ups hit
refresh up to the browser oops it is not
working now
still not working
you can see here just you need to rename
your drop-down class to drop up here it
will open the drop-down in an upward
direction you can see here I can't
scroll up my page here because it is
already at the top of the page so you
can easily give drop up or drop down
class here using this way you can create
dropdowns in bootstrap hope you like
