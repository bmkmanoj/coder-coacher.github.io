Liam from epic op and today I'm going to
be showing you about navigation in ionic
2 so before we get started I would like
to show you how we can navigate from one
page to another page what are the basic
things we need to include our in in our
pages for the navigations that thing I
want to show you before we get started
firstly you need to import the
navigation controller in your page that
is the homepage I in this case I am
going to navigate from home to the
contact page as you can see here I have
home dot T is file open here
in my visual studio code editor and from
this home dot TS file I am going to
navigate from hundred TS to the contact
dot HTML file from home page to contact
page we are going to navigate so first
we need to import the navigation
controller right here in the hundred TS
file so let's get started so this way
you can import the navigation controller
navigation controller from from ionic
and Euler poor semicolon here this way
you can import the navigation controller
and your page as you can see here it is
loading yeah it is loaded now we have
successfully imported the navigation
controller in our home page and now we
are going to use this navigation
controller and we are going to pass as a
parameter in our constructor like this
public nav control nap controller comma
this way you can pass the navigation
controller as a parameter inside your
constructor of this page and you have
assigned this navigation controller in
this page so after assigning or after
importing the navigation controller in
home dot es file will jump the home dot
HTML file and we will create a button
called
we will create a button called next as
you can see here I have created button
called next for the net for the
navigation from home to contact pace and
I have given a method called next page
when the user clicks this button this
method will get for this method the next
page method will be given here like this
we are creating the next page method
inside the home dot pH file and inside
this next page I am going to call this
dot nav controller which is our
controller navigation controller dot
push there is one method called push in
navigation controller using this method
you can navigate from one page to
another page basically there are two
methods in the navigation controller
they are push and pop if you want to
navigate from one page to another page
in a forward direction then you could
use push method and if you want to get
back to the first page the initial page
then you could use the pop method now I
am using the push method of navigation
controller to navigate from home hist
home file to the contact file home from
home page to the contact page so inside
this I am going to give the contact page
I think this will not work because we
have we haven't import our contact page
inside the home page so for using or for
navigating from home to contact we need
to import the page we need to import the
contact page inside this home page
contact page from
contact / contact you might be wondering
why I am giving this dot dot slash
contact / contact actually actually this
is the contact page which is present
inside this folder inside the pages and
inside this you can see here we have
contact folder and inside this we have
contact dot HTML file which is our
contact page so inside the contact
folder we have contact file so this way
you could import any page inside your
inside your inside a page or inside
another page
so using this import statement I'm going
to push this inside the navigation
controller and this will work so let's
save this and let's save this also the
button which we have created inside the
home dot HTML file and finally we are
going to see what we have to do inside
the app dot module dot ts file which is
present right here as you can see here
every page needs to be imported in AB
dot module or TS file without this you
cannot use or you cannot so you cannot
navigate from one page to another page
you need to import the page before
navigating from one page to another page
as you can see here or in our home page
is already imported inside this advert
modular tees file and now we have to
import the contact page as well which is
our destination page from
while during the path you need to be
very careful as you can see here inside
the pages folder I have contact /
contact this way you can import the page
inside ad dot module dot th but in the
home dot TS file we have imported with
the different way you can see your
import contact page from dot dot means
the root directory and inside contact
folder we have contact dot HTML file
this way you can import inside the page
but in the advert modular TS file this
is the root module of your ionic app so
you need to import very carefully as you
can see here we are we have imported
this contact page we have but we haven't
used this page right here in the ngmodel
de decorator you can see here every page
which is imported here inside the app
dot module or TS file needs to be inject
inside this and the mall decorator as
well and also we have to assign the
space inside the entry components comma
this two things are very important in
app dot module dot TS after importing
your face inside model F dot module
tortillas you need to assign it in the
ng model decorator and also in the entry
components array then only you can use
that page throughout your ionic app so
we have imported our page inside the
root model of this ionic app and finally
we are going to see the app dot HTML
which is the first file or the first or
the root page you can see you can say
the root page of this application which
is AB dot HTML inside this a dot HTML I
have created a unless
inside this ion list I have two ion
items one for the homepage and another
for the contact page when this item gets
clicked our go to home method will get
called which is present right here in
the app dot component or TS as you can
see here we have our two pages imported
right here in that abdur component or PS
and also this is the view child our
route page is set to home page means our
index page you can say the root page
means the index page of the app which is
set to home page and these two methods
are present inside the app door
component or TS when this item gets
click means the home item this method
will get called that is go to home and
our home page will be set to root will
be set to the root page and when this
item that is contact page gets clicked
when the user clicks this item then the
go to contact method will get called so
this way you can use or you can navigate
from one page to another page this is
the way you can navigate from one page
to another page will save this all
things and will run in the browser to
see it is working fine or not let's save
this all files and let's swap to the
folders which is ionic playground this
is my folder ionic folder inside this I
will write I will right-click and I will
select the get bash here
and finally I am going to put on this
application using command called ionic
surf you could also use ionic surf - L
which will be run on all three platforms
which will run on ionic labs so I'm not
going I'm not going to do that so I am
going to run it on my browser using
ionic surf command hit enter and we'll
see the navigation from one page to
other page hope you got this and this
way you can navigate from one page to
another page while importing the pages
you need to be very careful for the
syntax s and for the folder names as
well it is compiling
if you are a beginner then I would
service you to visit this documentation
the official website of ionic that is
ionic framework form there you can get
the docs and you can get started with
ionic yeah our application is running on
the browser I am getting this issue
setting some saved we will run it again
we close this file now this is official
website for ionic and here are the docs
ionic framework Docs inside this you
will get all components API and the
native part as well storage Taming many
cons which will give you the beautiful
icons for your ionic applications it is
still running it might take some time to
run
so here are the CLI commands our
application is running now I was showing
you the CLI v our application is ready
now you can see here I have a bunch of
components present on this homepage
which is not the part of this video I am
going to show you how we can navigate
when we click this next button yeah we
can see that we are going we are
successfully navigated to the contact
page from home page when we click this
button we will get back to that home
page you can see here our navigation is
working fine and inside this contact
which I have a model I which is which is
showing here and I have a list as well
the states of India under Pradesh you
can see here all things so this way you
can navigate from one page to another
page hope you got this hope you liked
