pickup today I'm going to show you how
to create responsive models using
bootstrap 3 so here is my file you can
see here model dot HTML and I am going
to create a model using bootstrap 3 as
you can see here I have one h1 tag
inside my body and one button for
toggling that model and the type of the
burden is puddle and I have given some
classes to this button like button info
and this would be the button large and
this would be at the center of the page
using center block class and I am
assigning and aligning this button to
the center at the page so this all
classes are of bootstrap these are these
are bootstrap classes you can use this
to make your buttons like this you can
see here this won't work now because we
haven't create a model yet so let's jump
in and let's create a model so firstly
I'm going to take one div class and I'm
I would like to give the model class to
this dip tack and and also I am going to
give the ID to this model div tag this
ID because we are targeting data target
my model so this button will target to
this ID my model and the data toggle
will be modeled and these all are the
bootstrap classes so inside this div tag
I'm going to take I'm going to take
another div tag which will be modeled
dialogue and inside this div tag let's
take another div tag called model
content and inside this div tag let's
take another one more distich and let's
give the class name as model header so
this will be the header of the model I
will show you one example here w3schools
is the best website for learning HTML
CSS JavaScript PHP SQL these all courses
are available are available on w3
schools you could refer this so in the
example at w3 schools it is shown that
when you click this button this is the
model header and the close button is
here and this is the model body and at
last at the bottom of this model this is
the model footer when you click this two
buttons the model will disappear from
the screen
so using these classes we are going to
create our model so this is not the code
which we are using in our model we are
also creating a form in the model so in
model header let's give one button first
and that button will be for the model
will be false will work like a close
button for the model let's leave class
as close and let's give data attributes
as data dismiss equals to model when you
click this button the model will
disappear the model will close will get
close let's refresh this and let's check
it out
yeah the model is here and when we give
the title for this model let's assign
this h4 tag with the class like model
title and the model title will be
bootstrap model let's save this and
let's talk to the browser refresh it
again
as you can see here the bootstrap model
the title is showing here at the model
this button is not appearing on our
model because we haven't give the
clothes symbol which is this one
ampersand times semicolon let's save
this refresh it again let's click this
button here you can see here our close
button is now appearing on the screen
let's close this so we are done with the
model header part let's move to the
model body part and let's give the class
name as model body and inside this body
firstly I'm going to take one h4 tag and
I'm going to say responsive model using
bootstrap 3 let's save this and let's
hop to the browser refresh it again as
you can see here this h4 tag is present
inside the body of the model and let's
take another P tag and let's assign this
P tag let's put some content dummy
content learning lorem ipsum
Laurium as you can see here this is the
dummy content I'm going to remove these
all lines and I'm going to give full
stop here so this is the dummy P tag
which I have put in my model body and
after giving this P tag let's give
another h4 tag and let's say danger
links you could you could give anything
inside your model and now I am giving
one button this this is all the content
which is present in our model body and
now I am giving one button and H ref
would be - and the class will be button
button MD but an MD means medium button
there are four kinds of button in
bootstrap but an excess means XS small
SM in small MD means medium and LG means
large so but in danger and let's give
don't click this or you can give danger
button let's save this and let's off the
browser and we'll see the changes as you
can see here the danger button is
appearing on the screen in the model
body and after doing this I'm going to
take another h4 tag and I'm going to say
information information of model
and I'm going to take one anchor tag
similar to the above one but now I am
going to give this link instead of
giving hash I am going to give this one
and I am going to give class button
button medium button info this is also
another class called button info in the
previous button we have used button
danger and now we are using but an info
and I'm going to give more info more
info let's save this and let's see the
changes as you can see here when you
click this button we are redirecting to
the w3schools page let's back to the
page and you can see here information of
model and now I am going to take another
anchor tag and before taking anchor tag
I would like to take one P tag and
inside this anchor tag I am going to
take one anchor tag which is for the
information of model click here so I am
giving this one get bootstrap comm this
is a website official website of
bootstrap you could visit this website
and you can explore the components of
bootstrap as you can see here this is
this all are the components pagination
breadcrumbs navbar input groups
dropdowns button groups you can explore
this all options and get bootstrap form

available here you could use this in
your projects this is a good website if

going to give it here and we'll see for
more info let's save this and let's back
to the page refresh it again and click
this button you can see here click here
when you hover on the click here text it
is showing link at the bottom of the
screen get bootstrap comm / component /
button groups so when you click this it
is redirecting to that page so now I'm
going to give I'm going to use 1 haytch
our tag and below this HR tag I'm going
to use one form and I'm going to give
form horizontal class to this form
because I am going to create an form
inside model here at bar as you can see
here this is the HR tag which is in line
and below that above that HR tag I'm
going to give one P tag and I'm going to
say claw I'm going to give a class
called text muted the text will be muted
which is present inside this p tag hope
you understand about model so far let's
save this and let's off to the browser
as you can see here it is in a muted
format text muted is also a una' is also
a class of bootstrap so inside this form
i am going to take one div tag called
form group and inside this form group
let's take another let us take one label
label and let's assign that label with
the class called control label these all
classes are of bootstrap this are the
bootstrap classes that you could use
when you are creating models or when you
are creating forms control label column
MD to means I am indicating that I am
representing here this label will take
only two columns on the medium sized
screens and this label is of control
label means this is a class which you
could use while dealing with your forms
so I am going to give for name this
label is for the name element and I am
going to give name
name and below this label let's take
another de stag and let's assign that
div tag with column MD 10 you might be
wondering why I am taking 10 columns
here because in one row we have 12
different columns so I have already
taken two here and the remaining 10
columns I am taking here and inside this
div tag I'm going to take one input
element and a mess I am assigning with
the class hold form control as this
input element will control the form and
also I am going to give if ID equals to
name as you can see here this label is
for the name and this label is
indicating is this label is representing
this input element so I'm going to give
type equals to text let's save this and
let's talk to the browser refresh it as
you can see here this is the label and
this is the input type and you could
also give placeholder your name inside
that input element this text will appear
let's save this and let's hop to the
browser and let's refresh it again as
you can see here so let's copy down this
div group form group and let's paste it
here and let's change this name to email
and this name to email because the first
element in our form is name and the
second element would be emailed in my
case you could take anything and paste
the email here
copy this and paste email here the type
would be email this is a format of forms
in html5 you would give type equals to
text type equals to credit card type
equals to email there are lot of options
available in html5
these all are the attributes so I am
going to give a mail here your email and
after email I'm going to take message
and this one is MSG message instead of
using input element we'll use text area
element you might have heard about text
area basically this element is used for
the messages for the message input
elements we cannot use input element for
the message we have to use text area
element and also we have to remove the
type equals to text attribute from here
and we have to give rows equals to 4 and
4 will be message your we we cannot give
placeholders as well because this
element is a text area element we have
to use this save this and hop to the
browser refresh it again as you can see
here the name is the first element which
is present in our form email and the
message and finally we are going to give
one button below this text area and that
button will be of button button MD
button success
this button will be sent after filling
all the forms I am giving after filling
all the fields of form I am giving send
button so let's give this and also I am
giving pull left means it will be left
aligned this button will be left aligned
as you can see here below this form the
send button is here now we have
completed the model body part as you can
see here this is the model header and
this is the model body inside model body
I have given these things and after
giving model body
let's take model footer another this tag
for model for footer inside this model
footer firstly I'm going to take a
button and I am going to give class as
