column from AP cop and today I am going
to show you how you can give fullscreen
video background using his KML and css3
as you can see here on this website the
video is playing in behind the scenes in
the background and the text free stock
video footage and these buttons and this
all things are appearing on the on the
top of this video on the front of this
video so we'll create a similar video
background to this web off of this
website but not exactly but we will try
to create video background and we'll
just give some content and some buttons
so this is a beautiful website where you
can find some free stock video footages
video a video video dotnet so here is
the website and you can find this
website in the description in the video
description so on this website I got
this video and I have downloaded for or
in my local host now we'll use this
video in our HTML file it is playing I
have already downloaded this video now
we'll use this so let's get started
this is my HTML file and I'll take
header first with the class V header the
class V header and we'll also give
container inside this header will take
one div tag with the class fullscreen
video wrapper right inside this div tag
will take a video element
let's keep the source empty for now
because we need to give the file name
the video name and we'll set autoplay
equals to true in my application folder
I have downloaded this video which I
have shown you on the it webs on that
website red 40 dot mp4 is the extension
so I'll use it here and after giving
this all things let's take one header
overlay header overlay well the reason
why I am taking this div tag header
overlay is just display our content on
the front of this video on the top of
this video background I'll show you how
we can do that let's take one more dip
tag and let's give class as header
content and inside this head if tag
we'll take one h1 tag and let's say
hello happy cop right is my channel name
this is my channel name and let's put
some nomicon dummy content lorem lorem
ipsum and let's take one button tag here
anchor tag here and let's give class as
button you might have heard about Emmet
it's extension which you can download in
Visual Studio code or in other text
editors as well but in sublime you can
you have to download separately but in
Visual Studio code you have one option
for installing in for installing
extensions so I'll show you the omit
abbreviation here if you want to take
one anchor tag with the class button
then you need to give a dot BTN and then
you have to hit tab it
it will create an ankle tag with the
class button BTN so let's give H ref
here if you know if you want to more
about if you want to know more about
Emmett and then you can watch my
tutorial on Emmett I have shown all
things about Emmett how you can boost up
your workflow of HTML and CSS using
Emmett using Emmett abbreviation so
don't forget to watch my video on Emmett
so here is the button which we have
created let's say read more so we have
created HTML pattern we'll run this
inside our browser to see the preview
yeah it is working but you can see here
the horizontal scrollbar is coming so we
need to apply some CSS and also our
content is appearing below the video but
we need this content on this video right
so we have to apply some CSS let's start
with the border boxing part right
box-sizing border box so it will apply
to all elements of this HTML page now
let's take body padding:0 and margin:0
and also we need to give overflow X
hidden right color should be white let's
save this and let's see the preview yeah
you can see here horizontal scrollbar
has gone away from our page and the
video is appearing clearly now we'll
give
styling 2v header right so let's give
dot here so you can understand this that
this is a class right so we need to give
hide first 100 VH right and we need to
give something some things like padding
it should be 1 RAM and padding left and
padding right padding left and padding
right 1 Ram right let's save this and
let's see yeah we need to give
position:absolute top:0 and left is also
0 let's see the preview on the browser
no it is not taking our CSS actually we
need to remove these things yeah we need
to remove these things yeah I have given
CSS here we need to give display flex
right this these things we need to give
here display flex means it will take it
will become a responsive design for us a
line item Center means it I it aligned
all items to the center and we don't
need to give this color because we are
giving in V header part let's save this
and let's see the preview it is taking
and right let's apply some CSS to the
container maximum width
Ben 960 pixels it is taking here 960
pixels right padding left and padding
right should be one rem-1 rem-3
text-align:center margin
right let's safe and let's see the
preview margin auto ok alright we need
to remove this I think so it is taking
margin but right we need to give the
width as well hundred percent and height
should be hundred VH if you are not
familiar with vh + VW then definitely
you need to know more about a viewport
because this is the viewport height and
viewport width which I am using in my
CSS it is taking now and the maximum
width here is 960 pixels so definitely I
am doing something wrong here
let me check yeah actually I need to
apply this CSS as well these things we
need to apply maximum weight should be
960 and padding left padding right
should be 1 gram margin Auto and
text-align:center let's save this and
let's
use full screen video rapper because we
have taken video inside this rapper full
screen video rapper so we need to give
some CSS position should be absolute top
should be set to 0 left should be set to
0 and what what else we need to give
here I think we need to give width 100%
height 100 vh let's save and read from
the preview
yeah it is it is appearing full screen
now we need to use the video part right
inside this we have our video element so
we need to give minimum height should be
hundred-percent and minimum width should
also be 100% right inside this
fullscreen video wrapper we have video
elements so we need to set the minimum
height and minimum width to 100% and it
is taking the full width and full height
as you can see here and now we will use
header overlay class header overlay
class inside this and we need to use
position:absolute top:0 left:0 and we
need to set height VH and width should
be 100 V W viewport height right header
overlay it is not appearing
but it will appear we need to give
background should be set to hash two two
five four seven zero right let's save
this yeah it is our video background has
gone away from this because we have
given this and let's say opacity let's
use opacity here 0.75 and that index
should be set to 1 as you can see here
but it is not taking full height I think
we need to remove this not exactly
something we are missing here exactly we
need to use this CSS the height and
width should be set first right so I
have saved this CSS this CSS I am
applying here it is still not taking the
correct size something we are missing
let me check fullscreen video wrapper
yeah I think we need to use this
overflow:hidden inside our fullscreen
video wrapper let's save this yeah it is
not taking now and our video is playing
background in a background so we need to
use overflow:hidden inside
fullscreen video wrapper because it's a
wrapper for a video definitely we need
to use overflow we need to we need to
keep the overflow:hidden okay so this is
the way which we can play a background
with
full screen background video now it's
time for the content header content
right so inside this header content we
can use that index too because it should
be appearing on on the front of this
video as you can see here the text is
appearing now on the screen and also we
need to give some fonts for font size as
well so we'll use this class header
content first we'll take the h1 tag
because that's our first element inside
header content so let's give font size
as 50 pixels let's save and let's
preview yeah it is appearing in a large
font let's say header content of P let's
say font size like 25 pixels let's save
this yeah it is appearing but our button
is not customized we need to give some
custom CSS to this button to look to
look more appealing right so we need to
use this header content class and inside
this we can take a anchor - anchor tag
because we have given we have given
angle tag here and also we can use this
class as well right inside this let's
say background equals 2/3 for be 300 or
0 right let's save this and run we'll
see yeah it is taking but
we need to give some padding as well
padding one rim right yeah it is looking
more natural and more appealing now so
using this method using this way you can
give fullscreen video background using
HTML and CSS 3 and I hope it is clear
and you can apply some more CSS to look
more appealing in your cases but in my
case I have used only some simple CSS so
I have applied CSS already and I have
commented this CSS below my actual CSS
here in this standard CSS file so you
can use fools you can give fullscreen
video background in it using HTML and
CSS using this way thanks for watching
