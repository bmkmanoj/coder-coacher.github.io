login pages using entity framework or so
let's get started without any further
delay in this video I'm going to show
you how we can create database for the
register and login pages need speed or
net or MVC application and as you can
see i have created my detail context

context this is the constructor and i
have created two classes one is contact
and one is sign up in this sign up class
i have created some properties that is
email address username and password and
ID so these are some properties and this
is my login page
so for the new developers for the
beginners I would highly recommend you
to go through with this Doc's docs dot a
speed art net to get started with entity
framework or as you can see getting
started with asp.net call using ndd
framework or and this we are going to
select new database so these are the
steps to install entity framework or in
your asp.net MVC application so go
through these steps and install in DD
framework or in your application i'm
going to show you how i have installed
entity framework i have added
dependencies in our project jason folder
here microsoft at entity framework or
dots equals of a designer so these are
some dependencies we have to install
before getting started with entity
framework or and i have already set up
application and i have already created
my database in my application as you can
see this is my detail context these are
my two database sets one is for contact
and when is for signup and this is my
login page and this is my sign up class
signup page and this is contact class in
this contact class i have created an ID
property and first name last name and
phone number so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to run this application and
show how we can sign up to this
application and how we can login into
this application so let's do this let's
run this applique
for setting a pure project to install
entity framework or go through this
website to go through these documents
and follow these steps you could easily
install entity framework Alinea MVC
application as you can see the steps are
mentioned over here so go through with
that yeah our application is ready let

message after logging in that is logged
in you can see here so let me show you
how I have installed entity framework or
in my application these are the
dependencies which we have already
included in the project or Jason folder
and in the start of god c.s class you
need to configure it yeah you need to
give connection string this is the
connection string you can get it from
the sequel server object explorer this
is the connection string the properties
you can get over here
yeah this is the connection string so
copy this connection string and paste it
here in the connection variable and I
have added this connection string in the
services at dbcontext detailed context
of options dot you sequel server
connections and the configure method I
have ensured created I have take this
parameter as detailed context and in the
context i have ensuring that my database
is already created or not making sure
