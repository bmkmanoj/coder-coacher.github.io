I'm gonna show you some higher-order
functions in JavaScript like es6
functions these are actually the es6
functions like filter map sort and
reduce so here it is basic file dot HTML
file and I have created two arrays one
is startups and the next one is ages in
startups we have some objects with some
properties called name platform location
and here so I have few properties in
this array as you can see here and the
next array is ages so basically what I'm
trying to show you in this video is I'm
trying to show you some higher-order
functions which you can use inside your
J's projects JavaScript projects and you
can improve your skills if you work on
those if you work on those functions so
as you can see here we have a two basic
arrays and using these two arrays I'm
gonna show you how you can actually use
these higher-order functions like filter
maps are introduced in JavaScript you
can I'm not going to I'm not going in
deep to show you these all things but
I'll show you the basics of these
functions so that you can explore more
about this on internet on Google so and
also you can use this inside any
framework or inside any project like
angular or react so it depends on your
requirement right so let's get started
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use
the for loop here right so I'll just
take let I equals to 0 and I'm going to
say I less than startups startups dot
length right sorry
and I'm gonna increment this value
right and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
console dot log the value of these
startups of I right so let's save it and
let's see the preview inside the browser
sorry let's save it and let's see the
preview inside the browser as you can
see here we have the herbs we have list
of objects inside our array and you can
see all properties like name platform
location and ear so this is just a basic
and a simple example of for loop for how
to loop an array but I'll show you how
you can loop an array using some
advanced loop called for each you might
have heard about this loop let me show
you how you can actually use inside your
javascript file inside your javascript
function right I'm gonna say Const and
I'm gonna see start up equals to
startups dot for each right I'm gonna
say for I'm gonna take one anonymous
function here and let's say start right
console dot log console dot log start
save it and let's see the preview inside
the browser and it still works as you
can see here I have taken a variable
constant variable startup and I'm gonna
now am looping through and and add an
array startups array using for each loop
and I'm just using one anonymous
function and passing on parameter and
just AM console logging into this
constant variable right but you can do
this in using arrow functions as well
let me show you start right this is the
more advanced
the arrow functions are popular these
days in JavaScript and you can do this
here is an example console dot log start
right let's save it and let's see the
preview inside the browser and still
works you can see here right all the
objects all the objects of this era
startups they are listing inside the
console dot log you can see here right
so this is the more advanced way using
arrow functions so these kind of things
I am going to teach you in this video so
the next one is the filter function in
JavaScript right basically filter
functions allow us to filter some values
present in our array let me show you how
you can do that constant filtered value
right startups dot filter and we'll take
one function and say startup right
startup and I'm gonna say console dot
log no sorry I'm gonna say if I'm taking
I'm trying to filter the values right
if startup dot here greater than 85 so
those values I'm going to print inside
the console right I'm filtering the
value here startup as you can see here
what I'm trying to do here is I'm gonna
I'm trying to filter the values depends
on the ear attribute here attribute
inside this object right if the value of
the ear is greater than 85 then it is
going to print the startup value right
so I'll save it an LCD preview inside
the browser you can see here I have only
one object right which is greater than
why let me check here it is 95 right all
the values are below 85 80 70 42 and 45
right so using this technique you can
filter the values but let me show you
the another way of this filter function
is the arrow function right you start up
right start up and say start up dot here
greater than 60 right then I'll say
console dot log console dot log start up
right otherwise I'm gonna say I'm using
ternary operator here as you can see
here I'm using ternary operator and I'm
trying to print the values in the
console which has the value of here
greater than 60 or else I'm gonna say oh
 right this is the simple message so
let's save it and let's see the preview
in the browser you can see here I have
three values which has the Year value
greater than 60 as you can see here 95
80 and 70 I have three values in C in in
the console the two values are lesser
than are less than 60 so I got the
message oh two times you can see
here the count of this message inside
the circle here the small circle right
so this is the smart and the advanced
way using arrow functions you can use
filter method this is just a simple
example but you can explore more about
this as I said earlier you can explore
more about these functions on internet
or you can find some good documentation
some good articles to read and you can
know more about these functions let me
just comment out this function let's
move
the next function that is map right the
map function is just used for creating
an array of elements like if you want to
map anything then you can use this
function let me show you the demo of
this function mapped what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna say startups dot map and
I'm gonna say function and I'm gonna say
startup the value of startup right and
I'm gonna say console dot log I want the
name of startups individual startups
right dot name let's save it and let's
see the preview inside the browser I
have all names of the of the companies
of the startups which I have defined
here in this startups array right what
if I want if I want to use something
like the expression right
so in this I'm going to use some
variables like I want the name of the
startup and the ear and the location as
well I want three values so I'll use
this expression right I'm going to say
dollar right startup dot name and I want
dollar startup dot location and I also
want sorry I let me connect this one
right dollar and I won't start up dot
here or you can say platform right so I
want these three
values inside the console the name
location and the platform this he can
use this expression you can use right I
have created one video on this
expression and you can watch to watch
that tutorial to understand this kind of
expressions in JavaScript right you use
this one and I'll paste it here you can
see here let me use the right you can
see here I pick up the location and the
platform the company's locations and the
platform's you can see here so this is
just a simple demo of map function in
JavaScript hope you understand and hope
you are getting my points what I'm
trying to explain you and please let me
know your comments in the in the comment
section below right if I'm doing
anything wrong let me know let's comment
out this line and let's move to the next
function that is sort function as you
can understand the functionality of this
function right it allows you to sort the
values inside the array right
let me show you how you can do that
Const sort it you can say startups no
I'm gonna use the ages area now I have
created two arrays right I have created
two arrays here the startups and the
ages one right so let me use ages dot
sort and let me take one anonymous
function here let's take age one or you
can say a comma B let me take two values
here right if a is greater than B I'm
gonna say console dot log a and let me
use the concatenation part hooray
right else I'm gonna say else hooray no
it's B so let's save it what I'm
trying to do here is I'm taking two
values because sort function takes two
two parameters right I'm taking two
values and I'm comparing these two
values if a is greater than B then it is
going to print a else it is going to
print B save this and let's see let
me use some spaces here so that it is
more readable right
 4,343 hooray 18 right it takes two
values because if 33 is greater then 33
is not greater than 43 so it it prints
43 first right then it takes 43 and a
team the next two values right it takes
two values 43 and 18:43 is greater than
so it prints 43 here in the console like
that it prints in the order it compares
every two value of it it compares two
values in every call right so let me use
the the advanced method the advanced way
of writing sort function is this one
right so use a comma B arrow functions
we are using arrow functions now right
and we are saying that if a is greater
than B right and I'm gonna say console
dot log a right or else I'm gonna say
console dot log B right this is the
advanced way of writing sort functions
save it and let's see the preview as you
can see here 43 43
so you can append some strings here to
see the exact values exact results it
just takes two values and it say we are
using ternary operator here if a is
greater than B then it is going to print
a value or else if it is going if it is
less lesser than B then it is going to
print the B value in the console so we
are getting the exact results but you
can append some you can concatenate some
strings inside your console dot log
statement to see the correct answer
right so I'm commenting out this line
here hope you understand about these
three functions filter map sort and last
but not the least is the radius function
in JavaScript let me show you
radius function allows you to reduce the
work which you are doing on array in
JavaScript like if you want to notice
some value of elements in an array then
you can use this function like let me
show you the demo here right some or
ages you can say ages some equals two
ages dot reduce and use function total
comma age right use this function and
say console dot log total plus age right
I am NOT going to use console dot log
statement because in radius we can we
have to use return function because it
returns something right we are trying to
know the total value the sum of all
elements inside ages array right so we
need to use this written statement in
reduced function rhythm remember this
point right the total value is zero
initially the initial value of total is
zero it takes the first value of age and
it then adds it to the total and it
returns the value so let me use let me
save it and let's see the preview inside
the browser it is not showing any result
because we have to use console dot log
each sum we have to use this you can see
here the value now 230 is the sum of all
elements sum of all values inside the
ages array right this is the advance
this is not the advance because we are
not using any arrow function here right
you can see here it takes two two
parameters total and age and it returns
the total plus age right it returns the
total plus age value right but you can
do this in an advanced way like it takes
two values total comma age right and
it's a total plus age and comma past
zero value right I am doing in one line
this is the optimized way of doing of
using Java sky
higher order JavaScript functions I'm
just passing two parameters total and
age and just I'm adding these two values
and I'm say passing the zero value to
the total the initial value should be
zero
I'm just using this optimized well let's
see the preview and it still gives the
same value to 30 right this is the
optimized way and this is the advanced
way of writing JavaScript functions
using Aero function and hope you like it
and hope you understand each and
everything which I have explained you in
this video please let me know your
comments your feedback in the comment
section below and I hope you really
enjoy this video thanks for watching
this video
and
forget to watch my previous tutorial on
JavaScript and es6 videos kind of then
you can easily understand those concepts
so thanks for watching this video and
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
