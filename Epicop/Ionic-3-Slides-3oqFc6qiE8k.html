and I hope you all are doing good and
today I'm gonna show you something
interesting and that is slides in ionic
three how you can make slides in ionic
three so before we get started I would
like to suggest you to visit the
documentation of ionic that is ionic dot
IO there you can find the introduction
about slides and the stuff which you
need in order to create slides in ionic
3 so this is just my simple introduction
to slides and I will create a simple and
easy slider in this video so let's get
started so I have my home dot HTML file
open in this visual studio code editor
and here you can see the home file this
is the default root page of my ionic app
in this I'm gonna create its symbol
slider so let's get started with the
home dot TS file let's create a simple
array known as slides or a slider in
this array I'm gonna create three
objects the first one will be titled and
the title will be like ionic is also the
first title and after this I'm gonna
take one more thing called description
description and in this description I am
gonna give yannick is built on top of
angular as its it is a fact you guys you
all guys you know that ionic is built on
the top of angular and ionic team is
consistently working on this
this is just a simple and a sweet
description which I'd like to add in
this slider part after this I'm gonna
take image and I'm gonna give the path
of the mage when I open my folder
structure or the folder path where I
have created this project of IBM inside
the vs projects you can see here when I
open this you can find it the source
folder inside the source folder I have
one assets folder and inside I have
image so let's give as assets slash
image slash your image name I'm gonna
copy this image and I'm gonna paste it
here so this is my first slider object
and next Lee I'm gonna create another
slider object I'll copy these all three
fields of the first object and I'll
paste it here inside the second object
and instead of saying awesome we can say
that ionic is fully native and we can
say that the top of let's remove this
same description ionic also uses sass as
it is also a fact as you guys all know
as you all guys know that and I'm gonna
copy this by pressing function + f2 and
I'll copy the image name and I will
paste it here inside the second object
let's create the final object I'm gonna
use three objects in this slider so I
have created two already and this one is
the last copy down these three fields of
the second object paste it here
and say that it's ionic three is the
latest version latest world right and
description in description will say
angular 4 is the latest one you could
give anything in the in the description
I am just showing for an example the
latest version and I'll copy this by
pressing function f2 and I'll copy the
image name and I just paste it here so
let's save these all things we have
created one slider and we have given
three things three objects in this
slider and now we will access now we
will use this slider array inside our
home Brad HTML file let's jump to the
home dot HTML file and let's see the
slider part now I on slides this one and
inside this I on slides we will create
what we will take one more element
called I on slide and let's close this
tag and also I would like to suggest you
to give phaser equals to true because
your bullet points may not appear on the
slider if you are not giving page at
equals to true it's just help you to
show or to display the bullet points on
your slider and I'm gonna take one
structural directive here called ng for
as you might have heard about this in
angular but those who are familiar with
angular must know about this
let slide off this thing slider
let's paste it here let's light up
slider and let's take their eye on tool
box let's forget about this for now
let's take one image tag here first of
all and let's say the source of the
image is obviously the slide dot image
you might be wondering why I have why I
use this element slide dot image well I
have created an object of desire a
slider which I which we have created
inside the home door ts file and using
this object we are accessing the first
image here right
not only the first means we are going to
access all images in that array and
after doing this I'll take one h2 tag
and I will close this h2 tag and inside
this I will take inner HTML equals to
slide dot title right inside this has to
tag our title will be displayed this
title non-ego is awesome is fully native
and it's the latest version right so
after taking these all things lastly I'm
going to take one P tag one paragraph
tag for displaying my for displaying my
description right so let's copy this in
a rest ml part and let's paste it here
and let's change this title to the
description as we are going to display
the description so I'll just save these
all things and let's preview this all
things in the browser itself it is
loading now
as I said earlier you must visit the
documentation of ionic to know more
about sliders as you can see here under
the dogs we have components and inside
components we have a slider section and
you can see here this is a simple slider
and also we have a button yeah you can
see here and if you want to see the
source code of this slider then you can
visit the get hep by hitting this button
demo source inside this basic folder
yeah we will have three files pages dot
ta sty lots s CSS and template dot HTML
as you can see here pager and we have
used almost everything here we will use
this part also this part is just for
giving the skip button at the top of the
slider right ion toolbar and inside iron
buttons at the end we are seeing this
now ever application is ready it is not
showing let's save this file one more
time oh I think yeah we have given
everything correct yeah I destroying
that here you can see it might take some
time to load or to put or to display the
preview of the slider I thought it was
not loading on my browser so we will use
this part also right ion toolbar iron
buttons right inside my slide I will use
ion toolbar and inside my toolbar I'll
use one ion buttons and add the ending
position we will use one button
and this button will be used for the
next thing right we can use anything
here I'll just give button and I'll just
give the color as well color equals to
secondary you could have key if anything
you would have given anything you could
give anything inside this I will just
use next here just save this let's
preview thing the preview we can preview
changes in the browser and you you may
you might want to give some event to
this button to be redirected to the
second page so in my case I'm not going
to redirect this because we are we are
we have created a simple slider right
and also we will use one method one
function here I on slide did change I'll
show you how you can use that you can
see this yeah it is working fine and the
images are also displaying you can also
give your own style inside the home dot
a CSS file I'm not going to give any
styling to this slider this is just the
simple slider which I have created let's
remove this toolbar because we are not
going to use this we will see about the
slider change part if one slide gets
changed we will display one message in
the toast controller right so I'll use
this inside here inside the
on slide I on slide it should be in
cattle farm I guess I on slide did
change oh right so let's give one method
your slide changed so let's save this
let's create a new method inside the
home dot ts file with the name I on sly
a slide changed slide change and what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just create a
simple toast controller private toast
controller of type toast controller as
we have not imported this thing we can
use it we can import post controller at
the top of the page as we are getting
error here so we need to press control +
dot it's yeah you can see here add toast
controller the toast controller has been
added you can see here inside it comes
from ionic angular so we can use this
toast controller now to display our
messages right this dot toast controller
dot create message of type slide has
been changed will display this simple
message slide has been changed and we'll
just use this method called present yeah
this is just a simple toast controller
right let's save this to files and let's
see that if our slide gets changed
we are getting this message in the toast
controller or not it is building now and
we can see the preview of its own also I
have I have used this source code

so I will close this tab yeah we are not
getting the toast controller missus
right so we are doing something wrong
here
I on slide did change I think I have
given let's give this to the eye on
slides part not to the hand slide right
and all simultaneously we will also
search about slightly change it is
running now and it might take some time
we will search about this method on
Google

was wrong so I have given I am slightly
