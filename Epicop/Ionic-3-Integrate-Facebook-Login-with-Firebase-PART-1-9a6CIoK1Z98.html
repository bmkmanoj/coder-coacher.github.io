Moussa Colleen from a pickup and today
I'm gonna show you how you can integrate
facebook login in ionic 3 so for doing
that we need to use obviously we need to
use angularfire to package so we need to
install that but before that I'll show
you how you can create a project in
firebase as you can see here I have
created one project in firebase if you
want to create a new one then you can
easily do it I have my I have created my
project here and inside this product
inside this project I will first enable
my authentication the Facebook
authentication because we are going to
integrate that so we'll do it first now
I have enabled email and password method
but this time I'll enable Facebook so
we'll just enable it as you can see here
we need app ID and app secret and we can
get this from we can get this from the
Facebook so for creating a new project
in Facebook you need to type this URL
called developer start facebook.com
slash apps so I'll show you how you can
create a new app in Facebook so that you
can get your app ID and app secret but
before that we'll see how you can
install angularfire to package because
we are going to use that in our project
right so i have also installed this
package I've also downloaded this
package in my project you can see here
if you want to install this angularfire
to and firebase package then you need to
use this command call npm install
angular fire to firebase - - safe as
their safe means it is it just saved in
your package store JSON file so this is
the command you can run easily to
install angularfire to package so that
you can use the authentication
angularfire authentication
so after installing this package you
need to copy the key which I will show
you here you can get your key from
firebase web you have to select web
setup yeah you can see here I have my
configuration key here and I have copied
this and I have paste it in my project
as you can see here inside app dot
module or TS I have my configuration fee
configuration key so you can paste it
here right above the ng model decorator
and after copying this you need to
import some statements in order to use
angular fire authentication so for that
I'll show you how you can do it first
you need to import the angular fire
module dot initialize app it just
initialized your angular fire module and
we need to pass firebase in it so we
need to give this statement inside the
imports array so well this is the first
step for using angular fire
authentication means it just initialize
your app and after doing that you need
to import angular fire auth here you can
input here copy here and you need to
pass this angular fire auth inside the
imports add a I'll show you here you can
see here angular fire auth module
angularfire auth module sorry we have
missed this statement we need actually
we need to copy this import statement
angular fire auth module from
angularfire to slash auth we need to
give this one and after giving this we
need to copy this angular fire off
module and we need to pass it in the amp
in the imports array
forget about all those stuff because I
have imported some more import
statements here this was a part of my
previous video which I have given to
process
Jason requests using HTTP GET method so
the these things are not really useful
for you angularfire module file database
modulized we are not using database in
this application so we don't need this
so we do not need this angularfire
database module you just need to import
the angularfire auth module as we are
going to authenticate users why I
integrate by integrating social of
Facebook social login so we just need
this statement angularfire auth module
and you just need this configuration key
which you can get from your firebase
console and also you need to pass two
parameters inside your input sorry and
that parameters are angularfire module
dot initialize app it just initialize
your app and you need angularfire auth
module that's it now I will show you how
you can create your app you just need to
go develop you just need to go on
developers or facebook.com slash apps
and then click create a new app probably
it may ask you for the password you can
give your display name and I'm gaming
this as IBM create app ID you can give
your password
no not password you're just asking us to
for human verification c-h a WP x-l and
occurred while processing this request
and then let's click create app ID l9 3
I don't know why if you think seeing
this my mistake please let us know
it is not a m5o ybk yeah you can see
here our app ID is here so we need to
close this one we are we are integrating
space book login right so we need to set
we need to click this button setup
button so that we can have our app ID
and app secret so we'll select web as we
are not hosting our application so we
need to give the URL for low localhost
I'll just give localhost / and we'll
save this one and we'll just hit
continue next we'll select next next
back so now we'll go to the settings
yeah you can see here we have to give
our URL for Roth redirect so we can get
this from here if we go to the Facebook
yeah you can see here twice to complete
setup at this redirect URI to your
Facebook app configuration so we need to
copy this and we have to paste it here
and Save Changes and after doing that we
need to go to the dashboard to get the
app ID and app secret yeah you can see
here I have my app ID here so I'll copy
this one and I'll paste it here inside
the app ID and this is my app secret
which you can see here when I click show
yeah it is asking me to enter my
password so I need to enter my facebook
password so so that I
can have yeah yeah see here I I got my
app secret app secret and paste it here
and hit Save button so that it just
enabled your Facebook yeah you can see
here or Facebook authentication is
successfully enabled so now we can write
our logic now we can write our code
inside the visual studio code editor so
I have explained you in a lucid way so
what you need to do before getting
started with the Facebook integration or
the facebook login if you want to
integrate your facebook login in your
project or in your app then you need to
install angularfire to package and you
need to import these statements and you
need to give your configuration key
which you can get from your firebase
console and you need to pass those two
statements inside imports array now we
will jump to the home dot TS file so
forget about these all things and you
can see here forget about these all
things GDP header this was my this this
is the part of my last video so you need
to forget this all import statements now
I'm going to show you how you what you
need to import in order to use
angularfire authentication so that you
can integrate Facebook login in your
ionic app so we'll import first import
firebase from firebase you need to
import this statement and then you need
to import one more statement called I'll
show you here on the documentation you
can see here
inside you can see it import angularfire
art from angular2 angularfire to slash
auth you need to import this statement
you need to import this statement
here and
then you need to import another
statement yeah you need to import this
statement as well
so remove this statement from here
because we have used this one we have
used this one and also we need to pass
the parameter inside the constructor as
you can see here I have a list of
parameters inside my constructor and I
need to pass it again private you can I
think you have to give yeah
private angularfire auth which is of
type angularfire auth so this one and
now I'll create my login method login
with Facebook
this is my method and for logout I'll
create one more method log out with
Facebook so these are my two methods if
the user wants to log in with Facebook
then you can then we can give this
method on the click event of login
button
and if you if the user wants to log out
from the Facebook then we can give this
method in the click event of the button
first we'll create two buttons inside
home dot HTML but
I own button
I on button
and the color will be I'll give
secondary here for login button
login with facebook login with Facebook
blogging with Facebook and we need to
give
click event
and we need to give this method we need
to pass it here and also will create one
more button for logout
and I'll change and I'll remove this
color because it default it takes
primary color so I'll give my I leave
this method logout with Facebook I'll
copy here and I'll say login this one
will be log out log out with Facebook
these are the two buttons which I have
created for logging and log log out log
out with Facebook so I'll save this one
for login I'll use this method as you
can see here sign in with Facebook and
I'm checking that here below I'll show
you how you can yeah this dot
angularfire auth dot or dot sign in with
sign in with
pop-ups and inside this I'll just pass
new firebase
dot
odd
dot my facebook auth provider yeah you
can see here so I'll give this one and
then it returns a promise right so we
need to give this
consult or talk will just display our
result in the console so that we can see
the result right and for logout this dot
angularfire auth dot sign out or auth
dot sign out we can use this method to
sign out user from the Facebook so we
will save this and we will see that we
are display we are getting any response
in the console or not what I am doing
here is I'm just allowing user to sign
in with Facebook with the pop-up and
after doing that user needs to enter
their credentials so that they can enter
this so that they can log in with
Facebook auth provider and just am
displaying the result it returns like a
promise so we need to save this all
things and we need to run this inside
our browser using ionic lab command
so this will this will run our ionic app
on the browser
Soho I think it might take some time to
compile or to run on the browser my
laptop is bit slow so we need to wait on
this
it is taking time
so hope you understand and hope it is
clear so far first you need to create a
project in firebase so that you can have
your configuration file and you can also
enable the authentication method in
authentication section you just need to
go to sign-in method I have also enabled
my email part which I have shown in my
previous video how you can log in with
email and password using firebase in
ionic 3 so this is the video which is
about the integration of Facebook log in
in ionic 3 for that we need to install
angular 2 fire auth package and also you
need to create a project on Facebook so
that you can have your app ID and app
secret it is still run yeah it is
running you can see here so hope it is
clear to you and hope you understand
about the facebook login integration in
ionic 3 so this is the simple way of the
integrating facebook login in ionic 3
you could do easily first you need to
set up your Facebook inside the Facebook
apps then you need to have you need to
give your site URL in my case I have
given local Lowe's because we are not
hosting any app or we are not hosting
our app on any server so we need to give
localhost and after doing that you know
you need to copy this or three direct
URI which you can get from here ya is
ready now now we will see
yeah it is ready and we can see here
it is not showing so we need to save
this
buttons
it is not showing me
oh I guess I need to give this to button
sorry sorry for that I forgot to give
these two buttons inside ionic content
we have given above iron content so we
need to give here we need to paste I
have given above iron content so
probably it will not display so we have
corrected this now it will display on
our screen
the students log in with Facebook and
log out with Facebook yeah you can see
here first we'll open our console so
that we can have a quick look to the
response which we will get after login
with Facebook now I'll just use this
developer console on the right side
right yeah
console log in with Facebook you can see
here it is showing me that Facebook
pop-up so I'll click continue I'll say
it now you can see here
yeah it is giving me some error the
pop-up has been closed by the user okay
so actually we need to
actually I was doing something wrong
here and that thing was this one I have
imported the important import star as
firebase from firebase / app so if we
are using on it on a platform or like
Android so we need to import this
statement if you are developing your app
on a web so that you can use this
statement import firebase from firebase
this statement will be correct for your
application so I have imported statement
I have changed this one to this one
import firebase from firebase so this is
the correct way of authenticating users
so probably will not get the error now
we'll save this and we'll run this
application and we'll see login with
Facebook it it will take my credentials
as you can see here yeah we got the
response in console when we expand this
when we go to user section you can see
here our app name firebase app name and
the display name email address and phone
number none and the photo URL you can
see here lot of stuff is there so we can
access this we can access this details
and we can display it on our page so
this was all about the integration of
facebook login in ionic 3 so hope you
understand and sorry for the mistake
which I did here while authenticating
users we need to import the statements
in order for the login in order for the
Facebook authentication so this way you
can log it this way you can integrate
Facebook login your ionic 3 a app and
hope you understand hope you like this
