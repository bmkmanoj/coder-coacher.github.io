show you how to create collapsible
panels using bootstrap so let's see what
is water panels a panel in bootstrap is
a border box with some padding around
its content and basically parents are
created with the panel class and the
content inside the panel can be created
using panel body class and for the
heading we can use panel heading class
and for the footer we can use panel
footer if we have more than one panels
then we can create more than one panels
in a panel group class so so to color
the panels we can use contextual classes
like panel default primary success so
these are some different kinds of panels
so let's see in the demo application how
we can create panels using bootstrap so
let's get started
so inside this diff container I'm going
to create panel group and i'm going to
give ID as the group inside this group
i'm going to create a pan pan info
under this in full battle
let's take the glasses panel heading
so this should be the heading for the
panel under this I'm going to take h2
tag for the panel title let's take the
classes panel title and has to as well
under this hedge to tag I am going to
take an anchor tag and first panel data
toggle should be the collapse class
collapse
and date apparent since it is the tie
clasp it should map to the parent class
the parent of these anchor tag is the
group panel group this one so we need to
give the ids group
digg this anchor tag name as first panel
so this is our panel heading
after that create another div class for
the panel
collapse collapse in
the ID for the panel should be the first
panel which is given in in the both
anchor tag inside this if I'm going to
take another div tag and let's give the
name ass and body and write some dummy
content here
collapsible panels let's save this and
run this application in the browser and
you can see here it is working fine it
is a collapsible collapsible panel so
let's create some more collapsible
panels in this panel group copy this
panel here and paste it down here and
let's give this as
since this is our second panel to change
this ID to the second panel and change
this name to second panel save and run
you can see here both the panels are
working fine let's do it more since we
have different kinds of panels in the
panel group let's take this panel for
the success and change this to the tour
panel copy this paste it here save this
and run this you can see here
our three panels which we have created
just now working fine so let's create
one more panel for the danger zone
let's change this ID name to the 4
channel copy this paste it here and here
also save this
yeah this one is the danger panel so
