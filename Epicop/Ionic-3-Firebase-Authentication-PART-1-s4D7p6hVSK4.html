Musa Colleen from a pickup and today I'm
going to show you firebase
authentication in ionic so let's get
started so this is my home page and you
can see here I have two buttons on my
home page register and login in this
video I will show you how we can
register using firebase authentication
and probably in the next part of this
video that will be the part two in that
video I will show you the login using
the firebase authentication so we will
see how we can register using email so
this is my home page I have two buttons
on my home page and you could see here I
have created register page and login
page using the command ionic G means
generate page and your page name so you
would use this command to generate a new
page in ionic so this is my register
page and I have given a form with two
input fields one is the username and
another wise another one is the password
so these are the two input fields on my
register page and the register button is
here and on the click event I am calling
user register so this is about the
register page and this is the login page
same as like register page with two
input fields username and password first
we will see about the register page now
we will jump to the firebase dashboard
here you could see that I have a project
with this name and if you want to create
a new project then click this button add
project and give your project name test
project and you have to select your
country I'll select India
and yeah so if if you could if you hit
this button then your project will be
created I have my project created here
so I'll open this and inside the project
dashboard you could see here we have a
list of different options
authentication database storage so as we
are going to see the authentication part
so we need to use this option that is
authentication so I don't have any users
right now so if we click setup sign-in
method yeah you can see here we have
different options email phone and you
could also log in with Google Facebook
Twitter get up and even anonymous logins
are also available in firebase so I'll
select this one and I'll enable this one
and I'll save this so this will allow us
to log in with email and password so
when we go back we'll see three
different options I had firebase 2 iOS
app Android app and your web app so
we'll select this one and we can see
here we have API key and value so this
is my API key and value so I'll add this
one type a key to my AB dot module or TS
file not this file AB dot module dot TS
this one copy this file and close this
above your ng module you could see here
constant firebase
equals two spot you could see here I
have a firebase authentication variable
with API key and it a value so I have
saved it saved that value in AB dot
modular TS file and now we'll jump to
the page where we can get the
instructions to install angular firebase
angular firebase auth so this is the
link and I'll page this thing in the
video description so you can have it
from there
get up the dot-com slash angular slash
angularfire - so using this information
will install firebase in our application
when we go to the docs will see a list
of options here and we'll go to the
first option that is installer and setup
so if we want to install firebase in
about ionic project then we have to use
this command this command NPM install
angular fire to firebase - as safe this
command will save angular fire to
firebase in our package dot jason so you
can see here I have my git bash open
here so we'll use this command npm
install angular angular fire to angular
fire to firebase - - safe this will
install firebase auth in our project so
after installing this you could see here
add firebase config - environments
variable as we have done already this
part we have done already in AB dot
model or TS we have saved we have saved
our API key so you can see here API key
and API value this is the most important
part of firebase authentication unless
and until you you cannot say you you
have to save this innocently you can't
use firebase authentication and ionic
project so we have save already and
after doing this we have to import
angularfire module in AB dot module or
TS this might take some time to install
we will add this import statement to AB
dot module dot TS here you can see I've
got modulo TS and after importing the
angularfire module we have to give
angularfire module in imports this is
the import array so we could use this so
I'll use this in this option inside the
parameter as you can see here it is not
showing angularfire module because of
the comma we have to give comma then
angularfire module dot initialize app
firebase in this case it is present
under the environment folder and -
firebase but in my case I have as I have
given a constant variable here so I
could use here directly so we will see
yeah the angular fire model has been
installed in our ionic project so now we
could use angular fire module angular
firebase
so after importing in the imports array
we have to use we have to assign in the
firebase database earth modules as well
adding firebase database and out modules
is a optional part because we are not
using any data based of here so but we
are using auth modules so we have to
include this angularfire
auth module and here we have to give it
below this so this will bring the
authentication part in our application
when we jump here you can see here
angularfire auth module inside the
imports array below this one this will
bring the authentication part so
injecting angularfire database is not a
mandatory here as they are not using
database part and we are not shooting
anything on database so this is all
about the authentication part we have
added and we have imported all the
statements in a broad module or TS so
now we'll go to the user authentication
part when we say when we hit save when
we save this all files now it's time for
the registration part we have to close
this ab dot model or TS as we are done
with that now we will jump to the
registered or TS file and this while we
will register a new user so we will see
here you user authentication so this is
the most important part of registering a
user in firebase as you could see here
angular fire auth from
no fire to slash or this import
statement will allow us to register the
new user
so I will paste it down here
and I'll use this import statement in my
registered or TS file and finally I'll
create a I will pass a parameter of this
firebase earth slash angular fair auth
so what we have what I have done here is
I have created a firebase earth which is
of type angular fire earth and I have
passed as a parameter in the constructor
so this is the method user dot Register
method will get call on the register
button click event so inside this I'll
use this this dot firebase auth dot you
could see here I have a list of options
here now I am NOT doing collect e you
can see here when we use this dot
firebase or the dot dot dot yeah you can
see here we have a list of different
options yeah you can see a sign in
anonymously sign-in with credentials
custom token we have different options
so I'll use create user with email and
password and this method will take two
parameters probably here you can see
here email is the first parameter which
is of type string and the next one is
the password which is also of type
string and I'll pass this dot user dot
value comma distort
password dot value so as you can see
here it returns a promise probably you
don't probably you might have heard
about promise promise is let me tell you
about the promise promise promise is
actually a fancy way to write a
synchronous code so this will return a
promise so we'll see how we can handle
the promise and how we can manage to
show the promise return value in the in
our browser console so we will see that
when we use the word promise then then
data of you can see here console dot log
user means user user registered
successfully and we'll also see data
semicolon if it returns any error then
we will catch this error and we'll
display this error in the console using
console dot log will display message
called error register ll in or error
registering user error registering user
will display this message and we'll also
see the error so this is all about the
authentication part we are we are
creating our new user we are registering
our new user with email and password
bypassing two parameters that is email
and password and let me show you the
form this is the form this is the item
for is for the username and
the next item is for the password so we
have basically two items to field two
input fields available on my form
username and password so I am using this
use two values in view child and I am
accessing the values from that view
child so I am passing along with the
with this method and finally I am
returning the promise which will be
shown in the console so let's see if
they hit the Save button and let's run
our ionic app using ionic lab this
command will run our ionic app in ionic
lab so you can see here this is all
about the firebase authentication this
in this video I have all I have shown or
only the part of registration user
registration but in the next part of
this video I will show you how we can
login using firebase authentication
using email and password so hope it is
clear so far and hope you understand
about and then say no because I don't
want to install an update here when we
hit no this process ionic app will be
started for compiling we'll start it
compiling on the home page I have
created two buttons as I have shown you
already register and login and when the
user aids register it gets pushed nav
controller will push this to register
page and this boggin method will push
the user to login page and I am doing
without lazy loading and in the net in
the upcoming videos I will also show you
about lazy loading as well how we can
use lazy loading and in ionic so I'll
show you in the up
in videos you can see here it is still
compiling it might take some time to run
on the browser so this is the part and I
have already enabled the sign-in method
of email and password our application is
ready now this will bring the nice
little interface of any type of all
three platforms in my case I'm only
using iPhone you could also select
Android and Windows as well first I'll
open my console you can see here when we
click register this brings up the form
and I will give moosa at the rate
gmail.com and password when we hit
register here you can see here moosa dot
moosa at gmail.com we are able to see in
our console and the response which is in
in a JSON format you can see here key
values display name email address and
all the other stuff so when we go to the
when we go to the firebase auth
dashboard we were able to see the user
with the name mu sided gmail.com as you
could see here this is all about the
registration part with email and
password so hope it is clear so far and
hope you understand about the
registration and in the next video I
will show you how you could log in with
email and password thanks for watching
