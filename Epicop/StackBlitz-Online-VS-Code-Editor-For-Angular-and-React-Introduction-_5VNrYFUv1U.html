column from epic op and today I'm going
to show you one interesting app and
there is more popular on internet these
days and that is stag days it's the
online visuals good studio code IDE for
developing angular and react apps so
it's a stag blaze allows you to create
angular react and ionic apps in just a
one click
it has embedded Visual Studio Visual
Studio code editor and it has lot lot of
features like intelligence and that is
present in Visual Studio code and it
also provides hot reloading as you type
and it also allows you to import NPM
packages and so that you can easily
install dependencies and also it gives
you the for stood app URL this is the
feature which I like really which I like
most it gives you the hosted app URL so
that you can share with your friends and
with anyone you wanted so it also keep
editing while off and you can make
changes and you can edit your
application on stackless while you are
offline so we'll see how we can create
our application in stack bliss let's go
ahead and click I on ik I'm going to
create a simple reference app to show
you how you how it works as you can see
here it looks like a Visual Studio code
ID and here you can see our app is
running its bundling and also this is
the URL for stead instant hosted URL so
that you can share with your friends
when I copy this and when I open this in
another tab you can see my application
here this is the feature which I really
like about stack bliss and also you can
create your production
apps or any app on stack bliss
so we'll see now we'll jump to the pages
and we'll see the home page home dot
HTML now you can see here it is home so
we'll change it to epic op and you can
see here hot reloading it gets changed
to epic up and you can also use any
ionic element inside this file you can
see here it is also reloading on the
browser which I have open here these are
the tabs which is in the footer about
contact we have three pages inside this
app and let me show you about the
dependencies how you can install
dependencies in stack bliss here we have
a bunch of dependencies NPN packages
Alex this typescript angular core HTTP
so just you need to type your package
name here so that you can install that
dependency so I will type angular fire
or angular slash file to installing
dependencies oh it is giving some it is
giving some error try installing a
different package name ago okay so this
package is not available in dependency
section so we need to install any other
dependencies like if you want to install
any dependency then you should type here
and so that you can easily install that
particular dependency and here we have
settings you can see we can also delete
this project as well and we have
different options we can open this in a
new window
like I shown open
it opens in the same window you can make
any changes and you can see the instant
results it just reloads when you fill it
or when you make any changes so we'll
create a button here below the P tag and
that button will be as you can see here
it also provides the intelligence which
is a beautiful feature of Visual Studio
code it has like I said it has embedded
Visual Studio code in it so you can use
all core features of Visual Studio code
inside stablish so button I'll I'll give
a on button it gives all kind of feature
and yeah you can see here and also we
can give the button name like shares or
share stack blaze share stack this and
you can also change the color of this
button color equals to primary or
secondary so yeah you can see here and
we can also give some events click
events on this button so that we can
write our logic in home dot TS file hope
you like stag bliss and I would suggest
you to start creating projects on
stablish because it has all features
like Visual Studio code is providing you
and it allows you to create all three
kind of applications on three different
platforms that is that are angular react
and ionic and you can also share your
life's project URL first setup URL with
your friends to see the changes and to
to give feedbacks to you on that
particular project hope you like it and
hope you enjoy this please don't forget
