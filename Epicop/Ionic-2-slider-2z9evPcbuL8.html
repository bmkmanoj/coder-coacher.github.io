Liam from epic op and today I'm going to
show you how we can create slides in
ionic so let's get started this is our
Contact dot HTML file in this file we're
going to be creating the slider using
ion slides ionic element and after
creating the ion slide we'll jump to the
contact or TS file and we'll import all
the necessary things for creating slider
and for changing the slides as well so
firstly we will start with the contact
or html5 contact dot HTML so in this
file I'm going to create a slide using
ion slides so this is our eye on slide
element ionic element and I'm going to
give the pager attribute and now I'm
going to say eye on slide did change
means it it generates the event if the
slide gets changed so I'm going to call
the one function called slide changed
and also I want this to be play auto
medically so I'm going to give the
attribute called auto play equals two
you need to give the seconds here in my
case I am giving 2000 it means two
seconds inside this ion slide element
I'm going to create a on slide
let's give the proper indentation here
on slide and inside this will give ng
four equals to let slide of slider so
this is the array the slider is the
array which we are going to create in
the contact dot TS file for now it is
not being it is not created it is not
present in our contact or TS file
currently I am giving this in my contact
out HTML file and now inside this let's
give the button and let's say I own
button and button and the color will be
secondary you could give anything you
could also give primary as well and
inside this I am going to display one
message from the from I'm binding the
message from contact or TS file and this
message would be skipped message so this
is the message which we are going to
create in our contact dot ts file and
after this let's give the image
attribute and inside the source we need
to give the sword's attribute in the
square brackets so that we can get the
image from the slider array and also
let's give a alt message a beautiful
image with some cool stuff let's give
this alt and also below this
Aion below this slide below this image
slider I'm going to give the hedge for
attribute and let's give the class to
this old slide title so inside this will
give innerhtml innerhtml equals to I am
giving this all attribute the source
attribute of image and the inner HTML
attribute of h4 tag and square bike it's
because we have to retrieve the value
from the slider array which we are going
to create in the contact or TS file
let's say slide dot title and below this
I'm going to create one Parra and inside
the pair I am going to give it a rest ml
attribute and that inner HTML would be
slide dot content this is all or the
properties of the slider array which I
will show you later
first we'll complete this part and we'll
move ahead after creating this all and
now finally I'm going to create another
eye on slide but now this time I won't
use this I'm not going I'm not going to
use the slider part and simply I'm going
to give one image and that image would
be present inside my assets folder and
let's delete this all things let's use
this image copy this image name and it
is present inside the assets folder
inside assets it is present in the
images your image name yeah you can see
here and finally I'm going to create one
button that button would be your eye on
button and the color of the button will
be will be primary and I'm going to use
one icon inside this button this button
will be present at the last slider of
this image slider so I can end and this
one will be large clear these all are
the properties which you could use and
you can find it on ionic framework calm
and inside this let give let's let's go
ahead and below this
let's give icon name I can name would be
arrow forward so this is the button
let's save these all things and finally
we are going to create the slider array
but before that I would like to import
the view child in the below in the at
the top
of this page beside the component I
would like to import this view child and
after that since we are using the slides
in ionic we have to import this slides
as well from ionic angular and the view
child would be imported from the angular
code after importing these two things in
the contact or TS file will now create
view child and we are going to pass the
slides as well let's create slides
slides and we'll also create one
variable and that variable would be of
type string you might have noticed that
we have given the skip message here in
this button we have binded this skip
message variable which is coming from
this file so after giving these all
things we'll create this method slight
change and inside this will check if
this dot slides dot is end it means that
we are checking here if the slide is end
then we're going to display this dot
skip message equals two that's awesome
if it is not a last slide or if it is
not the end of the slider
we'll use this dot skip message this dot
skip message equals to go if the slider
if the slide is the last slide of the
slider then we are displaying that's
awesome message
at the at this burden inside this button
you can see here inside these two
buttons if it is not end of the slider
then we are going to display this
message and we are going to give one
event here that is click event if this
button gets click by the user then we
can see next
then we are going to call this method
call next and this method will be
present right here at the bottom of this
method this dot slides dot slide next
you can see here it means that when the
user clicks this button the Go button
then the next side next slide will
appear on the screen so for this we are
going to create a slider array since we
are haven't created this yet we have to
create one array below this method and
let's give it here I did see if
semicolon and inside this array will
give title title would be awesome image
awesome slider or you could give
e eye on ik you are awesome you are
awesome you could display anything and
give comma here and give the content
here and in this content
let's give and a beautiful and amazing
slider is present here and let's give ,
and let's use image tag inside this
image tag let's give assets because my
all images because the all images of
this project is present inside the
assets folder and inside assets folder
we have a subfolder called
images inside this images folder we have
three images you can see here we'll copy
these all names here and we'll give it
here and let's give comma or let's give
comma here this is our first slider
title the content and image let's copy
this for two times because we have three
images here one two three let's change
this to angular beautiful and incredible
you could give anything inside
incredible
stuff and you have to change the image
name 4 3 9 double 2 7 4 3 9 double 2 7
and let's change this to firebase let's
change this message with some water
lorem ipsum Ola Ola anything you could
give this is the dummy content you could
use any content here and let's copy this
file let's paste it here after creating
this area hit safe and hit this save
these two files and let's check whether
we have created this slider in a right
way or not let's save this all files and
let's jump the project structure and I
have good batch installed here in my
computer you can see when I right click
in the project structure I have a option
for git bash I am running this
application on ionic labs as you could
see here ionic serve - L is the command
to run your app previously we are doing
few mistakes in ionic slider and I on
slide and that mistakes I have rectified
that mistakes and I have made this
correct as you could see here inner HTML
HTML will be in the capital form I was I
have given in a small form that's why it
is not taking you have to give inner
HTML in this way and you have to give
ion icon
attribute these two things I have fixed
in this eye on slides hope it will work
now we'll save this application and
we'll run using this command that is eye
on ionic serve - L will hit enter this
command will run the application on two
platforms and that are Android and iOS
you could also select Windows as well
but for now I am only running this
application on Android and iOS you have
the option to select the platform as
well in ionic lab I will show you how we
can select the platforms on ionic lab so
hope it is clear so far how we can
create the ion slide ion slider and how
we can go to the next slide using this
event and that is ion slide did change I
am calling this event and Here I am
calling this method if this slide isn't
then the message would be changed to
debts awesome and if it is the starting
slide then this message will appear on
the screen for the next slide we have
this method slide next and this is our
array
it contains the title the content and
the image so this all this is all about
the ionic slider I hope you understand
and will now will see the application on
any lab you yeah you can see here we
have platforms if we select this it will
render on the windows screen as well but
I don't want this on my screen so I'll
only select Android and iOS this is the
Android when we click
next you can you could see here they
image the title and the content when we
hit or when a click this go it will be
redirected to the next page see here it
is working fine and the message gets
changed - that's awesome here you can
see here we have given that if the slide
is n then the message will be that's
awesome if it is a starting slide the
message will be go as you can see here
this is the message go and this is
that's awesome the last slide of this
slider and this is the button let's go
ahead and the arrow you can see here I
have given icon named arrow forward I
was doing wrong but now I have fixed it
and our slider is working fine hope you
