in this video I'm going to be showing
you about a jack so we will start with
the introduction part and we will see
how Jack's works in our web application
and later I will show you the example of
Ajax how we can use ajax in the web
application so let's get started with
the introduction part so we will see how
I Jack's work and what is the use of
ajax ajax is a synchronous javascript
and xml it's a developer's dream you can
do this following stuff with as X you
you could do you could update a web page
without reloading the entire web page or
you could request the data from the
server after the page has loaded and you
could receive data from a server after
the page has loaded and you could also
send the data to a server in the
background so basically you don't need
to reload your web page if you are using
as X so this is some remember to
tremendous things about tremendous uses
of Ajax you could use a jacks in your
web application and you could also face
the data I synchronously from the server
so i will show you how to use ajax in
your web application so we will see the
example application now let now we will
see how to make ajax call so let's jump
right into the editor and let's get
started basically i have created a web
page called basic edge axe dot HTML as
you can see here and inside this what i
am going to do is I'm going to create a
form inside that form i have taken to
input fields one for the first number
and
another for the second number so I want
these two numbers to be multiplicative
and our result should be displayed here
in this row so this Row is hidden for
the moment as soon as the result
displays as soon as the user enters the
two numbers this row will be displayed
on the page so i'll give it a comment
here result row so you can see here
inside this i have taken a container and
i have given a ID called result box and
display none it hides the row it hides
this container for the moment and i am
displaying the h1 tag here your result
is here inside this stiff inside this if
I have a P tag called rapper and ID with
the rapper inside this P tag I'm gonna
display my result so you might be
wondering why I take this form and how
I'm going to process this form to
display my result so this is the form if
the user submits this form the method of
this form is the post obvious it's
obvious one and inside the action I have
given basic as X dot PHP this is the
file in this file I'm gonna process my
output read result and I have taken this
CSS class to style this form so these
this is the form and this is the result
box which i am going to display my
result so this is the front view front
view of the web application if you run
this application your application will
look like this so this is these are the
two input fields first number and last
number when the user submits the submits
these two fields and
when the user clicks or hits this show
button your result will be shown here so
I am going to save this page and let's
hop to the Jays part inside this JS file
I'm gonna give my validations first for
that two input fields so for that i am
using jquery yes it's a javascript
library famous javascript library you
can do some amazing things with jquery
so let's get started with the jquery
take document not ready inside this
function
when the document is ready I'm gonna
take my when the document is ready i'm
going to call a function inside this
function i am taking a ID of the button
which is present inside the form the
idea of the burden is show copy down
this and call it here and if this button
is click i'm going to call another
function inside this function i'm going
to take a parameter called event
inside this click event i'm going to say
even dot preventdefault so you might be
wondering what this preventdefault will
do this prevent default will prevent
your form from submitting before the
validations completed after the
validations has completed your form will
be submitted to the PHP file using Ajax
so this thing's will be covered later
after this I'm going to take a variable
called forced inside this I'm going to
take document dot get element by ID
inside this I'm going to take the input
field ID the first input field ID you
can see here the first using this I'm
going to retrieve the value of the input
field where second
document dot get element by ID second so
in this two variables I am storing the
values of this to input fields the first
input field and the second input field
you can retrieve the values using
javascript in this way document dot get
element by ID dot value so in these two
variables I have to input field values
why have taken these two input field
values because to check if this to input
fields are empty or not first not equals
to M T equal equals 2 i'm going to see
and second not equals to empty if the
two fields are empty then i am going to
say alert inside valid box all fields
are required means I'm
showing that all fields are required all
fields are mandatory if if these two
fields are not empty then we are going
to post our forum post and the URL will
be
the file name basic as X dot PHP which I
haven't created yet I have created but i
have not do any calculations here it is
empty for the moment i am giving the URL
theta
but calculate farm dot serialize so you
might be wondering what this what is all
things will do this is for the post the
form is a type of a post and the URL
where it has been posted to the basic
edge x dot PHP it's a file for the
moment is it is empty we will do the
calculations in the PHP file later and
this is the data for using which we are
going to send our data form data in a
serialized order to the PHP file and I'm
going to say cash will be false comma on
a success I am going to call a function
called this is a callback function you
can see here this is a callback function
inside this callback function i'm going
to say document dot get element by ID
present box not style dot display equals
to block
so what this line represents document or
get element by ID result box not styled
or display equals to block this file
will show your resin box which is hidden
in the eighth in the histamine file you
can see here I have hidden I have I made
this result box container hidden inside
the HTML box so once the form has been
submitted this result box will be shown
in the block so after this I'm going to
say document dot get element by ID
wrapper inside this inner HTML equals to
response so using this way you can post
your form through ajax and you could
display your container box which is
hidden in the HTML file and inside this
wrapper I am showing I am displaying my
data my response data once the form is
submitted it is being posted to the
basic attacks toward PHP file there the
calculations will be done and your data
will be the form data this calculator
form is the class name of the phone
which I have given in my HTML file you
can see here so I am calling this class
name and I am sending the data of this
form in a serialized order and this is
the attribute cage falls on the success
and calling it callback function inside
this response and I am displaying this
response in the wrapper container which
I have given here this is the P tag
inside the spear attack the result will
be shown so let's save this and let's
hop to the PHP part now
let's say PHP echo I'm just displaying
part here br tag after this I'm going to
take if condition and we'll see post and
we'll see is set post
and we'll see first and also I am going
to take and condition here shrimp post
first so inside the safe condition i am
taking i am taking another variable
called first in charges i am taking
another country another variable called
the first variable
so what I'm going to do is and take a
form called let's say post let's say and
first so here I am taking the variable
called first if the form input field is
said if the form input field is set and
if it is posed the first it is the ID
the poor if the first input field is set
and post and it is not being trimmed not
equals to nother I forgot to give the
dot equals to hear if it is not equals
to null I am storing this value in the
first variable else and I'm going to
display a error message here echo please
provide first value so this is for the
first variable I am gonna take for the
second variable called second value
because I have to input fields in my
form let's say second here and let's
copy down this to trim function and here
also and here also so if this all things
are done I'm going to create a function
called manipulate when you played inside
this I'm gonna give two parameters
called the first and the second
so this dollar sign represents the
variable in the PHP code in the PHP
language i'm going to call this function
here menu plate and i am going to pass
these two variables inside this function
and result result will be the
multiplication of these two variables as
i have said earlier echo result so i'm
gonna display this result result
variable here if the form is post and if
all the fields if the two if all two
fields are posted to this PHP file then
it is going to check it said post or not
and it is also it also checks the trip
using trim function if it is stream or
not then only this variable is going to
store the value of false input field
else it will eco the this message please
provide the first value and for the
second value i am doing the same after
that aamco so i am displaying my result
in this variable result and i am
displaying the result on the view page
so let's save this PHP file and let's
say these all files the front page and
the JS file using jquery i am doing the
validations if the variables are not set
if the variables are not if the input
fields are not submitted by the user
then this message will be returned and
else where Jack's fault
will be posted so using this way you can
give or you can use a Jackson your web
application and let's hop to the browser
and let's refresh the page and let's
give input fields input values as 5 10
and let's say so you can see here
without even calling to the server
Europe your result will be displayed in
below the form so using Ajax you can do
some dynamic things in an awesome manner
so these are some cool stuffs about Ajax
in the next videos I'm going to be
showing you about Jason how you can
retrieve this and data in adjacent
format using Ajax some of it big
applications like Gmail Yahoo this all
web applications use Ajax and Jason
format to retrieve data in an organized
manner so let's save this all and let's
review the code which I have given here
in the forum so this R this is the form
and this is the result box and inside
this Jays form I'm gonna give validation
parts above using jquery and if the
validations are all set then i'm going
to make a jerk score using jquery you
can see here dollar dot ajax inside this
i'm going to call a i'm gonna make a JAX
call and the type of the form is post
URL the form the the file name and the
data will be the form data and the cash
will be false on the success on the
success i'm going to make a response I'm
gonna make a callback function and using
this response i'm going to display in my
wrapper p tag paragraph tag in the PHP
file angle
take if the form is post or not and I'm
going to also check my variables and my
input fields are set or it is not being
trimmed after that I'm going to make a
call to the function which is present
below the if condition and inside this
manipulate function i am going to angle
i am passing the two variables the first
and the second and the result i am
displaying here so this is all about the
ajax hope you did enjoy this video
