Moussa column from epic op and in this
video we'll we're gonna be looking at
CSS variables the CSS custom properties
another name of CSS variables is CSS
custom properties it's a native one and
previously we were using some processors
CSS processors like less and sass to
compile this all properties but now we
are going to take a look using we are
going to take a look at CSS native
variables so in my opinion you can use
these variables these native variables
to play around with CSS and I would
highly recommend you to use this CSS
variables in your project because you
don't need any processor and you don't
have to compile ape you don't have to
transpile it to the browser right it can
compile automatically it's a native one
so in this video I'm going to show you
how you can actually use CSS variables
in your project and how you can play
around those variables so let's get
started so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create a div tag with the class
container and inside this class I'm
gonna take another div tag with the
class grid and if you don't know about
grid and I have then I would suggest you
to watch some tutorials on grid
it's a beautiful topic and you can play
around with great system in CSS
specially so inside this grid I'm gonna
take one more deep tag with the class
box right or you can take square right
so this is one square and I'm gonna copy
this square div tag let's paste it down
here below
in the same grid right so I have taken
two squares in this grid and we'll use
some content inside the square like the
h1 tag and can give anything like my
channel name epic op and one P tag right
and I'm gonna give some dummy text that
is lorem not exactly
just hit lorem and hit tab right it will
generate you some dummy contents I'm
gonna get rid of some content from this
till here I'm gonna cut it down let's
copy the same items same HTML elements
in this below square box right let's
correct the indentation first because
the code is like poetry we need to use
proper indentation while coding so I'm
gonna change the h1 to some different
name that is you can say seismic there
is my company which I am in which my I'm
currently working as a full stack web
developer seismic labs so I'm gonna give
sis me here let's save down this HTML
part and let's move to the CSS part and
now we will see how we can actually
create CSS variables inside style dot
CSS file so let's define a comment here
define variables for the root element
right as I said earlier that this one is
the native and you don't need any
compilers let's see the preview in the
browser first yeah it is appearing in
the grid and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna use two column grid here inside
this HTML part and we'll see how we can
actually do that in
CSS part so let's see root right and
inside this root element I'm gonna
define some variables that is that our
main background color and let me
maximize this sublime text editor so
that I can copy the colors from here I'm
gonna copy these colors and I'm gonna
create another variable with that name
main text color and I'm gonna use one
color that is hash 3-3-3 right so let's
copy the same variable container with
inside the root element right so let's
just equal actually save this and let's
take a body tag in CSS and let's give
margin sorry
margin that is that should be zero and
padding is zero right and the font
family I'm gonna use arial sans-serif
right and I'm gonna use line height as
1.5 0.5 and I'm gonna use background
color now actually I'm gonna show you
how you can actually use CSS variable so
I have written one attribute background
color and you can use CSS variables like
this variable where function it's kind
of function it's kind of method in
JavaScript and all you need to do is you
need to pass the variable name inside
this very function right this way you
can actually use CSS variables
let's say that let's pause the main text
color variable let's save it and let's
see in the browser yeah you can see here
the background is light gray and the
color is in this the color is this one
has three three three light color right
you can actually see the changes in the
browser so let's define the box
variables now right define box variables
we can also yeah firstly we need to use
the container CSS right this container
we can I take a look how we can actually
define it width equals to vas and let me
use this variable here that is container
width so it should be ninety percent not
hundred percent it should be ninety
percent in my case you can give anything
in your case and let's give margin
should be 20 pixels auto let's save this
and let's see the let's see in the
browser light the margin has been
applied and the width is ninety percent
right so this is about the container
part and the grid now it comes the time
of grid right we can define grid and as
we are using it in a grid format in a
grid form we should use display great
right and we can use grid template
columns drip grid template columns 1fr
when fr you might be wondering what I am
doing here right grid template columns
means how you are going to divide your
boxes your grid elements I'm dividing in
a fractional form that is one fraction
and one fraction in two halves in two
equal halves I am dividing and you can
also divide this grid in the form of
pixels and in in various forms you can
divide your grid and if you don't know
about great let's search it on google or
watch some tutorials on youtube you can
find more about grid and you can
understand about great system how it
works so I am dividing in it to
fractional forms and I'm gonna save this
and I'm gonna see in the browser right
it is appearing in a two equal halves to
fractional units let's give some grid
gap right I'm gonna minimize this and
let's use grid gap 20 pixels let's save
it and let's see the brow let's see in
the browser right that the gap between
two grids is 20 pixels as you can see
here in in in between and the two grid
boxes right so this is the way you can
do it and you can also define grid gap
in the form of variable let's actually
get rid of this grid gap and let's use
one variable that is gap and let's give
20 and and also I would like to show you
one important thing here in CSS
variables that is calc function you can
actually use this function to multiply
your your CSS right let me show you how
you can do that you can use this scalp
function inside that Cal function you
can use variable function let's pass
this gap and you can give in to one
pixel this means that you are telling
the grid gap you are you want the grid
gap to be 20
SILS but you are doing in this form
there is calculate variable that is
variable gab that is 20 into 1 things is
20 into 1 there is 20 pixels 20 into 1
pixels that is 20 pixels let's save this
and let's see the brow let's see in the
browser then this the gap between this
true grid boxes is 20 pixels you can you
can use this way I would suggest you to
use this way because it seems to be very
it seems to be very engaging right you
can use this and you can play around
with the stuff with the CSS variables it
seems to be very complex but if you
practice it then you can find it very
easy right so this is all about the
great let's move to the box variables
right let's define box variables let's
comment out this line and let's say box
let's say box main color and I'm gonna
use the box main color as this color
that is hash D D D and I'm gonna use one
more variable CS variable that is box
next color that is yeah oh actually I'm
gonna copy these all three variables
from here so that I don't have to type
there so basically I'm using three
variables inside the box class that is
that our box busy color main color and
the padding let's actually use this
inside the box class right box
background color should be variable
background color let's actually pass
this right
box main color means let's use border
one pixel solid variable and your box
main color right and let's use padding
as well variable and we need to pass
this box padding variable inside the
padding attribute so let's save it and
let's see the preview in the browser it
is still not appearing let me save it
and let me hide refresh my browser
because sometimes it gets cached still
not working oh sorry
actually I'm using square class here but
I was using box so let me replace this
with the square one right let's save
this and let's see the browser let's see
the preview in the browser as you can
see here the two boxes are appearing and
the background color with the border
color right so this way you can use your
CSS variables in any class or in any ID
let's use CSS variables inside the h1
tag in square we have one h1 tag that
are two h1 tags actually there are epic
op and seismic and let me use this color
tag with the variable this one main text
color right right let me use this here
and for the P tag for the P tag we gonna
use variable box main color right
this variable let's save it and let's
see the brow let's see in the browser
right you can see here the text is
appearing the h1 tag and the P tag is
appearing in the color form which we
have given the variables the variable
colors mean X color and the box main
color and you can also override your CSS
variables within a specific class and
that will not affect your global or your
predefined CSS variables let me show you
how you can actually do that here in
this class right I'm gonna use some
other color like red let's save it and
let's see in the browser yeah you can
see it is appearing in a red color and
this way you can override your CSS
variables so hope you understand about
CSS variables and the other name of this
CSS variables is CSS custom properties
these are native and you don't need any
CSS compilers pre compilers
preprocessors you don't need any pre
processors like less and sass you can do
it using native CSS variables but in my
opinion you can use less or sass because
less and sass provides some other
functionalities as well apart from the
variables and all you can play around
with sass variables that is also
wonderful but it depends on you and it
also depends on the project requirement
how what you are looking for so I would
suggest you to use CSS native variables
if you really want to play around with
the CSS stuff right it depends on you
and it also depends on the project
requirement like I said earlier now we
will see the JavaScript path how we can
actually manipulate
CSS variables using javascript let me
show you how you can do that script tag
let me take one script eye here and
let's take one variable that that is
square right and document dot sorry it
seems to be query selector right query
selector and let's pass the class that
is square sorry
squ a re right let's take one another
variable that there is square square
square style right let's use this square
tag squared dot get computed style right
that computed style of sorry we have to
pass this in this form let's let's
remove this dot from here and let's
actually console dot log
this will style what I am doing here is
I am just taking the square box which we
have given above this square box square
div tag and I'm trying to get the
computed style of that square box and I
just am console dot log that square
style so that we can see inside the
console let's open my console and I can
show you here right you can see CSS
style declaration when we open this we
can actually see the computed style in
the IRF form this all stuff we can see
here so let's get rid of this and let's
see or one more thing
about CSS variables and that is how we
can actually get the property value
right Const square document dot query
selector I'm gonna pass the class name
off what I'm gonna pass and let pass the
class name of yeah the box styles right
okay all right let me show you here
right we are using this class square
knot square get square property get
square property let's use the variable
image get square property and document
dot query selector or not exactly square
style dot get property value I was doing
wrong get property value right I'm
trying to get the property value of a
squared style and that is this value
right let me see square one
right this one background box busy
colored this variable what I'm trying to
do here is I am trying to get the
property value of this variable property
BG color which is inside the squared
style and let me consult out log it so
that we can see the output console dot
log so let's use this get square
property and let's see inside
browser let's clear our console so that
we can see and output easily yeah you
can see here has DDD it's a color which
we have defined which we have defined
here in style dot CSS that is hash DDD
and you can see it clearly that we can
access the property value using this
function that is get property value and
the color is appearing in the console
and even we can set the property using
set property function in JavaScript so
you can search it about Internet you can
search it about on internet and you can
find about you can find more about the
CSS variables how you can actually
manipulate and how you can play around
with the CSS variable stuff and I hope
