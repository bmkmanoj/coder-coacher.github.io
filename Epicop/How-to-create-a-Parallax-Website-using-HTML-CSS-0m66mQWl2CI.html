I'm gonna show you how to create a
parallax website using HTML and CSS so
this is a example which I am showing you
now this is a kind of palettes website
so we will be creating this kind of
parallax website in this video
when you scroll down you will see the
background images are fixed and you can
see the different sections of the
website of this webpage so this is just
example of parallax website now we will
see how we can create this kind of
parallax website using HTML and CSS so
let's get started
little close now and if you want some
free stock images then you can visit
this wonderful website called pixels
here you can find a bunch of free stock
images as you can see here and you can
download and you can use inside your
project it is of free no need to worry
and no copyright issues as well so I
have downloaded three images and I have
created one folder in my local host and
I have put these three images inside
this images folder so now we will see
now we will create an HTML part of this
parallax website first we'll take this
and with the class B image one
right I'm using this in a emit
abbreviation when you hit this when you
go type this when you give thought it
means the Class B text when you hit tab
it just creates a different with the
Class B text if you don't know about
Emmet then you can watch my video on
Emmet extension which I have shown you
in my previous tutorial
so don't forget to watch that video so I
have taken this let's take a span tag
and let's give the class model right hit
tab it will create a span with the class
model now we'll give parallax
effect inside this span tag right below
this diff tag I'm going to create a
section with the class section light hit
tab it will create a section and inside
this section I'm gonna use s to tag his
two tag
and I'm gonna give section one
and below this I'm gonna use one P tag
and I'm gonna say Lauren it's a dummy
next it's a dummy content when you hit
when you type lorem and when you hit tab
it will create a dummy content for you
right it is not creating let's try one
more time Lauren right it is creating
now
so let's remove this
two lines right
it's a dummy content I'm gonna copy this
section this div tag and I'm gonna paste
here in underneath the section one and
I'm gonna say BG to
right and I'm gonna copy this section
and paste it here underneath this BG to
this tag and I'm gonna say it's of dark
right let's copy this day one more time
let's give it here
let's say BG three
let's change this
- section - right we'll see
now we'll change the content of this div
tag and we'll type image
to text right or you can give second
image text
inside this div tag
and here you can give third image text
right and I'm gonna copy this one more
time this section and I'm going to paste
it here let's keep it as dark right
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy this
first if tag
and I'm gonna see
I'm gonna die I'm gonna baste it here
and underneath the last section let's
give the section class to all sections
so that we can easily define our CSS
right
let's give to all sections here let's
save this and let's run the review let's
see the preview of this inside the
browser it looks ridiculous now I'm just
looking it looks ridiculous because we
don't apply any CSS to this so now we
will create a CSS for this HTML inside
the style dot CSS I'm gonna give CSS for
body and HTML first obviously
right
let's see the margin should be zero
because I don't want any margin in the
body and
the height should be hundred percent
it should be zero and the font size
should be 16 pixels you can give
anything here and for font family I'll
use laddo
let Oh
sans-serif
right
and what more you can give we can give
the line height as well right the line
height in my case I'm giving 1.8 cm let
me see this first yeah I have a CSS
copied here in another file I'm using
this color right
color should be 666 the ladder should be
in caps right
so let's save this and let's use the
background classes right BG image 1
the background image
magadhan image
images
because I have used that image
you can see here this is the path which
we need to give inside single quotations
not in not in double quotations let me
see that image name first yeah this is
my image I will copy this name and I
will paste it here
and forth I will copy these three divs
right
let's change this to busy too and this
to be three two and the last one is
three
let's write so let's save this and let's
see the preview inside the browser
yeah it is showing now the images are
appearing right so now we can give some
CSS to all three background images
classes right these image one be the
image too
eg image - and the next one is PG image
three
this right the position should be
relative obviously the background size
should be cover
and the background position should be
centered right
and for parallax effect oh we need
background attachment property and that
should be fixed right and if you are
using scroll then you cannot see the
palettes effect I'll show you here right
we'll copy this CSS and we'll paste it
here inside our standard CSS folder also
the comment is written here the fixed
equals to parallax scroll means it is
normal right position is relative and we
also kept the opacity to zero point 70
and the background debate should not
reserve we have said it to no-repeat
they made should not repeat and the
attachment is fixed for parallax effect
let's hit let's refresh this we are not
seeing any parallax effect now because
the text is not appearing on this image
we'll see
the next part now so let's give some CSS
to section class text-align should be
Center and the padding should be 50
pixels and it should be 80 pixels from
the left and right right
the text is appearing in the middle and
we will use the colors now for section
light I have colors here for section
light background color should be hash f4
f4 f4 background color this one and the
color should be
this one which we have used inside the
body tag right and for the section light
for the section dark
we have two sections inside of our HTML
as I have shown you background color
should be this one 2 a 2 e 3 4 right and
the color should be equals to this one
which is little bit dark hash DDD
let's save and let's hit refresh now it
is appearing it is a light gray color as
you can see here the section 1 and the
section 2 is in dark and the last one is
also in dark we'll change this text to
section 3 section 2
and this should be the section tree
right and we will see we will use epic
up my channel name here right and said
refresh now you can see the the parallax
effect the images are attached in the
background and the text is appearing
when we scroll down we can see the
different sections of the page right
and even it should be responsive we will
minimize the browser yeah it is
responsive the section the text is also
responsive images are appearing but it
is in the scroll
effect right for mobile phones which
I'll show you later at the ending of
this video now we will use we will use
some CSS to the text and the bottle part
right for this I have B text here in my
case we have B text right position
should be absolute the top 50% right and
the width is 100%
we will use this CSS inside this B text
be text sorry right
the indentation should be good because
other developers can read right text
align Center and the color is zero zero
zero and we have set the font size to
twenty seven pixels letter spacing 8-bit
cells and text transform should be
uppercase right
you can see here some text
but we need some more CSS so for this we
need to use butter class as well right
the border class we will use the CSS and
we'll copy here and we'll see the next
part what I have done here is the
background color is 1 1 1 and the color
is white FFF and padding is 20 pixels
let's save and refresh this yeah you can
see here
I pick up next third pick up next
image one two
thirty minutes text Oh
so it is not a bidding yes
let's hit refresh now we'll apply some
more CSS the background should be
transparent right
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna keep this
two sections text should be transparent
so I'll use
section one inside this
element
I'm not getting that part yeah here
we'll use this trance class and below
this you have another class trance right
we'll save now
the text is appearing
and what I'm gonna do is
yeah
section one two three and the last one
so this is just we have we can remove
this text from here and we'll see
second epic of text this
yeah this one is appearing from the
section which is this section and the D
is not visible but the website is
parallax right so this way you can use
