show you how you can animate font
awesome icons using javascript so just
now I have learned this and I thought to
share with you so in this video I'm
gonna show you how you can actually
anime animate font awesome icons using
javascript so if you don't know about
font awesome then definitely you need to
check the documentation of font awesome
it's a library it's toolkit where you
can find a bunch of icons and these
icons are free you can use it in any
project right so here it is font awesome
dot io / icons it's a huge library you
can find hundreds maybe even thousands
thousands of icons you can find it here
and this has a latest version that is
4.7 4041 new icons have been added in
version 4.7 so you can find many icons
here so I'm gonna use a few icons like
three icons in this video and I'm gonna
show how you can actually animate those
icons using javascript let's get started
right so here I have created one file
and that file is animate icons dot HTML
it's just HTML file we need only HTML
file for this project for this video we
can play around with font or some icons
and even we can animate in such a way
that it looks beautiful on the screen
right so it's just a schema file and
that is Ione animate icons dot HTML what
I have done here is I have taken one
this tag and I have given one ID that is
normal chain and I have given the class
 that means font awesome and you can
use font awesome let me tell you about
font awesome how you can actually use
font awesome inside your project inside
your HTML file you just need to link to
use this link you
to use this link to use font awesome you
can use it remotely through CDN link
right this is a link and you can find it
here on Google by typing font awesome
CDN right
if you hit if you type this query and
you can find it here that is bootstrap
sealian just you need to copy the latest
version of font awesome CSN and then you
need to press then you need to paste it
inside the head chef of a link tag this
is how it works right so I have included
this link inside my HTML file so now I'm
gonna start using it right so I have
taken one div tag and I have given the
class as far and let me show you how you
can display the chain icon using font
awesome right so here we'll find chain
this is the chain and this has a unique
code right every icon has a unique code
and that is unique you can use it to
display this icon inside your JavaScript
but what I'm gonna do is here I'm gonna
just I'm gonna copy this class this two
classes and I'm gonna paste it here
inside the day and we will see how our
chain looks in the browser when I hit
refresh it looks so small because of the
font size of this icon we can increase
the font size of this icon by using CSS
font size we can use this ID right we
can use this font font size 50 pixels
save it and refresh it it looks big now
right what I'm gonna do here is I'm
going to display
I'm gonna display this chain this normal
chain and I want this chain to be broken
every one second in every once again
right so for that we need to write one
function in JavaScript and let me show
you how you can write how you can
animate that icon using javascript you
just need to create one function break
chain right it's just a function let
chain equals to document dot get element
by ID right you need to use this this ID
and chain sorry
chain dot inner HTML in a rest ml equals
to equals to the unicode right so I want
this chain to be normal when we refresh
the browser and I want this chain to be
broken after a second right so first we
need to keep it normal like this one
this is the normal chain so we will use
this unicode right F 0 c1 is the unicode
you can see here right as you f 0 c1 is
the unicode I'm gonna use this and for
the Unicode let me show you how you can
actually use unicode inside JavaScript
you just need to give the ampersand then
the number sign and X and the unicode
right then don't forget to put the
semicolon here it's just a rule you need
to follow and I'm gonna call one
function set timeout because I
on this to be I want this to keep this
animate keep this icon animating for
every one second right we need to call
this we need to call a callback function
right team
sorry chain dot innerhtml
equals two and now I'm gonna use one
different function here I'm gonna use
one different function that is the
broken chain function there is a broken
chain icon right so the unique code for
this icon is f1 to 7 so let's give it
here
ampersand number sign X your unicode and
then semicolon this is the way you can
do it
and I'm gonna say every one second
thousand means every one second
right so I'm gonna save this now and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call this
function there is break chain right
break chain and I'm gonna refresh the
browser it is not refreshing let's give
one comment here called call break
function
let's hit refresh still not working we
are missing something here yeah this is
the sorry this is the class which we
need to repose because if we are using a
falling class then we cannot we can we
may not able to display the broken chain
right we need to use only the class that
is far let's save this and let's run it
it is not displaying on the browser
because normal chain we need to use this
right I'm missing something here let me
check
what I'm missing here chain dot right
let me check here the break chain yeah
let me copy this function right I'm
gonna paste it here oh we need to remove
this right it's still not working I got
it now what I was missing here is I was
missing this function set interval
function we need to call this function
break chain and we want this function to
be called for every two seconds right so
if we use this function if we set the
interval the chain will keep animating
right right now it is not animating at
all just because we are we have not set
any interval interval for that so let's
say keep animating chain will keep
animating will comment out this chain
keep animating every two seconds right
now once we save this we'll see the
preview in the browser now you can see
the chain is animating for every two
seconds right so this is just one
example and it is easy to animate for
two awesome icons using Java
you could also do it and you could also
use some animated icons inside your
project you can animate using javascript
let me show you one more example and let
me give one break tag here actually to
break tax now we'll use one div tag with
the class far and now don't get confused
why I am writing HTML like this
it's Emmet abbreviation it's extension
Emmet extension allows you to write HTML
in this way this tag with the class far
well once you hit tab it will create a
distaff in the clay with the class far
if you don't know about Emmet then don't
forget to watch my previous tutorial on
Emmet extension which I have shown you
in that video how you can install it and
how you can use it inside the visual
studio code editor so I was talking
about the another example and that
example will be about the battery right
so we will use this ID here and what we
will do here is we will create a 1
another function we will comment out
this first and we'll say animation
animate animate sorry animate battery I
can write function and battery we will
use this function for the battery
animation let battery equals to that
battery equals to document dot get
element by ID right and we will use this
battery ID
inside this and we'll say battery dot
innerhtml equals to some Unicode and
we'll see what we you nee code we can
use it here in this case let's search
for by battery icon and let's search for
the zero we'll start with the zero right
the Unicode of this battery icon is s 2
4 4
ampersand number sign X then copy this
right and don't forget to put the
semicolon here and we'll see set timeout
function use a callback function and
we'll say teen dot inner HTML right here
it is and we will use this icon the
battery 1 the battery starts from 0 and
it will continue increasing to 1 and
that is 2 that is 3 sorry we will use
this Unicode right and we will use this
cell interval time our set timer
function and we'll keep this - mm mm
means 2 seconds right and we'll change
it to 2 we will copy the same function
and we will copy here we'll change it to
3,000 and we'll change it to 1 copy down
the same function and change it to 4
that means 4 seconds and finally it's
the time to change to 0 right
now we will call this function here this
battery function here and we'll see how
it looks inside the browser the battery
is not getting filled because we have
not set the time interval for this
battery right we need to set the
interval let me use this function here
right here and let's change this to 5
and let's save and let's see the preview
the chain is getting broken but the
battery is not getting filled
let me check here
what mistake I am doing here everything
looks fine but still not getting oh
sorry I did a blunder I need to copy
this battery instead of copying chain
let's change this to battery and let's
see the preview inside the browser right
yeah
the battery is getting filled now I was
using chain extremely sorry for that the
chain was used in this function and I
was trying to use it here that was a
blunder from from my side the battery is
getting filled and the chain is getting
broken and now it's time to see the
example of the hourglass you might be
wondering what our glass is let me show
you how it looks it looks like this
right we will use this because the
hourglass will start from this icon and
it keeps continuing to half
and ending part we will use these three
icons here so let me take one this tag
for using it right let's use it here and
let's say our glass copy this our glass
and give it here for making it big on
the screen right and let's call another
function and that will be for the
hourglass right let's give a one comment
here animation for our glass let's give
the comment and let's say let glass
equals two document dot get element by
ID copy the same thing and let's copy
the same timeout function as well right
let's say glass glass and the glass
right so what we gonna do is we're gonna
use this Unicode that is the starting
Unicode of our our glass two five one F
two five one and we will use this the
Unicode 2 Phi 2 right 2 Phi 2 we will
use this and we will use another time
and we will set one more
timeout function 1 what I would call
back function for this and that will be
the ending part of the hourglass
once it gets filled the hourglass gets
filled we will use F 2 5 3 right and we
will change it to
mm what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna
copy I'm gonna call this hourglass
function here and let me show you the
example let me show you the preview on
the browser it is not showing at all let
me check the mistake hourglass sorry I'm
extremely sorry I'm using the idea our
glass and I'm using it here I as a glass
right so let's see now
yeah the glass is getting filled but it
is not keep can't keep animating for
keeping it animated for keeping it
animating we need to use the the time
increment function like we have used in
the above two functions this one set
time interval let me copy this and let
me paste it here and let me change the
icon that is our glass keep animating
every two seconds so every every three
seconds exactly
let's change is to three let's save this
let's see the preview in the browser and
here how here is how it looks it is not
oh we are using the battery function
again we need to use this hourglass
function right so let's save and let's
save hit refresh button and the three
icons are animating right the first
broken chain and the second battery and
the last but not the least that is the
hourglass three icons are animating on
the screen this way you can animate your
font awesome icons using Java Script
easily it is not just it is
difficult as you are thinking you can
use these functions and you can find my
code on github and I'll paste that link
the source code link in the description
