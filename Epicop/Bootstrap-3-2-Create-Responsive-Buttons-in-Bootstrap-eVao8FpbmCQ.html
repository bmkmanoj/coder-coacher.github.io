introduction to bootstrap in that video
I have given a quick introduction a
quick introduction on bootstrap so in
this video I'm gonna show you how you
can create a responsive buttons with
bootstrap so we have different types and
different kinds of buttons in bootstrap
so let's get started and create some
different kinds of buttons in our web
application this is the asp.net core web
application and in this I'm gonna show
you how you can create different types
of buttons you can see here in the
Jumbotron we have one container in that
one we have row so that row we have
different anchor tags as well so these
are some anchor tags this is the default
button and this is the info button
information it gives basically it gives
information is the primary button this
is the success button danger and warning
these are some different kinds of
buttons and we have some different size
of buttons as well sizes of buttons are
also different in bootstrap this you can
see here LG for large devices which has
a screen resolution more than 280 pixels
this is extra small which has screen
resolution less than 364 pixels this is
SM for small devices less than 780 pigs
less than 568 pixels and MD for 768
pixels resolution devices this is for
the medium devices you can see here and
I'm gonna take another anchor tag and
create a button for success that with
the block it takes the entire block size
so let's save this application and run
this application and see how the button
will look like on our web page
so these are some different kinds of
buttons and these are different sizes of
buttons let's run this in our home
controller we have buttons page you can
see here
I haven't give the name of buttons this
is the default this is the info button
this one is primary this one is success
this one is the danger button and this
is the warning button
you can see here I'm creating this
buttons with different sizes that first
one is for large devices and this is for
extra small
let's copy and paste it here and this is
for the medium devices and last one is
for the block block button it takes the
entire block size save this and let's
refresh the browser you can see here the
first one is a default button and the
second one is the information button
third one is the primary and for this
success fifth one is danger and the last
one is warning and these are some
different kinds of buttons and in the
second row we can see the different
sizes of buttons this is for the large
this is for the large devices this is
for extra small devices and this is for
the medium view small devices and the
last one is for the medium devices and
as you can see here this button is
taking the entire block size because we
have given a button block it takes the
entire block size width so I think
that's all about the buttons within
bootstrap hopefully you liked this video
