this tutorial i'll be talking about
asp.net called startup dot CS file and
I'm going to give a quick introduction
on starboard CS file so let's take a
look in asp.net a startup dot cs5 is a
starting point of the application and
startup dots ES file consists of three
main methods as it contains the main
method it is obviously the entry point
of the app and let's see what are the
three main methods in star abroad cs5
star abroad she has file consists of
started startup method itself and
configured services method and another
and the last one is configure methods so
let's see in our demo application how
startup dot CSS file will look like so
i'm going to show you where we can
configure our services in configure
services method and let's see
so this is our startup broad CS file as
you can see this is the startup method
it consider contains hosting environment
hosting environment means we have
different environments likes tagging and
development so it selects the anvil on
in particular environment and that
environment it takes the environment
variables and it configures so this is
our configuration property and this is
the main method main configuration
method for the services as you can see
this method gets called by the runtime
and it used to add services and as you
can see ad MVC and add database context
these are this all stuff you can include
in configure services method and these
are completely dependency injections I
will tell you later what our dependency
injections in the next upcoming video so
this is all about what you can see the
dependency injection so let's move to
the configure method this configure
method consists of context or database
not enter created I have created one
database in this application so it is
ensuring that the database is created or
not so this configure method consists of
HTTP pipeline request you might have
heard about it so the request is going
to handle from this method all requests
will be in the pipeline so environment
again it is selecting is development or
not environment is development or not
and
I told you that these configure services
methods will configure services which
are dependency injections I will show
you where we can add our dependency
injections here we can add in project
Jason folder in project dot Jason file
you can add all dependents injections as
you can see microsoft asp.net co dot
server or IAS integration I is is our
local web host server we are running
this application all asp.net core
applications on is web server and this
is also a small web server for asp.net
core apps kestrel and this all our
dependency injections and after
including all dependency injections in
the project Jason folder you need to
include those dependency injections in
the configure services method I have
included my MVC without this method
without this service you won't be able
you won't be able to access the MVC
architecture at architectural pattern
and I am also using this you sequel
server dependency injection and I'm
including in my configure services
method so this this is all about the
configured services let's see about the
configure method as you can see here you
can use static files these static files
will be used for dot CSS files dot HTML
or JavaScript files all you need to
include those files in you static files
method and this is used for routing
routing is pretty important in asp.net
core apps this is the default route
which is already existed in our
application as you can see this route
name is default controller name is home
action name
be index and this ID parameter it's
optional and this is the default route
you can add more routes it's your wish
and this is all about the startup dot
CSS file hope you understand about
startup dot CSS files please like this
video and subscribe to my channel and
don't forget to share this video thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
