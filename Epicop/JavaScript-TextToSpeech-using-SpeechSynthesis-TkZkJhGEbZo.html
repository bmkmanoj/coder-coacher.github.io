I'm gonna show you text-to-speech in
JavaScript for fun you can see that
right LJ just type some text in the
message and it speaks for me inside the
browser as you can see here I have a
list of objects inside speaks array with
the name and language I have some
objects here like Alex and the language
is the United States English right ID
and so we have different values here you
can know more about this I'll paste this
code in the github you can find it from
there you can get it from there so I
have list of objects inside the speak
array so we'll start writing the code
for the actual text-to-speech
conversion in JavaScript inside the
browser right so let's get started right
it's it's time for fun let's say
constant message equals new sorry you
know it's new speech synthesis utterance
right so this is the mid third which
we'll use to convert number text to this
speech right so message dot volume
volume
equals to one right so this is from 0 to
1 let me tell you one thing here these
are the default values for the
properties right message dot rate equals
to one semicolon and the values the
range of values for rate is from zero
point one to ten message dot pitch
equals to 1 right and the range for this
is 0 to 2 so these are some ranges and
the text is
message or text we are going to provide
the message here right so I'm gonna use
smell la ybm it's Yavin dengue Mia the
message is this the text is this one
right now we'll use the voice variable
will take constant voice equals to
speaks the array and the the object
right I want the fifth object from this
array right and I'll console dot log it
right using string interpolation method
right voice
is this one
WAIS dot
name
right and
language
is
let me use properly why start lying
so it just console dot log the voice
name language language right so we'll
use this one and now we'll use the voice
thought voice URI
equals two voice
so a message dot was you're right I was
doing something wrong and I cut it dot
name right we are passing two attributes
two properties here that is that our
voice you are a nd language right
so I'll show you the proper use when a
proper use of these two attributes while
i refresh the violence while i show to
show you the preview inside the browser
right wise dot
lang
and now the final one is speech
synthesis
dot speak is the method message right so
this is the code which converts our text
bismillah of IBM to this peach right
what I did here is I have taken one
message variable and have created one
object speech synthesis utterance and I
have passed volume rate pitch and the
text and I have created voice and I have
selected the fifth object from bespeaks
and which I have created above and I'm
console not logging to know the name and
the language and I'm using two
attributes here two important attributes
two properties of speech synthesis
utterance object that is voice URI in
which wise you want and the language you
want and finally we are using speech
synthesis method to speak right let's
save it and let's see the preview inside
the browser as you can see here the
voice the name is Kermit and the
language is e e IL so we have different
objects you can know more about these
languages on internet so let me change
the fifth object to the 23rd one we have
total 47 voices here in this speaks
array right
right you can see here and you can also
change the rate annuals you can set to
five
it speaks fast if you increase the
weight but the default is 1 and the
volume part you can set it to 0.5 but I
don't think so it is going to be fun so
over here it speaks very low right let's
set it to 1 the pitch let's change this
to 0.6 right the range is from 0 to 2
right so let's change this to 15 right
different yeah it speaks in some
different language you can see here
right let's change the text to hello
epic op which is my channel name and
let's change this to 45
the Zosia is speaking now with the
language this P 1p l right and let's
change this to something like twelve the
twelve object let's set the pitch from
zero point six to one point five and
let's see the preview inside right Ayane
is speaking with the language ro right
and let's change it to the other value
which I want like something like thirty
five would be great
Singhji language said educate is not
speaking
oh let me check one more time
not still not speaking yeah it's it is
speaking now Cindy in some different
languages so you can have this fun in
JavaScript and you can convert your text
to speech hope you are getting my points
and hope you really enjoy this video and
I I'll paste this code inside my grid
hub and you can get it from there and
thanks for watching this video and don't
forget to watch my previous tutorials on
JavaScript and eczema at my script 6 so
stay tuned for latest updates thanks for
watching this video I'll catch you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
