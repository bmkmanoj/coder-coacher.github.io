this tutorial I am planning to talk
about Jason so let's get started with
Jason what does Jason stands for it
stands for JavaScript object notation it
is syntax for storing and exchanging
data it is basically used in retrieving
or accessing data from a web server like
XML but XML is more difficult than Jason
so many of the developers used to prefer
Jason and Jason is a lightweight data
interchange format let's explore more
about Jason now we will see the
advantages of Jason Jason first of all
is a language-independent format and
Jason uses same JavaScript syntax and it
doesn't require external parcel it is
parsed by JavaScript parser and it is a
data format used by any programming
language as I said earlier it is a
language-independent format and it is
more readable and it is quicker and
shorter as well the design it doesn't
require parsing now we will see the
differences between XML and Jason why
many of the developers are choosing
Jason so Jason is used to retrieve data
from a web server and XML is also used
to leave data from a web server jason is
a self-describing it's a human readable
and XML is also a human readable format
but they both share the same properties
but there are some difference they both
can be faced with xml httprequest object
but the main difference here is jason is
fast and small because it doesn't
require external parcel
is ready to pass in JavaScript object
but xml requires xml parser so we'll see
more about Jason in the later session of
this video now let's code now we will
see the example of Jason in the sublime
text editor in this file which is new
data road HTML now I would like to give
the script tag here inside the script
tag I would like to create JSON object
before that I would like to create div
tag
let's give ID as JSON data above this
div tag take one diff column and say
column sm2 l it's a bootstrap class it
takes all 12 columns for small sized
devices inside this div tag I would like
to take button tag which could be of
type submit and let's give the name as
click me to get Jason and on this button
Craig I would like to give on click
event which will be Jason function in
JavaScript so let's key if the class as
text center so we are all done with HTML
now let's create a function or Jason
which can be called when the user clicks
this button on click it will call it
will redirect to the dysfunction inside
this function I would like to create a
JSON object which could be customers so
this is the syntax for Jason inside this
curly braces inside this curly braces
you need to give your key value pairs
because jason contains key value pairs I
will show you how to give that first of
all we need to give a key here
then the value a value can be Joan let's
take comma comma is the separator
between two properties this is the first
key value pair this is our first pair of
the Jason to separate this we need to
put comma let's take another key value
pair that will that will be h 30 comma
let's take city and let's say head robot
so after this JSON object I would like
to display the key value pair of this
JSON object in an HTML tag that is get
element by ID and let's call the ID
which is which we have already created
there is JSON data inside this div tag I
want to display JSON data so inside this
dot inner HTML I want to display suppose
name let's save this and let's see
changes in the browser click yeah you
can see here John is displaying on the
left-hand side of the browser you can
see here let's try to access now will
act now we'll try to access the city of
the customer let's save hit refresh
click on this button here it is smoking
the hour Jason is working we can access
but this is the individual keyvaluepair
but what if I want to display all the
properties all the pair's insides Jason
object so for that i want to take for
loop
and customers where I in customers
inside this for loop I will call this
get element by ID the ID is this data
dot innerhtml customers of i plus i am
taking this bracket because we want
space after displaying each and every
object put semicolon here save the
changes hit the refresh button click
here yeah we are getting all the
properties you can see here all the
properties all the values all the values
of json object which may have given in
this customer json object so this way we
can access all the properties all the
values of json object but what if i want
to display only the key not the values
I will take I hear ya you can see here
if I want to display this scheme this
keys so I need to take I value here
instead of taking customer of I
customers of I will display the values
of Jason not the keys so this could be
the easy way of forgetting the keys to
be printed on your HTML page so this way
you can access the JSON object and we
will see how we can nest arrays in Jason
so these are the key value pairs which
we have seen hopefully you are getting
what i am trying to explain you now we
will see something even better we'll see
how we can nest arrays in inside Jason
object
first car I am taking the array of cards
let's say first car would be the Ferrari
the second one would be BMW and / gone
let's say Adi now if we want to display
this car values inside this for loop
what I want to do is I want to display
this car value car a car's array so for
that I need to take dot cars oops not
here here I have to take customers dot
cards of I let's save this refresh the
browser and click on this button it is
not working
let's if it double yeah it is working
now you can see here we are enabled we
are able to retrieve all the values of
this cars a day inside Jason object this
is the array so this is the syntax force
you need to remember if you are a
beginner you need to remember the syntax
for Jason and arrays nested is inside
station so this is the array nested
inside Jason object and I have shown you
how to access this nested array of Jason
so this way you can access for VAR i in
customers dot cars
you can access this all all stuff you
can access without using this way
hopefully you enjoyed this video thanks
