from epic op and today I'll show you how
to use media queries css3 media queries
in your web projects so before we dive
in we'll see a quick introduction of
media queries what basically media
queries are and how we can use in our
projects so let's get started so we why
should we why should you care about
media queries we will see how how media
hoodies are helpful for creating
responsive web designs for creating
responsive web pages will see in this
video so it is no it is the most
exciting aspects about CSS today and it
is very important for a web developers
to use media queries while creating or
while dealing with responsive web
designs and also it will allow us to
change our layout to soothe the exact
need of different devices without
changing the content well you don't need
to change your layout of the page if you
want it on different screen sizes you
just you just need to put media queries
in your CSS file then you can change the
layout of your web page I will see later
how you can change the styles or the
animations using media queries so this
is how media queries looks like in your
CSS file a direct media represents it is
a media query only screen and maximum
width here is one catch maximum with you
can see here this maximum width
represents that this style that is body
style the background should be light
blue the color background color of the
body should be back light blue when this
media when the styles will apply on our
page it applies before or it applies
below the maximum it applies below the
width of final two girls because maximum
with stars maximum which means we are
defining
till five hundred pixels below that
width week we we will apply this style
in our webpage and minimum which
represents that it is a starting point
of your you could say it is a break
point minimum width is your break point
is a starting bread point you can apply
this style this style will be applied on
your page from 500 pixels above but
madam with style will apply below that
find it feels so this is how you can use
in your CSS file this is how media
queries will work we'll see now how we
can code in our in our sample
application you could see later in this
video so there is another use of media
queries in CSS file that is the
orientation part orientation represents
your landscape and portrait version
landscape means it is how it is
vertically long and put landscape means
it is horizontally horizontal long and
portrayed means it is vertical long so
you could take landscape version as
tablet version and portrayed version as
your mobile version so we'll see how to
use media queries in the project as you
can see here I have created one file
called index dot HTML and inside this I
have given a style tag you can see here
i am giving the background color of the
body as light green and i have taken one
p tag inside my body tag and i have put
i have put some content in P tag so
let's say this end in our browser yeah
it looks like this or when we're on our
when we're on this page it looks like
this the background color of this page
is light green because we have given in
our style so let's minimize this browser
to the mobile view
the shortcut of the shortcut of toggling
to the mobile view in Firefox is ctrl +
Shift + m and for reversing this action
you could all you could do you could use
keys similarly for the mobile version
that is ctrl + Shift + M you can toggle
between desktop view and mobile view so
we will see now we are seeing in a mo
value that is 360 in this into 640
screen size we can also see in tablet
version and in this version also and the
last one is the desktop version so we'll
see in a mobile version it is not
applying any style if we are talking to
mobile you now I will show you how to
use media queries for changing the
background color of the body to the
different color so we'll see it now so
we'll start at direct media at the eight
media only screen
and maximum width should be 500 pixels
you could keep any thing it depends on
you you could use 400 pixels as well but
in my case I am using 500 pixels so
inside this you could apply your CSS now
I don't want light green color I want
light blue color on mobile view so let's
change it to blue instead of using light
green i am using light blue color on
mobile view let's save this file and
let's hop to the browser and will
refresh the page and you can see here
our color of the background of the body
gets changed to light blue when we move
to the text of you it is in light green
color so this is the simple example
which I have given for media queries you
can do anything you can also increase
the font size of this P tag the font
size of this etag index top view is and
show you what is the font size of this
so there is no font size defined in my
CSS but I want this font size to be
increase a little bit in mobile version
so i am using inside media query i am
giving font size as 30 pixels let's save
this and let's hop to the browser will
refresh it again and we'll move wilt
over to the mobile view as you can see
here the font size of the pita gets
changed to 30 pixels you can also see
here in the Firebug which is a firefox
firefox extension for debugging your
very applications or web pages you can
see here the font size gets changed to
30 pixels so this is the simple use this
is the simple use of media query which i
