say musallam and today I am going to
show you how to create controller and
how we can call this controller in your
in our view in ionic 2 application so
basically what controller does is what
it sounds like it does the controller is
used to pass the data from the data
layer to the view layer via data binding
it also controls your actions when you
go to the URL in your app actually you
are calling to the controller that
controller will build your view using
templates so we will see in this sample
application how we can create controller
in ionic 2 and how we can call it on our
view so let's get started so I am gonna
create one controller in a broad JS file
which is present here and this abdur Jas
is present in J's folder the J's folder
is present in depth of www folder so
inside this abroad JS file you can see
here there are some modules angular
modules and you can also notice here the
module name is similar to the ng app
name which is present in index dot HTML
index dot HTML will be called first so
you can see here ng r equals to starter
and the angular module name is started
the both names are same so now we will
create a controller here and we'll call
this controller will give the name as
you can see here the intelligence is
giving two parameters recipe name and
factory function so I am going to call
this controller name as my controller
and I am calling one anonymous function
here inside this function i am passing
one parameter called scope and inside
the controller i am going to take an
array of task an area of task so we can
create a task not in this way you have
to give square brackets dis brackets and
inside this array will take some few
properties firstly will give the title
our title is first element or force you
can we can call it as first after this
gif comma and we will take another
property called completed complete it
and i'm going to say true it's a boolean
value let's copy this element and paste
it down will take four elements and we
will call this element as second next is
third
and the last is food so we'll give false
false so I have taken four properties
four elements in this task array so we
have created our first controller so
this is the syntax of creating
controller a simple controller which I
have shown you here controller the
controller name and the function so you
can pass one parameter I using this
parameter i have created one array and i
have given four elements in this array
so this is the simple way of creating
controller now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to call this controller on our
index dot HTML view so let's give the
controller name first ng controller the
controller name is my controller save
save both files inside this I'm going to
take and on as you can see here I on
represents these are Evan elements I on
pain inside this I on pain I'm gonna
take I on header bar and i'm going to
give one class here called bar royale
borro el inside this I on header bar I
am going to take I on title these all
are ionic elements customizable and
custom elements you can see you could
say these are these all are and on
elements so I'm going to give a on title
as ybm and after this I am going to take
another ionic element that is ion
content which i am using to show the
controller data inside this ion
content element again I am taking
another ion element that is our list
because we are going to show that
controller data this all four elements
in one list format so inside this I'm
gonna say and on item so in this list we
have one item we have to leave some
attributes to this an item like
ng-repeat ng class and there are some
more other attributes we have to use for
showing that task array so we'll start
with the ng-repeat first this ng-repeat
will repeat the items which is present
in our array so we'll see task in task
and the class will be the complete task
not completed so this class is used to
style the ion elements which I am which
I which I will show you later we can
style the ion elements in style dot CSS
you can see here the file is empty yet
will style design elements later first
we'll concentrate on retrieving the
elements of that task array so now we
will see how we can get the data from
that controller and how we can show
inside this an element
so I'm going to give another attribute
here called ng-click whenever user
clicks this I on item then I'm going to
give on functionality to this I on item
that is task dots completed equals to
not task completed if the user clicks
this ion element then I am going to say
assign this with false because task
completed is true if user clicks it then
it becomes false so we are all done now
now we can give the title here inside
this I on item I am displaying the title
of the element of the array element this
title so let's say this all files
indexed or HTML abdur Jays now we have
to style this I on elements so complete
this class I am taking this class ng
class complete and i am going to give
the color of the iron atom will be black
and the text decoration will be line
through whenever user clicks this ion
element
it should be cut it down line through
we'll see it later and now I am going to
run this application and we will see how
these elements this other elements are
showing on our view page as you can see
here I have I am following few blocks
these blogs are very helpful for you if
you want to get started with ionic 2
gone hybrid calm and another blog which
I used to follow is Magda very calm so
these are a few blocks which are used to
follow for building ionic 2 applications
Josh Mahoney is also a good block it
might take some time to get compile
we are all done now now we will see how
it works and how it looks on the browser
on the mobile view these are the four
elements this is you have to remember
the syntax of creating controller in
ionic this is the syntax of creating a
simple controller you can also use
service providers in your controller and
the controller controls the passing of
data from your data layer to the view
layer as I have said you earlier in this
video it is still compiling as you can
see here it is at line number 30 till
then I will show you the solution
Explorer the architecture of this app
our app is ready now it is running on
localhost on google chrome it is not
showing
let's refresh it again yeah you can see
here we have four elements first second
third and fourth the 1st and 3rd are
already cut it down which is by this
property text decoration line through if
we click this that the line will be gone
so if we click this our functionality is
running our functionality is working
fine when our user clicks I have
assigned that task complete to not touch
that complaint means it assigns the
false value if true is there it will
become false if false is there it will
become true so this is our first
application which I have shown you how
to create controller in this video so
you could create your controller this is
just a simple controller which I have
created so hope you understand this
session the hope you understand this
video how you can create controllers in
your ionic application so thanks for
watching this video please like and
share my videos don't forget to
subscribe my channel thanks again for
