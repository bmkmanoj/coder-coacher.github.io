am from a peacock and today I'm really
excited to show you about github so
github is a software where you can
create repositories you can change your
code with others so in this video I'm
going to show you how you can create a
new repository how you can clone it and
how you can push and pull code from that
repository just to that repository so
firstly we have to install git bash if
you want to you want to commit some
changes to get up repository so you need
to install git bash from this website
called git SCM dot-com / downloads and
here you have different platforms as
well Windows Linux Mac OS and solar is
if you are a Windows user then
definitely you have to use this
definitely you have to install this file
windows file so after installing this
file you need to create a get up account
and I have created it so I'm gonna sign
in with my username and password my
username is this one
and I'll sign this and sign in with this
username
so after signing in to get up oh my
password seems to be wrong yeah
it is wrong so let's give the correct
username sayyed moussa claim 95 add the
weight gmail.com password
it is signing in yeah it is here we have
for deposit five reported five
repositories which I have already
created so I'm not going to use this or
existing repositories I'm going to show
you how you can you create a new
repository and how you can commit
changes to the repository so let's
create a new one here
and if you want to know more about
github then you can visit this link
guides it actually guide you how you can
create new repository branches and we
have different features in github like
creating new repositories and dealing
with branches merging branches and how
you can folk the repository and how you
can pull all clone the repository so we
have different things to do with github
it's if you are dealing with or if you
are working on open source projects or
if you have any creative ideas then you
can share your ideas and you can share
your code with others on github it's a
good platform so if you are not familiar
with github then definitely you need to
be familiar in order to get started with
github so let's give a new repository
name here angular and if you want to
make it public then definitely you need
to select this it's a default one and if
you really want to make it private then
you should use this option here you can
see and let me tell you about this thing
definitely we need to select this
checkbox initialize this repository with
a readme file readme file means it it
just give you a quick introduction or a
little bit introduction of your
repository and it it helps in many
things you can search about readme files
of git github repository on internet
because that is not our part of this
video that's not a part of this video so
I'm gonna create a new repository by
clicking this button
so it's a good documentation to know
more about github and let me show you
some interesting commands of github it's
a Atlassian documentation which I found
on internet and we have different
commands of github get in it with it
initialize your github repository and
like I said I'll show you how you can
clone your repository and how you can
add files to the repository and how you
can commit changes by using git commit
/m m represents mean so it represents
message means which commits is this so
it just gives a commit message like
first commit or initial commit you can
give anything git commit a means you are
committing changes to everyone add and
anywhere if you are making changes at
some file then definitely you need to
use this command - a it just commits all
changes to a repository so it push
origin master so we have different
commands of github you can visit this
documentation to know more about get up
come on
so I'll link this documentation in the
description of this video so you can
find there let me show you how you can
clone get up repository on your local
host on your local computer so I'm gonna
select this thrown or download button
and I'm gonna copy this you can see here
we have URL and let me show you the URL
yeah you can see here github.com slash
my username says Musa column 95 slash an
Euler dot git repository name dot git
dot git extension represents that it's
just it up repository it is very much
similar to this URL you can see here but
we don't have not get extension here in
this URL right so it means that it's
it's just a repository so I'm gonna copy
this and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
clone that repository on my desktop so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna type git
clone come on and I'm gonna paste that
URL and I'm gonna hit enter so it's
cloning the angular repository so we
have emptied repository and we have only
one file that is readme file and you can
see here if I open this file then you
can only see angular inside that file so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just
yeah we have angular repository here on
localhost I'm gonna open this readme
file in sublime text editor
you can see here so I'm gonna write
something here this is just a simple git
repo for angular series I'm gonna save
this once you eat safe it means that you
have you made some change in it right so
if you are making some changes to the
files then definitely you need to commit
those changes to the github so for that
we have different command called git
commit like I have shown you on that
documentation so get commit
- a it means we are we are committing
every change we are committing every
change to the github repository and we
also want to give the message called
first commit right so it's just a
message
it just shows your commitment means the
commitment message - M represents your
message of commitment so I'm gonna hit
enter what is saying that we are not in
a github repository so first we need to
go to that folder the github repository
folder CD angular now we are in angular
folder now we are in angular repository
so we'll just check the status before
committing changes that is if if someone
make changes or not so we'll see the
status of the repository by typing its
status con so once I hit enter once I
enter you can see that readme file has
been modified by someone and if you want
to make if you want to commit that
change then obviously you need to use
git commit command or get add you can
see here no changes added to commit so
we can use any command here so I'll use
git
commit - a means any change anywhere M
means message first commit I hit enter
right you can see here one file changed
three-inch three insertions one deletion
is just showing that now we'll see our
readme file right we haven't pushed that
code we haven't pushed that change to
the repository that's why the readme
file only contains angular this file
this change is not showing in our
repository in the readme file so we need
to use one more command here called git
push enter this command will push the
change to the repository and probably it
may ask you to login because we are not
using SSH feature SS SSH feature as I
have shown you here oh sorry I forgot to
show you the SS s SS edge feature which
is a different feature of github we have
cloned this directory using HTTP method
we haven't used
sssh feature it's a different one and
it's a different method if you are using
that method then you don't have to give
your login details of github it it
stores your username and password of get
up permanently so that's a different
topic and that's a different part if you
want to know more about s SS SS h
feature then you need to search it on
google or you can find some tutorials
you can find some tutorials on youtube
yeah you can see here counting objects 3
done Delta compression using 4 threads
right
yeah it it made it commit all changes to
the master branch now we'll see
yeah you can see here once we use get a
good push method our changes has been
committed to the readme file which we
have saved on our local computer so
using this way you can push the code or
you can commit the changes which you
have done on your localhost and little
bit surprised that I have used git push
method and it haven't asked me to enter
my username and password it haven't
asked us it haven't asked me my
credentials so sometimes it happens as I
am logged in so it might not ask me so
using this way you can commit your
changes and you can clone your directory
and you can make some changes and you
can commit those changes to the
repository to the github repository so
if you want to know more about github
then definitely you need to visit this
documentation it's a beautiful
documentation where you can find merge
pull request which is which is not a
part of this video I have shown you how
you can create a new repository how you
can clone it using HTTP method
if you want and if you want to know more
about SSS feature then definitely you
should watch some other tutorials as
well because I haven't shown you about
SSH so I have also shown you how you can
push and pull code so that's all about
github and hope you understand and hope
