this is Sayed Moussa column from epic op
and today we are going to talk about how
we can process complex JSON data using
Ajax get request method in ionic 3 so
let's get started
before we get started I would like to
show you how you can generate some dummy
JSON data some complex JSON data so you
don't have to worry about that because
we have a solution for that random user
dot me is a website and they are
providing you they are offering you to
create or to generate complex JSON data
so there you can get the JSON data using
the random random your user API you can
get complex decent data and you can
process that complex JSON data using
Ajax get request method in ionic 3 now
we will see how how we can do that so
firstly we need to import the HTTP
module in the home dot PS file because
I'm going to create I'm going to load
all the JSON data in inside home not
HTML file so we need to import the HTTP
module first HTTP HTTP comma headers
from at the rate angular slash HTTP so
this will bring the HTTP module in
inside home dot ts file and we need
another important import statement we
need to import that that is rxjs slash
add
slash operator slash map this will help
us to map JSON data the fetch JSON data
using HTTP so we need to import this to
while dealing with some HTTP module so
after importing these two statements you
might face some issue like no provider
for HTTP so for that you need to import
this module inside AB dot module dot ts
file here and you could remove this
because we don't need this inside I've
got module or TS file which is your
route module of ionic 3 so after
importing that statement above you need
to declare it here HTTP slash comma so
this will help you to deal with HTTP
module inside your ionic app so we have
imported all the import statements to
process complex JSON data now we will
see how we can generate complex this and
data I have URL with me yeah you can see
here will copy this URL and I'll show
you our application is running let it be
now we will see the Jason the complex
Jason here random user dot me slash API
slash question mark results 10 it means
that it only FETs 10 records if you give
two then it only fetch two records so
this is the complication and the two
root nodes which are available in this
Jason data our results and info so this
is the composition data and now we'll
gone we are going to process this this
data inside our ionic 3 application so
let me talk about random user dot maybe
it's a website and it's open source free
API for generating Jason did a random
user data like anything logs like all
our MSM for but for people and if you
click learn more this tab will get open
on your browser and here you can see the
example
it has some calls like this one using
API method you can generate your JSON
data and here is our JSON data which is
shown in the example here so we are not
going to use this or we are not going to
generate JSON data because we already
have that here using this URL we are
going to fill JSON data so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna copy this all
jason data and I'll show you in a free
format it's a it in a tree format on
code beautify dot or it's a beautiful
website it offers you two more to show
or to display JSON data in it free
format what you need to do is you need
to just paste all your JSON data here
and then you need to click this you have
to select this tree format you could
also select view and form as well but I
am selecting tree format and then click
beautify here it is you can see all the
fields are in the tree format now
results gender name location email and
there are lot of fields there are lot of
fields available in this JSON format so
this is a beautiful website to view the
JSON data in it free format so this was
about the code beautify dot odd and you
can also you you can also pass your XML
data on this website as well so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna copy this URL and
let's create a method before method will
create one object users dot any and I'm
gonna create one method or load Jason
because when user clicks the button this
method will get called later we will
create a button but first we will create
a method so
before that we need to pass a parameter
inside our constructor public HTTP of
type HTTP so using this HTTP parameter
we are going to create we are going to
call dot get method and just we need to
pass this URL then dot map
dart map response response dot decent
so this method will help us to create
subscribe
actually we are doing one mistake here
we don't have to give this comma we just
have to give Jason here in the small
letters and then we need to give
subscribe method and inside the
SUBSCRIBE method you can see here value
of any void or we can also return error
as well so firstly we will see and here
you can see inside when the user clicks
this button this method will get called
load Jason and we are fetching data from
this URL and we are saying that the
response should be Jason dot Jason and
we are subscribed subscribing means we
are just retrieving all the data and we
are just assigning that data in our
users array which we have defined here
above so this dot users equals to
response dot results response dot
results so and now we will create error
you can see here if we get any error
then simply will call alert pop-up and
we'll say fail loading Jason data so now
we'll give semicolon here so hope you
are understanding and hope it is clear
so far
load Jason method is a method when the
user clicks the button will create a
button for notation on the home dot HTML
file this method will get called and we
are fetching data it should be the real
response should be Jason in a JSON
format we are retrieving we are fetching
data and then we are subscribed means we
are assigning that data that results
JSON data inside our users object if we
are getting any error then we are just
displaying an alert pop-up failed
loading Jason data and it is very simple
as you can see here now we will save
this and now will create a button for
loading Jason data on the home page
inside ion content will create a button
will give click event and inside this
click event will create inside the click
event
I'll give my method name which is the
load Jason as you can see here it should
be like this
and now we'll see Lord
users so when the user clicks this will
this will display our data of a complex
Jason data by processing it in a list
format ion list inside this and take one
ion item and I'll give star and g4
equals to let user of users these are
these all are directives I'm just
looping a particular record and I am
displaying in a list format that's it so
I'll take a one a star a star and off
third and we'll give item start and
inside this I will take one image tag
and I'll give user dot picture dot large
I'll show you this or this field is all
these fields are available in our Jason
format this is the result results the
object Jason object which we are
fetching here in our users object we are
assigning that results in users object
and then we are trying to fetch
particular records such as name and
we'll also fetch picture as well we'll
search for it picture as you can see
here picture
and there are different kinds of picture
thumbnail large and many other types of
pictures are there so we are trying to
fetch large pictures in side this image
tag so after this I'm gonna give one h2
tag inside this has two tag I'll use
user dot name dot title and I'll take
one more
I'll just flip one more thing here that
is user dot name dot first I am
displaying title and the first name and
will give break tag here and now we'll
display I will display user dot will
display something like you can you can
display anything but I am displaying I
am going to display gender you can take
gender user dot gender and below that
I'm going to display one thing that is
the registered date means when the user
has registered
user dot registered so this is a list of
users now we'll see how we can fetch
this data so we'll save these all files
now we'll run our ionic application it
might take some time to run hope you
understand first you need to in import
stdp module in root module and then you
need to import these two statements and
then you need to import these two
statements and after that I have created
one method and I'm fetching all the JSON
data using the get request method and I
am displaying that particular data in a
list format here so when the user clicks
this button load users button this
method will get called and all the data
can be shown here inside this ion list
we'll see how it looks on platform I'll
just disable this iPhone because I don't
want this I'll just simply run my app it
is giving
me an error no it is still running
we got an inner please I had a ng module
annotation okay all right so actually we
have missed something here yes already I
have added this field I don't know why
it is giving me an error oh actually we
have missed something yeah I got this we
have imported HTTP here but we need to
import HTTP module inside hapmap module
there is our root module so we have
missed that import statement here you
can see we have only given HTTP but we
have to give module as well as we are
importing HTTP module so we have to copy
this and we have to paste it here in
place of SCDP I was doing wrong so
hopefully it works now it will work I
hope it will work so we'll save this
file and we'll see that our application
is running fine or not
of that statement we have missed hope
you understand about the HTTP module and
how we are importing how we are
processing the complex JSON data using
the get request method so this way you
can handle you can process compensation
data in ionic free and you can simply
extract the JSON data from the given URL
which I have give here which I have
given here inside home brought ES File
random user dot me slash API slash
question mark presents equals to 10 as I
said earlier that this result is is a
this result is indicating that we are
going to fetch we are going to fetch
only 10 records and we are just
displaying that 10 records in this list
in this list so we'll see
it is still running it might take some
time yeah you can see here our button is
ready now when we click this button yeah
you can see the name and the gender and
the registered date which I have here
inside the results object we have gender
name and in name I have only taken title
and the first name we haven't taken a
last name object so we have also taken
the pictures as well and we are
displaying in a thumbnails using ion
after element so this way you can
process the complex JSON data you can
also change your object names like I I
want to display email address here so
I'll change this to email previously it
was gender so I have changes to I have
changed this to email now it will
display the email address of users when
we click this it loads all data from
that URL which is a JSON data and now we
are processing that data and we can see
ten records ten records can be seen here
when we click this button
it might get changed here you can see
here every time is getting changed
because we have number of users and
every time we are just displaying 10
records so you can see the first the
title first name and email address and
the registered date so this way you can
handle and process complex JSON data
using Ajax get request method in ionic 3
