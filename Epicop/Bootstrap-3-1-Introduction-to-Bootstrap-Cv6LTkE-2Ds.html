today I'm going to give a quick
introduction on bootstrap so let's see
what is bootstrap so basically bootstrap
is a front-end web framework for
creating responsive mobile first of web
pages so let's explore this more bodies
bootstrap it's a free and open source
and it is open source on github it's a
front-end web framework for designing
websites and web applications it
contains HTML and CSS based design
templates for topography forms verdens
navigation and other interface
components as well as optional
JavaScript extensions and it is it is a
web framework so it concerns itself with
front-end development only it is not far
back end it's a print and web
development framework and it is the
second most tired project on github when
it was released in 2014 with more than
one lakh stars and 45,000 Forks so let's
move to the next slide in this tutorial
we are going to create a responsive
website using bootstrap so websites that
were created before the Lord with lot of
CSS and JavaScript those same websites
can now be created with few lines of
code using bootstrap so to make it more
responsive to make it mobile first web
page we can create using bootstrap so in
this series we are going to take a look
at introduction will walk you through
the intro of what we're about to do and
little bit about bootstrap as well and
also we're going to take a look at
installation of bootstrap latest version
in visuals 30 2015 so
I'll be going to create this responsive
web page individuals 30 2015 so I'm
going to install bootstrap using nuget
package manager so let's see what is
grid system bootstrap elements and
functional website so grid system
basically it means container so in
container we are having rows and columns
and in each row we are having 12 columns
so according to that according to the
device will divide that columns
bootstrap elements such as navigation
drop-down menus lists tabs carousel and
lot more we're going to create a fully
functional and responsive website using
bootstrap so you might have heard about
the bootstrap creators they are the
former employees of Twitter they are
mark auto and Jacob Thornton let me tell
you about awesome things about bootstrap
it is creating for highly responsive web
pages and built in HTML CSS and
JavaScript is there and also built in
grid system is also there in bootstrap
so before getting started watch what you
should already know before getting
started so you should have a little bit
knowledge of HTML and CSS before getting
started but it would be fine if you are
in New be as well so let's get started

12 different columns so you can see here
