Moussa column from epic op and today I'm
going to create a simple ionic app using
firebase so first we need to install
angularfire package so we'll install it
first and you can see here I have opened
my firebase dashboard all you need to do
is you need to visit firebase website
and you need to create a new project so
I have created mine here you can see
here if you want to create a new project
then you can create from here so my
applet my project is ready and inside
this I'll create I'll click hosting not
Hosting's I'll click database as you can
see here I have database so first of all
I will delete this one so that we can
install a new one we can create a new
database table real time database here
so in this video I am going to create a
simple contact list and that list will
be stored here in this database so we
need to check the RULES first before
calling database so you have to give
access to everyone so that it can be
accessed by publicly it should not be
anything like authentication so if you
visit this you might notice that there
is something like this which I will show
you here this one or not equals to null
it means that if user is authenticated
then only your database can be accessed
by that user so in my case I am giving
access to all users without
authentication because authentication is
not the part of this video so you need
to give true and in write as well you
need to give through read and write
should be true so we are all set now
so we'll create a simple contact list
and we'll store that list in this
database using ionic in ionic 3 using
firebase so let's get started so first
you need to install angularfire package
using this command npm install angular
fire to firebase - - safe does that safe
means it's safe your package in package
dot Jason it saved all dependencies so
you need to run these commands in my
case I have installed already I have
installed that package so I'm not going
to install it again so after installing
angularfire package all you need to do
is you need to you need to open app dot
module or TS file which is your root
module of your application and inside
that root module you need to you need to
give import statements for angularfire
module as you can see here I have
already given angularfire module angular
file database module as well so also you
have to use import statement for STD
pema module so angularfire module comes
from angular fire - fire database module
comes from angularfire 2 slash database
and this comes from angular slash htdp
so after you after giving this all
import statements in your root module
you need to visit your firebase
dashboard and then you need to select
your dashboard yeah you can see here
yeah you need to click this web setup
button so that you can access your
configuration key here you can see my
configuration key is this API key or the
domain database URL and other things as
well so you need to copy this thing and
you need to paste it here and I have
already given
in my root module it should be constant
I have created a constant variable and
inside that I have given this all things
this is mandatory one without this you
cannot access you may not access your
database so for authentication for
everything you need to give this in your
root module after giving this after
giving this or after giving this
firebase API key or you can say your web
setup configuration stuff you need to
give you need to assign HTTP module
inside imports array and also angular
file database module which we have used
here this one and also angularfire
module which is here so this all things
you need to assign inside the imports
array after that you need to you need to
create a provider for dealing with
database so for that I'll create a new
provider here using command ionic G
provider firebase service so this is
going to this command is going to create
a provider for us with the name firebase
service I'll hit enter this might take
some time so we'll continue with the
root module so I have explained all
things about root module and now we have
to wait for this provider to be created
so after doing this all things we need
we need some stuff in firebase provider
firebase service provider that things I
will show you after the provider gets
created so it might take some time to
load
Magnum some take some time to be created
so I'll show you if you want to know
more about angular file then you can
visit this URL github.com slash angular
slash angularfire - I like this too I I
personally liked this one I have also
used this code for my authentication so
this is the best best reference for you
to get started with firebase and all
other things which is related to
firebase now we'll see ya
okay generated our provider is created
here yeah I can see here when we open
this you can see here we have three
import statements injectable which is
for dependency injection HTTP and rxjs
so we need to use this angular firebase
they Angela fire database import
statement we need to give here fire
model we don't need module we just need
angular fire database from angular fire
to slash database so this provider we
need to assign to our root module as you
can see here I am yeah I have already
given service provider firebase service
provider from firebase service file this
one which we have created just now we
have created one provider from with the
name firebase service provider so I have
imported this firebase service provider
here in the root module from providers
slash firebase has hyphens service slash
firebase - service which is in this
directory inside providers inside
firebase service
we have our firebase service so I have
given I have given the import statement
here already now we need to assign this
firebase service provider to the
providers array because it's a provider
right so we need to assign into the
providers array so then only we can use
this in our application so inside this
what I am going to do is I'm going to
create one I'm gonna pass one parameter
inside constructor which should be the
public angularfire DB because we are
going to create a variable for database
for storing contact list which is of
type angular fired database obviously it
should be so by using this variable
angularfire
DB we are going to deal with the
database in which is in our firebase so
it is going to be the real-time database
so I'm gonna create one method called
get contact get contacts list return
this dot list and it should be like
contact list or you can you can say
contacts contacts list it returns this
list means if if we want to display the
list of contacts which you are storing
in our database then we can use this
method so this is the method and now if
we want to add a new contact to our list
then we need to use this method
at contact this method will help us to
store a new contact in our ionic in our
database so it should be like this not
apply we just will use this one it
should be the contact list and inside
this I'm going to add not add I didn't
push here
so if user wants to add a new contact to
the list then you can use this method at
contact method generally this method
will call the database and inside the
list it just puts the new contact so
name and you need to give this name here
as well now I will create a method for
deleting a contact delete contact this
method will help you to delete a contact
from the list this dot angular file DB
dot list and we need to give our list
name not remove this method remove
method will just remove the contact from
the list so we need to give this ID here
so we have created our provider we have
done with all things in provider and
also we have seen how we are going to
deal with the database and how we are
going to get contact list adding and
deleting that contacts from the list so
we'll save this file and now we will
move to the home dot HTML file which is
our witch which is our index page so
inside home dot ts file I'll just impor
things like import first of all we need
to import our service provider right so
we can use all stuff which is written
here inside the firebase service dot es
we need to copy this and we need to we
need to import here so sorry this one is
wrong we need to copy it again copy this
and paste it here so we need to give the
path as well for for this service
provider right so I'll just copy from
here which is in our app module which is
the root modulo for application so I'll
just paste it here yeah you can see here
cannot find module I think we need to
give it is not working because it is
saying that cannot find module we have
to give yeah I think this thing we are
missing yes exactly
it is it should be like this in home dot
ts file dot dot slash dot dot slash then
your folder name then your sub folder
name then your file name it should be
like this the bar should be in this
manner so it is going to work now so I
have given my service provider here now
I'll create a list for contacts which is
of which will be of type firebase list
observable observable
and it will store the area of type any
so definitely it is going to give me an
error because I haven't created I
haven't give the import statement here
for firebase list observable import
firebase list observable from angular
file to slash database so this statement
is going to bring the firebase list
observable which will help us to display
the contact list which we are going to
store in our database so we'll save this
one and now we will create one variable
for contact you can see here I have
created this contact for adding a new
contact to our list now I'll create now
I'll give now I'll give the contact list
inside the constructor because we want
that contacts list in our on our view
page so this dot contacts list equals to
firebase yeah you need to give here so
that we can access the first we need to
give the firebase service provider here
sorry
firebase service which is of type this
you have to pass this parameter then
only you can use this firebase service
provider
in your application so I have given this
this dot fire based service dot contact
or get contact list method here so what
I am doing here is I am just getting all
contacts from get contacts list method
and just I am storing in my contacts
list observable list observable that's
it so now I am going to create a new
method for adding a new contact this dot
this dot firebase service toward add
contact type name we are just passing
this and for removing a contact from the
list I am just using this method this
dot firebase service dot delete because
we have given we have already given the
method in the firebase service provider
so we need to give here delayed contact
and we have to pass the ID for deleting
this one and we need to also give we
have to also give this one inside this
method so we are all done now so hope
you understand what I am trying to show
you here I am just trying to store a
contact list if user adds the contact or
list then that contact is going to store
in our contacts list and that particular
contact will also be this also be shown
on our page in a list format that
context is are going to show are going
to display on our
on our page so these are things which we
are trying to do here so I have saved
this one and now I'll create a view for
this one so I'm gonna create a none list
inside this I don't list
I just create I have given my own list
and inside this I am going to give my
own rope and inside this iron row
I will give my own column and I will
close this one ion column so this column
should be of 6 and inside this I am
going to display my contact not my
contact I just I'll just create an input
field to add a new contact to our list
ion input type text and
ngmodel
we are using two-way binding here
ng-model equals to our variable name
which which I have given here for adding
a new contact it is empty right now so I
am using this one to add a new contact
and place folder inside placeholder I
will just display a text called add new
contact so this one so yeah it is
completed now just we just need to
create a button for adding a new contact
iron column and column right inside this
I am
I'm going to create button I am on
button and that color and you it's your
wish you can give any color to the
button so I'll just use color equals two
second read this all things this all
variables are present inside your
variable you're inside your variable or
a CSS folder this all things can be can
be seen here primary secondary danger
these all stuff so I'll just use this
color for my button and I'll give click
event to this button and I'll give at
contact because we are using this method
we are using this method to add a new
contact or list ad that's it so we'll
just save these all things and we'll run
this application so that we can see our
application is working fine or not I'll
use this common ionic lab so this
command will run our ionic application
on ionic lab you can see here our
database is empty right now you can see
here null it is running now now we will
see we have just given 0 here so we need
to give it correctly
it is running this might take some time
so hold tight
copy finished in 16.0 three seconds yeah
you can see the output within few
moments yeah our development server is
running now it is running on ionic lab
now we will see that our application is
finally ready
it is not returning since input I on
input this one is not working yeah we
have missed this we have to give we have
to close ng-model closing braces we have
we forgot to give there the closing
brace for ng model which is used for
two-way binding it it helps us for
property binding and for event binding
as well
this is the advantage for two-way
binding in angular so if you forget to
watch my previous videos on
authentication with firebase in ionic 3
then make sure to watch that I have
created a playlist on my channel for
ionic 3 you can explore that list to
watch to know more about ionic with
firebase recently I have published a
video using using firebase now you can
see here our application is ready now we
will give one contact name called
anything as if now I will hit this
button add
now we'll see here yeah our contact list
is finally ready and if we expand this
you can see here we are we we can see
here the ID but we are not we are not we
are able to see the name as if so we are
doing something wrong here name ID I
have given this one at contact this
thing is pushing this value at contact
actually I am passing a wrong parameter
here I have created a variable with the
name contact but I am passing name this
thing is which I am doing here wrong
that thing is passing a parameter inside
the add contact method it should be like
this this dot contact so this will help
us to add a new contact to our list
we'll save this now and we'll see this
is going to work
we we we were passing wrong parameter I
have given contact here but I was
passing name so it was not going to work
but this thing is going to work because
I have corrected that thing and I have
given I have passed this the correct
parameter inside the quiet add contact
method so now we will try to create now
we will add a new contact
now we will add a new contact using this
input field when we sub
meet when we click the add new bed Add
button it it will it will add a new
contact to our list so we'll click hit
and we'll see in our database that the
name is appearing along with the ID now
you can see here so I'll add one more
with the same name now I'll add here or
this thing I'll add another name called
North I'll add one more name vanish and
I'll add one more name called Namath so
this all things dissolved contacts which
we have added on our ionic application
can be seen here inside contacts list so
this all contacts we will we will try to
display here using this method which I
am going to show you now now so I'll
create a new ion list and inside this
I'll give an item - sliding this one and
I'll give my directive called ng4 equals
to let contact of contacts list which is
this contacts list we are we are just
looping here and we'll use the pipe as
well I think this
sink pipe will synchronous will will
fetch will retrieve all the contacts
from our list as synchronously so I'll
just use eye on item here and just I'll
display that using I are using a contact
dot dollar value so we'll save this and
we'll see that our contacts are
displaying in a list format or not then
finally we will give an option to delete
item yeah you can see here all the
contacts are displaying here on our
homepage now I'll give option for
deleting contact eye on item options
inside this I'll give this option should
be at the right side so we'll use side
equals to right and inside this I will
give one button for deleting that
particular contact one button and button
it should be icon only and when user
clicks when user click that button
that item should be deleted from the
contact list right so we'll use this
method delete contact method and we'll
pass contact dot dollar key we are just
passing the ID key means ID and we are
displaying the value using value value
variable so I am just passing here key
it means the ID which is this one this
ID and if you go back
you can see here we have different ideas
for different contacts so we are just
passing that and I'm you I'll use one
ion icon for that delete button name
should be trash so I'll just save this
and I'll show you how you can delete the
contacts from the list so hope it is
clear so far and hope you are
understanding how I am doing here
so when you pull this right you can see
here delete yeah you can see here if we
pull right then you can see the Delete
icon so I hope you understand about the
hope you understand about the database
part how I have created database I have
created a list in database using
angularfire package in ionic 3 with and
with in ionic 3 with firebase so this is
the way how you can create a simple
ionic application using firebase in
ionic 3 so I hope you like this and hope
