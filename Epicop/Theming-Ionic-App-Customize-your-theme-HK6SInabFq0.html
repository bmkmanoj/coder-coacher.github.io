take a look at how to any how to team an
ionic app and how we can team our ionic
app in variable dot a CSS file so this
is my tabs ionic project which I have
created using one command : ik start
your project name and the starter
template that is tabs so here you can
see it's just a simple project tabs
ionic tab simple project so in this tab
we will theme our we will theme this
ionic app so let's get started
so here you can see
this is my home rod HTML file and all we
need to do is we need to make some
changes in variable not a CSS folder
which is right under the theme folder so
here you can give your own custom theme
to your ionic application let me show
you how you can change the background
color of your ionic app to dark here you
can find one import statement that is
ionic thought team not default it is set
to default color so let's change this to
dark and we'll see the preview inside
the browser
so you can see it is appearing in dull
color and the text is in a white color
so this is running on ionic lab and also
I have I chose two platforms that is
Android and iOS so let's add a button in
this and we'll see how we can change the
color of this color of that button in
inside home dot HTML so let's say
like
let's give em on button this is one
attribute for ionic buttons and the
color of the button will be you can give
anything here so let let me choose one
color from the colors variable inside
variables dot s CSS folder
let's choose danger elective hit me
let's run this and let's see the preview
inside the browser
so hope you're getting how you can
actually change the colors and how you
can give your custom theming to an ionic
app and I'll show you how you can give
your custom theme to ionic components as
well the later part of this video I'll
show you
it is taking a bit time
yeah it is it is showing any danger
color hit me so as you can see here at
the bottom there are three tabs home
about and contact so let's change the
color of these three tabs to some to
this color to the secondary color which
is in green light green color so let me
show you how you can do it actually so I
am under the ionic framework
documentation and inside API you can
find a bunch of components and here you
can find your tabs by searching using
ctrl F in the browser this is tabs
and inside tabs as you can see if you
have different kind different types of
tabs this is the and raw if this is the
iOS version then you can find in side
Android version as well and we have
Windows let me show you how you can do
it
so for theming your ionic app you need
to use SAS variables and this allows you
to give your own custom theme to your
ionic app so let's change the color of
this tabs which is present at the bottom
of this application let me find
the color right taps iOS tire tab icon
color so this one is used to change the
icon color right
I concur which means this icon color
about contact color so we can use this
here under the app iOS variables as you
can see here and if you are if you want
to use material design variables then
you can use it here for Windows you can
use it here and this is the section for
app theming right so we will use this
inside the iOS variables and let's say
color
dollar colors means our color variable
which is created at the bottom at the
top and let's pass the color I'm gonna
use the secondary color you can add your
own custom colors in this variable in
this colors array so let's save this and
let's see right is it going to change
the color for tap icons or not we'll see
now
under I was right in showing the icons
in a light green color right and let's
change the color of this active home
button and for that we have difference
as variable
let me check here iOS tab I can color
active this variable which we need to
use to change
the color right for this I'm gonna use
same
method but the different color let me
use dark this dark one right let's say
this it is going to change the color of
the active element
right you can see here it is averring in
dark and let's see how we can change the
colors of tab icons inside Android
this we need to follow material design
it means and right and right variables
let me give some margin right we'll give
some margin to these icons so tabs MD
margin top you will use this inside
material design
Allah gives or 10 pixels
right
let's use 10 pixels
now we'll see it is yeah the ten pixels
has been added as a padding top inside
Android but not in the iOS you can see
here the difference right at the bottom
of the screen at the bottom of the tabs
you can see here and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to increase the font
size
of tab icons of the tab I'm going to
increase the font size to 24 pixels
let's say when let's see
as you can see here the foreign size is
increasing significantly
this way you can theme or your ionic app
your ionic components you can give your
custom themes and let me show you how
you can theme floating action buttons
that is fab and right under the
components section so here I can find
floating action buttons in different
styles
this is the top right edge manner and
this is in the horizont this is in the
vertical position and this is more like
circular form so I'm going to use this
kind of floating action button inside
home dot HTML file let's copy this and
let's paste it here below this button
let's save and let's see the preview
yeah it is it has been added
oh okay
I have added this this floating action
button which is appearing at the top
right edge of the screen you can see
here let me show you how you can
actually change the background color of
these social media icons inside this
floating action button right let's
explore and let's say fapp fapp button
right so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
change the background color of this
floating action buttons right right
under the API section we can find a
bunch of sass variables which is related
to floating action button and here you
can see fab list button background color
which is default he said to the light
gray color you can see here it is in the
default section so let me you can also
notice one thing here this is all that
means it is globally applied to all
platforms that is iOS Android and
Windows
so this is very helpful for us but the
all section is not present for all
components right it is available only
for few components might be ionic team
can can apply all section all SAS
variables to all components so let me
use this
here and you can use here at the top of
app iOS variables because it is globally
applied to all variables so we we do not
need to worry so let me use this here
let me use this dark color for this
floating action buttons let's save this
and let's see the preview inside the
browser it is appearing in the light
gray manner and you can see now the
buttons are appearing in the dark
color the background has been changed to
dark color so this way you can animate
this man you can team your ionic app you
can give your custom theme to ionic apps
