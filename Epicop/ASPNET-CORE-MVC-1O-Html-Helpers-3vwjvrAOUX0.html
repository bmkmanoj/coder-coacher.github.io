video because in this video I'm going to
show you how to create forms using HTML
helpers yes what are HTML helpers they
are the helpers used to create the forms
or the dynamic things in your view page
so i would like to show you how we can
get started with HTML helpers HTML
helpers are not being used now because
tag helpers replaced his team and
helpers in asp.net MVC so still I want
to show what our history and helpers and
how they are helpful to us while
creating views so let's get started so
this is the controller home controller
in this controller I would like to add
one action method that is for the HTML
helpers view page I actionresult this is
the return method or return portion of
this view I actionresult and I would
like to give the name of this method
action method as his team and helpers
and I would like to return the view
view so this is our action method which
I have created in the home controller
and now I would like to create HTML
helper view page so that we can create
our form using HTML helpers so for that
firstly I have created one model that is
the customers model which you can see
here in my models folder in the solution
Explorer inside this folder I have
created one model that is customers so
in that model I have three properties
first name last name and mobile so these
are the three properties which I am
going to use in my view page that is
HTML helpers view page to create the
forms using HTML helper so let's get
started firstly i'm going to go to
solution explorer then click home you
might be wondering why i am choosing
this home folder to create my HTML
helper view page because the action
which i have added recently is in the
home controller so this action method is
in the home controller so we need to
create this view page HTML helpers view
page inside the home view folder it's a
convention you need to follow this while
adding or while doing something in
asp.net MVC so let's add a new item here
that new item would be the MVC view page
let's call this view page name as HTML
helpers same name according to your
action method you can see this is to
action method and this is the view page
name then click Add
the view page is being added now so in
this Hestia my helpers view page I would
like to access my model first that is
the customer small so for that you need
to use the razor syntax if you are a
newbie to asp.net MVC then don't forget
to watch my previous videos on
introduction to asp.net core MVC and
introduction to razor so don't forget to
watch that previous videos so i am using
a great model symbol to access the
customers model from my model folders
model folder so accurate model then give
your application name my in my case my
application name is bang cap dot in
which folder the model is present in
models folder dot customers that's it so
in this way you can access your model
now I would like to create my HTML
helper my I would like to create a form
using HTML helpers so this way you can
create at the rate using then opening
and closing braces HTML dot begin form
so this is the method begin form it is
indicating that our form is beginning
from here now so inside this began form
I would like to give my action method
name that is HTML helpers which I have
created in home controller so give the
action name here karma in which
controller it is present that is in
controller former New
opening and closing braces curly braces
return no I don't like to give this I
would like to give form method instead
of this I would like to give form method
dot post so what I am doing here is
first I am indicating the form that if
the user submits the form if the user
submits the data through this form then
the form will be redirected to this
action method that is HTML helpers and
that action method is present in home
controller and the method of the form
should be post obviously we have to give
the post method if you if you want to
submit the form so this is the first
part of creating the form now I would
like to give my attribute fields of the
form at the rate HTML represents the
HTML helper this part represents the
HTML helpers you can see here so at the
HTML dot label dot label for then
opening and closing braces inside this M
give rise to m dot first name you can
see here you might be wondering what
this M represents this M represents
model which we are accessing here you
could write model here or you could
write em it's your wish it depends on
you how you want to access the model
properties so in my case I am giving em
it represents the model m this is the
lambda rotation or the arrow notation
which is indicating that model and dot
if I put dot there it is showing the
intelligence this is the wonderful
feature of visual studio it shows the
Intel is
means how many properties i have in my
model you can see here different kind of
methods and different price kind of
properties as well so in my case I am
selecting first name let's give PR tahir
break tag beside below this label I
would like to take the text box for for
which attribute I am taking this I am
taking this for the first name dot first
name so this part is for the first name
property this is the label and this text
box is for the first name so let's give
another break tag here now let's call
HTML dot label for m m dot first name no
not first name we have already accessed
that access that property first name now
would like to call last name let's give
Freytag here and let's say the text box
for text box for for the same property
that is for the last name property let's
give another break tahir we have taken
two fields here the first name and the
last name and what else remaining in the
models that is mobile so let's say at
the rate HTML dot label for
Oh model this M representing model dot
mobile give another break tag here i am
giving this break tags to continue this
text box filled in the new line break
represents the breaking of the line it
breaks the line text box for m m dot
mobile so we have done this part now i
would like to give my button tag here
button inside this button i would like
to give some bootstrap classes button
button success you can see here there
are different kinds of button there are
different kinds of buttons in bootstrap
you can access any one button success or
button primary or button default if you
want to change the size of the button
you can use button large LG or button SM
small button md there are different
kinds of buttons in my case I am taking
success because we are going to submit
this form so we have created this form
if the user submits is formed this for
me will be redirected it will be
redirected to the HTML helpers action
method which is present inside the home
controller so let's save dinner and
let's hop to the home controller and
let's say
HTTP GET firstly i'm going to give the
HTTP action verb as HTTP GET if the user
requests for the forum it represents the
HTTP GET action verb so for that action
work for that request I am showing this
form what if the user submits the form
in that case I would like to give his
TTP post let's copy this same action you
might be wondering why I am giving the
to action names as same because if the
user requests for the form it just
displays the form this has CDP get
action verb what if the user submits the
form what if the user submits the entire
data to the form that form that data
will be redirected to this HTML helpers
action method so let's call customer
names model here customer Nick customers
model you can see here this is the model
and this is the object so i would like
to validate the form if model state dot
is valid then
I would like to do something dynamic
here but before that I would like to
give another attribute here that is
validate anti forgery token this token
prevents you from cross-site scripting
attacks if the potential hackers want to
crack want to hack your web application
want to submit the data through the web
application then this token this
attribute will prevent you from that
cross-site scripting so this is the
important attribute you have to remember
while giving the post attribute in your
action methods so I would like to give
this validate aunty fortunately token
and now I would like to say view back
dot message equals to cust dot that is
the customers model cus dot first name I
am storing this value the first name of
the user which the user is going to
submit from this form so I am storing
this in a view back dot message we will
back dot message is a dynamic property
this view back represents the temporary
data it's towards the temporary data
which is used to pass the data temporary
data through a controller to a view view
data and view back these are the two
dynamic properties these are the two
dynamic dictionaries you can say which
holds temporary data so i am using this
property to store the first name of the
user let's save this and let's hop to
the view page and let's say if viewbag
dot message not equals to null now let's
say i would like to display this na this
is the good part of razor you can
here you can use HTML inside the c shop
so you can toggle easily between the c
sharp and a hash tml and you can use the
CSS properties as well by giving here if
you want to decorate these properties if
you want to decorate this fields you can
do it easily by giving new opening and
closing braces add the rate class so
that way you can decorate the properties
new I will show you how to do that new
closing braces not this class at delay
class so let's give some classes names
that is form control this is the
bootstrap class using this way you can
decorate the properties so in my case I
don't want to do this I will remove this
and let's say in this h1 tag what I was
showing you if the user submits the form
the post method will be called this a
testament helpers action method will be
called and if the user submits all the
fields then this view back property is
going to store the temporaries first
name data in this attribute that is in
this variable called message that
message I want to display here that is
view back at the rate view back dot
message so let's save this and let's run
in the browser and let's see how it
works so this is my block this is my
personal blog there is tech geek m dot
