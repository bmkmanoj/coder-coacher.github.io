gonna show you how you can validate
forms in ionic 3 so before we get
started I would like to show you some
import statements which you need to
import for validating your forms so
let's get started
this is my homework test file and in
this I'm gonna show you how of what
needs to be imported by you in order to
validate forms so first we need to
import form builder obviously right so
before without form builder you cannot
create the forms so you need to import
form builder form group and validators
this is the obvious one without this you
cannot validate your your ionic form
fields and also you need to import this
abstract control this all can be
imported from angular slash forms then
don't forget to give semicolon here so
this for things you need to import after
importing this for statements you can
create you can pass one parameter inside
your constructor for form builder form
builder which is of type form builder
right so here I'm gonna show you how you
can create a foam group from group of
form group and in this form we are going
to use two fields first name and last
name I am going to make a simple form
and I'll show you how you can display
your validation errors in ionic 3 right
so I'll just take two fields that is
they'll just take two fields that are
first name
and I'll give this type as abstract
control last name also as abstract
control so after giving these two fields
let's create our form now this dot form
group equals to form builder dot group
so now I'm gonna create I'm gonna create
one a field the first name field here of
type comma validators validated and
required as you can see here so this is
all about the first name let's copy down
this and paste it here for the last name
right last name so these are the two
fields which these are the two fields
which you need which we need to use in
order to display validation errors now
let's give this dot first name equals to
our farm group dot opps sorry I I think
I I need to give this dot right right
this dot controls and this name first
name so copy this and pass here let's
give another field called last name and
equal it is equals to this dot form
group dot can sorry I I I have to give
control here right controls controls and
last name this field so we are done with
these things some it is giving me Samara
does not exist on type form builder last
name oh sorry I need to give form group
here I have given formula so it is
taking now now that has gone you can see
here what I have done so far here is I
just created two fields and a farm group
this farm group is used to create a form
using form builder and you have given
two fields first name and last name and
we made these two things as required
right so if these two fields are not
given by user then it is going to be
some error so that error will be of
validation type validation error so I
will show you how you can display later
in the HTML file so these things are
very important and it is obligatory in
order to display validation errors we
have given required field we have given
we have made two fields required and we
have also passed it in the form group so
let's save this and let's move to the
head home dot HTML file home rod HTML
file and this I'm going to create one
simple form one simple form so we'll
just we'll just create a form and we'll
give form group
farm group equals to the group which we
have created right farm group so we'll
give it here and inside this let's
create one list and inside this list
let's create an item I on item and
inside this I'll take one element called
I on label and we will call it as first
name and now we will take one input
element I on input sorry I need to take
input here this one right so I think we
need to give it in one line as it is an
input field
let's give type equals to text and form
control name should be equals to the
name which we have given here first name
right to copy this and let's pay let's
copy this I on item here for the last
name as well so let's copy this last
name field and give it here in the form
control name so this will only display
the two fields which we have given but
it doesn't display any validation error
for that we need to give I'll give for
that or for displaying validation errors
we need to use some attributes or some
decorative decorators so I will show it
later
first we'll create a form first we'll
complete this form iron button and I'll
say this as submit' ID let's save this
and let's display let's show the preview
of this form in our browser it is giving
me some error form group cannot bind to
form group I think I have to give form
here form group let's save this it is
still not taking I think we need to
remove this let's save this let's see
still getting issue let's change this to
the form drop and run this and we'll see
that no it is yeah it has taken now form
control name must be using the parent
form group
it is saying about the form control name
okay all right
as you can see here this needs to be
used in this way from group let's save
this and we'll see the preview of the
form yeah you can see here we have
created our form it's a dummy form it
doesn't display any validation errors we
did a silly mistake here blunder mistake
first we need to give first letter of
the form group is kept small and the
group the word group the first letter of
the group G is in cap so we need to use
firm group here in this way and now we
will see the validation errors right so
let's do it now I'll use structural
directive here ng if equals to first
name dot has error then we'll say if the
error is required and first name dot
touch
then we'll display a simple error here
called first name is required right
sorry
first name is required so let's save
this and let's run this in the browser
to see it is working or not and the e
first name if it is having error of
required then we'll just display this
error first name is required it is
touched or not we if you are also taking
and here right you can see here first
name is required our validation error is
displaying below the first name field
will use this same I on item below this
one right and we'll change this to last
name and let's copy this last name
change this to last name because we are
checking for last name here right so
we'll save this it is working fine right
the required error is displaying on the
form you can see here we now will see
the minimum and maximum length error so
for that you need to use validators dot
minimum length is 5 in my case you could
give anything right so I'll just give 5
here and for the last name validators
dot max length it's 15 this way
you can give minimum and maximum length
in this way and you can also display
validation errors of minimum and maximum
length minimum and maximum length on the
forms so this is the way you can do it I
have just shown you the required fields
errors on the form but you can give your
own values your own custom validations
according to your required according it
depends on your requirement right so you
can give it so I have just shown you how
you can display the required error as
you can see here it is still giving some
issue we'll just save this and we'll see
that so this way you can do it the form
validation in ionic 3 and also you can
see these things and you can find my
code on github and my username is say at
Musa column 95 and I will paste the link
in the video description you can find it
below right here in the description so
please subscribe my channel and share my
videos with your friends don't forget to
watch playlists of Bionic 3 and ionic 2
on my channel subscribe to my channel
that is epic up you can find here on
youtube you can find it here on youtube
so hope you understand how I have done
the form validation in ionic 3 lets it
is giving me some issue let's remove
this you can see here first name is
required and the two fields are required
and you can also disable the button if
you want to so this is all about the
form validation in ionic 3 hope you
enjoy it I hope you enjoyed it and
thanks for watching this video and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
