I'm going to walk you through Jason how
you can retrieve data from adjacent file
so in this example I will show you how
you can fetch data using Jason format in
a JSON format you can retrieve data on a
histamine web page so let's get started
so what I have done here is I have
created one hash table page called index
dot HTML as some of you may not know
about index dot HTML use while creating
a project projects so let me clear this
while you create or while you build a
new project index dot HTML will be
called first as it is a default view
page or it is a default web page for
your bread for your web project so I
have given the name of this page as
index dot HTML and also I have given
here you can say two h1 tags these two
h1 tags retrieve data using J's as X and
Jason so on this button click I would
like to show the JSON data which I am
going to store in this file JSON data
dot jason so these three files are
present in my folder called jason this
is the new project which i have created
for this json format video so in this
video we'll show how to fetch we will
see how to fetch data using jason so
let's get started in this file I'm going
to create a Jason structure adjacent
format data so let's say
why bm1 this is the force property
so this is our first property and this
property is
first name would be your first property
and let's give see it may move as the
first name and the last name of this
property will be will be something like
this and the email you can see here I am
giving this all things in a double
quotation so this is the format of Jason
this is the syntax of Jason you need to
give in this structure you need to give
in this format if you are doing if you
are retrieving or if you are creating
Jason data so remember this while
dealing with the Jason data let's say
say mu that de-rate gmail.com will be
the email for this property of IBM and
our another property will be same as
like this but with different attributes
let's change this YB m 1 to YB m to the
name will be
make this in a caps so it looks
copy down this and paste it here so
let's change this email also save this
file which is Jason data or Jason you
can see here the extension of this file
is dot Jason so this file is a JSON file
now this file I would like to show on
the console in the console when the user
submits or when the user click this
button so in this script file in the J's
file I would like to use jQuery here
document dot ready on this I am calling
a function this represents that if the
document is ready then we are calling
one function inside the inside this
function I am giving another event which
is if our button is clicked
if someone clicked this button then we
are calling this function this functions
our anonymous functions as you can see
here there is no such names for these
functions this functions we can call
these functions as anonymous because it
doesn't have a name this function is
anonymous function inside this function
I'm calling a jQuery method called get
Jason and inside this I'm gonna give the
URL of this page copy this and give here
and as a callback function I am using
this on a get jason method if the if the
jason data is retrieved retrieve on word
page then i am using and then I'm giving
a callback function with the object obj
and inside this I'm gonna give each
function here I'm going to pass this
parameter obj and again I'm calling an
anonymous function and I am passing two
parameters key and value inside this I'm
gonna give console dot log inside this
I'm giving value so you might be
wondering what I am doing here
so let me explain you from the beginning
so this is the document dot ready if our
document is ready then then this
function will be executed after this
when the user submit when the user click
this button which is present on this
page this button this function will be
called which is anonymous function on
click we are calling this function we
are calling this anonymous function and
if the user clicks this button then we
are calling this function inside that
function we are retrieving our data from
this URL which is present on my local
host on my local host is easy PHP you
can see here it is running in the
background and after fetching after
retrieving the data from the JSON file I
am calling a callback function to show
on the console on the console window on
the console part I am gonna
to entire Jason theta so I am using this
callback function function I am passing
a parameter called obj and I am calling
another function called each this this
each is actually a loop it
it works like a low it consider each
property of Jason and display on the
page and passing the and I am passing
the parameters as obj and also I am
giving another anonymous function here
with two parameters called key and value
and finally I am displaying on my
console dot clock this value so let's
save this all files let's hop to the
browser and let's refresh the page and
let's click this button as you cannot
see here the data because we are
displaying the data in the console right
below here you can see Evan whenever you
click this button you can see here one
URL is given in the console when you
expand this console we can see here the
response the response on this page as a
HTML part so this one is not showing
the response is showing in HTML form and
I don't want that HTML form as a
response might be I am doing some
mistake here so let's bring down this
script files in the body let's save this
and let's hop to the browser refresh
again click the button now you can see
here yeah finally we got the Jason part
here and along with the properties you
can see here object this is the object
first name last name and email and the
values are also given inside this object
I am displaying this Jason data on the
console in the console dot log function
I have given the value in the script dot
JS file that's why it is displaying in
the console part if you want to display
on your view page then you can then you
can display the Jason data on the view
page by giving some ul tags inside that
div attacks you can give inside the duel
tags you can give the list items and
light axe so in that you can look
through with this Jason data so for now
I am showing you how to retrieve I have
shown you how to retrieve taste and data
using jQuery and Ajax and in the console
you can see here we have fetch we have
retrieve our data as JSON format so this
is the JSON format which you can use in
your web applications as this Jason is
very popular nowadays you could use in
any web application without reloading
the entire page you can display the data
using Jason and a jack
so these are the two what you can say
these are the two trending topics in the
market so this video is for the newbies
is for the beginners who want to learn
jQuery and a-jax
