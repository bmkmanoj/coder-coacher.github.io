Liam from epic op and today I'm going to
show you something interesting and that
is Google Maps in ionic 3 we will see
how we can use Google Maps API to
integrate Google Maps in ionic 3
application so let's build a simple
ionic 3 application and we can integrate
Google Maps in that application using
Google Maps API so first you need to
visit this documentation
developers.google.com slash maps if you
get started with this then you will find
a bunch of links here like if you are
developing app if you are developing an
app for Android then you can select this
option but in in my case um in my case I
will select Google Maps JavaScript API
as you know that we are developing
hybrid mobile applications so we need to
select this option for integrating
Google Maps so you can see here we have
three different types of we have three
different types of maps like with a
marker it's it's a marker in this app
you can see here you can create map with
a marker and you can also visualize data
using the map and also you can create
marker clusters so this way you can do
this let's start with the API key here
you can find your API key if you click
this button then you can see No
I need to login first you know I need to
login first in order to use in order to
get that API key right I'm logged in now
and I can find my key API key here
now if I click this button get a key
probably I'll get an API key which is a
unique key obviously right it is not
showing enable API I have created one
project so I have selected that project
to get that API token an API key from
Google Maps yeah you can see here my API
key is this one so I'll copy this and
I'll sit down after getting that API key
you need to visit your index dot HTML
file which is your root which is your
main file of your ionic app here you can
use one script tag and inside this you
can give maps.google.com
actually I need to give a PSA Google
api's comm slash Maps slash API slash
tears and after this you need to give
question mark here then only you can
give your key here so pace your key
right after giving this all things don't
forget to add this two attributes that
are sync and differ these two are
important and also don't forget to add
the question mark after giving your URL
before giving your API key HTTP slash
double slash maps.google.com slash Maps
slash API slash days pushing mark key
equals to your key which we have copied
from the documentation from here right
so let's go ahead and let's see let's
save this file close it and let's jump
to the home dot HTML file and we'll
create a div tag inside this iron
content
with an ID my map
yeah you can see it's an abbreviation
when we hit tab it is taking let's give
map as an element reference so that we
can use inside our typescript file right
so in this day I am going to show a
Google map so after giving this we need
to use a view child decorator right and
also we need element reference as well
so we need view child decorator which is
for map map reference of type element
reference right so what what I have done
here is I have just created a map I have
just linked this element div element in
this view child by creating an instance
by using mutual decorator I have created
this statement so after giving this
let's check the element reference is
working fine or not using eye on view
did load
right using this method we can see by
showing data inside console right this
dot map ref let's save this and let's
jump to the browser to see the changes
to see through you
it is building now let's open the
console so that we can have an element
reference of the dev which we have
created
yet is still running
and it's still running as you can see
here it might take some time to load
right so we need to wait for this
yeah it is ready now and we'll see an
element reference inside the console
right you can see here and I meant
reference diff of type of ID differ by D
my map when we when we break down this
console you can see here and I meant
reference native element the name of the
diff of the ID my map so let's close
this it is working fine now let's create
a method to display our actual map
display map inside this we need to give
location first so new google dot maps
Google dot maps dot lat
long that long is the position of your
location so we have if his website
called lat/long dotnet so I live in
Hyderabad so I will search this place so
that I can find latitude and longitude
and I will pass it here inside
this too right so let's create
and instance for this google so that we
cannot get this issue right so we need
to declare this as a global variable
Google Earth type any
so it is not showing any error to us
right after giving a location let's make
it simple after giving location you need
to give some options right for options
you need to create this object and you
need to give
two options like center will be location
and your zoom will be 10 right so let's
close this object after giving this
object you can first we need to give
the displaymessage is play man sorry I
need to give this
so let's save
and let's jump to the display part where
we can display our map our actual map
let's save this and let's see our
changes on the browser I hope it will
not does I will I hope it will not
display any change because we haven't
used display method so for that we need
something called map right so constant
map equals to new Google dot Maps
dot maps dot map right this dot map
reference which is our element reference
dot native element as location so hope
it will work now let's run and let's see
the preview and also we need to set the
height of the map right
so using this ID we can set our diff
hide
let's say height
we'll be hundred percent
let's save these all files and let's see
the preview in the browser
we haven't had any marker yet
we need to add our our custom marker or
a default marker using a method which
I'll show you after displaying map on
the page it might take some time because
my laptop is bit slow
and also you can watch some tutorials as
well on the documentation of Google you
can see a choose one of these tutorials
or see them all you can watch some
developer tutorials for how you can
integrate Google Maps inside your
application
yeah it is loading
I think it is ready
yeah you can see here
our map use ctrl + scroll to zoom
by example stack size exceeded actually
I am doing something wrong here I think
we are getting this issue because we are
not passing correct arguments we are not
passing correct parameters inside Google
at Google dot Maps dot map method as you
can see here we are passing the
reference of an element which we have
created here that if element with the
with an ID
map reference and also we are passing
location so we need to remove this
location from here because location is
not necessary for showing map but
options are necessary so this thing I am
doing wrong here so let's save this and
let's preview the change in the browser
I hope it will work now because I was
passing the wrong parameter which was
location but I need to pass options so
hope it will work now
so it was my mistake and I'm really
sorry for that
we need to pass options method and
inside options you can see here we have
location center location and zoom is set
to ten so I hope it will work now
because we have passed two arguments and
that two arguments are correct so it is
reloading now let's see the change and
let's see the life map on our browser as
you can see here it is working now and
the map is showing on the screen so
let's see the street view first first
we'll drag this
will drag the street view to the map
yeah you can see here the street view
yeah it is working fine
yeah you can see here our street view if
we go back our we can see the normal map
it's a road map actually it's a default
map it's a default type in Google Maps
we have other different types as well
which I will show you in the later part
of this video so let's add the marker
first because without marker we cannot
navigate to the current location so
let's create one method called add
marker and
this will take two arguments and that to
our position and map and after passing
too many parameters it will return an
object which is Google Maps dot marker
so it will return to things that our
position and map right so we will call
this ad marker method here this dot add
marker and we'll pass two options that
our location and our map
so let's save this and let's see the
change in the browser that will see that
marker is showing on the screen on the
map or not
so inside Malkin you need to pass
location first and your map and inside
your map if you want to display your map
on the screen then definitely you need
to pass your reference a pass a
reference of an element in which you are
going to display your map and also you
need to pass the options right so it is
reloading now and will see the marker on
the map on the current location
so we have many different options as
well you can explore more about Google
Maps API on this documentation as you
can see here everything is given
everything you can get everything here
if you want some different style maps
then you could find it easily here on
the documentation and we have some
tutorials as well for adding a marker
right so we'll see now it is taking much
time to load yeah you can see here
currently I like I said earlier I live
in Hyderabad so it is pointing to
Hyderabad if I go inside then I can see
my current location I live in a
beautiful city called Hyderabad yeah it
is showing the marker the exact location
so this way you can add your marker in
your google map so now we will see how
we can disable the Street View option
which I have shown you here right this
is a Street View you can enable this by
dragging that yellow small person
you can see here if we go back then we
will go to the normal map so let's
disable it first Street vu control let's
set this to false right let's save this
and also
let's save this street view control to
false and also we'll see different type
of maps right we have different types of
maps Road map it's a default one let's
save this and see the road map view on
the map
as you can see here
it is reloading now
it might take some time
it is running on the map
yeah it is taking much time to load like
I said earlier we have different types
of maps which we can show on our screen
so road map is the default one which I
am which I have shown you yeah it's a
it's a default so this is the default
road map you you can do which you can
see on the screen now I'll show you
different types like we have different
types and we have one more type called
terrain now we will see the terrain type
of map on the screen so we'll see the
preview on the browser it is reloading
now and we have two different types as
well as you can see as you can notice
one thing here I have set a street view
control to false that's why we we are we
cannot see street view on this map if
you enable it if you set it to true then
we can see the street view control now
we will see the terrain type of map and
we have two different types as well one
is highbreed and the other is satellite
so our map is ready you can see here the
terrain type it is not showing anything
let's change this to satellite
and after satellite will see the
highbreed map as well so hope you
understand about Google Maps API in
ionic 3 first you need to get an API key
from developers.google.com slash maps
and you you have to embed that script
tag inside index dot HTML then you need
to create an object for Google and then
you need to create it as to create an
HTML element for showing your map you
need to use view child decorator for the
reference of that element and after that
you need to use these three objects
location options and map and for showing
marker you need some different method
from you need a separate method for
showing marker that is add marker you
need to pass two variables position and
map and for map for swing map you need
to pass the reference of an element and
options you need to pass these two
parameters I hope you understand about
Google Maps API in ionic 3 now we will
see about the satellite map you as you
can see here it's a satellite map it is
working on our screen yeah it is working
now we'll see the hybrid map hybrid
let's save this and say see the preview
on the screen if you have missed my
previous videos on ionic 3 then don't
forget to watch my playlist on youtube
on my youtube channel that is ionic 3
tutorial series and also I have ionic 2
playlist as well so watch that
before watching this video so you can
understand about ionic 3 and if you are
a newbie or if you are a big beginner
then I would suggest you to visit ionic
dot IO
that's a beautiful documentation for
ionic developers
then you can get started with ionic and
angular yeah it's a hybrid map we have
some different map as you can see here
it is a hybrid view of Google map so
this is all about Google Maps API in
ionic 3 thanks for watching this video
