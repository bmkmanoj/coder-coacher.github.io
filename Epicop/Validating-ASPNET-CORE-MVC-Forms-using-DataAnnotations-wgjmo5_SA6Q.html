in this video I'm going to show you how
to validate asp.net MVC forms with data
annotations so let's get started with
data annotations first and let's see how
to validate our forms let's move to the
next slide why you need validation
basically you need validation to
validate your form errors validation
errors and validation can be done using
data annotations and if a user enter
invalid data in some inappropriate data
then it detects that errors and displays
on our page HTML page and validation can
be done at server side not on a client
side let's move to the next slide and
let's talk about data annotations what
our data annotations data annotations
are used to specify important properties
to an input field and there are a lot of
properties there are a lot of data
annotation attributes are they like
required attribute display attribute and
there are many other attributes as well
so we're going to cover up those
attributes in the code session after
this introduction it specifies required
attributes to an input field as I said
just now and it also provides the error
message attributes inside the required
attribute and it also specifies the
display a tribute to display the
property names using display attribute
let's code now let's switch on to the
visual studio and let's create one model
and our model folder I'm going to create
a model
new class as model is a class so let's
take the model name as validate dot CS
this would be the correct name for this
model as we are writing the validation
logic let's write here prop it's a short
form to write a property right prop and
hit double tap two times tap tap tap it
gives you property it's awesome feature
of visual studio let's take the name and
i am going to give required attribute as
you can see here it is not showing in
the intelligence the bulb is showing
here and it's a short cut to add the
using statement for required attribute
as you can see here using
system.componentmodel dot data
annotations so this is the using
statement for required attribute inside
this required attribute we can add error
messages you can see here this is a
required field and also we have another
attribute called display
name equals to your name it displays
this displayed attribute on HTML page so
let's take another property called
mobile and for this we have another data
type another validation data type called
phone let's give this property name as
mobile this is also a required field and
let's take the error message for this
let's copy down this and paste it here
paste it here and this is
mr. Awad Ibaka however let's take this
play attribute name your mobile number
your mobile number let's take the data
type for this as this is the data right
so we need to take phone number you here
you can see that we can take the data
type as phone number for the mobile
numbers for the contact numbers it is
also one feature of validation logic
which we are writing let's take another
property called
string let us take this as email ID
let's copy down this attribute data
annotations paste it here
it's showing error here because I have
to close curly braces here copied on
this list it here instead of phone
number I will take email address you can
see here in the data type a data
annotation we can take email address
phone number and we have different kind
of data as well you can see you can see
here from the starting we have credit
card currency custom and we have date
date and time duration email address
HTML we have different properties and
even we are having data annotation
property for password as well and phone
number postal code text plain text
upload time you are and lot more other
features so let's take this as email
address let's save this file and let's
move to the views folder and create in
this detail folder and let's create
awaaz amakura Hamas so the how much
Oh
and let's take this as MVC view page and
we see view page let's call this view
page as validate dot CSS HTML CSS ml is
the extension of this file because the
result we can use razor inside this file
so let's call it here firstly we're
going to access the model called
validate as we have created one model in
the model folder
models dot so this is our model using
this model we gonna get access all those
properties written inside this model us
so let's create a form here asp i would
like to take asp action validate
an HP controller would be detailed so we
forgot to write the action inside this
controller for the view let us copy this
sign up you
pace you down there above sign up
change this action name as validate and
also this is for the get if the user
requests the form the validate
validation form then this action will be
executed because it's a get request now
if user enters data if user post data
through a form then we have to take
another action with the HTTP POST
attribute so that is going to be
different action for the validate action
copied in a copy down this signup action
and paste it here let's change this sign
up name to validate let's change this
validate class as we are not using
database limb of this fields
name what I am doing here is when user
pose some data through a form it comes
to this action this action will be
executed and in this action am taking
that if you I am checking that user
enters all the fields or not to this if
statement model state dot is valid model
state dot is valid so if the user enters
all the required fields then I am taking
a view back property to store temporary
data this is the view back property and
inside this I am storing that
successfully registered message to
display on our page so let's design the
view' for this let's take a diff tag
let's take this as form horizontal
inside this form horizontal let's take
one diff type
I am taking this farm group
and this I'm taking a label class
control level column sm2 I am taking
this for I am taking this column sm2 for
the small devices and also i forgot to
take one attribute called is before it's
important property as we are specifying
that the label tag is only for a
particular property called name of
validate model which we have in this
folder this one so let's take another
div tag and let's say column sm10
inside this I'm going to take input
field is before name and beside this I'm
going to take span tag to display errors
this that span tag will display your
validation errors this is the bootstrap
class these all are bootstrap classes
form control control label and this
columns form horizontal dissolve our
bootstrap classes HP validation for name
I forgot to take one div tag here it is
very important ESP validation summary
that is for model only so this is the
first form group which we have created
for the name let's copy down this and
paste it here and let's say this is for
mobile
yeah our second property is mobile yes
so let's copy this mobile paste it down
here and here too let's say that
the last property that is for email for
that I am creating another fun group and
let's rename this mobile as email copy
this email paste it down here and let's
save this both files and let's also save
the action which we have written in the
detail controller and if the user enters
all fields
I'm doing my mistake here
there's to eat here let's cut it down
and forward to close the div tag beside
this or about this i'm going to paste it
here and and i also want to print the
message that if user enter all the
fields then i would like to view bad i
would like to display
the successful message here
view back door message
here and you can
show this view back message here save
this application and let's run this
application it might take some time to
get compile and run on our browser till
then I would like to show my personal
blog door which is the geek m dot tech
blog that I used to post all my updates
on asp.net and asp.net code regarding
MVC and all stuff my recent post was
about view back view data temp data and
session in asp.net MVC and I also upload
the code which I was written in the
Visual Studio code editor you can see
here so this was the code and this was
the view page and also i have uploaded
my video on this topic and this is the
introduction part to a spirited core MVC
for newbies not for the intermediate or
for the experienced one so follow this
block to stay updated
now our application is running out so
just we need to give controller and the
action name in the URL validate is our
action name and our controller name is
detail so
it is taking much time to compile
and if you want to get started with
asp.net this is the good side to start
from scratch as you can see you can
download visual studio also and.net call
it's open source and it's a cross
platform to build your mobile web apps
modern web apps on all platforms over
web page is ready we can give our
controller name and action name that is
validated let's run here you can see
here
we are unable to see the name tag and
also we forgot to give the button tag
here let's do it now let's even button
tag here
let's take a button button default and
also type of the button should be submit
boom here
as you can see here i am not feeling any
fields but still is showing that this is
required field we are successfully
getting that error validation error on
our view using this span tag which I
have shown earlier this pan tax in this
pan tax we are displaying our errors so
we are doing this on a server side not
on a client side so this so this is our
model and this or action so we did it
let's give some name as Joan mobile
number let's give mobile number as
alphabets for example and I think I
haven't changed this name
in the model
here you can see I have to give I have
to give your email id refresh this
refresh this your mobile number still it
is showing your name has goes upside
because i have given wrong diff type so
we can make it correct just by doing
this this so let's give some another
name this is the mobile number give
alphabets and this one is the email ID
but still it is showing that mobile
number email just on this application
let's let's read on this application
because it is showing the previous
results which is stored in the cache
I have written this application to get
correct names on the view page
mistakenly i have given wrong names to
the properties in the model class so
it's better to rebuild this application
and inside this URL give the controller
name and the action name
it might take some time as usual
you can see your name your mobile number
and ID let's try this let's give
alphabets in mobile number to see our
validation logic is working or not and
let's do some dummy alphabets go here
yeah you can see here please include an
ad the rate symbol in this email id data
annotation because we have given email
address as the data type so it will not
post this form to the controller action
until we make it correct so this is
about the data annotation logics all the
fields are required so you need to fill
in order to pose this form so this is
all about the validation and the data a
notation attributes hope you enjoyed
