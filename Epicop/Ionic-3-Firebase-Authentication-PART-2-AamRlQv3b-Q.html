it moussaka Liam from a pickup and today
I'm going to show you how we could how
we could login using a firebase
authentication we have seen how to
register a user using ionic tree and
with ionic tree with firebase or
authentication and in this part two I
will show you how we could login using
the existing user in firebase
authentication using firebase
authentication so if you forget to watch
my previous video on firebase
authentication then do watch it then
only you can understand this part
because in that part I have shown you
the registration of a user using
firebase authentication now we will see
the login part so we shall begin now so
in this file login dot HTML I have
created a form with two input fields
similar to the log register page with
username and password and I have given a
button power login here and on the form
submission I am calling this method this
event will call this user login method
and we are we have that login user login
method here right here in this in the
login dirtiest file so what we will do
is we will copy the angularfire auth
import statement from registered or
teeth and will paste it here because we
have to use this in the login part as
well so after importing that statement
will pass the Constructors inside will
pass a parameter inside the constructor
and firebase auth which is of type
angular fire auth so now we
could use this and a firebase odd to
login the user this dot firebase auth
dot dot dot sign in and now we you could
see here we have a different list
different lists of options so I'm going
to select sign in with email and
password method because I have
registered the user using create with
email and password method so as we are
as we are using email and password
authentication method so we have to use
this method that is email and password
method and as you can see here it also
accepts two parameters similar to
register function which we have seen in
our previous video that is that the two
parameters are email and password which
which are of type string and now we
could use the two values the two input
fields this dot user dot value or dot
value it is not showing here this dot
user dot value comma this dot password
dot value and it also returns promise
after passing two parameters similar to
the register function that is created
with email and password method as we
have seen in our earlier video so now
it's time to return a promise and I will
give data here and I'll show my promise
written
you in the console that user logged in
successfully so this message will be
shown inside of our console and also
I'll pass the optional parameters which
is of type ne and it is a la so I'll
give this dot file based off dot dot dot
dot dot current user so I'd use this so
it displays the current username and
after seeing this or after displaying
this message in the console dot log I'll
just show an alert controller on the
page and I'll post that page to another
page I mean to say that I'll navigate my
page to another page after the user
logged in successfully message appears
on the console so I'll show you in the
little part of this video for now it is
ok I'll show this message in the console
dot log and if we got any errors so in
that case will you use no we have to use
differently so which is of type yeah you
could see here if we got a if we get any
error while login then we'll simply say
error error login logging logging in
error log in Inc
so you could say anything header error
or you could say users cannot log in due
to some errors so this message will
appear in the console if we get any
error and also I will pass a error
optional parameter now this will run our
anak app login method as you could see
here I have the registration part in
this file this dot firebase dot fourth
create user with email and password but
now I am logging login my login and now
I am showing how to how to login in our
ionic app using firebase so this is the
way which you could use to login a user
now we'll hit safe and we'll run this
application now to see whether it works
or not
ionic lab this command will run on ionic
lab so after seeing this I will show you
how to create an alert controller after
logging in successfully and how we can
navigate to another page but first we
need to see that our application is
working fine or not we have to check it
so hope it is clear so far we have
import angularfire auth and we have
taken a parameter inside the constructor
and we have used that parameter to sign
sign in with email and password and we
have simply passed two parameters the
using value and password name and
password so after it returns a promise
and simply we are showing in the console
if we get any errors then also we are
showing in the console so this command
yeah I'll say no here it is asking me to
update my eye on ik c li plug-in but I
don't want to update it now so I I said
no this will run our ionic app so we
have to wait for some time this might
take some time to get compiled so till
then I will show you the documentation
part which I have shown you in the
earlier videos so this alert controller
we are going to create now in the later
part of this video when the user
successfully logged in and also will
navigate to another page as I have said
you earlier so if you forget to watch my
previous video on firebase
authentication with ionic 3 then do
watch it because you don't understand
this video ant in unless you watch that
video you have to watch that video to
understand this video because I have
shown you the registration part of a
user in that video and this is the part
2 this is the continuation part of that
video you can see here a replication is
ready and soon it will be launched on
the browser the I it is running now you
can see here I have already selected I I
phone platform so it it is it runs only
on iPhone you could select Android and
Windows as well login and we'll give
moosa first of all I will open my
console
see the result see the promise and also
I'll open my firebase die goat yeah and
I will give say my password which I have
given while registration now you can see
here user logged in successfully I have
clicked login here button and I will
show it again now this time I will show
you Musa I did gmail.com is the user
which I have used while registration and
I am also giving the password when I
click login here button yeah you can see
a user logged in successfully and also
we are getting the data so this data
from the firebase we are getting this
data and I will show you the user
details are available on our firebase
authentication dashboard
I have changed my account so I will open
it using different account so you can
see here our application is running fine
and it is working fine yeah this this
was my project which I have created
earlier and I will show you the user
with the Moose alert ad yeah you can see
a moose I did gmail.com is the user
which I have registered while
registering into this app using this
form register form now I have logged in
using this form and we are able we are
able to
login into the into the ionic app using
firebase authentication now I will show
you how you can create alert how you can
create an alert controller on the
success message import alert controller
from ionic - angular so this alert
controller should be passed as a
parameter inside the constructor public
alert controller of type alert
controller so this method is used to
create an alert controller and after
displaying the message in the console
let alert equals to this dot alert
controller dot create this method will
create the alert controller with the
title we have a ionic documentation you
can see here yeah we have seen here that
we'll just copy this all options
title/subtitle and button and we'll
paste it here
this method new user we will delete this
message subtype they will delete the
subtitle message and we'll show only
array subtitle and okay button and we'll
present
is alert dot present this method will
show will show the alert controller on
our screen so on the positive promise
value this alert control the select
controller will be shown on our page and
after showing this alert controller and
a disk dot Nass controller dot push to
homepage homepage as we don't have
homepage import statement here so we
have to import home page homepage from
from here you can see here from single
quotations - the dot dot home slash and
we'll sit safe what we are doing here is
when the user successfully logged in we
are just showing elect we are just
showing an alert controller and then we
are navigating the page to the home page
now we will see our application it is
building now live freeloading we have
saved all changes and also oh I hope it
is clear so far
and hope you are understanding about the
registration and the login part using
ionic 3 with firebase authentication
when we hit login button and when we
give our username and password
not calm and the password login yeah you
can see here
hooray our alert controller is showing
on the screen and we are navy we have
navigated to the home but home page you
can see here again we got register and
login button so we have seen that how it
is easy to register and login user using
email and password method of firebase
authentication you could also use
Facebook authentication Twitter github
and you could also use anonymous logins
as well using firebase in ionic free
