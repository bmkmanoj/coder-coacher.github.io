from epic op and today I'm going to show
you how to create a responsive carousel
using bootstrap 3 so let's get started
so I have one file here called index dot
HTML and inside this file I have I have
taken a div tag and I have given a class
called carousel slide and I have given
an ID called slider and data write
equals to slider this represents that
this entire div is a carousel div so as
you can see here in the header section
in the head section of this file I have
three elements two elements are of link
and last one last two are the script the
first two links are for the bootstrap
dot min CS and for the style dot CSS
this is the custom CSS file and this
file is for the borscht app tree and
this file script file this is the script
file and in this file I am taking a
jQuery file using CDN so this is a
Google API jQuery file and I have linked
this file in my folder and the last
script file is for the bootstrap dot min
dot J's so this this these are the four
files which have given in my head
section of this file so this is the
carousel div inside this div we are
going to create a responsive carousel
using bootstrap 3 so we will continue
with this firstly we'll take one div tag
and then and we'll give a class called
carousel inert inside this inner
carousel inner div tag inside this
carousel inner element we are going to
take all the items of this Karason so
inside this carousel inert will take one
div tag and we'll
class as item and active as you all know
that the first element the first item
should be active so that is why I have
given active class to this item and
inside this and give another div tag and
then say Kara's and caption so this is a
simple text carousel caption which which
displays along with this item so will
give one head for tag inside this
carousel caption and we'll say bootstrap
3 and we'll take one more P tag in this
carousel caption and will give some
description about bootstrap 3 it is a
design amazing CSS library to create
responsive web pages so this is our
first item and we'll give ID to this
item as slide 1 and we'll copy down this
entire item and we'll paste it down here
one more time so we'll remove this
activeclass as this is the second and
third element third item these these two
are the second and third items so we
don't want these eye items to be active
so we'll change this ID to slide 2 and
this one to slide 3 and we'll save this
so we have taken 3 items inside carousel
inner
after giving these three items we need
to create one unordered list above the
carriage and inner and we'll give class
as carousel indicators this indicators
represents your carousel indicators your
carousel items so inside this carousel
indicators let's take three list items
and give class as I acted the first item
should be active this is the indicator
of your item and the second class the
second list item and the third list item
so we'll give data slide two
this is the data annotations data HTML
and data attributes so we are giving
this HTML slide two equals to zero you
might be wondering why I am giving this
zero here because it works like an array
it starts with zero the first item
should be zero and the second item will
be one and the third item will be two
like like this it is it will go it will
goes on so the data slide two would be
the zero for this first element or the
first item and we'll copy down this data
slide to this list items and the change
is to 1 and this should be two
so after giving these all things let's
give the buttons the previous and the
next burdens of carousel where we have
to give that burdens right we have to
give that buttons below this carousel in
a distant let's say anchor tag and give
this as slider a chip I forgot to give
your target data target data target
should be the data target should be the
you should be the carousel as you can
see here I have given ID called slider
to the main carousel div tag so this
should be the data target for all the
list items which is present inside the
carousel indicators so copy down this
data target attribute and paste it down
here and here as well let's save this
and let's move on we'll give a class and
we'll say left carousel control as this
elements work like works like a controls
for your carousel for the prevail and
for the next item it works like a
carousel control so you have to give
carousel control boo carousel control
bootstrap 3 class this all classes are
both step 3 classes which you need to
remember while creating responsive
carousel so let's take another anchor
tag after this but before that let's
take a span tag inside this
anchor tag icon preview this depends
that this is the previous button in your
carousel copy down this anchor tag and
paste it here for the next element and
change this to right as this represents
the next element in your carousel inner
in your carousel slider change this to
next next save this and we are almost
done here and we need to check for we
need to check what we are forgetting
here so let's go to this file I have a
code here in my file and as you can see
here we have given oh l carousel
indicators and we have give class as
well data target data slide to these all
things we have given so after giving
this will check the carousel inner part
we are all done and we are forgetting
this one data slide data slide and the
role should be button to these anchor
tags we have to give this attributes
data slight previous and the role should
be button and to this next element we
have to give data slide equals to next
and the role should be obviously button
let's save this file and let's talk to
the browser and we'll see will it work
or not no it doesn't work because we
have we haven't seen a CSS here we need
to give CSS I have style dot CSS file
and we need to style this carousel using
CSS so we'll style this corrosion in
this file called style dot CSS firstly I
am going to take slider and inside this
slider ID I have item
inside the class item I will take the
height the height of the item should be
400 pixels in my case as you can take
anything you could take 500 results as
well it's it is your wish but I am
taking 400 pixels for the height of this
item and will refresh this no still does
not work we need to give slide one no we
need to take the ID of the each element
which we have taken here once again I
will show you as you can see here I have
given slide one the idea of this item
slide two idea of this second item and
slide three the idea of the third item
so this idea is you need to take here in
your CSS file because I am giving the
background images to these items so I
have images present inside my images
folder one dot jpg and I will say center
no-repeat let's save this and let's off
to the browser and we'll refresh as you
can see here my carousel is ready now
the first element is ready now let's see
if the images to the next item we have
given the background image to the first
item only and we haven't give any
background image to the next items so
firstly I'm going to take the slider ID
and I'll take the margin-top attribute
and we'll say 60 pixels and we'll save
this and we'll refresh this as you can
see here I have given a margin of 60
pixels to this entire carousel and we'll
copy down this idea and paste it here
and we'll change this to slide 2 for the
next item for the second item slightly
for the third item and we'll also change
these images will say to dot jpg and
three dot jpg and we'll save this and
we'll hit refresh yeah it is working it
is still not working because I have I
forgot something here while giving
indicators it seems like that firstly we
need to check what we are doing wrong
here in index dot HTML file carousel
caption yeah for the font size of the
carousel caption terrible caption are
the font size will be 18 pixels to put
break anything let's refresh this
refresh it again let's inspect this
element in the browser itself that our
changes are implementing in the browser
or not we'll check this one and yeah it
is working font size is adding pixels
for this carousel caption yeah our
carousel is working fine as you can see
here we need to remove this slider ID
from this and we need to refresh it
again you can see here this is the first
item and yeah it is working but the
second image is not working oh I have
given one wrong image here as you can
see here in my images folder which I
have opened here not in this folder I
will show you this is my folder time
script and inside this I have one folder
called images
I have three images one three and more
dot jpg so I forgot to give the correct
name of the image I have given too but I
was wrong the actual name of the image
was the actual name of the image is
lolled or jpg let's save this and let's
hop to the browser and we'll refresh it
again and we'll remove this ID from this
URL and we'll refresh it again and we'll
see no it is not working still not oh
yeah it is working now the third item is
displaying on the browser this is the
third and this is the second and this
one is the first item and we will see it
is is it responsive or not and will
minimize this browser to the mobile yeah
it is a responsive carousel you can see
here it is working fine
and it is a responsive karagin the text
is also responsible because I have given
only alien pigeons you could use media
queries in your case to reduce the font
size of this carousel caption the images
are responsive and the carousel is
working fine I hope you understand about
