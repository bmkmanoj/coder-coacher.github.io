video and this tutorial is on entity
framework code the basics of entity
framework or so let's get started so
this is the project template which is
asp.net web application and in this we
are going to select the web application
and this is our agenda we are we going
to talk about dotnet framework encore
asp.net code and visual studio let's
move to the next slide which is ndd
frame of course let me give you the
brief introduction of entity framework
or entity framework or is a popular data
access technology for all dot net
applications it is completely
cross-platform it runs on all operating
systems like Windows Linux Mac and we
can get started with it and we are going
to talk about the add mike migrations
and we are going to talk about the
model-view-controller and in this video
we have creating a demo application on
list of contacts and we can edit and
delete them too and these are this is
the source for is for entry framework
code and which is docs dot h p dot net
so this is the entity framework or
agenda we are going to talk about the
model and fields connection strings my
initial migration and additional
migrations controllers and views and
migration is three and snapshot and
we're going to see about the entity
framework or here we can see the
pictorial representation of entity
framework and the latest version of
entity framework core and this is the
diagram
and this is the object relational map
let's move to the next slide which is
database-driven web applications when
user eyes for a replica web application
it asks for the web app in the internet
on the internet it maps to the ORM ORM
maps to the database so this is the
startup dot CS configuration class in
this we have two main methods which is
configured services and configured we
gonna talk about this third class later
in this video let's move to the next
slide which is the properties of the
application you can select the platform
like dotnet framework and dotnet core
they both are available and you could
also choose the clr type while debugging
in the ISS Express section this is the
demo so let's move to the application in
this video I am going to show you how we
can create a list of contacts first
firstly i'm going to create model of
contact class in this class I'm going to
add four properties which is ID force
name last name and phone number and I
have already created my database context
which is detail context so in this
database I have created to database sets
one is for contact class another is for
sign up we are going to talk about this
contact model today so firstly we are
creating our list of contact using this
create page so this is the form you can
add list of contacts to this application
in this application using this create
page
this is the first name you need to enter
last name and the phone number and this
is the submit button it could redirect
you to the detail controller in this
create action you can see it here if
model stated is valid not I am including
this nod because this contact model has
ID in it which is required field so it
is mandatory to include this not before
the model state dot is valid otherwise
it won't create a list of contacts it
won't enter this if statement enter in
this if statement so I am going to add
this contact model and I'm going to save
changes this is important after updating
deleting or doing anything to database
you need to save changes to the database
and I'm redirecting to my action which
is index and in this index page i'm
going to show you the list of contacts
which is present in our detail contacts
database so these are the two pages this
is the index page it will show you the
list of contacts let's move to the
delete page you can delete a particular
contact by giving the information like
first name last name and phone number
this form is purple in color because
these are tagged helpers which are entry
which was introduced in asp.net core one
point oh and let's go on to edit page
you can edit a particular contact
details using this page which is edit
page and you can see I am including the
Model Model aggregate model for stage
speaker which is our application name
dot models.com tact and I am leaving the
title of these pages edit contacts and
using this form I am going to edit some
particular contact in our list so let's
run this application it is running on
localhost 52 double 94 let me show you
the startup dot CSS not CS I'm sorry
startup god c.s it is if you want to get
started with entity framework or first
you need to add dependencies in the
project dot Jason folder these are some
dependencies you should include before
getting started with entity framework or
this is the microsoft microsoft at
entity framework co dot sequel server
and dots equals or what not designed or
tools these are some dependencies and
this is the tool for entity framework or
so you need to include before getting
started and after this you should
include some services in the configure
method in startup dot CS class this is
the connection string this is very
important because without this you won't
be able to access your database this
connection string you can find it in the
sequel server object explorer from here
this is the connection string and as you
can see i have created two models to
databases one is for contacts and
another is for signup and this is the
entity framework migration history means
it consists of the history of migrations
which we did it amer in our application
so let's
give the controller name it will show
you the contacts which is present in our
database the idea is 3z three double
zero three and first name is a member
then last name is Seth Wyndemere and the
phone number is triple one let's edit
this contact details using edit three
double zero three is ID first name is
saya mammoth saith on Mir and I want to
change this number two this is triple
one and i'm going to change this number
two one two three four so let's edit
this I have put some break points here
so we need to continue in a stepwise
manner yeah you can see we can edit this
particular details of particular contact
using this edit method edit action lets
you can add some more contact to your
list using this add action first name
last name phone number let's delete this
particular contact which is present in
our application said mammoth give force
name as same MO saith on the maid and
the phone number is 1234 yeah delete
this
continue continue continue yeah you can
see it is completely deleted from our
list so this is up all about the demo
application using entity framework or in
MVC and let me show you some references
these are some references for entity
framework or in asp.net core so go
through with that hopefully you did
