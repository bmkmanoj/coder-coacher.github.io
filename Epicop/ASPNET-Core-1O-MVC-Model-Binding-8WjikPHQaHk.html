today I'm going to show you model
binding in asp.net core 1 point 0 so
let's get started basically model
binding allows you to pass data from
your web page to the methods you know in
your controllers so muddled binding
consists HTTP requests that HTTP request
contains two things that is the route
data and another another is data values
route data consists of actions and
controllers which you are seeing here
some of you may not know about
controllers and actions so for them i am
showing how a controller looks like an
an action also you can see here this is
a controller detail controller in this
way basically these controllers are the
classes only but you need to put
controller at the ending as you can see
a detail controller it's mandatory it's
a rule of asp.net it inherits the
controller class based controller class
in this controller you can write your
action methods you can see here these
are some action methods this is a create
action method which I have defined here
this method is for HTTP GET request not
for the post request this action method
is for the post method post request HTTP
POST they both are different you can see
here this is the action method if you
want to call this action method force
you need to give the controller name in
your HTTP request in the URL then you
can define your action name
then only you can access this create
page so let's get started with the model
binding in MVC in asp.net core 1.2 mb c
i'm going to show you how to create a
model right click on this model folder
add new class not new item models are
the classes so let's give some name
called customers
you can see here in this model I would
like to create some properties so this
way you can create properties it is a
shortcut to create properties type prop
in your visual studio editor and tap
double tap you can see here this is the
feature of visual studio ID and take
integer here as a data type now let's
take name let's take another property
called email in my earlier video videos
I have shown you how to create
properties and how to validate forms as
well in asp.net core 1 point 0 using
data annotations so if you forgot to
watch my previous videos and be sure
that check out my previous videos
contact this is a new property so i have
created for properties in the model
class here that is customers ID name
email and contact so i want to give data
annotations here as a required one so
the required class will not be inherited
because that class that using statement
is not included at the top of the page
you can see here so it is giving an
error so control dot you can see some
suggestions here quick suggestions at at
last you can see here using
system.componentmodel dot data
annotations so right click
that there're has gone this way you can
include the server-side data annotations
to live to validate your properties
let's give required attribute data
invitation to the name as well name
property as well these all properties
are required in my case it depends on
you I am NOT taking the ID as a required
one as we are not dealing with database
here it might give some issues while
running or or compiling our application
so it's better not to take required
attribute to ID property I am going to
save this model and I would like to
create a view page for this model in the
views folder here I would like to create
a view for the customers
and receive you page you can see here i
would like to give name of the view page
as customers dot CSS HTML the extension
is CSS HTML because it's a razor file
you can see here at the rate and curly
braces represents razor so this is the
powerful feature of asp.net MVC if you
want to know more about razor then visit
asp.net documentation you can get lot
more stuff about razor and all other
stuff regarding asp.net MVC now i would
like to call my model here which i have
created just now that is customers you
can see here and now i would like to
create a form here
a speed controller the controller would
be detailed
and asp action would be customers this
is the form which we are creating to
pass the data from this more from this
form to the method in this controller
widget which I haven't created yet
firstly I am creating this form to bind
our model this customers model so method
would be obviously post and the role of
this form will be from inside this form
I am going to take a div tag and let's
say asp validation somebody equals to
model only and inside this form let's
take div tag and let's say farm group
inside this form of this form group is a
class of a bootstrap it's a predefined
class in a bootstrap library so just you
have to call inside this form group I am
going to take label sp4 equals to name
you can see here the visual studio is
sensing the property names of this
customer customer small you can see here
I'll show you once again if i type and a
it is suggesting me that is the name
property of customers model which we
have created here so this is the
powerful feature of asp.net core 1.2 mb
c this feature is also available in the
previous versions of asp.net core which
was the beta version and let's call
bootstrap class here control label
column sm2 after this label tag i would
like to take another div tag and let's
say column sm the remaining 10 columns
as some of you might not know about
bootstrap classes why I am taking this
classes this is the column class and
this is for the small devices and this
is to this tag is telling that we are
taking two columns on small devices so
there are basically four types of
devices in bootstrap access means extra
small sm in small md means medium and LG
means large large devices when taking
SMS for small devices in a row there are
12 different columns so
I am dividing equally not equally i am
dividing those columns firstly i am
taking two columns for label and the
remaining 10 columns will be for the
input field let's take a SP for name the
name property let's save this and let's
take this form group here copy down copy
one more time time because we are having
three properties so delete this last
form group as we are having three
properties let's type email this label
is for the email model email property in
model this way you can bind your model
to the web page to the view page I
forgot to mention the class of input
fields the class will be form control
let's copy the same class to other input
fields as well copy here and paste it
here and here also we have taken name
email and now take contact
contact so this is the view page of
customers page and now let's jump to the
controller and let's create an action
method for the customers view page
scroll down here let's take public as
the action methods obviously will be
public let's say customers here is one
thing you will need to keep in your mind
while creating action methods firstly I
would I will return view if you are
creating an action in any controller you
have to give the name which you are
giving to your view page you can see
here customers dot CS HTML you can see
here this customers or CSS tml is the
view page name so this name you should
give in your action method action name
so it's mandatory in asp.net MVC it's a
standard you need to follow this role so
this is the view page and let's say HTTP
GET so HTTP GET is an action verb which
basically defines HTTP request either it
is a get or it is a post there are two
types of HTTP action verbs get and post
basically these are the two most
commonly used action verbs get in post
so this action is for the get request
and I would like to create another
action method
for the post request customers
later on view semicolon you can see here
rats will be you can see because we have
to same actions if we put if we give
HTTP POST here then and that error will
be gone you can see here still it is not
working by giving HTTP action work you
need to give or you need to change
something here that is alloy and now
anonymous attribute here you can say
validate anti forgery token this way you
can give
redirect this is also a another feature
of asp.net MVC is proud net for MVC type
controller already defines customer with
the same parameter type it is telling
that we are we have to same actions in
this detail controller customers let's
scroll up and let's see if we have any
customer action now we don't have
customers
let's see how we can get out of this
issue because it is giving issue let's
save and I was telling you about the
redirect to action if you want to
redirect to some action called index
let's suppose index if the user submits
your form from the view page and instead
of showing the view page like in like
this way if you want to redirect to any
other action then you can use this
redirect to action and in this method
you can say in X so this will redirect
you to the index action method let's run
this application
I got the point why we are getting this
issue in the customers class let's give
customers it is giving that we are
having two issues here we need to fix
let's take customers because customers
there is gone now the mistake which I
was doing here I was not passing the
parameter in this action method we need
to pass the parameter of a model class
here you can see so that is gone now
let's return the view and now if the
user submits the form from the view page
i would like to validate that form using
this way model state dot is valid if the
user has successfully entered all the
fields then I would like to take one
temporary message in the view back
called congratulations congratulations
you have entered
correct details put semicolon at the end
this is the view back they say this is
the dynamic property you can store
temporary data in this dynamic property
if the user enters all the fields then
the user submits the form then this
action will be executed this action will
be called if the user posed the data
through the form so if the user enter
all the fields of a form then i would
like to display this temporary data on
my view page here by putting added
symbol you can enter into c sharp if you
view back doored message not equals to
null
then
display
Congrats what i am doing here if the
user enter all the fields of the form
then i am storing this temporary message
congratulations you have entered correct
details in this view back property and i
am showing and i am displaying this
property on my view page that's it so
this way you can bind your MVC model to
the view page and you can display the
messages after the summation of a form
let's run this application now and let's
see how this application will work till
then I would like to show you my
personal blog there is that geek m dot
tech blog follow me on this blog I used
to post each and every update each and
every post regarding asp.net and other
stuff of MVC you can see here I have
some post on my homepage that is view
back view data tembe de and session in
asp.net MVC and i have given the
detailed description here along with the
code you can see here so follow me on
this block and drop your feet and drop
your feedbacks in the comment section
below and let me know how I can improve
myself while coding or while explaining
you
and I have also given my YouTube
tutorials tutorials along with this
explanation part this helps you to
understand in a better way so follow me
on this block our application is running
now let's see this will work or not I
forward to give the submit button here
let's take input let's say type
submit value submit and let's call
bootstrap class that is button button
success this is the homepage this is the
index page if you want to go the
customers page then like I said you have
to give your controller name and your
action name our controller name is
details and our action name is customers
you can see here named Syed email sayyed
moussa you can take say it musa a direct
email com contact number as one two
three four five six five six let's
submit this application submit this form
you can see here Congrats if i enter if
I submit this form if I pose this form
then it is going to this action that is
HTTP POST create action customers action
in this it is storing that
congratulations you have entered the
correct details this message I am not
displaying on my view page I am
displaying only congrats that's why it
is showing comrades here if you want to
display this entire information entire
line then you can display by removing
this contract Congrats view back not
message let's save and let's refresh the
browser continue you can see here
congratulations you have entered correct
details if I pose the form then it is
validating the forms and let's see
without filling all the fields I am
trying to submit this form without
filling a field
it's required it is not getting
submitted to the post action it is not
posting your form to the customers post
action method this way you can bind your
model to your view page and you can
display a temporary messages if the form
if your model is being submitted so hope
