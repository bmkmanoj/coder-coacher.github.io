Musa column from epic op and today I'm
going to show you
loading controller in ionic 2 how you
can use the loading controller on the
button click on or some event how you
could use that I will show you in this
video so it's like a spinner and then
you you can see here when you click the
button will use that spinner in this
application in this ionic project ionic
2 project so I have the button here I
have created this button let's go ahead
and we'll give the click event to this
button and we'll name that and we'll
give the method name a start page it's
safe let's hop to the typescript file
and let's scroll up first as you can see
here and basically I want to redirect
the user to the basic or to the for
start page which is my home page or
which is my first page of this which is
the first page of my application the
start page when the user clicks the
button this button which we have seen
just now this button let's go ahead
button and the user clicks this button
we will be redirected to this start page
so before that I I will show you the
loading spinner when the user clicks
that button so for that we need to
import loading controller
loading controller from ionic angular so
this is the import statement for the
loading controller so after importing
this loading controller you need to us
pass this loading controller you need to
pass it as a parameter in the
constructor public loading controller
which is of type loading controller so
as you can see here I have passed the
parameter inside this constructor so we
have imported this loading controller in
home dot TS and finally we will create
the start page method
inside this start page method because we
have given the event here the click
event and the user sub when the user
hits this button this method will get
called so let loader equals to this dot
loading controller dot create sorry so
we have different options for loading
controller the first which I am going to
take a risk Pinner and I'll pass as
bubbles the spinner will be in the
bubble form it's like the SVG form the
spinner form is a CG form you could give
anything I'll show you later what kind
of spinners you could use in your ionic
project so I have given bubbles here and
we have another option called content
and we'll say that awesome and the final
option is which I am going here is three
thousand three thousand means three
seconds
let's give semicolon let's end this
loader part and after shading give
loader dot present this will present the
loader on the page so in the start page
method I have created one loader and I
have taken three attributes of this
loader the spinner the content and the
duration you could also take the other
attributes like CSS class and we have
different options for this loader and
I'll show you in the later part of this
video so firstly we will see that loader
is
loser will be presented on the screen
and after that this dot
NASA control dot push to the start page
this will push to the start way let's
save these two files and let's run this
in the browser or on ionic lab our next
serve - L this will run your ionic app
on anok lab so you could test on all
three platforms like I said in my
previous videos if you forgot to watch
my previous videos then visit my channel
epic op and you can explore my ionic 2
tutorial series playlist on my youtube
channel and please don't forget to
subscribe my channel share my videos
with your friends so is running now you
can see here so hope you understand
about the loading controller which I
have created and I'll show you the
different types of spinners for the
loading controller you have to visit
this documentation ionic framework calm
slash talks or slash API components
loading loading controller and I'll
provide this link in my video
description you can get this URL from my
video description you can see our
application is running you can see here
we have different kinds of spinners iOS
dots bubbles circles crescent the
default one and you could also create
your custom loader spinner as a loading
spinner as well like this and if you
don't want to show any image or the icon
then only then you can also create the
today's loading spinner our application
is ready on the first page I have the
slider so we need to yeah this is our
button and then we click this is showing
it up in the bubble form and if we
change this to iOS if we save this then
we can see the loading spinner will be
like the iOS spinner like can see here
the iOS spinner so you can create your
loading spinner like this using CSS or
using some mage this is this will be
your custom loading spinner but the
predefined loading spinners are these
you can see here so you can also improve
this documentation and github you can
see here we have different kind of
loading options you can see here the
spinner which we have used in in this
project the content CSS last like I
mentioned before you can give your
custom CSS class show backdrop whether
to show backdrop or not it is set to
true by default enable backdrop dismiss
dismiss on page change and the duration
so these are loading options you can
explore this on the ionic framework
documentation so we'll see the loading
spinner now probably we will see this
loading spinner in iOS form yes you can
see here it looks beautiful and the last
one we'll use is we are going to use is
the dots
dot loading spinner it's it will be like
in this form hope it is clear so far how
you can create loading controller or the
loading spinner in your ionic 2
application you just need to import the
loading controller from ionic angular
and you just and after that you need to
pass the parameter inside your
constructor and then you can create one
method which will be the even for the
button or for anything you would use
anything I have used button in my case
and I have given the even method and
inside this even me that I have created
one loader and I have presented in
presented this on my screen and I am
finally redirecting this to the start
page so we'll see now the dots loading
spinner
it is still running it might take some
time
yeah it is still running we have to wait
for this until it is completed
it is ready now we'll hop to the last
slide and we'll click this button here

the dots form so I hope you got this and
