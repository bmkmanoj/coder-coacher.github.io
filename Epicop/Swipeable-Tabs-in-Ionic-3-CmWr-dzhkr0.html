I'm gonna show you how to create
swipeable tabs in ionic 3 I have been
researching on this and I got this
finally and I would like to show you how
you can actually create a swipeable tab
in ionic 3 here you can find the
reference on the documentation ionic
framework calm on the documentation
power under API section you can find
these segments here you can see here so
we'll use this segments and also we'll
use ion slides you might have heard
about ion slides and you might have seen
my previous tutorial on ionic slider
so the I'm gonna show you how you can
create swipeable tab using these two
components that is that our ion segment
and ion slide so let me use this ion
segment so here you can see here under
ion header you can see ion toolbar and
segment so we'll copy this part and
we'll paste in our application right
under home dot HTML file here below the
ion navbar right you can paste it here
and you can see that it will come under
the header part and on header part and
under ion tool bar you can see ion
segment and ngmodel
it is bind to icons so in my case I'm
gonna find this to page so I'll show you
in the later part of this video how we
are going to bind this ng-model
attribute of n segment with our slider
right so let me change the color of this
to dark right and here you can see we
have three no we have two buttons inside
our and segment and segment button and
value equals to camera and inside this
we have I if you have an icon with the
name camera and for the next button for
the second button that is on segment but
value bookmark and under this we have we
have an irony ionic icon with the name
bookmark so we have these two tabs so we
are going to use these two tabs to see
the to create the swipeable tab in ionic
3 so hope you understand and hope you
you got this how you can use ionic
segment so now we are going to use ionic
slides inside our ionic content right
there is iron content right so let me
use this ion slides right inside this
I'm going to take two slides P as we
have two buttons and segment buttons two
buttons so we are going to use two ion
slide right so inside this I'll use h1
right
and let me say tab one so this is our
tab one so I'm gonna use another slide
for tap two because they have two
swipeable tabs in this application right
so let's change this to tab 2 so these
are my two tabs as you can see here I
have two I have created two segment
buttons and I have created two slides
here let's see and let's let's check the
preview in the browser how it looks it
is running and you can see here the
camera icon and the bookmarks icon are
appearing on the segment button so we
have two sizable taps this is not going
to work because we have not created a
fully swipeable tap so fully swipeable
taps so we have to create it right so
let's jump to the home the TS file and
let's use some decorators here's
decorators here like view child and let
me use this slider part here by
importing slides right so let's say
view child right here we have to define
the available name by by defining by
River by giving hash symbol right slider
so let's save this let's copy the slider
and let's use inside the new child
decorator say that slider of type slides
right and also set the page equals to
zero right by default it will be
selected to the zero zero index of the
slider we have bind this ngmodel
to the page you can see here inside the
HTML file right now let's move down and
let's create a new function new method
right selected tab and let's pass the
index inside the inside this method and
let's say this dot sorry this dot slider
dot and we have a function that is slide
two to the current index right and let's
put semicolon here at the end so this
will slide to the current index to the
selected index let's save this and let's
use this method copy down this first and
let's move to the home dot HTML file and
inside the ion segment button use the
same method right if the user clicks
this button right we are going to use
the selected
tap method and we are going to pass the
index as zero because the first button
is obviously zero in the ad is obviously
at zero at index and the next button is
at the first index the index of the next
button is 1 let's change this to 1 right
so if you want to add more pages in this
swipeable tabs you can create it by
copying this here and let's say the
camera again let's pass the selected
index as two let's change this to camera
and also create one eye on slide inside
the eye on content inside the N slides
right let's change this to a tap 3
because previously we had two tabs now
we have three tabs let's save this and
let's save this two files let's see the
preview inside the browser right how it
is going to look inside the browser
we'll check now right the three tabs are
appearing on the screen and camera
bookmark and the camera again so we have
three tabs
now let's swipe this tabs to see the
preview right right type tab one tap two
and the last one is Tab 3 so hope you
got it and hope you understand about
these swipeable tabs in ionic 3 and I
have more things to show in this video
let me show you the attributes and the
sass variables which can use along with
ion segments so we have some sass
variables here on this documentation
if you really then definitely you can
understand what what what this is all
about right and also we have a bunch of
related methods and functions to use
along with ion segment and ion slide so
here you can find the slide part I am
opening in this in new window and you
can check more methods of ion slide
right it is loading and you can see here
the ion slide right and if you scroll
down then you can find slides API
documentation and you can read more
about it here right
ion slides and you can find yeah you can
find bunch of methods get previous index
is beginning is and we have different
methods so hope you understand about
these five able tabs in ionic three
first you need to create ion segment and
on toolbar in the ion header so you have
to define the number of tabs first how
many tabs you are going to use inside
your application then you need to define
the number of slides according to that
segment part under the ion content part
then you need to jump over then you need
to move to the former TS file there is
type script file and you need to import
two things the first one is view child
and the next one is slides you need to
create a view child decorator with the
name of slider and you need to define
the page zero and the selected tab and
you need to pass the index then it will
slide to the correct index to the
current index
hope you understand about tribal tabs in

date about ionic 3 and a lot of cool
stuff is there on my channel please
