going to take a look at action sheet in
ionic 3 so I show you how you could
create an action sheet in ionic 3 and I
will show the basics of action sheet how
we can design and how we could use that
so let's get started this is my project
and inside my project I have my home dot
HTML file so inside this file I will
create a button to show or to present an
action sheet but before that I'd like to
create an action sheet before calling it
so let's jump to the home dot ts file
and we'll create a method called show
action sheet this method will present
the action sheet but before that we need
to import action sheet from ionic
angular by tapping by typing action
sheet controller so this is the
controller for action sheet from ionic
angular this statement or this import
statement will bring the action sheet
controller and you can use it inside
your app the we need to pass the
parameter inside the constructor I am
going to make it public public action
controller which is of type action sheet
controller so I'll use this let action
sheet equals to this dot action
controller dot create this create method
will generally create an action sheet
for us and this will create and after
this will call a present method to
present or to display
the actions here on our page so inside
this you can see here is the options
which is of action sheet options and
here you can see the title will be you
could give anything like my favorite
list my favorite list comma and now I'm
going to give buttons buttons are are of
an array it's like an array you could
give n number of options inside your
buttons like for this one I'll show you
this will give the text to your button
I'll give delete and the role of the
button show will be this struct if
destructive comma handler will be of
this handler this hand handler will
handle some action which is performed on
this button so I am going to display a
deleted successfully so I'm going to
display this message and after that I'm
going to create and I am going to create
another button by copying this and
testing the down here and I will remove
this one and I'll save you look you can
remove this role it's not a mandatory
one and I will create another button and
I'll say cancel and the role of that of
this button will be canceled so
we'll change this to cancel and also
will change this message to this one the
button to the button name a canceled
successfully so this is my action sheet
as you can see here I have a title and
burdens which is off tab type array and
I have given I have taken three buttons
inside my action sheet and finally I'm
going to present this action sheet
whenever user clicks the button this
method will get called and our action
sheet will appear on the screen so let's
do it we'll do this one but before that
we'll say this dot action or you could
say action sheet dot present so our
action sheet is ready and we'll go to
the home blood HTML and we'll create a
button for that here button and I'm
going to take an attribute of a on
button block and let's say the click
event should match to your method which
is show action sheet and let's paste it
here and let's say this show action
sheet will be the button so let's save
this and let's run this in the let's run
this on ionic lab by typing ionic lab
enter this will run our ionic app on
ionic lab as you have seen in the
earlier videos of mine so I also I'd
like to show you more about the action
sheet controller you can visit the ionic
framework
commendation and here right in the
component section you have action sheet
so here you can see here I have taken
this one and I have created an action
sheet you can see here title buttons
when you click this one the action sheet
is working on iOS you could also see on
let's say no to this one put see it's in
it it is a native action sheet
controller on Windows you could see here
yeah it is working fine on all three
platforms so this was all about the
action sheet our application is running
now and we it might take some time to
run so we have to wait for this we
forward to give semicolon here so this
is the logic this is the way to create
an action sheet in ionic 3 hope you
understand and hope you got it how you
could create an action sheet and how it
is helpful and also you have a a bunch
of components present here in the
documentation and on ionic documentation
you can see here we have different
options and we have different components
as well there is a separate sections for
icons as well if you want to use icons
then you could visit ionic ons calm eye
on icons calm yeah our application is
ready finally it is running on ionic lab
now we will see that our action seed is
working or not so this is the beautiful
documentation you can
lore about any component and it is
wonderful documentation you can visit
this documentation and you can have some
information about any component which
would like to use in your ionic app so
application is ready if we hit yeah it
is it is showing now you could also give
icons as you have seen here that an
ionic documentation if you click this
button the icons are not showing on iOS
but it is showing on Android you could
see here you could also give icons as
well in your action sheet if you click
this demo source button then you will
find a code for this action sheet you
can see here basic dot HTML pages
tortillas and styles dot s CSS file so
you can explore about you can explore
more about action sheet on ionic
documentation it is the Android platform
and now I will show you on iOS you can
see here it is working and it gives a
native functionality it is it looks like
a native action sheet controller so hope
you got it and hope you understand about
the action sheet controller in ionic 3
hope you liked it please subscribe and
share my videos and don't forget to
watch my earlier videos on ionic 3 and
also I would like to hear your feedback
