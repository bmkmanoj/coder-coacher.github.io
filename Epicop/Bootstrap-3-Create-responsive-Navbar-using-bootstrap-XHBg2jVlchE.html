to walk you through how to create
responsive navbar in bootstrap and we'll
also see different kind of stuff we can
put in our nav bar so let's create the
navbar using bootstrap
here we can see that we have a Jumbotron
in that container and I'm displaying a
hatch one tag welcome to bootstrap and
after that and show how to create a boot
a responsive navbar using bootstrap in
this pan let's create let's get started
with nav far using bootstrap so this is
the jumbotron and Here I am going to add
a navbar part in our header in the
header tag as you can see i have also
included the comment did navbar part so
let's go and create a div tag for the
navbar part a bar and bar in verse i am
taking the snapper inverse because i
want this nav bar to be in black color
and also i want this nav bar to be fixed
at the top of the page ok let's
dig deeper in the navbar section and
let's create a container inside this nav
bar Dave container a simple container
and let's create another diff and let's
give the class name as navbar header and
abra header is for the heading of the
navbar under this navbar head I am going
to create an anchor tag hrf will be a
default hashtag this one and this class
should be the navbar brand if you want
to give your company brand logo you
could give using this anchor tag and
using this nav bar brand class you can
give your company logo or your company
name in my case I am giving epic op as
my channel name is a pickup so this is
the neighborhood in which we have
created a navbar brand called epic op
before this anchor tag I will create a
button and I will give the class of the
button as navarrete organ as this snap
bar is responsive we are going to create
is a responsive navbar we should give
the navigable class and the type of the
button should be the button
and data toggle should be collapse
and the data target should be the
targeted navbar and give here navbar
I'll create this data target ID in the
later part of this video I will show you
so we are done with the button tag this
is the collapse button in the mobile
view which we can see later under this
container I am also going to create
another div tag hold collapse navbar
collapse and inside this collapsible
life bar I am going to create a pun tag
or a simple element
let's take as UN or unordered list let's
give the class as nap nap pod nap inside
this you an unordered list I am going to
take some list items and also i want to
give give this list item class as active
let's give the name as what you can see
for copy this link paste it down here
copy it again paste it and one thing I
am forgetting here to include is inside
this button tag I have to specify the
span tag which is for icon bar
that's our only let's close this pan tag
copy the span tag paste it down here
three times so this is the navbar so
let's run this application in the
browser let's preview this I'll look
yeah it looks good let's take this
pantac in the center in the jumbotron
copy this class tech center using this
txt enter class you can make the text in
the center of the page it's changes to
h3 copy this paste at the end of the
span tag change the span tag to hesitate
ask for now it looks pretty good let's
say in these names also about us and
let's take this name as OVR I am taking
this as a dummy content you can take
according to your wish contact change
this and refresh the browser as you can
see i have included the class active to
all the list items which is not
necessary here only give the active
class 21 list item default lee will take
say if it and refresh the browser you
can see here active our first list item
is active so it is showing in a dark
black color so let's minimize the
browser you can see here
our neighbor is now ready so this is all
about the Napa using bootstrap you can
also include the farm down here let's
take firm and roll as search and the
class should be the navbar far and let's
take a diff inside this form and give
them class of that diff as a form group
inside this form group I am going to
take the input tag here let's do it
again tap
placeholder for this input tag should be
the search save this I have close that
tab called nav bar down here for nokia
save it and you can see here we have
included the certs form in the nav bar
so if you want to change the color of
the nav bar to the default one so you
have to change this class name to
default and see here it is showing in a
white color instead of plaque if you are
using inverse class then you can see the
nav bar color will be black so and I
also want to include a source button
inside this form under the nav bar so
what we have to do is inside this form
group take a button tag and leave the
class name as button button primary this
is one of the class of buttons search
let's give the name of the button as
search in see here it is showing that
the form is along with the burden so
this is all about the nav bar which you
can create in bootstrap and this is the
response if navbar hope you liked this
