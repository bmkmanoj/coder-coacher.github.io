second tutorial of CSS grid and in this
video I'm gonna show you some features
of CSS grid like fraction units and the
repeat function out of it and min/max
function and the last but not the least
that is implicit rows so today we are
going to see these things in this video
right so I have a simple container I
have a simple grid and I have six items
inside my grid these are great items and
if you take a look at style or CSS I
have a simple CSS that creates a simple
grid which I will show you here right
the container display grid and the
display template columns so these are
all things so let's save it and let's
see the preview inside the browser so
here how it looks so I have given
template columns the first column the
width the width of the first column is
100 pixels and the second one is set to
auto and the last one is 100 pixels and
I have defined two rows inside the grid
and there are 50 pixels the height of
these two rows are 50 pixels as you can
see here and the grid gap is 3 pixels so
here we can see how we can use the
fractional units and the repeat function
to do style our CSS grid right so even
you can see if you shrink it the first
and the last one are hundred pixels wide
and the the middle one is set to auto if
you make it large right then you can see
here the difference between these two
columns this is 100 pixels wide and this
one is auto right so I don't want this
to be auto but I want this to be
responsive so what we need to do here is
we need to define the fractional units
inside the grid template columns right
so let's say 1 + R 1 F R + 1 F R it
means that you want equal columns
regardless of the width of the container
right when you save it and when you see
inside the browser
then you can see here this all are equal
regardless of the container width when
you make it large or when you make it
when you string it then you can see here
these three columns are equal because of
this fractional unit and you can see
here the grid template rows the height
of the row is 50 pixels we have two rows
defined here these two rows are
implicitly defined right if we add some
more grid items inside this container
then the the height of the rows may be
varied right so I'll show you the I'll
show you in the later part of this video
how you can define Auto rows inside this
grid so let me use the repeat function
here so these are this is the way you
can define the fractional unit for your
grid template columns so this will take
the equal size regardless of the
container with let me use the repeat
function here so the repeat function
actually takes two parameters right
this is these are the two parameters the
first one is the number of rows or
columns inside the grid and the second
one is the value right let's save it and
let's see the preview inside the browser
you can see here the three columns are
100 pixels wide and you can see the
difference here when you make it to 1fr
it will take
the columns of equal size hands you can
see here right you can also use the
repeat function in the grid template
rows so you need to use the same
function and you need to say the number
of rows you have to and the height of
the rope let's save it
let's see the preview inside the browser
can see here right but we can do this in
one line you might be wondering how we
can do that you can do it easily right
when you inspect it inside the browser
then you can see some
CSS here when you inspect it right I
want I want the
a style of the container so let me
select the container here right so I
have a we have a property called grid
template areas right let me check one
more time here
great
template areas right so we need to use
this function grid template areas to
define the number of columns and number
of rows in one line so let me use it
here below this one grid template areas
it will take the value of rows first
divided by the column value right save
it and comment these two lines the above
two lines write these two lines we need
to comment it
we have committed out write three
template areas so I'll make the screen
large so that you can see properly great
template areas then you need to define
two then you need to give two values
here the first one is the repeat
function of the rows and the second one
is the repeat function or the columns
let's save it and let's see the preview
inside the browser no it is not taking I
think we need to use grid template grid
template I think we need yeah
the function is grid template sorry I
was using wrong function we need to use
creat template only this attribute I was
brought to I was using wrong attribute
inside CSS grid the for the add tip the
correct attribute is grid template so
you you can define number of rows and
columns and the width of the column and
the height of the column in just one
line you can use it in one mind that the
attribute is grid template so all you
need to do is you need to define the
grid template and you need to give the
repeat function of the rows first it
will take the rows value and next one is
the column value save it and let's see
the preview inside the browser
it still looks the same so here you can
do it so hope you got it about
diffraction units
the repeat function so the next one the
next attribute of our tutorial is out of
it so
the next one is autofit right here is
the syntax for all of it I'll use it
here out of it right I'll copy it I'll
copy this and I'll paste it here right
so let me comment out this line grid
template let's switch back to the
original one grid template columns and
template rows so here you can see when I
use out of it
we'll see how it looks it Otto fits 2 1
s are right because we have defined 1
fractional unit it takes the entire size
of the width when you give it hundred
pixels
let's save it and let's see the preview
it takes the hundred pixels only it auto
fills the value or when you make it
large right the items are appearing in
one row you you can see here the change
right the auto fit function auto fits
the value out of its the column when the
screen is getting large or when you
shrink it it just it adjusts the grid
items in two rows right you can see here
the difference but you can use min Max
function if you want the complete
responsiveness the min Max functions
take two parameters the first parameters
is the 100 pixels we can define the 100
pixels and the next one is 1fr so when
you save it when you see inside the
browser when you see the previous ready
browser and then you can understand the
difference
right you can see here it takes the 100
pixels regardless of the screen size
regardless of the container width right
when you make it large you can see here
it is completely responsive and it is
taking minimum 100 pixels but it can
take 1fr right you can see here the
boxes the grid items are adjusting
itself so this is the use of min max
function you need to give two values the
first one is the minimum value and the
last one is the maximum value
and you can see here this is the use of
min max function now let's move to the
knowledge move to the implicit rules the
last attribute of our today's tutorial
is implicit rules you can see here we
have to add some more some more things
inside our rate I'm not really sure
about min Max function because I don't
know much about min Max function I have
used it inside this grid but you can
explore more about it and you can let me
know in the comment section below
because I have not been using this min
Max function in CSS grid this is the
first time so you can more you can know
more about on some blog zones or on or
you can lead some articles right so you
can let me know in the comment section
below and you can see here I have I have
added some more items inside my great
write 9 let me use and base it here
11 12 so we have 12 items inside our
great right 11
and the last one is 12 save it and let's
let's comment out this to this no not
this one
yeah it is okay so we can save it and we
can see the preview inside the browser
as you can see here the rose right when
I Frink
my screen the container size is less now
the two rules the first two rows are 50
pixels the height of these first two
rows are 50 pixels and the third row the
height of the third row and the
remaining rows are less when compared to
first and row because of the implicit
rows we have defined only two rows
inside all where you can see here repeat
250 pixels we have only defined the
higher of the two rows it takes on the
height of two rocks and the remaining
rows are of the height which is the
height of the content right it takes
only the height of the content the
content inside this item so what if you
want all the rules to be equal size of
equal height you need to use one
attribute in CSS that is great
Otto rose right and you can say I want
all rows to be of same height that is 50
pixels so let's comment out this line
and let's see the preview inside the
browser
then you can see here the all rows are
50 pixels the height of these all rows
are 50 pixels you can see here and then
you can define using this attribute that
is great otto rose so hope you got it
