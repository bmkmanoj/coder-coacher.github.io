tutorial I'm going to be talking about
responsive with background image using
bootstrap 3 and css3 so you might have
word about bootstrap 3
it's a popular and famous CSS framework
you can create the responsive web pages
that roll that runs on all type of all
kinds of devices like extra small
devices and small devices medium devices
and on the large devices so these are
the functionalities these are some
dissolve the few functionalities of
bootstrap so in this video I will show
you how to create full with background
image using bootstrap and css3 so let's
get started so this is the first page
this is the histamine page in this I
would like to take one div tag and I am
gonna give a class called row and let's
say one class called background image
it's a CSS class inside this I'm going
to take another div tag let's give the
class name as container so you might be
wondering why I am giving this class is
called row background image and
container so this is the bootstrap class
as some of you may not know about
bootstrap so if you are a newbie I would
like to suggest you to go through with
my previous videos on bootstrap series
that is the introduction to bootstrap 3
and other stuff about the bootstrap so
don't forget to watch my previous videos
on
trap so it's a bootstrap class called
row and it has a default margin left and
right as minus 15 pixels inside this row
I am taking another class called
container this class is also a bootstrap
class and what about this class this is
the background image class this class is
a custom class which we are going to use
in our CSS part for giving the
background image so let's save this and
let's say one hatch one tag here inside
this I'm gonna give a class called h1
and let's say responsive full-width
background image I'm displaying this h1
tag on this HTML page so this is what
this is the HTML part and now I would
like to give the CSS part firstly I'm
gonna take body and HTML and inside this
I'm gonna say margin:0 and padding:0
this margin and padding properties these
two properties gives the full-width page
on our browser so this is the use of
body this is the use of margin and
padding inside the body and HTML tag and
now I would like to take background
image class which I have given in my
HTML page this class inside this class I
would like to call a property called
background image and let's say the URL
part inside this URL part I am gonna
give a URL which I have taken from one
website and let's say another property
called background size so these are some
important properties you need to
remember while giving full with
background image in CSS if you have
given background image with the URL the
background will not work or the
background will not appear in a full
width behavior it it will not be a full
width background so you need to remember
this properties while giving full width
background
this is the main property and another
property is background position this
property centers your image on the page
and let's say background repeat' I'm
gonna give no-repeat this property says
that our background image will be will
not be repeated on the page so these are
some important properties you need to
remember while giving the full-width
background image and also I would like
to give the height of the div tag
this stiff tag because I want to display
the image in a full-width manner so
let's say 100 vh v h is a viewport
height we had means viewport height so
I'm going to take the width of the div
tag the width of the container as 100%
100% and let's save this and open this
page inside our browser true now you can
see here the background is in a full
width manner and the text is given here
and now I'm going to take this h1 tag to
the center of the page as you know that
in bootstrap we have 12 columns in each
row so this row contains 12 columns and
this text is present at the center of
the column at the center of the row so
you can give some other tags like P and
let's say the class of this P has lead
this is also a bootstrap class and now
I'm going to give some dummy text inside
this P tag lorem ipsum let's refresh
this and save this this text is in a
grey color is in the light color so you
can make it in a blue blue or some other
different colors so this way you can
give the full weight background to your
page and you can give any properties any
tags inside this div container so you
need to remember
these important properties while giving
the full-width background image that
that that properties our background
image as this is the obvious one and the
next property is background size which
will be covered and the background
position would be Center Center and the
background repeat' should be no-repeat
and the last two properties are height
and width so hope you understand this
