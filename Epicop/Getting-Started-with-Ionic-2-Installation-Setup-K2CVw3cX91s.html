peacock I am sad Musa column and today
I'm really excited because we are going
to start learning something new and that
is ionic too as you all know that I have
given an introduction part on ionic to
ionic to is a hybrid mobile app
development framework which is built on
top of angular 2 it allows you to create
hybrid mobile apps using HTML CSS and
JavaScript so using the web languages
web technologies you could develop the
hybrid mobile apps which runs on all
platforms that are Android Windows and
iOS so this is the website this is the
official website for ionic if you want
to get started with ionic then this is
the website as you can see here then we
click get started button we have two
options designed with ionic creator and
code with CLI I would like to go with
CLI so before we we get started there
are a few things we need to install and
that things are the first thing is
node.js you have to download node.js on
your local machine if you want to get
started with ionic and this is the
website for node.js node s dot o-r-g and
I would recommend you to download this
version which is version 8.0 point 0
well not don't download this version
download this version this is the latest
version of node.js I have installed
node.js on my local machine so I am NOT
going to install it again and the second
thing is Androids to you as you can see
here Android studio you can download
Android studio from
developer.android.com and here is the
Android studio so after installing
Android studio I would also suggest you
to download
- because when we deal with ionic ass so
we should be able to write the commands
on git bash you can also write the
commands ionic serve ionic run this all
commands in your real skort or shell as
well but git bash I would say this I
would suggest you to use git bash for
those commands so forget bash this is
the website gate SCM comm and finally
the editor which we are using which we
are going to use for creating ionic to
applications and this is the editor
Visual Studio 4 which is available on
code.google.com
so these four things you need to install
before getting started with ionic 2 and
after installing all these things we'll
start with this document that is ionic
framework document so code with CLI part
under this part you can see here you can
download or you can install ionic using
this command what I am going to do is
I'm going to copy this come on and I'm
going to paste it down here on my
command prompt and hit enter in my case
I won't hit enter because I have already
installed ionic NPM node.js all things I
have installed on my local machine so I
am NOT going to hit enter so this is the
command for installing ionic and Cordova
and the second thing is that if you want
to start a new project then you should
use this command called ionic start your
app name and the starter template in
this come on
tabs is the starter template you could
also select blank template as well or
you could also select side menu there
are three different starter templates in
ionic which is predefined in ionic
templates so I have created a new blank
application using this command that is
ionic start and your app name and
starter template which is blank
so after in opt-ins too after creating
your new project in vs code this is my
this is my vs code as you can see here I
have created a simple application in
ionic tow and this is my folder
structure I would I would like to show
you I have created one folder called
vias projects inside this I have created
one project called ionic playground and
this is the folder structure and this
all are the folders in this structure or
in this ionic to folder application
folder these are the hooks and inside
this hook we have read meet or MD file
if you want to get started if you are
newbie
then you should read this file so we are
not going to explore that file now and
these are the node modules and inside
this we have different kinds of node
modules which is not which are not a
part of this video as we are seeing the
installation and the project setup of
ionic 2 so this is the basic
introduction video of ionic 2 and this
we are going we are going to see how we
can get started with ionic 2 as I have
shown you how to install and setup your
project so these are the platforms in in
platforms folder we have two platforms
now Android and Windows and other file
is platforms dot Jason so I I haven't
installed iOS folder inside this
platforms folder now if you want to
install then you could install using
ionic install platform iOS this is the
command ionic install platform iOS using
this command you could also you could
install iOS platform in your project so
we are going to explore the next four
that is plugins and also I would like to
say you about ionic awesome things ionic
provides you the native mobile
functionality being a hybrid mobile app
development framework it does it allows
you to create native functionalities in
your app so we have different kinds of
ionic ionic native plugins so these all
dissolve are the Cordova plugins and you
could also install any plug-in in this
folder so these are the resources and
this is the source file which we are
which we mainly deal in this project
this is the source folder and inside
this holds source folder we have a
folder and inside app folder we have
food we have five different files AB dot
component of TS in ionic app everything
will be considered as a component and
this component will be rendered inside
this module that is AB dot module dot PS
this is the root module of your
application where your application will
start running so this is the file if you
want to add a new page in your app then
you should declare in this AB dot module
dot TS inside the declarations firstly
you need to import that page and after
that you you have to declare your page
inside this declaration attribute which
is present in this ng model decorator so
after declaring that page you have to
also register or you have also declare
that page that include that page in the
entry components which is present inside
this entry components attribute so I
have my I have three pages inside this
project that is home page contact page
and the basic model page so after
declaring this all pages inside a broad
module or TS I would like to show you I
would like to tell you about few things
about I am AB come after component of TS
so this is the main component of your
app and you have to import the pages in
AB dot component of TS file as well and
if you want to use the navigation or the
router in ionic 2 apps then you have to
include all the important things in
these two files that is AB dot component
or TS and AB dot module OTS and these
are the files for styling your app you
should use this AB dot s CSS file as we
are using s CSS means it is a sass file
it is a CSS pre-compile ur so we are we
have to style our ionic 2 apps using
sass so this this was all about the app
folder which is present inside the
source now I'm going to tell you about
the assets inside assets you could store
your images which will be used in your
ionic 2 project and these are the icons
5 icons and the next thing the next
folder which is very important in ionic
2 project structure that is pages the
pages folder contains all the pages
which is present in your ionic 2
application so in my pages folder as you
can see here I have 4 different pages
alert basic model contact and home so
this is the home page and inside the
home folder I have three different files
that are home dot HTML home dot s CSS
and one dot TS type script file so
inside home dot HTML I have my HTML part
and inside home tortillas I have all
those things like mask controller if I
want to use nap controller then I should
import the
laughs controller first and then I have
to assign it to the controller and then
I have assign it to the constructor I
have to pass as a parameter in the
constructor as you can see an ass
controller alert controller all the
controllers I have passed as a parameter
in my constructor and these are dissolve
are the methods which I am using on my
home dot HTML file and this is the whole
dot a CSS file so this file is used for
styling your home dot home page so this
is this or this is all about the pages
so I have all pages inside my project
you can see here I have four different
pages and coming to the last part of
this video that is package dot Jason
this is the important file and this file
maintains all the dependencies all the
new gates packages in your application
this file maintains all the dependencies
of your application and Conflict dot XML
this is the main file while you are
deploying while you deploy your app on
App Store then this is the main file
because when you deploy the app you have
to give the app name where you can give
here and you have to give the
description of the app which you can
give in this description tag and all the
things are important you have to give
your you have to give your email and
also the unique ID your unique ID app
store ID would be here which is present
inside the bridgit tank so this was all
about the ionic to installation and
project setup hope you understand about
this video hope you got this and thanks
for watching this video and see you
again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
