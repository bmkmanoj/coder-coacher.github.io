we will state arrest I'll start showing
my powerpoint so the the intent of this
next one our session is to give insight
to the PMP training plan that we are
planning to start next week and what is
PMP and all the certification
eligibility requirements and in fact
while going through any strengths you
can stop and ask your questions like now
the version is going to be a change from
version Phi 2 version 6 plus you'll be
having lot of doubts in in a forthcoming
ocean what does that change and what is
that any question related to PMP exam
and kind of thing we will use this time
next to 55 minutes or what not
effectively so that you got clarified
with all the doubts that while you more
after or not is it fine okay
so we will show you the I'm showing you
the PPD just go through it and see that
so we'll just stay to start with this
and now this is basically the the
training that we are planning to do okay
the thing that we are trying to do next
week is going to align with the abortion
fight the water version okay now the
version six is going to get launched
from I think precisely on March 26th
2018 so what is in it for you and me is
that now if you write the exam before or
not before March 26 you will be still
continuing to write in the older version
version 5 okay so it is a very important
point you need to know now you need to
decide whether you want to write the
exam in version 5 or you want to let the
version you want to write the exam in
the version 6 it's it's all that you
have to take ok I didn't hurry s joint
high hurry welcome so you can little bit
speak to me yeah
so I you are hearing right sorry ok so
whether you want to write
examine version five other that you want
to write the version that is the Collier
to take okay time Cydia for your chat so
so that is the thing so otherwise there
are some changes they are made I hope
you all know that the changes little bit
changes they have gone they have
increased the number of crosses from 47
to 50 and the same whatever I am showing
you now the right from your integration
interval introduction integration
project management framework in
television management to stakeholder
management same topics the topic has not
been changed they have a little bit
changed about the HR 1 module time
management one in small process and that
they are added one more in integration
management there are some three changes
they have made and otherwise it's all
same only I would say a 85% or close to
85% we can keep it is same you don't
need to worry ok and there are there are
little bit changes have gone ok that I
will tell you as we warned into the
training from next week ok so let me
walk through this PowerPoint and we will
discuss lot of questions posed that ok
we will take about maximum 20 minutes or
even or 30 minutes in the last to ask
for I will throw open the platform for
question-and-answer session I'll be glad
to answer your questions that if you if
you you may have to get clarified in
next one our time okay so so basically
the intent of again coming back to the
same topic the intent of the training is
to make you thorough in the PMO quotient
file and how to implement your reppin
book best practices in your day-to-day
activities of your project that you are
working in your organization and of
course Zarin that will be glad to give
you the 35 hours of PMP certification
and that I want to run with us and the
intent of the training is of course one
of the important thing is that to build
the confidence to take the paint itself
ok so we will give you the confidence to
you like how to take the exam and that
is that's kind of a thing that
guaranteed so you don't need to report
that these are some of the things that
we are
trying to give you and so we will just
cover these topics like PM ISM okay so
don't mean PM Islamists project
management the ISM okay that is
something a topic which was initiated by
the world-renowned author in project
management by V Tameka he okay our IPA
mu l CH way so that is basically she
told a concept like p.m. ISM okay but
that is nothing like if you go to
dictionary if you go and search that is
nothing like a PM ISM it's just the idea
that how p.m. ISM means project
management is a means how you should be
as a project manager if you want to
learn project manager what you should be
able to imagine of a large project for
example I'm telling I'm telling a couple
of points in p.m. some one is that you
should think something big
okay think maybe you're something like a
very massive project that have done
something like palm jumeirah in Dubai
couple of years they constructed their
concerted two more islands or you want
to think of installing a Tokyo Tower or
Eiffel Tower in u.s. so something you
know think something very big that you
do a very large project whether it is an
IT or a conception project or whatever
it is okay so that if you have to think
like that then only you will know what
are all the problems that one could face
when managing the projects whatever the
risk you could face and why are you
assume how you have to manage your
people oh you have to manage things
manage resources so all these things
will surface only in case of a large
project that okay and moreover this
concept of PMP is another thing is that
then the completely the painting model
works on a waterfall model so what is a
waterfall model can anybody shad you all
know right the waterfall model as a
model kind of thing so what is this
waterfall model is done in stages rather
than everything happening simultaneously
everything is staged
there's planning requirement gardening
development QA step-by-step rather than
an agile everything is his in iterations
at the same time caring you do
everything you want small iterations
exact exactly but you don't do it in
whatever model value have a plan like
you want to finish requirement gathering
and scope and you want to go to design
and translation and so on and so forth
absolutely fine
objective so that is the waterfall model
where PMP emphasises okay now here one
point I want to make in version 6 there
little bit introduced the concept of as
a so what they say is how you can tune
to a jail environment every chapter has
gotten brief description about ISIL time
management okay how you manage time
although you are doing a waterfall model
how do so that is I'm just giving a
small gist that is going to happen in
the version 6 okay so now we will see
the some concepts in coming to the slide
so some concepts will see we will see
some process tools and techniques and
will also summarize the learnings of the
module and we will see any question and
answer that week that you may have so
basically of course so you all would
have stated your expectations okay so
please be in touch with the surrounded
people will be glad to meet your
expectations at any cost okay so don't
worry about that and so you can you can
definitely tell your expectation before
the sort of the training with me today
that is really important because I am
going to somewhere I saw will be points
discussed in this next probably fifty
minutes and then I'm going to put a
proposal to surrender them to sada
training probably makes me okay with all
your expectations so so I think anybody
has any doubt about this baby
certification it's a globally recognized
and highly demanded certification for
project managers okay so when you get
this credential that you you prove to
the world that you have a demonstrated
experience in having managed projects
one of the important thing okay so it
definitely
increases your competency level because
it is like something like you know you
you have a tunnel and then or some light
comes with you but you have a clear path
what you need to do next what you need
to do next okay and that is one so that
means you are awareness will increase
second is you become more proactive
because it's all planning most of the
PMP works on planning better planning
and of course it's a bulky document but
still you you you know everything what
is going to happen the next one year one
of your students of time that are going
to work in the project proactively today
itself so that means you are you are
almost certain that how the project is
going to get shaped in the coming months
one of the important advantage of
studying this certification because if
you see this certificate is what what
the I like personally is you have
different topics combined very nicely
very nicely it has been articulated in a
book of Finder pages book for example
you don't get an opportunity to study
stakeholder management you don't get off
and quality management what is audit
what is quality control what do you
maybe verification of results validation
of products or validation of your
results you know you you study
everything in one platform right one how
to say one space called project
management so so suddenly you learn
about something about costing suddenly
you learn about something about time
management you apply some critical path
method you you understand that when I
when I am going to manage a project from
from this particular part are doing
these tasks one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten
there are some bottlenecks there are
some tasks which is going to take risk
this is going to take some time how I am
going to manage what does project
management taught me to manage these
situations where I can able to say
through safely without any issues so
these are some of the things that you
will learn in project management and
these are basically choice of numerous
industries of course the industries
doesn't take the entire PMO concept and
replace all the concepts but they pick
pick and choose when I say
can choose something like tailoring they
say that this is this all the best
methods I would like to take from p.m.
book on applied to my projects and the
fourth point enhances confidence to
deliver a project within time and budget
so that is very very important because
what is a see the last two decades three
decades if you go and see what is a
project statistics say that is one
organization by name Scandinavian I
think out of this they have come out
with the statistics on projects happened
in the last two decades they have told
that only one-third of the project are
successful okay
so the remaining sixty-seven percent of
the projects happened in the world okay
well barenbi successful it was not
successful okay
and in that sixty seven they say that
the thirty-five to forty percent
let's keep forty percent forty thirty
five to forty percent of the projects
failed due to cost and time okay
hey there is a time cost overrun and
there was a time escalated so time got
shoot up and stakeholders were not
interested if the project is not
completed on time okay so time is a very
important precious time precious thing
in any project so you need to complete
on time when you commit to the
stakeholders that I will be completing
the project in this by but this
particular time and of course money is
not a concern but still there are some
projects which got fail the sponsor said
that I cannot able to sponsor beyond
this point so it got terminated so so
please understand thirty-five to forty
percent of the projects have been
failing due to time and cost reasons so
you add forty plus thirty by seventy
five the remaining twenty five got
terminated due to various reasons the
reasons are unknown it could be anything
like there is no need for project mostly
those reasons that means you you start
with the project but soon realize that
there is no need for the project so
those kind of situations have come and
they have terminated the project okay so
here the point I want to mention is can
we reduce this forty percent the project
failed due to
time and cost - 30 20 and 10 and still
the answer is yes okay
provided if you are competent enough to
know other project management techniques
and applied cautiously to your projects
keeping you know the awareness if your
awareness is increases I'm very sure
that you can easily are you you will
have the capability to the handle the
project within the time and the budget
okay of course something will sleep
beyond the torso but that's a different
thing but on and all at a high level you
can definitely manage projects within
the time member there if you know some
proper tools and technique that you can
apply to your projects that's one of the
important point I would like to make you
and it definitely says positively
impacts project - Alvis yes definitely
that is a surgeon demand for the
qualified project managers in the last
ten years and it is going to continue
the next 10 years coming up probably
2030 till 2020 by 2030 there are lot of
that there is a lot of demand for
qualified project managers who are
knowledgeable that is very important not
only knowledgeable they have - they
should have applied those project
management techniques in their carrier
in that in their projects so for those
people there's always a high demand with
the higher salaries okay that's no doubt
in that okay so so I think guys you all
know this requirement right so you
should have 4,000 final hours of project
experience and you know you have managed
some project tasks maybe as a developer
in IP industry maybe as a project site
engineer in a concierge industry you
would have managed some project manage
people and manage things issues risk all
these things stuffs so this 4,000 final
hours roughly will reflect - anything
between 3 end of years - four years of
experience so when you have the minimum
four years of experience solid project
management experience in projects on any
capacity you don't need to be a project
manager you need to be a project lead
any role is fine okay then PMI says that
you are eligible to take up this PMP
exam okay and you also have you need to
have a bachelor degree from
recognized University okay and so that
is one of the important thing and if you
are not having a bachelor's degree if
someone is having a PU below the
graduation undergraduate or a diploma
then they need to have 7000 find out
hours of project madman experience okay
and the most important is you need to
undergo this 35 hours of training from
recognized Institute like xenon Tech the
registered education provider and this
35 hours of certain after the training
that we will give you the certificate
and you need to mention the details of
the training that you've undergone in
your PMI application form 40mp okay and
there are some you can see the last note
the you should not overlap the project
they don't show two projects in the same
time okay try to show in sequence one by
one and you have to take into account
the experience that you have in the last
seven to eight years don't go beyond
2010 2009 and show some old experiences
okay it is not recommended you have to
take the latest experienced projects and
fill in your application form okay so
for details are important when you feel
that the project experience the projects
one is your project name on the project
description second the duration third
the the project the supervisor that you
reported to whom when you have been
working in the project the name of the
person his designation is contact number
these are four or five details are very
important and so that means for every
project that you are planning to put in
the PMI application form now like these
five details
okay so that is very important okay so
let me just break for a minute and I
just want to throw question that so far
any doubts thanks side what kind of
support would would Zarin tag be
providing us and
filling this application again I haven't
I haven't seen the application yet but
I've heard that it's it's a complicated
one and people do require some sort of
support or help so do you guys have any
any process in place or like what kind
of assistance do you provide see what we
are planning to do is what we have been
doing earlier so we just repeat the same
thing we do have some templates where it
can provide you it will help you to fill
our application from first thing second
thing this and the close of the training
say this the 30 hours of training in the
last say two hours or one hour we will
spend time in literally filling the
application form okay so like we'll go
to a somebody sub what I do is normally
in training is I take somebody's login
ID and then go inside so how it has to
be done I like demo will be given to you
so it's a earlier it was very
complicated payment was putting it's
little bit complicated notice they're a
very user friendly and it's very simple
I didn't you hope for example say you
have done appropriate 4,000 find it
hours okay take the first project put
that started and it and describe the
project and put how many hours of
initiating your homonyms of planning
executing monitoring the running closing
you need to split this thousand final
hours into initiating planning executing
wandering utterly and closely so that is
you need to feel that we will help you
how to put according to your project
okay so we so answering Sykes question
that we will give you a kind of a live
demo how to fill an PMI application form
for your PMP exam okay in addition to
some templates will be provided to you
where you can you know fill be your
project details the how was initiating
all those stuffs so that is not a very I
mean yeah
earlier it was very complicated but now
they're made little bit easier
user-friendly so you don't need to worry
about that we'll take okay and yeah as I
said earlier about
two three minutes back I told right that
the five details of the project are very
important so that you need to keep it
ready bTW I hope I have answered your
goes inside yep you got it right yeah
thank you yeah so Flavius any questions
to you with you no I'm okay I'm good for
now okay good so we will proceed with
the thing whenever any question you you
have please unmute and you can speak to
me immediately okay oh yeah so we are
going to have I mean the exam pattern
seen there's no change whether it's a
version six it is going to be 200
questions will be given to you and
mostly it is a computer-based test view
few places they do have this paper base
but let's not bring that let's keep it
that out of scope and you need to you
will be writing in the computer-based
tests at 200 questions will be given to
you and you need to answer one by one
and you can ma air cushion for review
you can come back later and you can
proceed with the rest of the presents
and one of the important point in the
exam yes that 25 questions they put
inside the stone door questions randomly
please understand the word randomly you
don't know which are the 25 questions
these 20 questions are used for
statistical purpose they are all pretest
questions the way you answer p.m. I will
gather information that people from this
region these kind of questions they're
answering like this they take some
survey out of that okay that is for for
them to you know go ahead and ask those
type of questions in the future exams
for four different pop plus actually
okay so that is not important when you
don't need to worry about that you need
to answer as if it is a part of your
exam and that is very well the 25
questions are within the syllabus money
so you don't need to worry if it is
tough
maybe you may end up answering
wrong ah probably because of your you
know you picked a lot of stuff on your
studied will your answer could be right
so don't worry about that no impact for
your marking that they are the questions
which are whether it is right and
supplied by you or wherever it is marked
wrong wrong by you you don't need to
worry that that is not going to count
count for your Mac there's another
important point okay so the 25 priests
has to be sure he included to assess if
these questions can't be into the master
said subsequently this master said this
RI said they will decide based on the
statistics how their people have
answered in a particular region whether
we can take those type of questions to
the master asset and then ask in the
subsequent exams if many people cannot
able to answer then they will drop the
idea of putting in the master set so
they just take some survey out of that
okay and whenever any wrong marking no
negative marks for wrong wrong answers
that have answered okay and one of the
important point is the example is is all
about different groups or digit from
across the globe who hold the PMP
credential so people who are pimply said
wait very experienced okay there are the
people who create the set of question
papers and there are thousands of
questions available in the closing bank
for every abortion and that every time
it gets updated so when you go on to
take the seat for you for you to you
know write the exam you will never know
which caused my probably commit set of
questions will come due okay for every
question set there are answers there are
this previous questions all this stuff
it's structured okay so you can go to
the website
ww-wait auto orgy and you can download
the PMP Handbook the latest one probably
it should be plus six months old
abortion but still it's the latest one
they will update with lettuce
information and you can always learn
something from that it's about some PDF
five twenty thirty pages like what are
the
we'll be great vivia what type of the
Institute offering these kind of courses
all this stuff okay and yeah so this is
all about this training and so any
questions again before going to this DPM
book thing okay so okay let me continue
anyway if any doubts you can always stop
me and ask me cousins so we will go to
this premium book is the fifth edition
that they are going to study because ye
we are insisting on p.m. okay at this
point of timers still we are in number
2017 we do have three months time
December January February for you to go
full fledged for version six ninety days
is a right time for it to crack your
exam okay lot of people take 60 to 90
days to clear the exam 60 days they
finish all the preparation the last
after 60 days they do some revision and
they go and crack the exam so this is
the right time so you can crack this
exam still we are in motion seats
version 5 okay so so you can see here
couple of points about this cream book
okay the paper guide identifies the
subset of the project management body of
knowledge that is it a general
accessible practice and the e-book it is
a distilled version of the project
management body of knowledge okay so
there is another point now the fifth
edition published in January 2013 and it
was effective from eiseley members
except August first I think August 1st
2013
so do you have Christian have you have
you actually reviewed version six do you
do you know what kind of difference we
have like what what piece has got
upgraded like is this a major change or
a minor small okay I do done a little
bit of R&amp;amp;D on the forthcoming version
just to show you couple of points that
in the version 6 is I just
prepared on my own what is that thing so
it's all same for example see this slide
what I am trying to show you here is the
chapter one for example I am just
telling in chapter 1 so it's all same
definitional project project drive
changed it enables business value
creation factors that lead to creation
or project I what I find this that is
about say very few points they have
changed here and there okay
overall it's all same okay like you can
see here factors that led to creation of
project in the earlier question they say
reasons for you to initiate your project
why you want to initiate a project
they gave some seven reasons like legal
reasons environmental resistance
business opportunity strategic me here
they have put the same sound reasons but
under the head different heading or
factors that lead to creation of a
project and they have given some you can
see the first point of definition of
projects projects drive change it
enables business value creation some
points they brought little bit here in
that okay so don't be too very much
about that and going ahead no are you
saying if I if I purchase version five
book I should be fine cuz because I'm
going to college this was the case like
they were authors would come out for the
version pretty much every year but there
wasn't that much context which was which
was different from the older versions so
dreams like it's pretty much the same
thing a little bit of headings there and
they're changed that really doesn't
matter it correctly yeah because you you
may get questions from those small
changes that are made absolutely see
even those from the examination
perspective you're absolutely right but
the main point is what I am trying to
tell you is the the basic content ok the
85% it's all same so I'm just telling
you know let me give a scenario even if
the version six your your can write say
let us say you are trying to write after
March 26 and still you your you're 100%
thorough with version 5 okay
I'm very sure I'm very sure that you're
you're definitely going to get a to the
person if you're under person showed
with your ocean file so that means your
you are already past even if the
question is going to be in version 6 but
you're under person thought oh with the
ocean 5 question 5 if you go and write
the exam you'll definitely cracked X
card but holding is that then there are
some learnings that you need to know
what they are put in version 6 like the
way I told you introduction to RJ they
have given some points how you can
manage our jail whenever managing a
waterfall project so those kind of
learning those kind of external
knowledge will definitely add value to
you personally you understand right
see clearing the examples of different
things you need have value for what you
are you know getting certified for a
particular see you are spending time
effort and all those monies and you need
to have some value for it so in that way
it will help you probably what even what
I tell my the project and community you
want to take user do business I say
first crack the exam in your ocean fight
then go ahead and learn things from your
version six and nothing wrong in that
right so you can still always yeah apply
those techniques that you have learned
in the version five plus you can take
some time and to study things on your
own when from the ocean six and you can
ignore absolutely yeah
so that could be a kind of you can try
to apply at this point of at this point
of so yeah and going ahead in the second
thing under so the version success
it's also in the phase gate project
management they are introducing product
manual process Ito a process group on
knowledge area mapping work performance
data tailoring project and and business
documents ah so this topic I saw they
have elaborated more the business case
and the project charter and the earlier
version the business case was not
mentioned too much in this their mention
about business case and project benefits
management plan is a some topic they're
introduced and project success measures
some other things that have introduced
going ahead in Chapter two
the environment means projects operate
so they have changed the total chapter
to name whereas in the version
- sorry version 5 version 5 the topic
was different I think it was project
management framework so the name was
different and what they're given in the
version sixes they are giving maximum
emphases - and intrapersonal factors
internal to the organization external to
organization and your whoopi corporate
knowledge base or organization knowledge
depositories and in the earlier version
we had they had organization structure
yeah yeah also you have ordinances
structure they have brought something
called organization systems and
governance feminity it was that it was
as in the world erosion management
elements that is something new so the
money element something new and
organization structure they have added
couple of organizations more in the
earlier version version 5
we had three major classifications of
organization I think must be knowing
functional organization matrix
organization and projectized of musician
in the new ocean version 6 they have
added some more type of organization so
you should be thorough with that because
many questions will come from type of
organizations well in which or the
example you take so they've added some
magnetic structures factors in
organization structure selection that is
a new topic they have introduced like
when you are in the management what type
of organization you need to select those
kind of insights that are given in
devotion 6 ok and of course PMO's the
old topic it's it's all in the same and
coming to the project the chapter 3 in
the chapter 3 what they have done is the
the old name was project management
process and process groups but here in
motion 6 they are completely changed
what scene they have made us there they
have brought the role of the project
manager here like they have put the
topic as a role of the project manager
you as a project manager what are other
qualities you need to have so they are
put very nicely
in six in that they are telling you that
they are comparing menu manager music
orchestra and they are comparing that
wiki project manager yeah this one
actually I have learned earlier like
manager project manager role is similar
similar to a you know managing an
orchestra and a music so that they have
brought this concept it was really nice
actually
and what are the knowledge and skills
required for a project manager an ideal
project manager and project manager
sphere of influence like your discipline
okay and your competencies if the talent
triangle that book and qualities and
skills of a leader now what here they
have done this under the role of a
project manager in the version six they
brought this leadership okay
they have comparing leadership and
management okay
so that in fact that this leadership and
management is a concept being widely
discussed in I say okay so they have
brought a little bit of all those
concepts here and different types of
yeah leadership assessment different
leadership sense that is already there
earlier but earlier in the version 5 the
PM book personified did not mention
about all these leadership styles for
example you are democratic leader you
have autocratic leader you have this you
know the different types of ladies like
servant leadership you have this one
more what you call ladies of a French
based leadership style so all these did
not have I mentioned in the earlier
version in Motion's it's them ensure
that we should mention about all these
leadership states because the idea
behind is that when you are a leader
when you are managing a project so what
kind of leadership spell you want to
practice so all these insights you will
get in version 6 and they also talk
about personality whatever of
personality you should be and performing
and then something they have told about
performing integration at process level
cognitive level and context level and
integration and complexity these are
some other topics that went for a change
in the chapter 3 and compared to the
earlier one
Ilia won't had but not mentioned
in the version fight so that's why they
exclusively mentioned in the version six
these are some other point sign I am
preparing this I thought I will
so in fact from from integration
management not much change except that
few yeah thanks Eddie
yeah so okay so so this is the the idea
behind that the thing so any doubts no I
think you have spent a lot of time and
done the comparison piece let's just go
back to the basic stuff so in terms of
would there
so this 35 hour training you're gonna be
walking us through the entire book or
like what's what's gonna be what's your
style of teaching is it can it be you're
gonna give us a lot of multiple choice
questions passed papers to kind of
practice like if you could just kindly
follow through the process which you'll
be following in terms of making up
successful in in cracking this exam that
would be highly appreciated my question
is um this this course is going to take
and what is the what's the timeline is
it something about the wiki daily okay
yeah so I take this first eclairisse
question then I'll go to side question I
think you are asking about the the how
the course is going to go so the course
duration is anything between 30 to 35
hours okay effective you know lecture
from my side
it could be minimum 30 it could take up
to 35 depending upon the doubts that you
ask and some question and said that we
are going to do so let us keep 35 let us
keep 35 and the the plan that we are
going to do this is from
you know for you it will be like a timed
of a Monday evening and Tuesday evening
Wednesday evening on Thursday evening
this is what being planned if required
we would we would like to have it on
Friday evening but for days we will be
realistic the forest each day it will be
anything between 2 to 2 and off of us
okay it will be two enough so that means
what one big you are going to learn for
10 us the training will continue again
the next week Monday evening okay yeah
so Monday evening again Tuesday evening
when is the evening Thursday evening so
that means second me you finished in
hours third week you go for 10 hours in
the fourth week you will be having two
more days say another five hours of
training to wrap up and to discuss some
questions application form filling this
is stuff so this is how it is structured
it'll be like a structured one you need
to join probably little bit of okay here
in that 5-10 minutes that's okay but you
have to join the right time recordings
will be there advantages you can take
the recording and go back and redo what
we have discussed in the class and any
anything any concept from the pay book
will be taken and through the PowerPoint
the the PowerPoint will be like this I
think you are seeing my slide for
example if I want to explain you a
portfolio my throat so if I want to
explain you the portfolio I'll use this
particular slide and explain you I won't
show this I will talk more about this
okay so you so after you listen to me
after you see this diagram you can
understand more about what is portfolio
what has program what is projects
involve more so this is all I explained
and you can what what is important this
I like about every stage to write notes
even if you hear something write notes
in your notepad what we are discussing
in the class that will help you a long
wait when you go because even if you
don't have time to listen to the
previous recording I recommend that you
can always go to the notes and you know
it's kind of a ready reckoner you
immediately can see oh what point we
discussed during this portfolio
discussion and always go back and see
that so most of the major points will be
covered I think this is I think I've
answered
Gladius person course duration is it
fine Clavius yeah so I think sighs I
think you are asking about the method of
teaching I think I've covered a little
bit so this is what we'll do that
so a CST time I think CAC Thomas should
be right how to say now it is 7:30 p.m.
CST p.m. central time zone time so we
will stick to the same time and that we
will do the session for 30 to 35 hours
and we will walk through so all the the
PMO quotient five concepts have been
translated into kind of a PowerPoint
that I have and we will be walking
through the PowerPoint and discuss the
funds because all the major points have
covered in this order we don't need to
worry about why we have not gone through
the book okay so this is what we'll do
and the last five hours we will spend on
the muslin cushion paper wrapping up any
point you want to touch base and one of
the important thing is let me go back to
be one slide where he we had all the 14
chapters right you can see this so after
every chapter the idea behind is that to
show you some questions okay we will
discuss some questions after a project
management framework okay what type of
question you make it kind of the are we
can group you know the first three
chapters and then we can discuss in
cousins for the intent from the
integration management you can do Goosen
paper for each chapter
after finishing integration management
will discuss about 10 15 minutes some
critical questions so you will get an
idea oh I have studied integration
management for last 2 under for 3 hours
this is a deeply step opposites being as
in the exam you will get against
okay so that will be a better idea
similarly for scope time management for
every chapter will discuss about 15 to
20 minutes question and answer session
quiz session for the first three
chapters we'll do it combinely
and then this will continue along with
the training okay sorry then I just give
me a one minute that I'll be back
just one minute hello hello yeah so say
that you got yeah yep thank you okay
yeah so Flavius we have clarified you
doubts I think so yeah so I think one
more person has don't carry so any other
doubts do you have people I'm trying to
find off another five minutes time I'm
good I'll follow up by Friday because
smooth holiday here so follow up with
the fire by Friday
okay yeah I think we have one more
question one person Hari he want to
clarify can you show me some other
topics covered in each lesson I think
that's what is okay so we'll spend on
the five minutes in this I will walk
through probably one particular lesson
like okay so so we go to the same topic
you know same request like what Harry
has asked so see we be the second
chapter has concept of project program
portfolio okay and we have PMO the next
is PMO kind of thing so that is being
taught like this
the Rabia we are showing you the slide
hurry
okay so what we will what I am going to
explain in their training is that you
know we have a portfolio but always at a
high level
okay a portfolio represents the complete
organization's the way they want to do
business at a particular level at a high
level examples I can say race event
Toyota so Toyota is an organization that
they have presence in every country so
for example Toyota want to do business
in India for example so they have a
Toyota Motor India portfolio so they
create a portfolio and how do they want
to run the business like they want to
have new projects going on and they have
a manufacturing facility in Bengaluru
and they have this plant they release
new cars every year or not two cars and
how that is being cascaded to projects
like when you have a new new product new
car it has to be managed as if it is a
new project so all these things will be
covered to you the way I am showing you
and you can see the definition for
portfolio program and projects okay
you can see portfolio at a high level
that means it's it's a complete
combination of your program projects
your operations also their operations is
missing that is why I come in here okay
so I feel that those missing part also
so that means operations is very
important all your manufacturing your
sales and service which happened daily
on a daily basis they are all operations
so that is very important so that is
also part of your portfolio okay in
addition to that you have program and
program has got a group of later
projects
you also have projects which is
independent of any program so they are
all completely put together called as a
portfolio
okay so program is collection of
projects which are interrelated which
are interdependent and coming to the
projects projects I think the definition
of project we will see during the
painting okay so we teach you and this
is a PMO like PMO is another division
that you create an attached with any
program or even at a portfolio level you
can have a PMO PM will have consist of
set of team members and
what our responsibilities is they always
facilitate and sharing the all the
know-how of past projects information
resource information methodologies
templates tools all these stuff so that
is a response of the PMO pay more hats
like a pivot for all the projects okay
and so that is one thing you will know
response what is a PMO okay you are
going to see that also and so this is
basically a collection of what do men be
so next topic is project management what
is defensible that is nothing but your
use of your skills knowledge and tools
and technique that I applied to projects
like collection of policies project
idling templates and mandate items which
define how projects should be planned
and monitored and controlled within an
organization and the use of methods it
brings in consider of approach across
projects so when you use all these
process that means it across
organization there'll be a consistency
among projects that is also important
point that you need to take care now
this slide talks about your product
lifecycle and project lifecycle okay
again repeat he talks about project life
cycle and product lifecycle so what is
the project lifecycle that means you
initiate a project on go on
from initiating to planning and planning
to execution excitation to you monitor
and control and finally close out the
project so when you're managing the
project from one stage to another okay
it follows through a life cycle the
project will have a life cycle
okay okay now what what do you mean by
product life cycle okay think of a new
mobile phone that you would like to
release think of a new left of the do
like a release think a new camera new
car for example how do they do that
okay you go to those industries so you
will learn those terminologies related
to product lifecycle first ideation they
call something called ideation
conceptualization that means something
comes to my mind how idea came to Steve
Jobs when he want to release iPhone
something came to him his mind right
this is what the product should have
these features you should have
so that idea will come to you first for
anyone who want to who are product
manufacturers anything it could be a web
based tool it could be a tool that you
have your daughter being a software that
could be a product yes after that you're
developing a product or a tool we are
people could be a product for someone
right it may not be a mechanical
component it may not be a mobile phone
or a car or a camera it could be
anything okay you can treat that
software package as a product now what
happens an idea comes to you first then
what you do this idea will work in the
market are not so you have to do where
markets should be okay that is very
important because there will be some
there are member of organizations who
are doing those ideas and bad is how we
are going to position yourself in the
market and ultimately you release a
product it does not sell right you end
up in loss and then what do you do after
you you find this the project the this
particular product is going to be
feasible that it is going to make
inroads in the market what he will do
you will start planning to design you
create the blueprint for that particular
product okay that is very very the the
heart of the entire project after you
prepare the blueprint what do you do you
give it to the manufacturing to
manufacture the particular mobile phone
right you manufacture then what you do
you are in fall sales that is you two
separately then you do service then what
happens after I your conscious
realization your market sell me your
blue print your design and construction
your manufacturing sales service
what is it loss can anybody tell me in
product in product lifecycle what
happens to the product in the last go
large yeah you after you like suppose
you you UN go live for years back okay
you have a mobile you know with you now
today what is happening to that mobile
phone
it becomes outdated right people look
for better features better very natural
right yeah so it dies okay it goes to
the shelf it now what happened to the
Nokia phones all the keypad phones that
we had about 10 years back you can't you
can you see anyone for now you can't see
that right it has become obsolete
technological advancement
so people want latest technology let us
mobile phone smart phones same concept
with product lifecycle the product with
us it goes out of the market a new
product comes in this is our product
lifecycle votes okay you may ask what is
that I need to know here regarding to
project lifecycle now project lifecycle
will always is we you have to take your
particular face of the product I am just
linking product lifecycle and project
electrical mind you this I am taking one
face of the product let us take the
blueprint creation I'm going to play the
complete blueprint for my mobile phone
now that face alone will follow the
entire project management processes it
will follow the entire project lifecycle
I have to initiate for that I have to
plan for resources fund time then I have
to execute that blueprint creating the
blueprint then cost should monitor and
control and come out of the project and
tell to my management the blueprint for
the mobile phone is security that I am
going to treat that as a separate
project please understand that similarly
you can take a market server and do it
as a project simply for your production
facility you want to set up the plant in
the manufacturing plant that you can
treat that is as if it is a separate
project so what is the message conveyed
here is the product lifecycle will spawn
spawn is word use in English called SP a
WN spawn many project life cycles that
is a point I want to convey here okay
you've got it all of you so again I'll
repeat yeah
life cycle will spawn many project life
cycles whereas the reverse is not true
okay inside this particular project life
cycle when I'm in blueprint creations
you can't think of the other phases of
the product it is only one aspect of the
product that you are doing here okay so
that is the point I want to make you so
like this you will learn a lot of things
so when I am showing us like usual bit
you may not able to catch up but the way
I explained you will definitely
understand a lot of things ok I think I
heard you have a little bit explained
you how we are going to end of life
updates yeah thank you
yeah okay so with this I adjourn this
because we have other work we had a good
office so so you can I got some couple
of questions from you that's very fine
any other questions
last 2-3 mins we'll spend yeah I think
I'm good thank you thank you Flavius
like I said thank you hurry yeah Carrie
