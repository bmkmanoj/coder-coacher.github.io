had a wonderful day so welcome to the
introduction of the business analyst
course my name is Andy I'll be your
instructor for this course
and I see some familiar names and some
new names so I'd like to spend a few
minutes introducing myself and also give
you an opportunity to introduce
yourselves so let's get started are
there any questions before we start
any basic questions we have ok so like I
said my name is Andy and I've worked in
various domains as a business analyst
starting as an intern then I became a
junior analyst and now I'm a senior
business analyst I've done different
technologies I've done different domains
so I started off with database and
eventually got into bi sum of data
analysis and so on so why don't I give
you guys an opportunity to introduce
yourselves it's it's important that you
have to be a little more proactive a
little more outspoken as business
analyst because we'll talk in more
detail on why this is so important or
how it's gonna help you in your projects
but I definitely like everyone to
participate and again remember this is a
classroom session so it's it's pretty
much a training environment where you're
welcome to speak you're welcome to
participate without worrying about if
someone's gonna judge you someone's
gonna tell you you're wrong so don't be
disappointed ask
there's no silly questions during a
learning process you can ask me any type
of questions silly or not and then
please feel free to participate because
again I like to make my sessions as
interactive as possible rather than
one-sided so if you have
any input if you have any feedback you'd
like to contribute towards the class and
think it'd be it'd be useful for other
fellow students please definitely feel
free to speak alright so who would like
to volunteer first tell me how much you
know about business analysis what are
you looking from this course and what
kind of background are you coming from
are you coming from an IT background are
you familiar with IT background or has
IT always intrigued you and you're
curious to start an IT definitely give
me as much information as possible so I
can relate to you in the future during
our sessions when we're talking about
different topics when we're answering
different questions it'll be easier for
me to relate and also this will show me
your communication skills your
presentation skills because all these
things are gonna be very essential for
you as a business analyst during your
projects okay so this will be an
opportunity for you guys to speak this
I'm giving you guys this platform to
participate so definitely be active take
advantage so that you can start speaking
about the subject about your experiences
about the background so this is also
going to help you in one way or the
other for the interviews so speaking of
interviews towards the end of the
program we're also going to dedicate an
entire session to talk about the
different types of questions that
interviewers might ask you what are some
possible or acceptable answers responses
to questions like that and then you can
also chime in and say hey if I answer
something like this would that be
acceptable or you know what would this
sound like so I'll give you guys a
chance as well towards the end of the
program when we do an interview round a
session to see some of the most commonly
asked questions and business analyst
interviews and then also what are the
possible responses you could give reach
so can I have some volunteers tonight
where you introduce yourselves tell me a
little bit about your work background
your interests in IT / business analyst
and what are you expecting from this
course hello Andy oh this is Vishnu here
I wish knew yeah it had yeah this is
Vishnu living in Canada
I finished my computers as well as I did
oh I have my diploma in employed
management as well I'm currently working
in the social developer in our TRP
for almost 3 years mmm the reason I am
here in the course right now me working
in software I I had a chance to work
with fitness analysts some functional
consultants as well as working with some
end users so in this process I realized
I like talking to people like talking to
the user Sonics and explaining the how
the process works and providing the best
solution reward at the end so in this
process I discard I mean my interest
lies in talking to people giving them
the best business solutions and as well
as talking to the end users and the and
the IT people as well so so we show in
terms of the rules of what are some of
the rules you've done so far uh so my
work and what what what my typical day
looks like mmm I get a requirement from
a constant concern
fine I understand the requirement and if
I have any questions I go back to him
and in some cases he go back to the
business users and get the requirements
right and then I will develop some
Kemalists as per the requirement then
he'll be doing the testing and
everything so there is a typical ERP in
Iran meant right now or in my case as
well as I also had a chance to work with
some end users where I was able to train
them regarding the how these new
application works ok familiar with how
you get requirements from stakeholders
the different team members in the team
and then if you have any questions
reaching
to the business and so you're familiar
with all that you just want some more
like training process I guess is that
right there's one point as well as I
mean I've been working as a software
developer right now I really wanted to
get into complete business analyst role
there are so many things which I which I
don't know as well as I would like to
understand
I mean how important is to men I mean me
completely having a software background
right even though no and then I get some
business functional flow from the
functional analyst from a workplace but
still there are so many different
domains right so I would like to you
know ask you how can I get that domain
knowledge I mean it it even though we
haven't got a chance to work in those
different domains how can a business
analyst can really manage and understand
the business has realized so now I'm
pretty much comfortable with I think
kind of way how does it work and how the
business requirements come signed how we
make it happen I'm similar with that
part of the picture but I'm not sure
about the how to get the business
requirements from the business users as
well as if we if you do not have the
enough domain knowledge right so how can
we extract what we need so to make this
also you actually wish thank you for
responding you actually brought up a
very few very important topics that
we'll definitely discuss so the first
one is definitely how do we gather
requirements who do we work with what is
the process for that so all of this is
something that we intend to cover in
this program this training program so
starting from what is the definition of
a business analyst what is the role of
the business analyst what are like what
is the whole point what is the intention
of the business analyst role within a
project how do we work with stakeholders
how do we get requirements what are some
of the strategies and techniques we
used to collect requirements to analyze
the documents what are the types of
deliverables that business analysts have
all these are some of the things that we
will cover in the program I don't want
to jump too far ahead right now by
shooting out all the answers and
explaining it in detail because I kind
of want to do it starting from the
basics so that we can go step by step so
I promise you will definitely answer all
those questions in the next couple of
classroom sessions and after that if we
still have any questions on those basics
we'll definitely go back to each one of
those questions and try to answer okay
is that fair so we'll definitely get all
those basic questions answered in terms
of domain you definitely bring a very
interesting point here because I think
with so much competition especially with
all this competition going on today
everyone has that question saying hey
one IT background is that necessary for
me to enter this field and second is how
critical is domain knowledge will I get
a job without a domain knowledge because
I don't have any background and the ones
with domains what are some of the things
I can do to get jobs in individual
domains right so all those things will
be covered in the next few sessions but
just to quickly summarize about the
domains itself so you have to remember
yes it's definitely important it's
definitely an asset for an employer to
say if a candidate has domain knowledge
they'll definitely give them extra
points they'll give them extra leverage
to be considered for that position
because they're coming with that
background but it's also important to
realize that not every business analyst
job will be domain dependent so within a
project implementation there's one side
called the front end which is facing
customers clients your end users and
there's something that's in the middle
which is called the middleware that
middleware doesn't apply for every
instance but in that middleware you're
basically the midpoint where you're
integrating different systems right
you're facing the front end you're
facing the back end when you have up
streams and down streams application you
would be in the middleware where it's
not as much necessary to have domain
knowledge as
as you understand the systems the
integration points the inputs outputs
and all that kind of flow and then
there's also back-end business analysts
who are primarily responsible for the
data for the application for the data
behavior of the data a little bit about
data base all those topics take priority
at that point so we have front-end
middleware and back-end and each of the
different types of positions require
have different preferences on what is
required to know so we'll definitely
talk in more detail about each one of
them but don't think that if you don't
have domain knowledge you're not gonna
find jobs because for it like for
example I've worked several years at
JPMorgan Chase right so even within JP
Morgan Chase there are some business
analyst jobs that literally expect
nothing from you they're not expecting
any sort of domain knowledge because all
they're saying is hey listen we're
building this application and we need a
business analyst who can work for our
team to represent the technology team to
stakeholders so they can work with
stakeholders understand what they want
collect all this requirements come up
with documentation and work with
technology team to get it implemented so
in a sit-in instances like that they're
not dependent on the domain knowledge
but then at one point I've actually
worked in AI for most of my experience
has been in asset management over there
and with an asset management I did
different rotations and one of the
rotations was heavily dependent on
domain knowledge so I worked in fixed
income I survived the first half because
we were building a portfolio management
tool and as long as people said as long
as you understand how this portfolio
management tools gonna help people
you'll be fine and then eventually I got
into a project that had to do with
derivatives so I was completely lost
when I started that project and and mind
you I've had experience working as a
business analyst but it was still lost
in that project because I didn't know
the subject around it I didn't have the
domain knowledge around it so for that
what I did is I had to consider doing my
cfa level one and I studied cfa level
one at first I wasn't you know
enthusiastic or excited to do it but
when I did it I learned so much out of
it and that significantly helped me
during my derivatives project
implementation but it's not always
necessary for you to have domain
knowledge so again you should be doing
your choosing and picking of which
projects to which locations to go to
because for example there's a lot of
state projects these days right state of
Minnesota is one of the most common
client who has tons of positions these
days they're actually so many open
positions in state of Minnesota that
they're looking for resources to be
filled there right so in situations like
that they're flexible and they're saying
even if you're an entry-level mid-level
you might not have too much experience
within the domain knowledge it's fine
we'll take you because it's a state
project there's not a lot around it but
if it's in finance and it's a market
related or market dependent application
development then obviously they'll
expect you to have some finance
background because the terminologies the
definitions you'll be using in that
product development is crucial so unless
you know the background unless you know
those terminologies you might not even
be able to understand what needs to be
developed similar to healthcare right
some pharma some healthcare projects are
also similar where some of those
projects expect you to have a good
understanding of certain regulatory
policies certain law certain bills on
how it's impacting or affecting that
industry but again within healthcare and
pharma there's not every project that's
dependent on the domain itself they're
saying as long as you can get a grasp of
good subject knowledge on the
application itself you be just fine so
the bottom line is business analysts are
really knowledge specialists in that
application that you'll be working on so
more than being as smart as a rocket
scientist or a genius it's more about
working hard and understanding
everything from end to end process on
how that application works so that is
really the key to success for a
successful business analyst because as
long as you understand how this
application works from a front-end to an
end user and the backend to the
technology if you can get a good
understanding of that application around
that from an analyst perspective
nobody can beat you people would want
you people would want to work with you
when you have a good understanding so
that is really the key not having an MBA
CFA I mean all those things will
definitely help because that'll give you
a very good understanding it gives you a
very good exposure to various components
within specific domains but that's not a
necessity right it's not like a
precondition for us to be business
analysts is that a fair response yeah
thank you so much just quick couple of
questions does it make sense me
switching from an IT background to
business analyst that's my first
question second question I always wanted
to get into project management and
that's where I want to be there so with
a bit if I'd go for a business analyst
better path take me to the product
management or such part of sort of
things I could definitely start
answering from question number two
because that's very relevant here
product management is an excellent space
to get into but again if you want to get
into project management they would
expect you to master on that subject
right not necessarily the application
but the actual subject which means
domain in other ways right so obviously
the first thing to do is to have some
experience within that IT so if you're
starting off as a developer and you want
to get to a business analyst absolutely
there are no restrictions people would
actually be happy to hire someone with a
QA background or developer ad background
to become a business analyst one
downside that you have to be careful or
vigilant while being a business analyst
with technical background is we're gonna
talk in more detail about some of the
activities as a business analyst but
when you're working as a business
analyst you have to remember when you're
giving your solution proposal you're
focusing on what is that the
stakeholders want while explaining what
is that they want you should also have
an understanding of why do they want
certain things so when you work with
your technology teams people can also
often ask you hey ba you know it seems
like you're focusing a lot on this
specific requirement do you know exactly
this is so important do you know why
this is a high priority for reasons like
that it's important for you to
understand what business value each
requirement is contributing towards the
project but the bottom line especially
for technical or QA background business
analysts is that you need to focus on
what is that they're asking and why is
that they're asking and oftentimes what
happens is when you are a developer and
you're coming into a business analyst
bucket what happens is you also start
putting in information on how you can
develop certain things right which is
technically an asset to be honest
because you already know how that's
going to be implemented but as a
business analyst you have no right to
explain to the technology team on how
something needs to be implemented so you
are focusing on what needs to be
developed and why it needs to be
developed and not how does that make
sense yes
so especially especially with developers
this what happens because technically
it's almost like I don't want to say
this but it's almost like you're smarter
than what a regular business has to be
with the development background because
you know the back end of the system and
you're saying okay this is the
requirement I know exactly how this
would be developed but if you're working
as a business analyst you have no right
to speak about that yeah so that's gonna
be your first challenge and second is if
you are interested in to product
management the first start for your
career once you start as a business
analyst is to consider scrum okay try to
get to scrum certifications so when we
get to agile we'll talk about the
different positions we have scrum master
certification we have the team also I
think there's some development related
certification and there's also the
product owner certifications right so a
great start would be to take this course
start working as a business analyst
consider getting the scrum master
certification which is called the CSM by
agile Alliance I think there's a couple
of other agencies as well equivalent to
agile Alliance so if once you consider
getting the scrum master certification
that will give you a good combination of
ba and scrum master so that way
different projects might have different
needs but since you have a combination
of
both ba and scrum master it'll give you
a higher leverage in getting different
jobs and you probably will have a higher
probability as well to get jobs and once
you get into that stream you once you
become a certified scrum master you get
into scrum eventually you can slowly
work your way up towards product
management because product owners are
expected to have a basic understanding
of the application and a lot of subject
knowledge about the domain itself and
all this is possible only through work
experience not by taking an MBA a CFA
any masters because these things are all
like real life scenarios and the best
way to learn these things is by working
through work experience so product owner
is a great ocean to have and which no
you should definitely save responses
like these for your interviews because
people will often ask you where do you
see yourself in three years where do you
see yourself in five years and that
response would be an excellent response
to say I'm eventually again you don't
want to say I want to become a product
manager because some people might feel
threatened at that point and be like oh
my god these guys didn't take my job
eventually you don't want to make it
sound like that but you should all you
can always say I'm interested towards
the product side as well so once I have
a good understanding as a business
analyst I want to work with product
teams and eventually see how we can
integrate right so don't give away that
goal or aspiration you have and say I
want to become a product owner because
sometimes people in management might
feel threatened by that response but you
can always say I'm interested in working
with the product teams that's where my
interest rate are yes and that that
shows that you're focused you have a
goal and you're working towards
something so people people can
understand that you're serious about
this position yes and I mean the current
company where I'm working
they don't really follow a specific what
you call a scrum master and all those
things I mean so in companies and become
me how often do they really follow those
product management standards or are
scrum meetings for agile of and all
those things
that's another excellent question it's
almost like putting managers on the spot
by asking that question as much as
possible every team wants to follow the
basic standards so something like
following your daily stand up your scrum
calls all those things obviously are
gonna happen because people want
everyday updates the management is
always looking for updates progress
reports so they're because of that
pressure from management people will
always follow that discipline where
you're regularly having meetings your
PMS are gonna be having all these
sessions your daily stand-ups are gonna
have a quick status check all those
things are definitely gonna be
streamlined for almost every project I
would say there's no exception there but
when it comes to documentation different
people end up following different
standards because not one answer is
gonna work for every single organization
so that's where you'll see a different
variation where some people will say and
I kind of like waterfall because it has
nice documentation and then some teams
will say no our things are very dynamic
things keep changing so we don't want to
spend too much time on documentation
because it might end up changing rather
quickly so we'll go a little more
towards agile will stick to epics and
user stories so that way we can move
things around we can refine them again
when we talk about different
methodologies we'll talk about how all
these daily behaviors and activities
will vary from one methodology to the
other but as much as possible people
follow the discipline of it but when it
comes to deliverables and documentation
it might vary because sometimes
management will say I like lengthy user
guides like SRS B RDS and all those
things where other product owners will
kind of push back on the management and
say hey guys listen we can't come up
with lengthy documents because things
are changing very quickly especially
when you're dependent on certain
regulations like if you're in health
care and pharmacy different laws
different bills health care policy
changes right all these things will
significantly change the project and the
industry itself so if you're if you're
not adapting to the new changes your
applications will be left behind you're
project will fall behind and it will
fail eventually because you're not going
to meet the expectations or standards of
today alright and then again some in
finance also have all these regulatory
policies dodd-frank regulations that
people have to comply and if you don't
comply you go out of compliance if you
go out of compliance you get penalized
right and you'll see often if you start
following all these financial firms or
healthcare firms you'll see how people
are actually being penalized they pay
all these heavy penalties for not
following certain regulations or for
going out of compliance yes okay awesome
again if some of you are kind of left
behind and you think we went too fast
don't worry about it with this is more
of an introduction it's giving you guys
an opportunity to ask questions to learn
and again by asking questions you're
actually giving an opportunity for the
entire class to learn new things right
because for example these last couple of
good questions at which namaz does
actually brought a lot of insight
brought of a broad a lot of different
different topics who are gonna cover
over the next couple of weeks so you're
actually learning a lot as well so by
asking questions you're not only
answering your own question you're also
helping other fellow students in this
classroom to kind of get an idea of
what's going on in today's world how do
we compare to the programs and so on
hello yeah I can hear ya my name is
Gideon I have a BA in Business
Administration and over the years I've
been running my own working on my own or
running my own business back in my home
country if I move down to Atlanta
Georgia where I reside now and I've
worked with that airline as a service
ambassador and also I worked as a CNA
and also I had a lecture
SQL see Gustavo and after that looking
into it I decided that I should go into
business analysis when I went online and
saw that it is related to part of the
things that I'd like to do which leads
to my own background business so my
question is for someone like me that
does not have that basic like there's an
interested in my SQL data program I
applied for the job and the each of you
are give me a question that I should
solve and it happens to be a C++ which
truly of God which I I don't know
anything about it but then I wanted me
with these business analysis what is the
correlation that does it mean that we
must have a basic understanding about
programming or for somebody like me that
does know however the basic
understanding of programming what what
way can I be able to get myself
acquitted with good question I think we
also had a similar question in the chat
couple of minutes ago and the student is
asking is this training useful for
people with no technical background so
again I think both your questions are
very similar and again you guys got to
understand this obviously when employers
are hiring technically business analysts
don't need to know sequel completely
don't need to know
bi information but now what's happening
is everyone has budget cuts going on
right so there used to be a point in
time when they didn't have enough
resources and they would just invite
people with
no experience join their teams learn
throughout the training process and then
work right but now the days have come
when there's more resources than actual
opportunities so because of that and
with all the budget cuts that's going on
people are saying instead of me having a
dedicated sequel developer and a
dedicated business analyst why don't I
look for a BA with some sequel knowledge
why don't I look for BA with some
technical knowledge so there's gonna be
all these different permutations and
combinations that people are looking for
and now you can't stop them right so if
you're a BA with development background
great it's useful for a lot of people if
your BA with a testing background great
it might help a lot of organizations and
if you are a beer with no background
some organizations will still hire you
they'll still find you useful because
believe it or not in some teams they're
actually looking for non-technical
business analysts because they if as
soon as the business analyst becomes
technical the technology team kind of
feels threatened that the business
analyst will end up making all their
decisions in terms of constraints
hardware's limitations or even certain
implementation designs so because of
that you'll find all sorts of people if
you're saying I'm a business analyst
with some blah blah blah background
great that's an addition that's an added
bonus but it's not always necessary for
every position so that's why I said some
employers will require you to have
domain knowledge and some not some
employers will prefer you to have some
sort of technical background and some
don't so it depends on the types of
opportunities if you have the patience
to learn newer technologies along with
the course great you're adding that
bonus to your profile but if not then
you just look for regular business
analyst opportunities so again there's
there's all types available in the
market so it's not like this is the only
path you can go into so in terms of the
this course itself right people are
asking these questions what are we
actually learning from this course so I
would say one of the most essential
things we're learning from this course
first of all to understand how does IT
work right what is the role of IT within
a business and then within IT what are
the different team members in a project
what are the responsibilities of
different team members and who is a
business analyst who does a business
analyst interact with what are some of
the things business analyst is expected
to do and then what are some
expectations or deliverables that the
business analyst has to show right or
has to deliver those are some of the
things we're gonna learn in this course
so if you're new to the business analyst
course completely this is actually an
excellent opportunity for you guys to
learn from the very basics from the
definitions terminologies to different
activities different roles different
responsibilities towards the end you'll
even be doing a project by yourself
and again the benefit of doing that
project of me being the stakeholder and
you being the business analyst at the
end of the course is that you guys will
be given an opportunity to even include
that project on your resumes and say I
did participate in a short quick project
during my training process during my
training program and I actually got to
do a lot of the business analyst
activities in that project right so one
you're learning - you're executing what
you're learning and three you're being
given a chance by us to add something to
your resume to your profile by saying
you have some sort of implementation
experience in projects so when ice
regular BM just saying a generic
business analyst without any added
specific domains right so again there's
specifics like healthcare be a finance
BA and then general BA where this again
you have to remember when you say
healthcare ba for some it's very useful
because people are like oh how he's
healthcare domain so if it's a hospital
they'll easily hire you but you also
have to remember if you become a
healthcare ba forget getting jobs in any
other fields like finance or insurance
because they're gonna be like oh no you
worked in healthcare so you're gonna be
in healthcare we're not we're looking
for someone non healthcare at this point
right and then if your general ba some
healthcare projects might say we're kind
of looking for specifics so you might
not be suitable but then if you're a
general ba you can work in retail
project couple years you can work in
finance the next couple of years and you
can work in education the next couple of
years right anywhere they're not
expecting specific skills you have an
opportunity to put yourself into
different opportunities into different
projects into different domains but if
you get into a specific domain you're
pretty much you have to consider that
your career is going to be in that
stream at that from that point now
that's not a bad thing but again it'll
have its limitations sure it has its own
strengths but you you put you're pretty
much restricted to that stream for the
rest of your career it's really hard for
someone to work as a health care be here
for five years and then all of a sudden
jump into finance or insurance right
that's not very realistic for people to
hire you when you're coming from that
background but if you work as a general
business analyst you can get into any
projects you can even sometimes get into
specific projects and they'll say we'll
give you an opportunity to learn or will
train you pretty much in our subject
matter okay any other questions
feedbacks things you've heard things you
want to know before we get into some of
the basic fundamentals hello hi Andy hi
hi hi this is Chris butcher I'm pursuing
my missing
lytx I decided Connect ticket
and back in India I have done my masters
in computer application and then
afterwards I worked as a web developer
and in that my work was sort of like
sequel developer type like as an web
developer I was working on sequel HTML
CSS c-sharp and now when I moved to us
and while pursuing miami's I have like
done my internship in healthcare
analytics and I have worked on SSIS and
a tableau I have been learning are but
mica I'm after October I will be like
come like looking for jobs like I will
complete my MSO so I am like thinking in
that business being a as a data analyst
the understanding business is also a
main concern
so from this course I am expecting that
I get some tips and tricks that how to
understand though I am moving towards
data analytics but I should wholly
understand business so that I can I
should have a mixed combination of both
there is a gap between map between my
professional carrier so it will boost my
carrier so I just wanted to know is this
beneficial for me as a data analyst to
get some sort of training and being a
data analyst is business analyst is
important to me absolutely so thank you
for the introduction khushboo so
one thing I'll definitely say is in this
today's market with so much competition
around us having a combination will
actually boost your profile right so you
have to understand different employers
are looking for different combinations
for some employers they're saying we're
looking for a ba who knows some sequel
queries we're looking for a BA who knows
some basic UI stuff we're looking for a
BA who's an expert in reporting right so
a lot of times employers are looking for
BS with some sort of added combination
so if you're pursuing your education in
data analytics you can still continue
your education and that'll almost become
like you're one of your specialized
areas as a business analyst even though
you're doing data analytics and you're
kind of looking to become a data analyst
business analyst will still be
applicable to you because especially
with all these merging and acquisitions
going on in today's world you'll see a
lot of projects migration projects that
expect almost a combination of a data
analyst and a business analyst to work
in a single role for that project so
with your combination for someone who
has recently been acquired or who
recently got merged into a bigger
corporate company you would be a good
fit because people are saying well you
have multiple combinations so I'm sure
you can be you would be able to
contribute to the project and again
don't always look for data analyst jobs
only once you graduate you can still
keep your options open and say I've done
a little bit of both as a business
analyst and a data analyst so I'm
looking for both opportunities I'm
looking for a combination or one or the
other but I'm willing to learn explore
in various areas right so that kind of
responses and interviews is what
employers are actually looking to hear
yeah like right now I'm like always
looking for what is going on in market
so it's sort of mix in whenever I'm
looking for jobs
in business analyst assaults so they
want some technical experiences like
tableau or Python or something and so
like I do think that business analysis
and it analysis both fit for me as a
like again I have to start afresh and
make carrier so I hope so it will be
very beneficial for my career I totally
agree and I think it will thank you and
again remember guys when you're building
your resumes you want to dedicate a lot
of space to summarize yourself right
we're not expecting you to write an
essay in your summary section of your
resume but you want to list a lot of so
a lot of times what happens is the
general format of a resume is you start
off with a summary of you through all
bullet points and in the bullets you can
pretty much identify all your strengths
right what are some of the technologies
you're familiar with what are some of
your strengths so so far we've heard a
lot of people have said hey I have a
combination of ad and BA so you a person
like that can say I have experience in
certain back-end tools and certain
integration tools in some of the
wireframe tools I am familiar reading
prototypes or pseudocode right so all
these are some of the skills of that
person and then someone else who's done
data and business analyst a combination
can say I have experience in these
technologies I'm familiar with sequel
I'm familiar with SSIS I'm familiar with
tableau I'm familiar with understanding
the data I know how to define a data
dictionary I know how to create a
traceability matrix right so all these
are some of the strengths you can
identify and list on the summary section
of your resume and then again as we're
discussing different topics and
different concepts I'll talk about your
resume every now and then and say what
are all some of the things we should
keep adding and updating our profiles
because again you have to remember that
employers are only spending a minute
max on your resume sometimes people say
they're only spending a few seconds on
your resume so you want to make sure you
can put as much as possible on the
resumes because even one keyword that
you may have thought is not as important
can actually become the key word on how
that recruiter even found you so as much
as possible whatever can relate to the
IT industry whatever can relate to the
business analyst job
especially as we were going over
different topics if you think you're
familiar with certain areas definitely
take notes of it or highlight it put it
on a piece of paper or even update your
resume at that point so that you're
constantly making changes and updating
your profile so that towards the end of
the program when people say okay you're
done with the course and you can start
applying for jobs again you would be
ready you don't have to cram this almost
like you know what teachers tell you in
school don't study for your final exam
the night before but keep studying a
little bit a little bit a little bit and
then all these bits and pieces will come
together when you're reviewing the
content a couple of nights before
alright so something similar again I'm
sure this is much more important than
your academics because this is your life
this is your career you're making money
people are paying you for these jobs so
you definitely want to take it a lot
more seriously your homework in school
at least do my homeworks please one more
question Andy like I have analytics
background I have done internship in
healthcare which was a this project was
basically on a CEO medical shared saving
program so I have worked on that data
but and as I'm doing this business
analysis course so I'm not sure for
which job profile I should look for like
there are many profiles like data
architect daytime junior data analyst
and business analyst so
one thing I can definitely tell you
there is don't even try for data
architect as much as possible people
won't hire an outsider to be the
data architect as much as possible
projects want someone internal to become
a data architect so most likely it would
be a bump or like a promotion internally
for someone who's worked as an analyst
as a project manager as a business
analyst to become the architect
eventually so hiring a data architect
from outside is very rare and again if
you're coming out of education you have
very limited work experience most likely
people are not going to hire you as a
data architect so that can be out of the
picture I would say don't spend time or
your effort on something like that
because the likely I'm not saying it's
impossible but the likelihood of getting
a data architect position right away
after masters is very very minut so
don't consider data architect but data
analysts business analysts you can
definitely be all open to both and like
I said there's gonna be a lot of roles
with which actually ask for a
combination of both as well so I would
say in my opinion you can have two
different versions as well for your
resume so one can be for a business
analyst one can be for a data analyst
and everything that highlights the
business analyst skills can go on that
version and everything that highlights
the data analyst skills can go on that
version so there's nothing wrong with
that because they're very similar
they're very parallel so if you find if
you come across certain job descriptions
that are very very specific you can
decide which version to use okay anyone
else want to introduce yourselves I
can't hear you
hey Balu hear me now much better okay so
I'm actually coming from I did my LLB
and what I love is that law yes yes I
did lower back in UK and then came back
to us and started doing got into
recruiting and now I'm into cells and
marketing but I want to move for more
citing exciting I would say rather than
what I'm doing right now so my my focus
is I I mean I've been hearing and I
think you've answered most of my
question but I have no technical
background in whatsoever I have no of
course I know the the you know the
technical terms and everything because I
look at resumes every day I I you know I
sell people to them to the market and
everything but at the same time and now
it's coming to me
I think it's reached a stage that you
know when you tell everybody don't worry
you're gonna make it fine now it's me um
I'm kind of freaking out so I think
you've answered but I really don't know
how even I could really get into my
resume because I've been doing this for
so long for more than eight years so I
don't know how this is gonna work out so
one thing I can definitely tell you is
if you're coming from a sales and
marketing background there's gonna be a
lot of similar things that you can
relate to as a business analyst right so
when you're in sales and marketing
you're trying to advertise a certain
product you're trying to promote that
product you're trying to do research on
everything around that product who are
your users how do you reach out to your
users how do you make their life more
convenient right all those things are
also done by a business analyst from an
application perspective you're doing
very very similar things on an
application where you're doing research
on your application you're trying to
master your application you're trying to
find out how your application works
front end back end the data coming in
leaving what are the exceptions what are
the most frequently asked questions how
our users using your application when
you have new enhancements being added to
that application you're doing a sales
pitch to all your end-users you're
giving them demos you're giving them
presentations on what are some of the
things you've been working on what are
the enhancements that's being added to
the application how are those
enhancements going to be useful for
those business
users so there's gonna be a lot of
similarities from sales and marketing in
business analysts only differences your
shifting your source from a specific
product or from a specific team to an
application you're moving slow slightly
into IT where you're trying to advertise
and promote your application you're
trying to represent the technology team
as a business analyst but for the most
part business analysts on one side are
always facing stakeholders end-users
clients prospects right all these are
the types of people you're facing
because for example if you're working in
the middle of a project your project
manager will come up to you and say hey
listen we have a prospective client who
wants to find out more about the
application can you give them a
demonstration right give them a quick
demo on how this application works so
you can see if you have something that
is useful to them so very very similar
to sales which is again another reason
why I'm saying I want you guys to be
outspoken I want you guys to talk to me
and don't worry about someone's gonna
judge me I'm gonna sound silly I'm gonna
sound stupid don't worry about any of
those because trust me guys no one knows
each other here let's at least make that
assumption and nobody's here to judge
you we're all here to learn we're all
here to contribute and the more you
speak here the better you're gonna get
right I would rather expect you to make
mistakes here in this class so that I
can correct you because it doesn't
matter you're part of the training this
is rather better than making mistakes
during your job during your interviews
so definitely speak to me ask me
questions I'll be more than happy to
help you
but definitely remember or keep this in
mind that this course will definitely
help you understand the introductions of
everything pretty much and by the end of
this course you'll have an understanding
of how does project implementation
happened what is the business analyst
role there what are some of the things
the business analysts will do and not
only are you getting a review or recap
at the end but you're actually gonna get
a demonstration you'll actually get an
opportunity to work on that project and
be a business analyst so by that end of
that program you'll have actually known
what
pros and cons from your side to be a
business analyst and again everyone has
different strengths and different
weaknesses so there's not one way of
seeing this everyone's perspective can
be different and again I would like to
hear your feedback towards the end of
the program as well on how much has it
improved you or has it not made any
difference so far so I'm sorry but so do
you feel that do I when I'm taking the
BA course do I need to
apparently learn sequel and testing as
well to have an idea of what you know to
relay in most of the things because like
all these stuff like RUP and all those
good stuff I have no idea where to start
where to end I mean it's completely all
those things will be covered as part of
this course maybe not so much into
sequel because that's a whole separate
subject but we'll talk about all the
different methodologies are a DJ ad RUP
agile waterfall des DLC will also talk a
lot I wouldn't say a lot but we'll also
talk about the basics of testing what is
the point of testing what is the result
of testing because b is actually are
part of the whole testing process as
well even when you have a QA so we'll
introduce those topics to you you'll
have an idea of what it is so it's not
like it's something that you're expected
to learn by yourself and we're not gonna
cover it we're definitely gonna cover it
maybe sometimes enough for certain
projects sometimes not enough for
certain projects definitely again I'm
like I said all those things are pretty
much at an added bonus to your profile
so if you want to be on top of the
competition the more you spend time on
it the more knowledge you have the
better you sound in an interview again
this is not like a test where people
will give you an exam and you have to
prove how much you know but the whole
point is the more subject you have on
all these different things during the
interviews your conversations are much
more smoother you're having better
conversations you're giving more input
you're asking more questions so that's
just making an
better impression overall but it's it
does certainly doesn't hurt you but I'm
not gonna say that by learning those
things you're gonna get a job for sure
either again you have to keep this in
mind the whole point of your resume is
to get that interview the whole point of
that interview is to get that job so it
depends on your performance in each
stage having a perfect resume is not
gonna guarantee you a job or having a
mediocre resume doesn't eliminate the
possibility of you getting the job it
all depends on how you do the interview
so the more knowledge you have the
better conversations you'll have make
sense thank you hi Andy quick question
reservation here again go ahead yes so I
know we have 40 hours of training for
five weeks after that would you still be
our mentor guiding us with all the
interview process or you know more than
interview or like will you still be our
mentor in you know I wish I could be man
but um but so for the most part the
classroom sessions are all in under my
guidance so as much as possible or happy
hour towards the entire forty hours but
once that forty hours is done you'll be
assigned to the resume assistance
workshop and once you join that resume
workshop mock interview sessions so the
staff at Z as Erin Tech will actually
help you out with those things
I am I might not have time after the
class yeah I mean to be honest resume
and all those things that more than that
I mean if you have any questions
regarding the business analysis or that
sort of things so can we can reach you
we'll have to see again I mean we can we
can discuss those things after the class
on how we can come up with a
communication channel but the entire
class is definitely 100% under my
control
okay because I personally believe I mean
this forty hours wouldn't be really
sufficient but we might really need your
guidance even on for that so I'll do my
best here thank you so much so we have
other questions like what's the duration
of each class so we're gonna have 20
individual sessions and II
session is gonna last two hours and it's
all under my guidance so people are
asking for references to read so once
you have access to the blog there's a
lot of reading material there so there's
also a be a there's a guide for the four
if you guys are considering for the any
certifications that's aligned to the I
IBA Institute there's also a guide book
called the be a balk so it's Bab okay
and we have the version two actually
available on our blog you can definitely
use that material to familiarize
yourself with a lot of topics we
actually have another version released
by the I IBA but it's only for IAB and
members registered members only at this
time again not many many changes on
version 3 versus version 2 but version 2
can definitely be your base if you want
to refer to a certain guide or to a book
as a baseline for your learning I mean
it's not really an individual author
it's by its be a balk is released by an
institute called the I IBA so they're
the national standardized agency who
issues all the certifications for
business analysts and they come up with
this guidebook which will help you if
you're considering any of the IIb
aligned certifications
all right we had someone raise their
hand as well Okello did you want to say
something hi yes can you hear me yes I
can
okay great well my name is akela I'm
here in Dallas Texas I think for the
most part most of my questions have been
answered I mean I have come from a
healthcare background I graduated with
psychology and I did communication
studies and about a year ago I you know
switched to a mental health care to
mortgage so I'm kind of in a new pool
and I stumbled upon you know the pull of
business analysis and I thought you know
I think I could really benefit from this
because I'm a very I like solving
problems I love interacting with people
I'm trying to figure out you know how
things work in a business but I just
don't have that technical background
like some people have you know who knows
it so like I said most of my questions
have been answered yeah so yeah
definitely I think this will certainly
help you it's good that you have some of
the domain knowledge and then I think
this will also give you a formal
training formal especially this course
will help you familiarize in a lot of
definitions so when you have interviews
when you're doing your phone round Skype
rounds in-person rounds all these things
will significantly help you because you
know the actual terminologies are the
actual definitions because a lot of
times what happens in interviews is that
people kind of know the subject people
kind of know the answers they have an
idea but they're they don't sometimes
people are not able to formulate it
together they're not able to use the
right terminologies so this course will
definitely help you in that subject so
why don't we spend some
and go over some of the concepts that we
have so far and talk about what business
analyst is all about so when we say what
is business analysis that's probably one
of the most common questions people will
come across so according to the IIb a
this is the Institute defined definition
business analysis is the practice of
enabling change in an organization
context by defining needs and
recommending solutions that deliver
value to stakeholders so why are we the
change agents here we're saying business
analysts are one of the modes mediums to
enable a change within an organization
so what's happening here is on one side
we have stakeholders who are giving your
budgets your funding and also saying hey
listen I am spending too much time on
this or this has become a tedious
process for me I want my life to be
easier than this right so on one side
you have those stakeholders and on the
other side you have the technology team
that you'll be managing by saying all
right guys this is the kind of change
that are looking for so let's break down
this definition in more detail so we're
saying enabling change in an
organization what does that mean can
someone take a guess when we say and as
a business analyst you're enabling a
change within an organization what does
that mean what do you think or how do
you think you're contributing to that I
think we are getting a requirement from
the end-user or either we are enhancing
a already established system or we are
coming up with a new change or is it a
new requirement so we are being a part
of a change we are making some changes
to the existing system that's what I
think absolutely fantastic
anyone else want to take a shot
yes I believe that when you talk about
enabling change pretty much the basic
principle of any business organization
is to make profit so I believe that the
role of a business analyst constant to
play in the essence of the change being
that we come up we come up with better
results that enable that growth and
profitability of stakeholders excellent
so it's really those two folds so both
answers were so on point both were
perfect one is if anything is missing if
anything is lacking if you want to
automate something make it more
efficient those are all some of the
reasons why you want to make the change
to the organization and second thing is
your the business at least from a
business perspective you're always
looking for a way to increase your
profitability right how do you make more
money how do you expand your business
how do you expand your user base what
what all can you automate what all can
you add to your applications to your IT
to increase your business to expand your
business to attract more clients so
those are the two different
possibilities of how a business analysts
can help in contributing towards IT for
an organization some make sense
so on the first saw on the first
response what we're saying is we have an
existing application and most likely
we're adding improvements enhancements
we're just refining it all part of
maintenance we're always trying to make
the best out of what we have and in the
second instances we're always looking
for new ways to introduce new concepts
right for example what is Facebook do
Facebook by itself as a standalone
application itself has made so much
profits they made so much money so on
one side we have the first student
respond by saying we're trying to add
certain things we're trying to improve
certain things we're trying to add
enhancements and within Facebook
standalone application they do all that
right on the other end this
instead and what he just mentioned is we
were looking for new ways to make money
we're looking for other streams to make
revenue his Facebook doing that right
now absolutely right they've introduced
advertisements they've integrated with
so many applications right it started
off with all these different games right
application different applications that
were meant to be as games but now almost
like every field every type of
application wants to integrate with
Facebook right candy crush for example
right
candy crush on one side is a great game
and then by integrating with Facebook it
became even more popular friends are
playing with each other through Facebook
right so many people are addicted to
that game so that's just one example
where Facebook made refinements
improvements enhancements to their
existing application and they were also
looking for all different possibilities
to come up with new businesses so every
time they did that I'm not saying the
business analyst is responsible for
these new businesses but every time a
business is looking to expand they're
actually giving opportunities by hiring
all these analysts to say on one end it
might be it might say hey collect all
the data and come up with analytics
that'll help us on how we can study
certain behaviors age patterns responses
on the other end they'll say why don't
you as an analyst keep looking for other
opportunities to attract more businesses
that will integrate with Facebook right
so what's Facebook's profit in that on
one end that application is paying
certain things to Facebook and they're
also making money from increasing their
user base right and then on top of that
advertising is also giving them enough
money right so that's just one example
obviously there's tons of other examples
as well where one you're always trying
to make your existing application better
and better and two you're looking for
newer opportunities make sense
I know some of you actually want to
speak and I'm sorry if you guys are
still muted let me unmute okay go ahead
I'm sorry you got cut off what did you
say well anything looking out for more
absolutely right certain people want to
automate certain things certain people
want to increase the performance
increase the efficiency make it faster
all those things are all contributing
factors for a business analyst to be
part of that change any other questions
or comments about this topic so a lot of
you also asked me right I think we even
went across a couple of instances where
people said like what are all the
different roles out there right what are
the jobs I should be applying for
there's a system engineer or data
analyst business analyst data architect
right so these are some of the very very
similarly aligned roles towards the
business analyst we have system analyst
process analyst requirements engineer
Enterprise analyst management consultant
business architect data architect right
data analyst all these are some of the
roles that are very very similar to a
business analyst every company might
have a different way of saying things
for example let's take Google as an
example to my understanding as far as
what I understand my best friend works
at Google from what I understand so far
Google very rarely looks for a business
analyst right they're just using
different terminologies I mean in the
first place they probably don't need as
many business
because they're not actually looking for
new businesses to be on boarded they're
just looking to expand their services
into everything so because of that kind
of nature of business they might not
need as many business analysts as
opposed to a healthcare or a finance
related organization right so but they
do have roles very similar to a business
analyst and they call them either data
engineer or system engineer or sometimes
even a requirements engineer right so
those are just some of the terminologies
that Google prefers to use over a
business analyst so every organization
might have a different way of the title
itself but the one way I mean so you
might ask me a counter question on that
and say well how do I know if this suits
me so the first thing you need to be
doing when you look for such
opportunities is to read their job
description right so read some of their
job description to understand what are
they actually looking for what are some
of the skills they're looking for
because in a lot of these roles a lot
almost 90 percent or I would say at
least majority would be very similar in
terms of what they're looking for what
are some of the skills required but then
each role might have a different
preference might have a different
priority so for example a systems
analyst my organization might say well
we expect our analysts to think and act
more in terms of the application itself
we don't want to keep it at a high level
but we are willing to get it to a
functional level so if stakeholders are
giving us requirements we want to be
able to speak from a system perspective
and say these are the capabilities these
are limitations these are constraints
these are some of the enhancements from
an application perspective versus we
have another let's see let's pick the
enterprise analyst in this list versus
what is an enterprise analyst doing
enterprise analysis the enterprise
itself should give you the answer it's
self-explanatory that it's focusing more
on the organization itself so if someone
is looking for an enterprise analyst
they're looking to give more focus and
more
towards the business enterprise itself
and not as much on the system so they
they expect this enterprise analyst to
be more on the sales side and say well
this person is gonna promote this
application he's gonna give a bunch of
demos he's gonna try selling this
product right for example if it's a
company where you come up with a product
but that product is not internally used
for example if you work at a hospital
right when you become a business analyst
for a project in a hospital whatever
applications you're working on you're
doing it in for internal use majority of
the times you're doing it for that
organization if you're coming up with a
portal system you want that portal
system to be used by a hospital that
hospital will never come up with a
portal and sell it to other companies
because they don't care that's not their
focus that's not their main stream right
all they're saying is we want to build
this patient portal and be able to use
it within our network within all our
branches and that could be a business
analyst system analyst process analyst
whereas there could be one company
that's developing this portal system a
patient portal system and they want to
advertise this patient portal system to
hospitals across the United States so
when that happens they have those kind
of analysts we'll have more focus on the
business on the enterprise on the
product and not as much on the system
backend integration up streams down
streams not as much on that does that
make sense so every organization every
project might have different focus some
will say your goal is to promote our
product so when they say that enterprise
business that might make more sense some
people might say we're doing an internal
project so we want you to think from a
system perspective from process if it's
a workflow related application then all
your focus is on the process flows on
what are the integration points what are
the mains up streams down streams like
all those things will become your focus
right management consultant is more like
a contractor where they're giving a
certain set of tasks or objectives
for that consultant to accomplish but
the focus in a management consultant is
usually not on i.t but more towards the
ops side which is pretty much the the
middleman for IT and any other
operations like sales or end-users or
management consultants can just be
facing the end-users and be working with
another business or a system analyst on
the backend alright so the technology is
not as much focus for a management
consultant as compared to like a system
analyst or a process analyst right so we
said Google is always looking for system
engineers data engineers and each of
those job description might have
different focus some might say your
entire goal is going to be on this data
collecting the data organizing analyzing
searching formatting right so Google is
all about that every organization has
different focus so all these roles that
you see you're seeing on your screen
right now are very very similarly
aligned to the business analyst so if
you come across a title like that just
read the Job Description if that
interests you you can always consider
applying for something like that
and again one thing I would tell you is
if you're applying to one or two
different variations you may have to
move things around because again like I
said when your recruiters are only
spending a few seconds on your resume
you want to put the most important
things first and in that summary as well
you want to highlight what makes the
most difference to that job if you're
gonna be lazy about it and say I'm only
gonna stick to one version and send this
to like 20 different types of jobs guess
what they don't see your effort in it
it's going into garbage right they're
gonna trash it right away so if you show
effort and say because for recruiters
when they're looking at the resume
they're looking at how can I relate this
resume to what I'm looking for so those
are some of the things you want to pay
attention on your resume based on that
job description if you show effort by
highlighting the things that they need
to know then you're getting their
attention more quicker if not very small
likelihood that you might even be
considered
all right so the effectiveness of
business analysis does business help
business do business is better so the
business analyst is an agent of this
change we talked about the different
variations of a change right what are
all the possibilities for a business
analyst to add change or to be a part of
that change management business analysis
is a disciplined approach for
introducing and managing change to an
organization right so that could be
within an existing application or adding
something new
that'll bring more business towards the
organization and again I don't know if
you realize business analyst can apply
for any type of businesses whether
they're for-profit or nonprofit or even
all these state projects government
projects so I'm based off New York City
so so in New York for example MTA is
something that is always expanding right
they're always looking for
implementations projects expansions news
the systems keep changing they need a
lot of maintenance so for all those
needs they actually have a lot of demand
in IT right and people will be surprised
that we like what is a subway metro or
you know the whole like transportation
of New York doing with IT they have a
ton of opportunities with an IT so state
projects government federal for-profit
nonprofit different domains they all
will or somehow might have opportunities
for a business analyst so keep your
options open to various organizations
and not necessarily one or the other
type business analysis is used to
identify and articulate the need for
change in how the organization's work
and how you facilitate such changes
right so on one end you have your
stakeholders giving you all the
requirements on the other hand you'll
have your technology team who's waiting
to make those implementations happen so
you're the middleman they're working on
both sides trying to balance both sides
understand the requirements organize it
analyze
and give a proposal to technology teams
for them to come up with a solution and
as business analysts were identifying
and defining these solutions that'll
maximize the value delivered by this
organization to its stakeholders so this
is where we're also gonna learn about
prioritization so in some of our agile
concepts we'll come up with like um we
have a very popular rule called the
Moscow rule which stands for must have
could have should have so we'll talk
about all the different priority
categories on how let's say you come up
with 500 requirements how do you
organize those requirements those are
some of the things we'll learn as
business analyst what are some of the
things we need to be looking at and the
bottom line of that entire thing is that
we need to see how much of value is each
requirement adding right is it
convenience to the product owner himself
is it convenience to the team is it
adding business value to the
organization is it bringing new value to
the application right all those are some
of the things that you need to
understand as a business analyst because
when the technology team will have
questions on certain requirements
they're actually looking for answers
from you right again if you don't know
the response you can always say I'll
work with my stakeholders and get back
to you but that shouldn't be your
response to every single question right
which is why I always said when you're
gathering requirements when you're
collecting all these user stories you
need to pay attention to two questions
what are they asking and why are they
asking so that you know the business
value of each requirement you're going
to be defining don't worry about how
that's going to be implemented leave it
up to the design teams the architects
the dev leads and the entire technology
teams will take care of how they can
make it happen
but you just work on what needs to
happen and the reasoning behind it on
why that's gonna help the project the
team the stakeholders the product owners
or whoever business analysts work across
all levels of an organization they
involve in everything from defining
strategy creating enterprise
architecture defining the goals
engineering these requirements and
supporting continuous improvement in any
existing
technology development and processes
okay
so it it could be all types and so for
example some of you might even ask me
questions like what kind of jobs might I
get right would I have an application or
would I have to build an application and
again I don't have a straightforward
answer to that because it really depends
you can join a team where they already
have an existing application and they're
just expecting you to join in for some
maintenance and yeah pretty much the
maintenance phase or minor enhancements
to the project or you can be joining
teams where they're saying we want to
build a brand new application so we need
someone who's starting from scratch so
we have nothing in place we're gonna
start everything from scratch
documentation prototypes the designs the
wireframes the flow diagrams everything
is gonna start from scratch and again
they have their own pros and cons and
I've actually had the opportunity to
work in both instances where we were in
positions where we already had existing
applications and we were just trying to
make it better more efficient stronger
performance and all that with
enhancements and then on the other hand
we started projects literally from
nothing right we started off with a
bunch of brainstorming sessions to come
up with an idea the concept and idea all
the way towards implementing and
releasing it into production
right so I've done both and I've
actually learned different things in
each one of them so they have their own
pros and cons so if you end up getting
jobs tomorrow you might either join an
existing team with an application or you
might have nothing where you're starting
from scratch well which is actually a
good thing because you'll get to learn a
lot in that process so this is a
question that you can always save when
people you're interviewers ask you if
you have any questions and believe me
that always happens in every interview
towards the end if time permits your
employer's hiring managers recruiters
they often will ask hey do you have any
questions for me towards the end right
so when that happens please don't try to
sound like a smartass and say oh no I
don't have any questions I think I'm
pretty
right I don't want anyone to say this is
what you told this is what you told them
always have at least one or two
questions basic or not saved because one
by asking that question you're showing
them that you have interest in their
organization in their projects and two
you want to know what their project is
about and that might intrigue their
interest even more and say hey I kind of
like this person I wasn't sure but he's
showing interest in my project why
wouldn't I like to speak right and you
must know human nature by now right if
you give people a chance to talk they
would love to talk right so similarly
even though interviewers are asking you
questions they will give you an
opportunity at the end to ask any
questions that you may have right you
don't overdo it and ask a question every
five minutes but towards the end you
should feel free to ask one or two
questions right show interest in them
and this is a very common question you
can ask and say so what kind of project
if I get the job what kind of project
would I be working on do you have any
existing application or I'll just be
joining the team and making enhancements
and taking care of the maintenance of
that project or are we coming up with
any new innovation new projects where
I'm pretty much gonna be starting from
the very very beginning right so you can
always ask a question like that and so
during my experience we've also like at
one point I was working on an existing
application and all of a sudden I went
through a merging and acquisition right
so especially when you work in finance
this happens so common the merging and
acquisition just is like another regular
thing people won't even be surprised
right
so when merging an acquisition happens
for example that anyone who said data
analyst analytics business intelligence
anyone interested in the data area
itself those people would be a perfect
fit for any merging and acquisition
projects right because when I got to
work on an existing application all of a
sudden our company took over another
smaller company and we had to take their
applications understand their
applications come up with proper
documentation on their application and
then based on how our application works
we're trying to come up with a model
where we can integrate
this into that by either just merging it
or by adding all different enhancements
to that existing application to
accommodate everything that our new
company that just got acquired was
providing to their customers okay so
this lot of data related migration
related projects as well like that where
the focus is different right because
over there you're talking all about data
migration data dictionaries you're
talking about attribute mapping you're
studying application a application B and
you're coming up with a common target
where it'll accommodate both a and B
right so those are all some of the
things that's the focus in a merchant
acquisition situation so we as business
analysts have specialized knowledge to
act as a guide and lead the business
through unknown or unmapped territory to
get its desired future state or
destination you have to remember again I
told you guys before the key to become a
successful business analyst is by
mastering your application because when
your clients when your end-users are
using your application they might not be
aware of every single thing in your
application but guess who they're
counting on if they have any questions
you guys business analysts is always the
point of contact for stakeholders and
users always if they have any questions
they usually will reach out to the
business analyst first so if you again I
get like like I said you don't need to
be a rocket scientist to be a good
business analyst you just need to work
hard enough to understand how your
application works master that
application trust me everyone wants to
talk to you after that everyone wants
you in the project everyone wants to
work with you once they know that right
and obviously you have to come up with
proper documentation you have to use the
right strategies and techniques to do
the analysis as well because if you
don't do that then it defeats the
purpose so let's see what are some of
the things business analysts contribute
in projects right one they help in
identifying
opportunities so this was one of the
students responses by saying we want to
see where all can we increase our
business to increase our revenue model
right again this if we talk in terms of
agile this is more of a product owner
type of things so this will become more
of the product side and not so much on
the BA side but business analysts in a
traditional model would have to work on
something like this understanding
required capabilities right what does
that mean we're saying the business
analyst should know everything about the
existing application right how do you
access the database what data is sitting
in your database if a customer said hey
I did this can you check the logs you
should be able to check the logs you
should you need to learn how to do that
again for doing you know the basic SQL
stuff honestly you don't even need to be
a sequel expert for that sometimes
customers are asking you very very
simple questions like hey can I get
yesterday's report hey I heard there was
an issue last week can you check the
logs and see what was the issue who got
impacted these things are such basic
things that you probably don't even need
a lot of sequel skills to come up with
reports like that because you're just
writing basic queries like saying on
this date give me a list of all the
users who access this write or give me a
list of all the errors encountered on
this date right so it's just matter of
some of the semantics you need to learn
in sequel but it's you can quickly learn
so don't consider it as a disadvantage
if you don't know it but the point is
you're helping the business one because
the business first of all barely
understands technology and second is
they're always relying on you and saying
hey you're here to make my life better
can you help me out business analysts
also help by thinking based on the
organization model right when you set
your goals when you set your objectives
for the project and for yourself you
also always want to keep the
organization in perspective and say how
is this going to help the organization
how is this gonna help this project how
is this project going to contribute to
the team how is this team gonna help in
their line of business and how is that
line of business gonna contribute
towards your organization
so if it's a small company we can always
think how does this project help that
company but if it's a bigger
organization especially all corporate
companies there's all these different
layers so even if you don't relate on
how your project will help the
organization at least go one or two
levels higher and say by doing this
without adding business value here this
is gonna help this team succeed in this
and that succeed is gonna help them be
recognized in that right so try to see
at least one or two levels higher of a
high level picture on how that
contribution or development is going to
help that organization or that division
of that organization and obviously
business analysts have always are
expected to help by providing an
effective solution right could be an
enhancement could be a new development
could be a new migration could be a
brand new product or it could just be
existing maintenance you always want to
come up with the best possible solution
all right question now that we
understand a lot of the basics so far
let's ask ourselves a question like do
you think it would help the organization
avoid or incur a high cost if they hired
a dedicated business analyst do you
think it would help the organization
save money by having a business analyst
so again there's no yes or no response
to this from what you understand so far
if you had to take a guess what would
you guys say my own response to the
first question my own authority means is
has individuals already helped help
avoid cost in general challenges well
you cannot avoid costs
well equals two role in a business and
what I feel in business analysts
a print efficiency and also create turn
out not and you know and overall you can
lessons in can't really necessary what
cost because for a business to to excel
definitely there because for at one
point in time only honor
okay fair enough yo ya one you're
definitely trying to build the
efficiency of that organization and
you're also adding convenience by making
things easier that's aligned to the
business yes certainly
again fair response you can't avoid all
costs it will come at a cost by having a
dedicated business analyst but overall
you are saying it will definitely help
avoid a lot of failures for example yes
totally fine any other responses to
these questions yes I believe as the
business analyst you can totally in a
way help to avoid cost I can just say in
indirectly by saying unnecessary cost
because you'll be in business analyst
the main purpose why you get the job or
be hired is to try to increase
efficiency by increasing efficiency that
means you directly have targets what the
company needs are stuff that the school
is not like too many stuff Rumble around
trying to figure out stuff so in the
long run it tends to avoid unnecessary
costs absolutely that's actually a very
good point right because a lot of times
people actually throw so many changes so
many requirements that but when you have
a dedicated business analyst sitting
there that person is absorbing
everything that these stakeholders are
saying and we're trying to do a
high-level assessment on what is really
required here how do we organize these
things how can we come up with a
solution that might maximize a lot of
these changes right so all these
analysis is being done by a person there
who's helping things streamline
organize and say well does this make
sense right because it's not just up to
the stakeholder to say do this the
business analyst is not a robot there
who's just taking information from here
putting it on the technology and saying
hey can we get this done that's not how
it's being done right because we still
are arranging the data organizing it
analyzing it we
seeing what makes sense what doesn't we
can always argue as well right I mean
not like putting a fight with your
product team but we can always have a
discussion and say well does this really
add value does this make sense should we
be doing this right and sometimes your
technology teams can also chime in and
say yeah let's push back on this because
this is not necessary because doing this
change will cost us X amount of dollars
but I don't know if it's worth doing
that X amount of dollars because in
returns it might not even break even
right all these things might come up and
there needs to be someone to absorb
responses from both sides and be that
liaison between business on one side and
technology on the other side so that's a
very good point because especially when
you give people a chance to make changes
what the more flexible you are the more
changes are gonna happen right for
example let's take real life scenario
airlines what happens in Airlines right
when we're traveling when we've halved
our when we have our book or tickets
booked we know unless it's an emergency
unless it's a last-minute situation or
unless it's a situation worth paying the
change of fees or we don't have an
option we're not gonna change our
tickets right because we know they're
not gonna be flexible it's not like we
can just call United and say hey can you
move my ticket to tomorrow I'm not in
the mood to go tonight
right it they're not giving us that
option so if they give you that option
it comes at a cost right then they're
saying well okay if you want us to move
your ticket
well we will but here's the change of
fees here's the fare difference right
they're giving you all that cost and
that at that point you have to decide
for yourself and say well is it worth
for me to spend another $200 and do the
change fees and move my ticket right and
sometimes it night might not even be a
monetary return because sometimes you
may just not be able to go you have to
work you have a family situation you
just have to stay back for whatever
reason right but for you you think it's
worth spending their money right very
similarly stakeholders are gonna dump a
bunch of requirements on you and you can
always work with the technology team and
come up with estimates and say well this
might cost you this much this
so I cost you this much so you guys can
decide as stakeholders and say if you're
spending half a million dollars over the
next a year or two on a change like this
you guys can decide and tell me if it's
worth spending that five hundred
thousand dollars on a change in this
application right and again there they
are going to assess that as well because
that's very important if they're
shedding $500,000 they want to see value
come out of it and not always as the
money sometimes it's convenience
sometimes it's meetings are in standards
sometimes it's complying certain
regulations there can be many other
reasons other than just money
but the point is you're saying okay
you're giving me this requirement but
this requirement will come at a cost are
you willing to face that cost or do you
think that cost is fair for this makes
sense and especially in situations like
this is when technology teams will ask
you questions and say hey why is this so
important can you tell me is if it's
really that important or not right so
these are some of the things that people
will ask you people will question you
and say do you know the reason behind
this and that's one other thing that you
should always understand when you're
collecting your requirements that is one
of the most common question I would
always ask my business analyst
very good very very good that's a good
practice from a developer standpoint and
even from a business analyst standpoint
that's a very good practice that is when
it kind of made me realize I mean I can
be better business analyst yeah there
you go and even as a developer right
when you're asking that question it's
not always to see the reason behind why
you're doing that but sometimes the
actual reason behind that requirement
can actually influence in your decision
on when you're designing the MA the
design model or when you're coming up
with that tech spec for that requirement
that reasoning behind that requirement
will sometimes actually help the
architects or dev leads to come up with
certain approaches so it is important
for developers to ask that question
because that might actually make a
difference on how you design it exactly
I mean sometimes that can give us a bit
better
solution to the bee anomalies which he
might not be aware into the first place
so taller spider if the developer knows
as much as information so he can come up
with a better solution
everyone business analyst you guys have
to be careful if people are as smart as
Vishnu they're gonna ask you so many
questions and you should be in a
position to say yes I'm willing to
answer or justify for all these
requirements blah blah blah right you
should be willing to or ready to face a
situation like that because people will
ask you those questions so when you're
doing your assessment or analysis you
should you can ask the same questions to
the stakeholders right you can always
say can you help me understand on why
this is so important or what's the
reasoning behind giving this requirement
like how is that gonna make your life
more convenient how is this gonna add
business value and again not everything
is monetary related sometimes it's
convenient sometimes it's making things
easier for business users as well so
don't always translate it to financial
gains from every requirement
I mean sometimes there are cases where a
business analyst they were there blindly
what the requirements from the youth and
users even before analyzing whether it's
really needed that there are cases as
well all right and again it would be
your responsibility if a business
analyst does a poor job there you as a
developer should be asking that question
and saying hey can you help me
understand this right and if the
developer doesn't do that either guess
what the project will most likely you
know again you'll have unnecessary costs
which might not be justified at the end
and this is how people actually lose
jobs by the way right so what happens is
when the BA is poor or when the
developer is poor in analyzing or
assessing on what's important what's not
and you just develop whatever is given
end of the day end of the year let's say
you spend a million dollars and the
product team is saying well let's see
the value that's coming out of all this
development we've done a bunch of
releases we've done a bunch of
development but what is the end result
of this application a year later if you
had to come up with a summary or a list
of accomplishments from that prod
not by not just by listing what has come
out of the release but what components
have contributed for the business users
to make their lives easier
again not everything is financial but at
least like has that saved time has that
improved efficiency has that made the
Protestant cleaner right is that
organizing certain things all these are
some of the questions that the product
team especially upper management on the
CX o level is asking all the managers
all the product owners and saying tell
me what you've done for a million
dollars and if you can't justify guess
what's gonna happen bye-bye
you get a severance package and you'll
be asked to leave right and that's how
people lose jobs that's how people get
laid off so which is why it's important
for you from the beginning to beyond to
be able to understand the justification
behind doing developments especially for
people who want to be product owners
product managers you have to be very
keen on what kind of development is
happening because you should be able to
justify every release that really should
have added some value to the project or
to the team in one way or the other
could be in many ways could be again
some financially some just benefits some
convenience rights some efficiency and
performance it could be any one of them
but you should be able to justify every
release for that matter so organizations
regardless of what the economy seems to
be like they continue to increase their
demand and investment on software
development right almost every company
so I would say what like 10 years ago
every company was saying we need to have
a website we need to have a website we
need to have a website and in the last
decade or so what has happened
everyone's like we need an app we need
an app so almost everyone wants to come
up with their own apps and again almost
any area you take you take banking you
take dating life you take personal
finances you take games you take social
entertainment write news articles movies
music everyone has their own mobile apps
right so that's that's how people are
increasing their dependency on
technology it started off with building
actual and applications
- web UI portals all these internet or
internet relay 'td applications and then
people are all building all these mobile
apps right so technology keeps
increasing by coming up with more and
more platforms for people and again once
you have all this mobile development you
need to have constant maintenance on it
right every time phones especially this
iPhones man the phone screen size change
the iOS upgrades happen all the time
so when you're the developer behind that
application or when you're the business
analyst for such an application you
always want to make sure that you're up
to the mark with new changes coming up
right so if iPhone says hey we're
changing our phones we're coming up with
the S models and our screens are going
to be much bigger you have to make sure
you work with your developers and say
hey if the new models are released are
we gonna be ok with our application can
you make sure that the screen size will
not be an issue can you make sure the
new iOS version is not going to be any
impact to our applications right because
what happens we've come to a generation
where we don't want to wait anymore
right we lose patience just in a matter
of minutes right there used to be a time
when we had DSL connection and when we
had internet we would just sit there
waiting for the AOL page to load up but
now even if the page is taking a minute
to load and if we see that loading
happening we get frustrated so quickly
right if the same thing happened to
applications we stopped using
applications eventually and will always
say oh it always freezes on me it
doesn't work updates make it fail it
crashes on my phone people get
frustrated they don't want to use it
anymore right so because of those
reasons companies and organizations I've
always have to be on top of it to make
sure that there's a team dedicated
towards the maintenance and we'll make
sure any new changes coming up will
still comply with that will still work
with every version we won't have an
issue anywhere all right so because the
cost of losing customers or the cost of
having a deliverable that doesn't
fulfill the initial requirements is very
very damaging to the company
reputation wise Fame wise jobs wise even
financially for that matter right so 71%
of failed software projects are actually
happening because of poor requirement
management and when we say poor
requirement management it's not always
the business analysts who are
responsible for that it could be because
stakeholders didn't think of a full
picture or the business analyst didn't
do the best job or the technology team
didn't understand that or something went
wrong in translating the requirements
from stakeholders to technology teams it
could be any one of those incidents that
has contributed for that to have
happened where requirements were poorly
managed and we'll see when we start our
first of a very first session we'll show
you the SDLC cycle of all the different
phases and how one phase gives the
doorway to another phase so we'll see if
requirements become poor so if that
impact is actually like a bottleneck
effect on all other consecutive phases
so we're gonna see how one thing can
actually lead the entire project to fail
which is why requirements are critical
I'm not saying it's the critical phase
every phase is important in its own ways
because it is making its own
contribution some more some less some
major some not but if the requirements
are poorly designed there's not much we
can do from there because the source
itself is screwed up and now if that's
messed up then everything else after
that is only gonna be a downfall 40% of
the effort in an average software
project is actually fixing errors right
so others business analysts how can we
help for that to reduce right first of
all what's the problem if we're saying
40% of effort is actually going in
fixing bugs what does that even mean
first of all that there were too many
bugs that was released into production
so testing didn't do a good job or
business analyst didn't come up with
accurate requirements so if 40% of the
effort is going in fixing bugs we're
adding so much extra cost to doing a
development and then fixing that
development so it's on it's an
unnecessary cost for us to have extra
testing people
extra developers be is to validate PMS
to oversee and product owners to spend
time on fixing issues right so all that
can actually be avoided if we did a
better job in managing our requirements
aligning the test cases to those
requirements testing all of it before it
goes into production to ensure that one
the system is free of errors and two
it's aligned to your product owners to
your stakeholders so before it goes live
into production your stakeholders should
take a look at it at test environments
and say staging test or UAT and say okay
I'm okay with this right so till you
have those kind of sign offs till you
have those kind of approvals you don't
want to go into production because as
soon as you go into production your cost
will increase your criticality will
increase right and the escalation so
obviously increase a lot more according
to certain stats almost 250 billion
dollars of money is actually being
wasted in poor requirements right so
when you have poor requirements your
result is a fail your product ends up
failing nobody wants to use it nobody so
all the effort that you've put into it
is just a waste of money and a lot of
times also what happens is especially
those long projects when you fall when
you follow a waterfall tomorrow people
will spend like six months on working on
the requirements and then eventually
they'll realize okay we're not getting
anywhere with this I don't think we're
going to accomplish our goal because
we've already we're already in a mess
and it's not easy to fix this mess so
when that happens this actually
management actually tells people to stop
working on it and they say just close
that project and everything put
everything in the back end don't put
anything into production move everyone
from that project to somewhere else
right so when that happens what's
happening it might have not gone into
production but the money that you've
invested in all your resources for those
six months is all a waste now right so
you lose a ton of money in resources if
your requirements are not properly
defined
and again the bottom line of all these
things is that we need to do a better
job at collecting the requirements
putting up their requirements in our
documentation and we have to make sure
that our product team our stakeholders
agree with the requirements we've come
up with they should say yes this makes
sense yes I agree with this yes please
go ahead till they give you that
sign-off till they're convinced till
they're assured that this is a good
thing or this is aligned to the way
they're thinking we might not want to
move it to production till they approve
it okay otherwise you're gonna end up
spending a lot of money
by putting into deployment and then
fixing all of that deployment through
bug tracking bug fixes redeployments all
those things are unnecessary redundant
additional costs right so because people
are spending billions of dollars in
developing it and then several billions
of dollars just fixing a bunch of bugs
so it's important for us to keep in mind
that we need to do a better job in
defining proper requirements and to
validate that the requirements we've
come up with satisfy our stakeholders
needs and then technology team
understands it right so because again in
that transition all as well we might
actually lose a lot when the business
analyst works with the technology team
it's possible for us to misinterpret for
them to misunderstand and any such
miscommunications will actually have a
much bigger cost towards the end so the
bottom line is saying if we examine
those those several numbers that we've
encountered from those stats almost 25%
of all spending on software is rework
associated with requirements right so
you don't want people to say well the
BIA did a terrible job at that and
believe it or not I might sound like I'm
exaggerating it people actually do say
that in projects saying hey maybe the
business analyst didn't understand was
stakeholder said or maybe the business
analyst didn't give the requirements
correctly to the technology teams they
will often blame the business analyst
for giving poor requirements so you want
to make sure while you're doing it you
validate the requirements with both
sides and you also have at least one
sign-off session with both together
technology team and stakeholders so that
everyone's on the same page and it gets
signed off with everyone on the same
page saying this is what we're going
with so that nobody should blame you end
of the day and say maybe the business
analyst did a terrible job because even
though it might not be your fault
they might blame you so for you to take
out that accountability from you you can
make sure you have both of these parties
together under one roof and come up with
a review session with a sign-off process
so you'll have some sort of proof and
evidence and say well we all agree to do
this to do it this way people have even
signed off to do it this way before it
went into production all right and again
it's not about playing a blame game here
it's not about escaping from that blame
but it's about ensuring that as a
business analyst if I am the liaison
between the product on one side and the
technology on the other side I want to
make sure once I come up with a proposal
with the solution recommendation I want
to make sure both parties are involved
in that sign-off process both agree
because the product team all they're
looking at is from the business
perspective right and technology team
they might not value the business
perspective as much as they other
stakeholders might so they're just
thinking from a system perspective is as
possible is this feasible do we have
license for this do we have a constraint
here do we have a limitation here do we
have the support for this do we have the
platform for this is this compatible
with what we're doing way they're
thinking more from a system development
back-end standpoint and the product team
is thinking from a UI front-end
perspective and saying if this is what
it looks like this is what it's going to
do because they have their own
expectations so you want to make sure
they all meet somewhere on the same page
and say well this is the set expectation
so this is what we're expecting the
outcome to look like right so we'll come
in the future
we'll come up with a couple of different
things on how we can come up with
effective ways of coming up with proper
techniques right people say build proper
prototypes people say poor do proper
testing make sure you come up with in a
better documentation good wire flow
diagrams good process flow diagrams
right so when we talk about those things
we'll also talk about what are all the
different possible tools for us to use
to come up with all these things right
so I want to make sure everyone is even
familiar with Microsoft Visio you will
definitely need Visio to build
wireframes process flow diagrams so as
we come up with more sessions coming up
we'll talk about Visio but if you don't
have Visio you can always download a
trial version don't do it just yet maybe
when we in the middle of the session or
towards the end of the session when we
come up with that project maybe that
might be a better time to install Visio
so that you and cash those 30 days by
being familiar and in cashing those
entire 30 days by practicing because I
want to make sure every business analyst
is familiar at least with one or the
other drawing tools where you can draw
mock-ups wireframes UI screens build
process flow diagrams all these things
are some of the things we're gonna see
in this class and you also get
assignments to be able to prove your
potential as well because again remember
your homework assignments have to be
very very committed you have to make
sure you put your effort into it because
the better effort you put into it the
more familiar you'll be with it and the
more comfortable that'll make you in
your interviews so it's clear that
improving business analysis capabilities
can actually have a significant impact
on the bottom line right absolutely
one more thing is certain organizations
might do the same thing again and again
continuously so sometimes doing the same
way will get the results and sometimes
it may not so you should always be open
to the option on how do we adapt to
what's happening today to make sure we
succeed right it's almost like the
survival of the fittest concept where
we're saying this is how today's world
is how can we meet those expectations
how do we meet those standards so that
we don't over so that we're not left
behind you also need to think from that
perspective so sometimes doing things
differently will actually make a
difference will actually make an impact
a positive impact in your development in
your project towards the organization so
the BOD again the bottom line is
business analysis can make a significant
difference it can actually make things a
lot smoother if you do it the right way
but then if you don't give it your best
shot and if you do a poor job or if you
take it for granted
it can actually have a bottleneck effect
on all the consecutive stages meaning
all your deliverables that's coming out
of each of those phases after your
requirement sessions can be flawed
because the requirements have flaws all
right so do we have any questions so far
again if you don't understand every
single thing so far it's okay because
we're gonna expand into more details all
these things are gonna be discussed
again in one way or the other and if we
still don't address it at some point you
can always ask me questions do we have
any questions yes sir hiney so let's say
if I want as a business analyst so my
first job would be understanding the
requirements right so I'm not in the
requirements then I can go to the ID and
tell them this is what we are looking at
right correct I mean if you can I have
mean you mentioned couple of times has
it been business analyst we need to have
it thorough
understanding our application so let's
say me if I do not have a domain
knowledge or how to get that you know a
hack of that complete application how do
we get that I mean it it to experience
or you know or point your users or I
mean certainly experience is the best
way to gain knowledge on that but you
also have to decide right pick your
stream decide what you think will
interest you the most what do you think
will fit the best for you some people
might say I've made up my mind I'm
sticking to healthcare
totally fine with that so work on all
the topics on all the discussions
towards healthcare so you're
knowledgeable especially with you know
new administration in our country today
new healthcare policies how are
regulations coming in how is healthcare
changing how is the insurance industry
changing all having knowledge of all
these things might actually help you
succeed in the healthcare sector right
if you say you know what I think finance
will suit me I did my MBA and I think
I'll be better off in the banking side
great you learn as much as possible
about banking about finance because
people will ask you in interviews and
say for example let's say you go to
JPMorgan Chase for an interview people
will ask you like how much do you know
about the basic finance right not every
project will ask you a question like oh
do you know how derivatives work right
some projects will ask you specific
questions like that and those things are
usually mentioned in your requirements
right I'm sorry in your job descriptions
so I'm saying when you apply for jobs
read those job descriptions see where
the emphasis is because sometimes people
will say having a knowledge on
derivatives is a must right experience
in this category is required so when
they say things like that those things
as mandatory so either you can see a
familiar similar theme and a lot of
requirements of what is required for you
to have if you want to get into finance
and work on those topics or you could
say well this is too specific for me I'm
looking for something more generic so
right what would you recommend I mean me
having
it depends on the domain so having that
background for you I think you're good
when it comes to IT you there's not much
for you to learn other than the proper
definitions and terminologies from a
business analyst course but then in
terms of the domain if you're saying I
want to get into banking and finance
then you need to show some sort of
initiative to show that you have
interest in this right you can say hey I
have a portfolio that I manage myself I
have some investments I you know invest
money in the market all these are some
of the ways for them to know that you
have knowledge about these things or you
can say I'm considering to pursue my CFA
level one I just did my MBA I have
knowledge on this right you have to come
up with something that will show them
that you're showing efforts or that
you've already done certain things to
show that you have knowledge right and
again there's no one answer to this not
everyone would workout in one way so you
have to decide based on your strengths
and weaknesses based on your aspirations
and where you want to get into based on
that you can decide how can you come up
with something that shows that you have
knowledge in this any other questions
does anyone fall asleep again like I
said I like making it interactive if you
have questions you have suggestions you
want to add any value here to the
discussions please feel free to do so
especially if I bore you out and make
you fall asleep I think that that's a
better way to get involved to get more
involved so you don't fall asleep so
again we're gonna have sessions like
these each session is going to last
about two hours so at any point if you
have any questions we'll definitely make
sure those questions get addressed
are we good so far no questions I know
if you wanted to get a certification
done uh-huh
so do we really need to start looking
into the BOK the via Bach will be your
guideline so if you're considering
certifications yeah definitely start
reading it look at the topics I mean if
you start reading it now some might make
sense I might not but definitely keep in
keep in mind that at least by end of
week one you should start reading that
book but if you want more of an
understanding of this and applying for
jobs then you don't need to beat that
book as much because that book is less
it relates less to working real-life
scenarios what today's world is like
it's more towards like this is the book
this is the certification these are some
of the topics and concepts you need to
master to pass the certification that's
more the intention of that book so it's
up to you how you want to see it yeah in
book which one Oh in management okay
yeah I mean even within PMP like PMP
would be the actual certification or you
can apply for the cap m2 if you have
less experience you don't have as much
experience you can use the PM bak so in
in our case watch which certification do
you recommend I would recommend the ECB
a so that's the entry-level in business
analysis so that's easier because one it
has less requirements for you to say
because like if you go for like CC ba or
any higher level of business analyst
certifications they expect you to have
certain work experience some will say a
year-and-a-half experience or three
years experience so because of that a
lot of people might not be qualified but
ECB is more like an entry-level it's
more like an associate certification so
one it's doable most likely if when
you're spending money for a
certification exam like that most likely
there's a better likelihood that you'll
pass an exam like that and there's less
restrictions if you're eligible for that
or not so
I believe they're expecting you to have
maybe like 20 20 20 to 25 hours of
training and you're also you're already
getting that as part of this so you'll
be eligible to take that exam okay
thanks
any other questions guys all right if we
have no other questions I look forward
to talking to you guys this week
most likely tomorrow I'm not exactly
sure about the fixed schedule yet but I
look forward to see you all in my
sessions as well alright have a
wonderful night we'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
