hello everyone very good morning and
good evening
Parminder here welcome to SMEs for Hana
simple logistics introductory session I
hope you all are able to hear me clearly
and you are able to see my screen if we
are facing any issues and problems with
audio or video please contact the
support team or drop a message to the
question window so that the support team
can help you with the audio or screen
sharing issues today's session is
basically before we start actually
before we ramp up our training just to
you know have more interactive session
where I can answer your queries
questions related to the course and
other stuff whatever the questions you
have whatever whatever the queries you
have what would be covered what would
not be covered how will be conducting
the training so all of these questions
we are supposed to answer in this
session so what I would do I would also
try to cover one of the topic it depends
on the time we have and I would also
start with quickly showing that what we
have done in our demo session what
topics we have covered or just giving
you a brief again and then we'll
straight away start with the question
and answer session if you have any kind
of questions queries related to this
session that will I will answer and
based on the remaining time I will start
with one of the topic of basically
history basics of history of SLP and
history of SME Hana
so in our last week's session what we
have done we have quickly covered that
what are the benefits to take this
course and why everyone most of the
function consultants are required to
learn as a ps4 HANA so I will quickly go
through the slides which we have gone
through in our demo session so we
discussed that you know the Hana is a
biggest change which is coming it's not
only the database change with the
database change a lot of capabilities
are getting improved and to address
those improved capabilities as for Hana
has a lot of new features
functionalities and new interfaces which
a functional consultants is required to
learn those things also include the new
interfaces like hana studio fury some VI
tools like Lumira emitted analytics
okay so a lot of things are coming new
which are basically changing the market
conditions and also changing the profile
which is required in market who will
deal with the new technologies so we we
have seen that a lot of projects are
coming which is related to the analytics
SME HANA analytics products a lot of
projects are coming which is related to
sa PS rohana migration convergence and
the customers who are basically till now
they are not there on SME hana or not on
SP so the greenfield projects all of the
greenfield projects are directly coming
honest ApS for Hana because in the era
of this booming technology nobody wants
to start with the older versions even
with SMEs for Hana also the clients are
more interested that they want to go
with this not with the 1511 the latest
availability of 1610 or 1709 and they
have also very specific requirement
there that they want to go with support
path one release which is the latest one
so everybody wants to go with the latest
technology so this we have seen that
they are hardly any clients which is
going with the Greenfield
implementations of ECC all of the
Greenfield implementation is coming on
as
yes vahana and most of the projects
which is coming related to the analytics
okay that's also include ICP Hana so
Hana has also introduced us to use as
analytics as a sidecar we'll discuss it
in detail so that kind of projects are
also coming up so all of these things
are actually changing the knowledge of
function consultant have the areas and
the tools are function consultant knows
so due to that shift we mentioned that
it's very necessary to learn s ApS for
Hana the new capabilities and the new
technologies which is coming in the
market we have also seen some of the
market trends that how what is the
requirement in the market and versus
that how how many profiles are available
in the market so you can see here if you
can see that around ten thousands jobs
are there in the market which talks
about sapa so Hana there is only one
profile available in the market so the
the ratio is between ten thousands jobs
for Strings which talks about this
recipe is for Hana and compared to the
resumes of a labels or the sieve is
available on the market it's come ten
thousand comparing to the ten thousand
is only one CV available in the market
which says that we they have some skills
or proficiency related to a CPS for Hana
so we discuss about the target audience
that all of the functional consultants
are the major target audience for this
you don't require any functional
knowledge you don't require any Hana
knowledge is not required it's not a pre
requisite
will provide you all of the related Hana
knowledge or basics of Hana will be
chained in this training so if you don't
know anything about Hana
don't worry we'll let you know all of
the things you are required to know
basics of SLP modules are required so
you should know one of the basics SFP
module so either mm s T or P P so that
basic knowledge of SLP is very much
required to go ahead with this training
so this training
is different from the other market
available training because quite
interactive training we give a lot of
chance to their users and the
participants to ask questions and around
20 to 25 percent of the training part
you will see that we cover answering the
different questions users have there are
a lot of other market trainings
available which basically is only
webinar training where user doesn't get
chance to interact with the trainings
although it's a live training but
there's no question also happening
during the training but this training we
give a chance users to get interact we
open the sessions for the
question-and-answer and each and every
questions we try to answer in detail and
other than that in the other trainings
available in market you will see that
90% of the sps for our simple logistics
of trainings available in the market
they only talk about Hana and when it
comes to simplifications when it comes
to the modules BPM MST there is not much
content provided in our last session I
have shown the our last training which
we have conducted it went to 28 sessions
in total and around 20 round 13 or 14
sessions we have dedicatedly spent on
the simple logistics on the different
modules that what are the new fury
applications are there what are the
changing changes are there what
configurations are there so this
training is basically that we have our
topics which is hand-picked so that a
consultant a functional consultant can
quickly jump into a new project that
project can be a SMEs for Hana migration
project conversion project it can be a
greenfield project or it can be a HANA
analytic project so we have hand-picked
the topics which is required for the
consultant to go into the new projects
so in this handbook tropics we have
covered in between the migration tools
we have covered basics of SME Hana
because when we go into the client sites
try and ask you all of questions related
to what is Hana how it will help to
answer those all of these questions the
basic knowledge of
required so that we have covered we have
also covered the embedded analytics
because there are some projects coming
which all which are still using Hana
only as a sidecar and only analytics is
run on SME Hana so there also the
functional consultants are required so
that topics also we have picked where
basically we tell you that how Hana can
be used for the analytics purpose and
then we covered the fury part in detail
because that is the biggest change in
future GUI is going to stop and the
future interface is only the fury so we
cover fury in detail all of the
applications how to install them and
then the simplification in each of the
module that what are the changes coming
so that's how our training our content
is quite different you will not get in
any another training which is available
in market so these are the training
roadmap and we have covered that what
all the topics which will be covering we
start with the very basics so if you
already have a lot of knowledge related
to SME Hana and other stuff so you need
to little patience because the course is
conducting like that we start from very
scratch telling you what is this ap Hana
how it is built
what kind of different capabilities as
ap Hana has then we start with the
embedded analytics that other analytics
tools which we have we also covered Hana
live then we covered the basics of SPS
for Hana how the projects works
we covered the cloud topics on
enterprise cloud on a cloud platforms
and then we covered the data modelling
which is again part of the embedded
analytics we also train you that if you
if you are required not all of the
projects required if you are required in
a Hana project to create a data models
or in s for Hana products also sometimes
functional consultants require a
knowledge to create data models so we
also note tell you that how to create a
data models in Hana and we also extended
that how these data models can be used
quickly in the BI tools without any
and of coding okay with the graphical
tools of the BA tools can be used and in
in in the data providing also we covered
the tools in details we covered SLT we
covered be ODS we covered on a migration
cockpits okay and when it covers two
simplifications we go step by step first
we cover the master data part where the
business partner is the biggest topic
then material number changes then we go
module by module and we check in each of
the modules what other things changes
what are the new configurations required
what are the new fury applications are
coming which will make user life more
simpler and in the last topic we will
talk about in detail about the
certification exam what are the
different certification exams available
or which certification exam you can go
and opt for after this training and
we'll also cover the details what other
change is coming in 1709 in our last
session so altogether it will be covered
we'll be covering this in and we'll try
to cover in one and a half month but
general experiences that course can take
up to two months to complete this
training all of the training materials
ebooks will be provided to you so we
share it through the Google Drive we'll
be sharing the session notes web links a
lot of links will be provided to you
which has a lot of useful material
session session presentations would be
provided to you will also provide you
handouts and some notes assignments and
quizzes also provided hands-on
experience will be provided so most of
the part is not a theoretical training
in the initial part is little bit
theoretical when we talk about the
basics of ICP Hana but after a couple of
or two or three sessions we quickly jump
into the different tools then it's
mostly around 60% will be 60 to 70%
we'll be covering that different tools
it's kind of own and straining and 20 to
30% we'll be talking about the
theoretical part
all of the sessions are recorded and the
recorded is provided by the support team
through the portal within 24 hours
server access would be provided for two
months in our session I have shown you
that what are the things we have
available through a remote desktop
server if you still have answer them so
today I will be covering with the very
basics the history of ICP Hana but
today's session is more about the
interacting more about answering your
questions your queries about the
training so before starting off any
topic will go through the participants
and will check if you have any kind of
questions I can answer them now related
to training are related to the basic
stuffs which we have covered so far I
can see one hand is rates I'm jet so I'm
dead I have unmuted you you can ask your
question now
other participants also either you can
raise your hands if you have any
questions or you can put your question
on the question window yeah I am jet
please go ahead I'm not able to hear you
clearly
let me check if it is related to my from
my side the volume is low yeah yeah
please go ahead now shall I speak bit
loud no no it's fine actually the volume
was low from my sight okay fine
see what I understand is that you know
that the percentage of sessions you know
theoretical and practical how much
practical sessions are there here number
one okay
second going because as I see you know
the delta part what you are covering
here is related to the more of a basic
model s DMM and P P what about you know
CRM you initial models like yes RM CRM
TM you know because you know they have
different data models of transferring
you know you would
for example AP also you will transfer
data through from ERP to this new model
through SIF ok so what about these are
these data embedded now in it yes for
Hana itself or still they need to be
transferred you know kind of thing ok so
first to answer your question that how
much is the theoretical part covered and
how much as sub practical things we'll
be covering in this so we talk we start
with the very much basics of SOP Hana
right so that basic sessions that would
be two to three sessions would be only
the theoretical sessions after that as
soon as we start with the hana studio
and we start with the migration tools
like we'll be covering SLT will be
covering a migration cockpit how hana
studio can be used will be covering
rapid data migration and B ODS so
everything as soon as you cover the
basics one everything we do is on the
system so what I do that if I pick one
topic let's say SLT I will spend fifteen
to twenty minutes to explain you what is
SLT how it can be used what are the
difference in area we can use in SLT
then we jump into the system to see how
to configure SLT or how to use a cell T
as soon as we have talked about as a
tiana will be jumping into the hana
studio
i will be explaining that how to use
hana studio what are the different
features are there everything will be
explained on hana studio which is kind
of a hand so on so after the initial
two-three session you will see that
twenty percent is twenty to thirty
percent is thirty
and 70% will be on the tools we'll be
doing on the tools itself but bender if
I'm not wrong like migration tool are
these responsibilities of a functional
consultant or a you know being a bi
personal we'll be doing this no not the
BI guy there's no involvement of the BI
guy for the migration migration we'll
talk about the different scenarios so we
have something like software SEM
software update manager which has a
option of with data migration BMO option
okay
so there are the different strategy to
do the migration so if you do we do with
this SEM with DMO we'll also discuss
this then a lot of things is done by the
basis team okay but we have one other
migration options when we are doing a
conversion or for the greenfield
migration you will be required to use a
migration cockpit need to be used by
functional consultants you need to use
SLT if it is a sidecar scenarios we'll
discuss that how when SLT is used for
the migration it can be done the
function consultant okay vo TS we'll be
covering in detail that what function
and features it has because in the
conversion also sometime you don't use
as you am DMO some time you use LS MW
some time you use migration cockpit some
time you will require to use be ODS but
beauteous will be done by a separate
team but I will show you one time own
beauties so what you need to understand
that the first thing is that when you
pitch into a project how to do the
migration which tools need to be
selected whether we need to go with this
option or with V ODS option or with my
migration cockpit option or you need to
select LS MW which tools need to be
selected that would be the first
question which need to be answered by a
functional consultants or architects
okay okay to know that you need to have
a knowledge of all of these tools that
would be explained with the hands-on
other than be ODS okay okay and be
honest itself is the model be odious
itself is a model in itself right and
here it I see it is a form of a tool now
anyway itself it is not a module it's
not a itself is a product it says a pre
different products which is used with
used for any kind of data migrations yes
ETL basically right it's a basically ETL
tool that's right that's right
so that's why we said that when you
pitch into a migration project or a
conversion project there can be a
different options you have so to select
that in which scenarios you should
recommend your client to go for be ODS
in which scenario you can say that ok LS
MW is fine in which scenario you say
that migration cockpit is required or
you need to create some your your own
programs to do the migration so that all
will be discussing and to make that
decision you need a knowledge of all of
these tools okay thank you
now covering the second part which is
related to you know the SRM senior your
APU your TM that ewm okay so EWN is now
core part of s for Hana from 1610
version TM is introduced with s for Hana
with 1709 is again core part of s for
Hana in AP o P PDS has been introduced
with s for Hana from 1511 onwards they
have introduced nursery from 1610 so
this is the PDS which has been come into
s for Hana so in our training SRM is
going to be obsoleted okay FM is going
to be optional ated we still need to
have some confirmation that the new CRM
or the which functionality which exactly
will be coming with s for Hana
but right now this all SRM and CRM can
work with us for Hana with the same kind
of interfaces which it was having with
ECC so just shortening the topic that
what we cover in our trail
we'll be covering that how this P PDS
change would be happening because we
cover the PP production planning part
that how the data models is going to
change what would happen to the SIF what
would happen to the life cash when the
pvds is coming as an integral part of
the apu so that basic things will be
covering because it's part of the pp
okay we don't cover anything related to
the ewl okay
neither we don't cover anything related
to the TM transport management because
right now the server access also we have
1610 which doesn't have T L so TM and DW
m are very specific areas which require
experience which require a specific
training and experience to handle these
tools or TM and E debris on so other
than you have not worked on these
modules you cannot cover I don't have
any exposure to TM I don't have any
exposure to e W so we don't cover these
modules in our training SRM are called
covered that yes behind permit for the
benefit of the crowd I think I can I can
contribute in this tereus TM e WM other
areas apos okay if we could just just I
had another questions like you know how
what about the other products of our you
are another concur so this all product
let's say if you want to know Arriba no
I want no no that's easy I I am NOT
expecting that you cover everything here
but in Italy because see nowadays the
trend is towards our new models okay and
what is upcoming and what material you
would provide in this area for you know
consultant to explore or you know get
knowledge on those areas I'm not
expecting that you cover each and
everything and it is not possible also
what are the you know guidelines you
provide us you know in terms of getting
these training materials or something
like before example if I want to go with
EWN I understand what is there in 1709
for me
do you provide any materials for this so
what we provide that let me quickly show
you we provide a lot of links so we will
be providing the ebooks which comes from
ICP but the other than the ebooks a lot
of materials are available
within the SP also but that material is
not at the one player scattered at the
different places so what we provide we
provide a lot of links where you can go
through and explore my own okay and I
can show you the links kind of links we
provide and 70 to 80 percent of the
material which is available related to
this is freely available you can go
through and excess it in just for a
sample I can show you the kind of links
which we provide we can yeah just give
me a minute so we share this all of the
things from OneNote so will be also
sharing this one no taxes with you
so this is kind of the links will be
sharing with you with all of the topics
which is required to explore more here
you can go ahead and check that what are
the things available in the systems okay
so these kind of links will be shared
with you for each of the topics
permanent is specially one one 7:09
if I want to see something you know
what's coming up in one 7:09 can you
show up yeah yes we can we can show so
we have a specific session four one
seven zero nine in the last session we
will be covering what is covering what
is coming with one seven zero nine and
we'll be specifically sharing you the
links which will take you that what
exactly changes are coming in the one
seven zero nine where you can read
through the whole document so there is a
two hundred three hundred page document
is there from the sfe so that link will
be shared and there is the twenty page
presentation from the SOP which shows
you at the high level that what other
change is coming with 1709 those links
will be shared if you talk about 1709
okay so I mean the thanks a lot may I go
with my third question or you want to
give it a chance to the other people
let's let's go ahead with the third
question then we'll go back to the
participants yeah see if the clients
today want to go and s4 Hana
implementation okay and like as I said
you know there are new modules and he
wants to implement a set of business
suits okay is there that something
everything available on has for Hana I
or something is not available here
whether he has to implement ERP also
along with this you know core product
along with this are there scenarios like
this or today a customer can go and
simply implement s4 you know no so it's
not like you can simply go and implement
s4 so when we'll be discussing in our
session the first thing we need to you
need to do is you need to check so SP
has provided tools for that so the dual
which is maintenance planner
okay MP so we'll also discuss about this
tool so basically this tool is used by
the basis consultants so what this tool
do that the maintenance planner you give
them that what is your source system and
you mentioned that what is your target
system you go with let's see you
mentioned that you want to go with s4
Hana 16 then then this maintenance
planner check that whether you can
simply switch from your source system
which is ECC to SPS 416 10 or there are
some major things major setbacks for you
which you need to talk with SLP for that
before moving to a CPS for Hannam so
what this maintenance planning to do is
checks all of the add-ons which you are
using all of the business functions
which you are using so this all of the
add-ons and business function is checked
by this tool then it tells you that is
there is any add-ons or business
function which is not supported by a CPS
vahana there is a specific accepting
nodes are also there which clearly
explained that which business functions
are not supported by SPS for Hana so
we'll share those asipi notes also with
you so this will be telling you this
tool will be telling you that if there
is any business function there is any
add-on which you are using and not note
it cannot be supported by the current
versions of SPS for Hana then the
discussion start coming that whether we
have seen in our life scenarios that
there are some business functions which
got activated
we just got activated but the actual
businesses are not using them okay so
for those kind of business function now
you need to start analyzing that whether
you can deactivate those business
function there are specific notes has
been provided by ICP to activate some of
the business function to move to s for
Hana 1610 and if the nodes are not there
then you need to contact SP and they
also provide you some solutions for that
so then you need to think about based on
this analysis which come from this
maintenance planner then whether you can
move to s 416 10 or you need to wait for
the next versions to come up so that
your functionalities are fully supported
there right now s ApS for Hana doesn't
support all of the functionalities
although it has a lot of things that say
it has a advanced ATP but you cannot
replace it with your gtp UTP oh you have
PPD s in s for Hana but it is not
exactly same people D s which was there
in APO so your foreign trade sorry so in
such cases like you know it's so in
short we to say that yes for Hana is not
fully functionally ready to accommodate
all the scenarios
yes so it would be what we have seen
that it covers let's say when you talk
about PPVs so how we pitch it to the
clients so if a client is already using
APO okay so when we with us for Hana we
tell them that PPD s in s for Hana you
don't use it okay you have your S 4 Hana
and you have your s4 on a link with APO
and you use it in the same way it was
working with the ECC the same way if you
have a G ATP we don't pitch in for the a
ATP so this modules are basically
introduced when we analyze the clients
and they are not using APO they are not
using G ATP then we pitch in that with
this for Hana you can additionally also
use a ATP and enhance your capabilities
are available to promise with a ATP and
announce your capabilities with PPD s so
that's how we need to analyze that what
clients we have and how we can pitch
them but you will say that 95 or 98
percent of the basic functionalities are
supported yeah but let's see whatever it
Delta is there but I need to go a mixed
model hybrid model right in such cases
where I
no functionalities are not available so
basically the functionalities if your
core functionality is not available we
don't recommend to go with the hybrid
model so there are some line of
businesses and there are some business
specific solutions which is not
supported with s4 HANA so if you have
the specific solution build and if you
are looking for that we tell you that to
wait for the next version so within the
next versions which would be answered
and then you can go ahead so here
basically if you have some technical
constraint in short in maintenance
planner then it will be decided whether
you can go to s4 HANA or you need to
wait for it ok and do you see these
tools basically there are other tools
like landscape transformation tools also
right here in maintenance planner so do
you cover those as well so maintenance
plan is basically tool used by a basis
so we cover at basic level that how it
need to be used as as a ps4 Hana project
because when you start a project you
need to suggest your client that you use
maintenance planner so it is not only
used for SMEs for Hana but it's used for
the multiple purposes but what we cover
in our training and at how it can be
used for s for Hana migration projects
but definitely it has a lot of
capabilities which can be used for
multiple things and thanks for this
information and apart from this do you
share any information see for example
from our project management perspective
ok number one thing is that or from
pre-sales prospective do you contribute
anything on how does the licensing is
done here in his for what are the
licensing cost here what are the
parameters for this we specifically
don't have that topic but if you are
interested in that that definitely can
be shared so there the basically there
the different license models which SP
has we can definitely share the
information related to that but that
depends a lot the pricing depends a lot
that what you are buying and your
negotiate
with recipe that what different license
will be required let's say we talk about
aap doesn't come with Hana you need to
have a separate license what are the
things which is basically covered with
s4r license though that all party cover
because from a project management
perspective this is very important for
me as and what about this activate
methodology how it differs and you know
do we have any templates you do you have
any template ready-made templates with
you to be shared or best practices what
you are done or you know so example
template do you have this all this so
basically activate methodology we cover
in detail no need to go outside SP has
improved a lot
with s4 mana the many of the templates
are readily available with SP you talk
about your project plan you talk about
your information elected to the cut over
templates cut over plans how the
migration would be happening
how many consultants you might require
everything is available so we share the
links from each and everything we'll
also show you how to access those links
and how to access those materials and
templates which is out of box provided
by our recipe for each of the scenario
they have also provided you the
ready-made
test scripts available so many things
are now available with this activate
mythology it has been provided by
setting so we'll share all of these
things ok last question here how about
like say if I have after the training I
want to reach I need a help from
Permenter is that available like if I
need to consult you yeah as far as you
as far as you are having access to czar
and tech discussion board you can put
your queries there after your course
during your project if you are having
any queries you can put your question on
the discussion board and that would be
answered by me and so as long we have an
access rate and six months worth what
you're saying yes yes okay thanks a lot
thank you I don't know anymore thank you
thank you could you're going to a look
yeah hip I'm in there this is I look let
me just let you know my background
little bit I have a like 15 year
experiencing vws every bit of you mostly
and last budget I did on Native Hana so
this is my background and I have some
questions so maybe some dumb questions
for you but because I don't have any
much functional knowledge mostly on the
bi area so I have some potions because
I'm looking for some jobs in ru and they
are asking for embedded analysis in s4
have a KPI modeler CDs views so are you
gonna cover all these things these three
things CDs use embedded analysis and KPI
mode definitely we are going to cover
the embedded analytics emitted analytics
is covered CDs use are also covered that
how a functional consultant can can use
available CDs views okay but CVS you
variation of the CDs view is quite
technical there is so far a graphical
model is not available for that the
graphical model for the serious views
which function consultant can use might
become by 2020 but we cover that how the
CDs views can be used for the embedded
analytics through fury so that part
would be covered okay and but I heard
like in the 1710 or the latest version
they have this you can make it graphical
also CDs views is it not true yes yes
yes it is that's what we call when we
call emitted analytics from CDs views is
that serious use as a functional
consultants you will be able to generate
in graphs you will be unable to generate
fury tiles from the CDs use that would
be covered as embedded analytics from
CVS view through fury that would be
covered how much fury part is going to
cover like are we gonna build fury from
scratch or will be I'm just gonna touch
it touch base with fury it's not as
detailed we have a specific two to three
sessions where we'll be discussing fury
only so we'll be discussing II and
everything which a function consultant
is required in fury so it should start
from the scratch that our requirement
comes from the client for an application
how
we are at the position which are the
links you need to follow and search for
this application then what configuration
is required we will find the
applications and how to find the odata
services and how to approach the basis
team although we also covered how to
activate or data services but that part
in projects is done by the pieces team
and then how to find it out the roles
which exact roles you need to use and
how to create your catalogs and business
groups and how to create new roles which
business can use how to you know make
really the your Launchpad do the you for
the usage of the business users so that
all part is covered ok and ok that
that's good information like I haven't
another daughter mind like when somebody
is going for as for as for
implementation as for Hana for logistic
for example or as for finance so let us
talk as for logistics implementation so
usually what is a team side like you
know everybody's doing the the training
and many people are already available so
normally a green fill implementation or
a implementation for conversion
migration project so normally like the
how many connect general owner in every
I'm not talking the very big flow at a
small project on an average how many
consultants do they need like I mean one
person is handling all the modules like
SDM MPP or SRM or whatever is there how
do they divide know so that you cannot
rule out that it's a big project or
small project because the team size will
definitely depend on the scale of the
project and on the scale of the scope we
have if you have a multiple systems
let's say if you have if you are using
multiple landscape and if you are trying
to consolidate into one landscape okay
if you are trying to do a consolidation
with scenarios where this appears for
Hana your team size would be very big
you will be having a multiple
consultants for a single module and your
duration to deliver that project is also
big okay but you are talking about only
one system okay one basic
system is a system which you talk about
conversion into a CPS for Hana systems
that can be done within six to nine
months of the period and that will also
depend you know again the scope whether
you are putting Furion scope whether you
are putting further enhancement in scope
for a CPS Ohana whether what kind of
migration you are doing do you need a
data cleansing so this all things that
scope will definitely be a bigger part
to decide the team and to decide the
duration but whatever the configuration
yeah so what we have seen is that if it
is a conversion project you require a
minimum one consultant for each of the
area it's not like one consultant can
cover even a conversion project PPS T
and M em all together so you require a
separate still separate consultants but
in other projects we have seen that you
know sometime you need a two or three
ESD consultants here if it is a simple
conversion project and a smaller scope
you can cover it with a single SD
consultant you can cover with single PP
consultant who also have a basic
knowledge and Q AM and PM covering those
modules cross functionally so to reduce
your team size okay and another thing I
was wondering we have usually working
16:09 as 401 6:09 correct
we'll be working here on 1610
oh sorry 1610 which is the the last one
not the latest one but the second
secondly he has six second latest one so
probably there is then a big difference
in the because the last room per se the
latest one is there any big difference
in these two are not much difference
technically it's a big difference
because it's coming with the now 1709 is
supported with the latest fury version
and it is also supported by Hana 2.0 so
technically it's a big difference
because the latest technical components
are now fully supported with 1709 which
was not there
16:10 fury related changes you will find
a lot of your related changes which is
coming copilot has been introduced with
1709 okay so that would be again a
bigger change and a lot of fury
applications will be introduced so
basics change you will see from any
version we are going forward from now
moving it further if you talk
specifically from the logistics modules
the 70 to 80% india's you will be fine
with the introduction of the new fury
applications okay so that will be
continuing when it will not stop with
1709 it will be continued until 2020 and
furthermore it will continue until
unless you have fury which has can do
all kind of walks to replay replace your
GUI transactions so that simplification
will still keep on going so what you
need to know that how to how to search
for the fury application what new Finity
applications are coming and how to
understand that fury application how to
configure it how to add in in the roles
so that thinks you need to understand
that thing the basic thing will not
change whether you go from 1610 to 1709
or you know it it will not change the
other change from the logistic side
which is coming with 1709 STM is now
integral part sorry which venatori
transport management is now integral
part of it a ps4 HANA that is kind of a
big biggest change in from the logistics
side okay and the two more questions
there very small just you can say yes or
no the IBP I work in integrated business
planning earlier as a be FBI consultant
so if we will get go aware it will
remain it will remain like that IBP
integrated with this planning no
integrated business planning is not
going away
it sure it's coming in so apu at some
point of time is going to stop and it
would be replaced by the different
functionalities IPP will come and your
PPD s will be supported from s4 hana and
your SNP and DP will be supported from
IBP and yugi it be
yeah GDP will be coming as ATP in future
from s4 Hana so that if you will be
divided into the different products
what about SNC the SNC module that will
remain in the core apo SNC SNC I don't
have any idea I need to check okay last
question
what about the adjust I don't understand
why they are pushing to go for
cloud-like I mean what is the big
biggest advantage the big benefit to go
for Hana cloud platform or HEC or HCP
why okay so will again discuss in detail
what is at CP platform what is HEC and
what are the benefits in going into the
cloud platforms but just to shortly
answer your question is that basically
whenever you talk about the cloud you
talk about saving your infrastructures
okay so if you are going with on-premise
you need to buy your own infrastructure
and whenever you buy your own
infrastructure okay let's say you are
planning a airport in Bangalore today in
2018 your planning will not be for 2018
your planning would be that the airport
should cover at least the crowd til 2030
right so what you will be doing in 2080
you would be putting a big
infrastructure which you can say the 50
or 70 percent is not used okay so you
would be having a big infrastructure you
would be putting a big price for it
although you are not using it in cloud
what benefits you get it that you start
from a small right and then you get
bigger bigger and bigger right so when
you starting from small you are paying
only for the small infrastructure which
you are using when you expand your
infrastructure then you need to pay more
and expanding infrastructure is very
easy you know to maintain the different
teams for that so that is a basic
difference between cloud and on-premise
expensive I would be expensive because
this is supported by ASAP and or Amazon
so you have to pay a lot of money so
it's not really expensive right cloud is
expensive but if you will compare the
whole cost we and over the over a period
of time and team sizes which will be
reducing to maintain the servers and
other things if you will see all of
these things cloud will definitely a
better economic solution okay thank you
for me that I do a lot of thank you okay
I would before I go to the next
candidate I would quickly go through
some of the questions on the chat window
because it's little bit for some time
it's pending I have not answered them so
let's go one by one
I have a question
Ilan yeah yeah yes and they please go
out with you yeah yeah I've got one
question suppose for me my client is
already going for a CPS for Hana on
fluency so he has already caught the
recent fury in which he is working okay
now in the in future as you are telling
that ACP is going to go for making the
fury also much more capable of handling
much more complex scenarios so so as we
know that in conventional SAV the
clients they go for a city updates so
how this is how the clients are going to
they are also going in the what does it
suggest to adopt the new fury features
again okay so if you already have a fury
setup if you are using it you can use
the same fury setup but technically you
need to see that whenever you are moving
ahead let's say from s for Hana
15:11 or at for hana 1610 or s4 Hana
1709 there are fury applications which
has been introduced which only support
with the s4 Hana version plus with a
certain fury version so if the birthing
match which you have implemented then
only you will be able to use this
application so in short what I mean to
say is when you have already fury let's
say you are using fury 1.0 so you need
to also switch into the upgrade your
fury as you are upgrading your basic ECC
system to s4 Hana from 15 11 to 16 10 to
17 on oh nine you need to also upgrade
your fury version you need to also
upgrade your Hana versions on a database
versions to get full advantage of all of
the fury applications which has been
delivered by Sippy because when we will
going into the fury application you will
see other than the versions it also
depends on the fury version it also
depends on the Hana button if all three
are capable with what you have
implemented then only that fury app will
work for you okay that means you want to
tell that they have to go go for a blade
of the universal fury motion together to
make the new app technically it's not
required together but and that is what
you are so the recommendation right what
a superior comments experiments that
look at a full advantage of fury
applications we need to upgrade our
system with the new versions so that the
new application which has been delivered
it can be used thank you actually I have
got another question which I could not
ask you on the on the last demo session
this is regarding carry on stir because
actually the thing is that my background
is that
years of experience in Mississippi okay
now in that five years I have got a
consulting experience after that seven
years in project management but though I
have green project management I am fully
fully involved with that technical
things also okay now now as you know the
recent market trained all the all the
person who are going to give you the
projects they are asking for is for
online implementation experience so so
that is one of the major reason why I am
going for this course and for the round
I'll go for the certification also so I
mean certification I see that there are
a couple of certification first is the
functional certification that is is for
on a simple logistic sales another is a
CP activate methodology so from your
perspective if you refer some time on
suit on site is not a problem for me
I can wait also so do you think that it
is better for me to go for a CP activate
methodology kind of certifications or
the function certifications so because
involved for a longer time to in the
project management side what I would
recommend is that you can go with the
activate methodology certification what
benefit you will be getting because
let's say if you want to go with the CL
certifications so what you need to read
you need to read around six books for
that so three books which talk about the
whole ERP functionality because I know
you are in project management although
you also have your technical hand but
through knowing each and every things
which is asked in the certification from
the sales so sales s for Hana
certification include everything about
SD module yes RP is you need to throw
with your basic ERP you need to read all
of these three books plus the more three
books which we here which covers Delta
part of s for Hana so a lot of you know
effort is required here to get certified
here yes and this certification would be
a little bit easy for you because you
are already in the project management
and it has a smaller content and what
would be happening in your profile you
will be
to add your s for Hana certification tag
will come with this certification with
the lesser effort so once you've done
with that then you can try to approach
this one thank you thank you thank you
let me quickly go to the questions which
we have I have a question from early on
so if I'm not spelling it out correctly
in the end okay iliyan has already left
the session no worries
yes without go please go ahead see
though you are going to report ASAP this
Hana Student Response artist can you
just give me a word view right now how
what is the basic functionality and how
it is going to use in our on a platform
sorry I missed your last sentence can
you please repeat in the ACP Hana
platform the what is the high hammer
studio and how what is the advantages of
getting out to use this what is the
benefit out of here getting technically
or functionally what is the okay so hana
studio is again a new interface which is
coming with Hana itself I will not say
it's coming with s for Hana but Hana is
a database okay so to use that database
to use this on a database to access this
on a database a new interface has been
built up which is called Hana studio we
use hana studio to interact with Hana
right so that is on a database right so
this hana studio is having the larger
capabilities not this hana studio is
having a larger capabilities because the
sauna is not only rate of ways
is appliance this Hana has having a
larger capabilities now to get out this
capabilities from hana hana studio has
been used so it has a multiple things it
can be used by functional consultants it
can be used by technical consultants to
write their serious views it can be used
okay to write programs it can be used
your SQL programmers can be used your
application layer programmers Java
programmers can use it and your function
consultants coming to how function
consultant can use it is which we have
seen in the projects this functional
consultant can use directly hana studio
to fetch some of the data if required
and some of the functionalities which is
delivered from hana studio is data
modeling data modeling is again open
questions many people say that it's not
it's for the bi consultants it's not for
the function consultant but it's a
graphical model model tool which can be
used by any consultants who has a
functional knowledge there is no
technical knowledge required so you can
create a data models out of it you can
use some of the tools like SLT can be
directly used from the hana studio so i
am now talking about only what functions
and sentence can do so you can create
data models you can use SLT for the
reader migrations and this data models
you can generate some ad hoc analytics
which is again to be used by the
function consultant note for the end
user for the end user this data model we
plug it with BI tools and then end user
will be using from the BI tools what the
data model has been created so that is
the basic use of Hana studio for
functional consultants my next question
is yeah for the Greenfield
implementation of s for Ana do we
require to have a ECC also to be
installed
Permenter because if you look at into
the 1709 our 16 and 10 or whatever it is
it's not fully explored to
provide you all the functionality in the
s4 Ohana so in that case without
installing the ECC would you execute all
the functionalities in the Ana's s
piranha so the first thing is that when
we talk about Greenville implementation
going to s for Hana before going place
for Ana let's say you're implementing
ECC okay I understand your question but
to answer your question I just going a
little bit Dion a little bit very basic
and very scratch this is your client he
wants to implement ECC ASAP this is a
greenfield project right can we
implement ECC whether this client has a
requirement set of requirement whether
all requirement ECC can fulfill it is
not like that ECC can is delivering what
is under the sky right so client can
have a specific requirement even the ECC
cannot fulfill all of the requirements
so what we do we do the enhancements to
fulfill all of the client requirements
some time client based on the
requirement they come up OK this
functionality will be used in ECC for
the remaining functionality they use
some third-party tool they use or they
said that the planning which is
available in ECC is not sufficient we
need to implement APO transport
management is not properly available in
ECC so you I use otm and integrated with
the ECC so what I am trying to say here
is that when you are doing a Greenfield
implementation you are not moving from
ECC to s for Hana so you don't have any
technical constraint you again have a
client and again have a requirement
right and you have s for Hana when we
are saying in earlier discussion when we
are talking about that all of the
functionalities are not supported which
was in ECC there were some
functionalities which now is not support
exactly in the same vein Isfahan ah but
in the greenfield project that
constraints are not there again you have
often client you have open Greenfield
where client is there with requirement
and it needs to be supported with s for
Hana there will be some requirement
which is not supported for NS for Hana
again what you will be doing you will be
doing enhancements or you will be again
finding out out that okay the PPD s is s
for Hana is still not sufficient
okay client will say okay I go with APO
I use G ATP and PPD s from APO and then
I will be using rest of the
functionality from s for Hana so again
it's more or less it's again the same
thing which we were doing in a
Greenfield implementation in ECC the
same kind of thing we need to do here in
s for Hana
while analyzing the client requirement
yeah please go ahead with your question
now yeah no I'm not talking about the
enhancements per malaria it has some
functionality available whether that
meeting our the business needs are mud
that is a different kind of a thing to
achieve that we go for the enhancements
customization and are some user exists
whatever it is we are doing but if you
look at into the simplify list of the
1709 some of the my module is the PS
area which they are talking about
elimination of the many of the
transactions when you look into the
hello bees and industry sector
professional service they are talking
about the CPM module commercial project
management which basically is a add-on
module on the PS ECC so now without the
ECC being implemented I cannot go with
my CPM model connectivity between these
two so now again again there is a
misconception when we talk about
simplification list we don't talk about
greenfield simplification list has been
clearly mentioned by sfe is to be most
only in the conversion project
mm-hmm there are hundred transactions
which is obsoleted yep here in
Greenfield project this hundred
transaction the client is not bothered
about what has been simplified what has
been removed right because he is not
using except assistant let's say there
is some functionality or hundred
transaction is removed now we need to
use new transaction a Greenfield client
is not bothered about that because he
was not using a zippy it is not
impacting him right so when he will be
coming new there can be some transaction
removed we have no fury app you will be
directly using fury up that
simplification which tells that this
transaction code is not not available
let's just talk about your M B one B is
not available and you need to use me go
right it's Greenfield implementation
when it will be coming he will be
directly using Mego is not more than
that there was some MV one be available
in ECC which is not here so that
discussion in the Greenfield what I am
trying to say is totally different when
we were discussing about the conversion
don't follow the simplification list for
the Greenfield okay so you naturally
made this a that simplification list is
only for the conversion types but when
we for the conversion projects but the
Greenfield whatever is the functionality
is built into the system that can be
utilized if any requirements to be done
additionally those needs to be an axe in
the Greenfield like what we would in the
yes right those need to be enhanced or
we need to find out what other recipe
products now can deliver the
functionality so you have a lot of SCP
products you have Arriba
then SRM is still continuing you have
CRM you have APO you have transport
management UW and different different
things are there so you need to
understand that what is delivered as a
core and what another product you need
to introduce to to fulfill all of your
business requirement but ninety nine
percent nineteen eighty to ninety nine
percent of the basic business
requirements is covered with this for
Hana
okay so basically the first thing will
be starting it with uh I will be quickly
covering what is the history of recipe
hana so before going from the history of
recipe Hana how ICP has proceeded from s
for Hana so basically as if we started
their journey although you wouldn't be
already aware about this that they
started their journey during 1970s with
the r22 tire model here will be having a
presentation layer and a DB okay that
two layers was there it was a real-time
system then they moved around in
nineteen nineties here the interface was
not good it was a black screens was
there then they moved around in 1990s to
r3 where they moved into first time into
a three year three tire real-time system
which is actually from this state it was
called as a OLTP system online
transaction processing system from r3
that was this was a big shift where
basically we moved to a three tire
system where we have a presentation
layer we added application layer and the
DB layer to have a more fast processing
more more live transaction processing
for that and a new interface GUI has
been introduced here during 1990s which
was a biggest difference when you talk
about moving from r2 to r3 your user has
been via the user interface and your
interaction has been very much
simplified and very much enhanced with
the GUI so do i when it was launched in
1990 was a key thing was the key
deliverable and key selling part of r3
now when we are moving to Isfahan are
the same UI we are saying that it's
outdated it's not a good solution for
end-user we need a more simplified
solution which is coming with the fury
here I
then from r3 they moved it to ECC we're
basically Enterprise core component was
build which can linked with quickly
linked with the multiple products like
SRM CRM epu a lot of technical changes
has been done fury has been introduced
and WBC has been introduced netweaver
platforms comes into the picture I Docs
and Ellie's has been coming to the
pictures so a lot of these kind of
changes come into the ECC during 2000
and now again as a bishop ting to sa ps4
HANA which is the biggest change from
here to here here to here or here to
here if we compare this sa ps4 HANA is a
biggest change happening which is
starting from 2015 although between this
part asipi also has a journey which
we'll discuss in the last slide with the
hana okay so now the ECC has been
shifted to s4 hana what is SS represents
the SP 4 represent the 4th generation of
recipe and hana represent the database
why hana word has been used in this war
zone hana board has been using this
version because the s4 hana is the first
solution of SOP which has a constraint
that it can only work with the hana DB
your Isfahan a solution cannot work with
NEX database although this ones can work
with NEX database db2 or oracle
databases or ibune databases it can work
but s4 hana can only work with the Hana
database that's why the Hana word has
been used and this database is much much
it say that 10 years higher with the
traditional database which were using in
ECC because of the capabilities it has
ok
so as for Hana when it comes the first
version comes in 1511 ok 15 is what year
15 represent by year
and 11 represent by month the next
version came in 16 October 6 1610 and
then 17 September so each year there
will be one version will be released for
SMEs for Hana okay and the naming
convention is year and the month for the
was a name that is on premise we are
discussing about then this solution
again also come with the cloud with
cloud also will be discussing there the
multiple options available it can come
with cloud and it also can come with the
private cloud so with the public cloud
rather than a yearly innovations they
have a quarterly innovation so each
water there will be one version for a
public cloud versions and for the
on-premise versions we have every year
we have every year we have version now
when it moved from ECC to s for Hana it
is not a single step shift will now in
the next slide we will see that how Hana
has been built and how the shifts has
been happen in between of this a lot of
product has been launched by ICP first
Hana has been launched and then another
products which can support Hana that was
launched so there is a big journey which
s apena Hana has already has gone
through now the product which we have is
esfahan ax which is also called the core
component digital code is another word
which is used in the digital core the
core component would be s for Hana
before going to Esfahani will discuss
that this is it move with the simple
finance but after simple finance s if we
realized that they should be again a
core component which has all of the
functionalities so they put it s for
Hana
now as for Hana is a product which will
be having simple finance also and having
the simplification for all of the
logistics modules also and it supports
all of the modules which was supported
by ECC
okay so that's the quickly I covered
that what is the journey from r2 to s4
Hana
let me quickly move to the next slide
okay just a question for you so we will
be having this kind of quiz and
questions during our session so to give
you a flavor of this there is a question
for you
you can type down your answers on the
chat window and everybody need to answer
it in the last slide we have seen as if
we shifted from two-tire system from r2
and r3 and ECC to a3 tire system now
with SME Hana and with s4 Hana what kind
of tire system is it is it a two-tire
system one tire system three tire system
or a four tire system what kind of tire
system we have with SOP Hana
applications you can type down your
answer in the chat window so just to
know that this is the one of the
question which is also asked in the
certification exams our answer is three
tire our answer for tire however the
other other participants one tire okay
then fourth is for tire so most of the
people say is that either it is three
tire or it is a four tire so the
actually what is happening with us for
Hana is when Hana comes as a database
the different layers it has a DB layer
that's why we call it you will be having
your Hana is not called a database it's
appliance they have also put it one
application layer so application layer
is within built up within this database
itself which is called excess
application layer so you what you need
to use if you want to use a high honor
at the database you just need a browser
or you just need your application layer
your presentation layer you can connect
with the Hana reader base and you can
use a database application layer for
application layer perspective so you can
use a database itself so with this one
it's a too tired system with this
architecture but it is not mandatory to
use the application layer from HANA data
base you can also have your third party
application layer you can connect here
then you can connect here if you follow
this architecture it is still three tire
so what is the right answer for this
right answer for this is both is a
multiple choice questions it has a
multiple answers so answer for this
question is B and C together
it's a two-tire system also and it's a
three tired system also okay I will come
back to your questions lets me quickly
move to the next slide
now the first question we need to answer
answer is I have you know the people I
have also seen that the people having
experience on Hana or as for Hana still
they are not able to answer this
question that what is the key difference
between sp Hana while we talk about suit
on Hana or we talk about s for Hana so
whenever we will be talking about Hana
we talk about the simplifications but
actually for the consultants is making
the things more complex because of the
more and more terminology which is I
didn't put it up more and more products
we have in in in the market now earlier
it was only easy see the life was
simpler now we have more and more
terminology and more and more products
into the market so first thing we need
to understand what is the difference
between all of these products so to
discuss this will will understand first
try to understand how evolution happen
for a seppie Hana so SP Hana was
introduced somewhere around 2010 and 11
okay SP launched their first product as
SP Hana which was a in-memory database
system so here Hana was introduced as a
database system
there was no application ASAP
application which can directly support
here or which can be built only for ICP
Hana so in in-memory database system was
launched by a CPA around 2011 because it
was only database so anyone can use it
so different third party players start
using as a P Hana as an in-memory
database to use its capabilities and
basically because it was having a higher
speed capabilities it can process very
fast
mostly it was used for the analytical
proper purposes so the first scenario
which come with Hana was a sidecar
scenario where Hana was used as a
sidecar although a lot of companies has
used SOP Hana as just as a database to
build their own
vacation on top of it so that was the
first launch which happened from recipe
as a P Hana when you talk about is a P
Hana it's a product it's not necessary
that you can only run F SOP related
things you can run multiple things on
SME Hana it's a database which can be
used purely with for any purposes during
2012 SP comes with their first product
which was BW powered by SP Hana which is
also called BW for Hana
now this BW for Hana which is powered by
SP was a first system or first
application which can support or which
can only run on SP Hana and which can
fully utilize the capabilities of SP
Hana again but it was only for OLAP
offices own line analytical purposes not
for the transaction purposes what
benefit we got from when we searched
from BW 2 BW for Hana we get the
real-time analysis
earlier the PW was only with the delays
one day delay and the speed to generate
reporting's out of BW was also enhanced
like anything with this product then as
happy mood had and they introduced their
first product which can do both
analytical processing and production
processing both together in 2013 they
introduced a CP suit on Hana
so when we said SP suit on Hana is
nothing we are having our ECC system and
we are doing a technical upgrade of our
database and now ECC is used on the Hana
database that is called suit on Hana so
don't confuse with suit on Hana with
Hana or s4 Hana
soo-dong Hana you will be still using
your ECC with enhancement pact 7 or
enhancement pact 8 you will do a
technical upgrade of your database
rather than using ex database you will
be using your HANA data base so now the
ECC is can be also supported by Hana
which is called suit on Hana the
benefits here we get it here that the
most kind of the complex reports which
earlier we said that we need to deliver
it through BW because it takes a lot of
time to generate that reports that kind
of reports we can generate from the same
system itself and we can use Hana for
it's an antenna litical capabilities
also we can use the data modeling part
and there are some fury applications
also developed for suit on Hana
so the speed of the transactions which
we were doing in ECC you will see is
improved like anything when we moved to
suit on Hana our batch processes which
were taking a lot time a longer time has
been reduced with this product which was
launched in 2013 2014 they launched
another product which is simple finance
so it until this point it was only
development has been done on the
database which is SOP Hana with the
simple finished product a core
components was simplified a/c finance
module was simplified and what
simplification has been once the data
model was simplified okay so here the
problem with the e suit on Hana is Hana
is in-memory database and if you consume
the whole transaction processing if you
want to do on in-memory database so it
consumes a lot of number in memory if
you could consume a lot of memory its
expensive solution so to reduce the
memory part you need to simplify the
data model we will discuss again in
detail that what are the data models and
why we need to do the simplification of
the data models what was there in mm or
1990s which need to be now improved
in 2012 2020 or 2015 so finance data
model was simplified a lot of redundant
table has been removed single source or
Cruz has been put with the egg TOC table
okay so that data model simplification
come with the simple finance and some
some finish features also get simplified
with this solution but this was having
only simplification related to finance
now no other simplification was there in
this product which was called simple
finance product when I say P started
their simplification on other products
so rather than launching is a separate
Logistics product which they have
launched they have launched S for Hana
which has all of the modules and now the
simplifications will be continued
journey on Isfahan afore all of the
modules as for Hana when first it was
launched in 1511 other than the simple
finance simplification so simple finance
is already included in this plus
Logistics Module simplification was also
included in a cbs4 Hana
okay then fluids from 15 11 to 16 10 and
1709 you will see that morphine and
simplifications comes and more logistics
related simplification comes when we
have moved from a simple finance to this
s for Hana now going further the product
will be known as s for Hana another
misconception people have simple
logistic is not a product although we
are doing this training for simple
logistic but simple logistic itself is
not a product simple - was a product but
simple logistic is not a product the
product is s for Hana which includes
both simplification finance and logistic
itself okay now here we got the data
model related simplification all of the
data model got simplified for multiple
modules not only for 15 ants and it it
also supports most of the functional
tee's of the key scenarios we got also
got the choice of deployment because
it's also available on cloud the before
he says he was not available on cloud s4
hana is the first which is get oblivion
on as a public cloud new user experience
has been launched with the fury user
experiences highly simplified the
transaction processing become easier so
this has become a true OLAP plus OLTP
system altogether which can do your
reporting purposes also and transaction
purposes also real-time it can be used
so that is SFE journey from hana
database improving it and putting it
more and more products into it and now
coming to s4 hana
in-between of this as if we also talked
about launched central finance central
finance is again a different product
which is come as a part of s4 hana so
that is called s4 hana central finance
so that is again a separate product it
is sold as foreign a central Phoenix
then we have a s4 hana as a core which
includes all of the logistics modules
then another mode product which recipes
selling with esfahan eyes as for Hana
MDG macerator governance with us for
Hana that is again MDG was made capable
with MBG 9.0 to run on s4 hana now we
are having us for Hana MDG which is
again sold as a separate product but
this all is add-on central finances
add-on and MDGs add-on on s4 hana okay
so that is the journey which recipe has
done so far moving from the r2 r3 ECC
Hana then improving Hana with different
software soutane hana bwa hana simple
finance and simple logistics i hope that
with that explanation it would be now
very clear to you what are these
different products
when we call Hana what do we mean when
we call s for Hana what do we mean if we
are calling simple finance what do we
mean if you are calling simple logistics
what it is and if somebody comes and say
that we are having a suit on Hana what
what do they mean by suit on Hana
okay so these all are different products
which we need to understand what that
how different they are I will again take
a pause here to check if there are any
kind of questions here to answer and
then after that we'll be finishing our
today's session which was the
introductory session and from tomorrow
we will be proceeding it I had with some
motivation for sa pshome Hana we'll be
discussing and we'll discuss that what
kind of scenarios can actually improve
with SMEs for Hana and then further
we'll talk about the data models
database and then we'll talk about the
basics of ICP Hana so before I take a
pause I will ask if you have any
question you can put it down on the chat
window so that I can answer them or you
can raise your hand okay okay I was like
you a message about a asaram like with
the s4 hotline is is Adam going that way
or it will be still be deployed as a as
like hell and like in like SRM gets
integrated the PCs so now going forward
it will be integrated with this for Hana
or if I said I'm going to be a part of
this for Hana going forward
so if you are if you ask me about the
long-term SRM is going away
okay so SRM capabilities is will be
answered within the procurement module
of s4 hana combining the Arriba solution
so combination of this both two would be
answering the SRM but as for Hana can
also be used for SRM so let's say if you
are using the SRM with the ECC you are
moving to s4 Hana you can still use SRM
but to use this SRM this topic we have
about 30 minutes of session that what
would be happening to a syrup we'll
cover in detail but we need to take care
of that we need to first see that how
the SRM was implemented with ECC okay if
it is implemented on the same box as an
add-on SRM then you cannot do the
conversion and use s for Hana on SRM so
you need to separate out SRM in a
separate box if it is used in a separate
box on a separate server it can connect
with s for Hana the additional thing you
need to implement is sa pmdg so sa pmdg
you need to link in between to connect
the master data between SRM and s for
Hana with that linkage you will be able
to still be able to use this SRM but
going future in the going further in the
future all of the SRM related
functionalities is planned to be
delivered either through Arriba or
through the core components of
procurement okay okay yeah I have got
two small questions this like I work as
an independent consultant so depending
which was providing will it be like
sufficient enough for me to work as an
independent in this for logistics like I
have got 20 years of ICT implementation
experience and 13 full lifecycle
projects and I have been working as an
independent for past several years
representing it should be another
companies from the closet I don't have
any any knowledge of as for Hana and
this will be my first exposure to as for
Hannah
so with this training what you are
dealing and the documentation which will
be providing
we'll get the sufficient enough for me
to like go as an independent on the edge
for Hana projects or will it not be it
would be very much sufficient for you to
go as an independent consultant and to
concern the clients and to pitch in for
the new projects for a CPS for Hana with
this training so that would be very much
very much available and you would be
able to do that so you would be able to
do any analytics projects with Hana or
you would be able to do Swan and
Greenfield implementations on as for
Hana conversion projects after this
training so that that much of knowledge
will be delivered to you so nobody's on
that part okay okay sure sure
I have a quick question from Jaya what
is central finance and as for Hana MDG
so we'll be covering that's basically
this products also that what is central
finance for what purpose it is used just
to give you brief that central Venus is
used for the centralized reporting of
enhancer area it's more use where you
have multiple landscapes all together
and you don't want to use s for Hana
as a transaction processing only for
your analytics purposes and for
reporting purposes you want to use you
can Club your multiple ECC system as a
PA known a safety system combined with s
for Hana and then generate reporting
your centralized reports you can
generate from the central finance system
from MDG also we have one specific 30 to
45 minute session on that I am DG where
we explain what is MDG because that is
again would be a core component of s for
Hana MDG is used for the master data
governess
we are basically rather than you
directly creating a material into the
system you have a governess model where
basically you first request for a
material it goes to certain the viewers
then approvals and system check the
duplications in the systems and just to
make sure that the data quality is there
we can put some data validations in
another things and then it can be
created yes it is similar to MDM you
might be knowing that MDM is getting
sitting down in 2020 and MDG is
replacing
I have a question s from Amjad SP
business suit powered by a CP Hana and
does it include all modules I guess it
includes all modules suit on Hana I
include all of these CC modules that's
right let me quickly check if I have
some hand raised I can see only one hand
raised of M jet will unmute you
yeah I'm jet you have any another
question regarding the same ASAP yes I
just wanted to know this is a sidecar
approach till this 2013 Orion pipe sorry
NCP business will powered by City Hana
in the sidecar approach right where you
know we have any CC and we just
replicate the data promises it's not a
sidecar it's a main car it's the main
car scenario basically ECC runs on top
of Hana sidecar is different this is not
it is easy sits on on this yes yes thank
you then
like the first to 2011 and in 2012
outside Caracas right these two are done
except Ahana was a site cut approach VW
always is a sidecar because you don't do
any transaction on BW it's only used for
reporting purposes so when we say the
sidecar is basically it's useful either
reporting purposes or for analytical
purposes so BW was always a sidecar when
in 2010 which was launched as a P Hana
used by a lot of a lot of third parties
a lot of customer clients at the sidecar
approach they basically with the Hana
like we are not discussed here in
between this was one product launched by
recipe which is called Hana life so Hana
life makes sure that you can use isapi
Hana as a sidecar with ECC so we will
discuss that scenario
so our are these like customers are
still running this no it's not obsolete
is still a nice widely used as a sidecar
still some people are still on business
suit on SME Hana they want to some
business want to move just step by step
they don't want to take a big step so
there are many businesses or companies a
first want to do a business suit on Hana
and then they want to shift it to s for
Hana going quickly to harsh Kumar yeah
so I'm here so I have a question like s
AP has acquired some tools like wrist X
which is already embedded into si P so
do we have such tools already in it for
Hana or how those are managed by for
Hana sorry which tool you said can you
please repeat with mystics
mystics and it's used for what purpose
it is use for rebate rebate processing
so I say P rebate does not have much of
taxability so they have our Vista small
separate tool third-party tool which was
used by Clay
for creating rebate related flows or
marketing programs so actually has
acquired it so which tax is embedded to
SM itself so do we have cycle tools so
basically we built management is
definitely changing in SPS bhajana I
need to check this vist X tool that
whether it's still emitted in SPS vahana
or basically with the simplification of
rebate management rebate management is
going to replace by a settlement
management which has a more and much
more functionality and features compared
to the base management so in the
settlement management which is again a
finance component we need to check
whether this Vista is still used in the
settlement management because rebate
management itself is getting obsoleted
so I'm not sure for that but it looks
like that as Vista is embedded with the
rebate management it will also get up
saluted with SPS vahana
because rebate whole process is getting
replaced by settlement management
okay guys so if we don't have any
further questions we can finish our
session here for today so as support
team has updated the next session we
don't have it tomorrow or day after
tomorrow is the next session so it means
that in this week we'll be having only
one more session and the 26 January
India which would be 25th January in
u.s. will not be having a session
because it's a holiday in India okay so
this week we'll have one more session
and from the next week we'll be pissing
up our training with four session weeks
let me quickly check before finishing if
I have any questions I have something
from Sachi have a sir as I have only two
years of experience as an end-user in sp
mmm
as I did not work in implementation
project will you also be able to handle
and to end project you would not be able
to handle end to end project but
definitely you can give your
contribution in SPS for Hana projects
because it's not like in a project we
only require a senior resources we also
require Union forces from this
specifically for the data migration part
so if you will be having additional
knowledge on Hana and s for Hana you
would get it it will it will be very
easy for you to get it selected for
those projects so definitely at some
time either this year or next year or
next to next year you need to learn this
on an S for one and switch to it so
definitely this knowledge will help you
to get s for Hana project for joining
today we'll catch up again on day after
tomorrow bye bye for now
