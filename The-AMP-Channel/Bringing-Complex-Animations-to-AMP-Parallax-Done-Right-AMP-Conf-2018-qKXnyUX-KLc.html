everybody loves a good story and I'm
here today to tell your story as well
the story of how we brought complex
animations to amp so here we go once
upon a time right before lunch what
after a munch just before emerge but
after a purge alley GE got a message
this is cool can we do it in out of
course we can set the little man
give me a minute I shall be back by the
way this is the only cheesy part of the
person patience oh do not worry
optimism is great isn't it so one year
later we were done but a lot more than
just Alex was done in that year a
low-level framework was created to
handle many complex animations in app so
let's take a step back and look at that
journey to talk about the three
different approaches we took the
complexities the trade-offs and of
course the final results but let's start
with the basics first so what is
parallax anyway at its core is just some
content moving faster or slower than the
other content as the user Scrolls you
have likely seen this in one form or
another on the web but why is it a hard
problem is in CSS meant for this sort of
thing well like many other things in the
web platform there is no primitive for
parallax but there are many other
primitives which can be hacked together
in innovative ways to create new things
and that's one of the beauties of the
web platform
so let's talk about the first pack
Detroit it has something to do with 3d
support in CSS perspective is a property
in CSS that creates a 3d space by moving
the viewpoints out of the 2d pain and
into the third dimension the value sorry
the value of the property of course
there will be cats the value of the
property is essentially the distance
that controls the intensity of the
effect so in this example that's not
showing up it was showing the use of the
parallax use of the perspective property
in CSS
so as the viewpoint and as usually as
you use the perspective property as you
change the viewpoint and as you get
closer to 3d things you notice more 3d
Ness and as you get further away you
notice less so what does that have to do
with parallax bear with me for a minute
and we'll explain how 3d CSS has
anything to do with Alex another
property of 3d CSS is that browsers
they're very serious about this virtual
world mimicking the real world so just
like in real life distant objects seem
to move a slower than the closer ones as
the viewpoint
moves across the classic example of this
is looking out of the window of a moving
train the mountains seem to move slower
than the trees and so on but whatever
how is this related to Alex again well
the scrolling is the movement of the
viewpoints on the y-axis so if we create
multiple layers on the z-axis at
different distances from each other
they will move a slower or faster
relative to each other as the user
Scrolls of course the distant objects
are also rendered smaller than their
intrinsic size again browsers are being
super realistic here but what we can do
is to scale them back to their original
size so the only bearing speeds are
observed therefore creating the parallax
effect such as the one you see here all
right great
easy parallax done right well WebKit on
iOS cannot do both momentum scrolling
and create a 3d space at the same time
it simply flattens the 3d space as soon
as is the overflow scroll in touch and
momentum is scrolling is the good kind
that's the one you want it's somewhat a
known bug
it has me report a few times and
unfortunately there is no fix in
progress for it there are some
workarounds but they are not perfect and
requires some markup restrictions on the
markup that are not acceptable in app
for instance the scroller elements
cannot be the body elements and the
parallax element has to have position a
sticky so these are not things we can do
now if you are still curious about this
approach and the genius but very
complicated workaround for Safari please
see this awesome blog post by the Google
developer developer group you can find
it by just googling performance
parallax alright so what's the next
trick Detroit
well what if you pull or push an element
as the user Scrolls user Scrolls six
pixels we add three more pixels so it
moves faster this can be done via CSS
transform which is hardware accelerated
so that's great
we still need to debounce the scroll
events and hit a good balance for
smoothness
and hind uh some edge cases but doable
well some of you may notice we actually
did this we launched an experimental
component called amp effects parallax a
while back based on this approach so
what was the problem why didn't it
launch well essentially it over-promised
and under-delivered it could not handle
complex parallax scenes and tire legs is
just a small subset of what developers
wanted to do with the scroll bound
animations on their pages we needed a
more generic and powerful approach that
could handle parallel but a lot more in
hindsight we could have polished and
launched the experimental component
while working on a more comprehensive
solution but in my defense also thought
the new solution would only take five
minutes - so what did we end up doing so
here's an idea keyframe animations can
create very complex effects so what if
we sync the timeline of an animation
with the position of an element within
the viewport essentially tick the
animation with a scroll instead of time
here's what I mean here we have two
examples you're using the exact same
animation code but they just are ticked
differently the first one goes through
its animation timeline with time that's
how animations normally work the other
one goes through its animation timeline
as the clock moves across the viewports
but how do you do parallax with keyframe
animations well if at the end of the
animation timeline an element is
requested to be above or below where
it's supposed to be it must move faster
or slower together
in this example in normal situation the
rocket will be at the top of the
viewport after the user Scrolls one
viewport amount of a scrolling that just
makes sense you scroll one viewport
amount and it will be on top of the
viewport but with the animation
definition we are asking it to be half a
viewport the 50 VH here more on top so
it has to move faster to catch up to get
to its final state that we are asking so
that's how you do parallax with keyframe
animations we have launched this
solution under two independent but
related components app animation can be
used to define your effect an app
physician observer can be used to sync
an animation timeline with a scroll or
more precisely with the position of an
element within the viewport because
that's easier to reason about than an
absolute pixel value of scroll top for
instance but before we get into the
details of how you can use these
components and what their API looks like
let's first see what you can do with
them of course you can spin a fidgeter
spinner that was the MVP but what else
can we do maybe you want to have opacity
of an image to be tied with a scroll or
maybe not a scroll what you want an
image to fade in when it comes into the
viewport or maybe when it comes to the
view in the middle of the viewport for
instance or both you can mix visibility
based time-bound animations with a
scrollbar animations to create effects
like this how about an image window or
more precisely a parallax image window
you can use these components on any
element whether a normal HTML element or
an custom elements here we have an amp
carousel that slides in
the first time it becomes visible in the
viewport and after that is just behaves
like a normal carousel it may not be
obvious at first but these building
blocks can be used to create useful
features that are not just some fancy
visual effects for example you can have
headers that shrink or expand or hide
and show when the user Scrolls a little
bit of top of the page similarly you can
show a scroll to top button that only
becomes visible when the user has a
scroll past a certain threshold you can
even implement a snack bar overlay with
it
this is not possible with your CSS we
tried you can probably do it with amp
bind and CSS but hey here's another way
to do it and of course you can do all of
this without writing a single line of
JavaScript now let's get into the
details of the underlying components
that were used to create these demos
animation is a wrapper for web animation
API but it also adds many new useful
features to it for instance it adds
variables it as conditional animations
based on media queries or support matrix
it allows for composition of animations
and it has useful functions such as calc
random or ability to measure width and
height of other elements and you'll use
those values in your animation
definition the component also exposes
actions such as starts restarts pause
and seek to which can be used to
manipulate the running state of the
animation and position observer is a
functional component that simply
monitors the position of an element
within the viewport and it dispatches
enter scroll and exit events as an
element moves through the viewport these
events are
considered low trust which means you
cannot run many amp actions as a result
of these events you can only run other
low trust actions and the actions
exposed by an animation component are
also low trust and a few actions exposed
by our video players are also considered
low trust so you can run those the API
is fairly similar to the native
intersection observer and attributes
such as intersection ratios and viewport
margins can be used to change the
behavior of dysfunctional components so
now let's see how these two work
together to spin a fidgeter spinner
well first we define our animation it's
fairly simple
we find the fit to the spinner image and
we take it from 0 degrees to 360 degrees
so that's the definition here next we
have to define our scene or animation
scene which is simply an image but also
a position observer to monitor the
position of the image within the
viewport here we are using intersection
ratio 1 which means the effect only
comes you only see the effect when the
foetidus panel is fully visible had we
chosen to put 0.5 here for instance the
featureless winner would ever started
spinning when it became half visible and
would ever stop when it became half
invisible and this is really where the
magic happens this is where we sync the
animation timeline with the scroll with
the position of the fidgeter spinner
within the viewport so at the beginning
when the image of the foetidus mirror is
at the bottom of the viewport the scroll
event starts dispatching the value a
number between 0 and 100 the percentage
of where it is within the timeline so
you start at 0 goes up 1% 2% 3% when it
gets to the middle of the viewport it
would say I am at 50% progress I'm in
the middle of the viewport and as we get
those events we tell the animation
timeline to also seek to it
addition of 1% 2% of 50% and 50% happens
to be 180 degrees for example and then
we get to the top we are both at 100%
and animation will be at the end and it
would have done a full rotation
abstraction based on simple rules can be
very powerful
allowing thinking of animation timeline
with any other timeline opens up other
opportunities for example you can sing a
video timeline with an animation
timeline creating overlays that are
perfectly time synced on top of your
videos and you can do this today
and the idea is the same as the video
goes to its timeline it reports progress
on at 10% and we asked animation to be
at 10% and the animation is showing the
overlays at those positions within its
timeline and of course there are other
opportunities basically anything that
can progress anything that can go from 0
to 100 can be made to sync with anything
else that can progress and go from zero
to hundred for instance we can start
thinking animation timeline with an AJAX
request with the status of a network
request or we can actually try to sync a
video timeline with the scroll saying
they related animations so we have asked
robot animations why not have a scroll
down videos we actually tried this and
unfortunately all browsers are very very
slow at sticking to a particular frame
reading the video so the overall a
scroll bound video was not done a smooth
experience at all a particularly
exciting exciting one that we are
planning to launch soon is ability to
sync an animation timeline with the
physical tilt of a song imagine you
could configure what 0% and 100% marks
are based on a degree a phone is tilted
on a particular axis now there are three
of them
and you can have three animations for
each and effectively creating complex
visual effects such as 3d parallax so
look out for that in near future so are
we done well now we have the building
blocks that cover many use cases but
they come at a cost for simple cases
they're simply too verbose and not very
simple to use and ease of use is
something that we value not therefore
you're bringing some common visual
effects although they're already
possible with the existing building
blocks that we talked about to amp under
an easy-to-use API
under a new extension called app effects
collection and the very first effect
that we are adding to this collection
going forth full circle is parallax
which you can use today but we are
planning to add more things such as a
slide in fade in and so on here you can
see the new parallax API in practice the
behavior is similar to the app effects
parallax which is now removed but the
names and the syntax are a bit different
to allow for expansion and composition
of the effects so here essentially we
are saying we have an image and we want
the parallax effect on it we are
controlling how the effect works using
the parallax factor if the factor is
greater than 1 it's going to move faster
as we use there Scrolls and if it's less
than 1 it will move slower now let's
talk about some of the boringest stuff
we're a bit about the challenges we ran
into and optimizations with it while
building these features we have made
sure that they are not only very
performant but in true spread of amp
they cannot be used in a slow way at all
we all want 60 frames per second
that means when using app animation we
had to whitelist only certain properties
that are hardware accelerated and
blacklist all the other ones this means
when you're using amp animation we can
essentially only animate transform
opacity and visibility and nothing else
because those are the ones that are
hardware accelerated this may restrict
you on what you can do but at the end of
the day your UX will be better and your
users will be happier viewport is
another challenge we ran into in the
eyes of the browser
there is no single viewport when things
are in an iframe everything is relative
to that sandbox window but we wants the
position of an element in the real
viewport the one that the user is
actually looking at so we actually
collect informations from different
layers of these viewpoints and we
coalesced them together to get the final
result for the viewport that the user is
looking at and this is important for app
because amp is a portable content format
it can be in cross-origin iframes
same-origin iframes shadow DOM and of
course as a top-level documents the
animation API itself is a fairly new API
and not all the browser's support it and
the ones that do have partial support a
lot of times so we have researched and
found a good polyfill for web animations
that's included in the amp animation
components but finally and most
importantly animations are not
transitions animations go from a known
state from a known first keyframe to a
known last keyframe but transitions go
from the current state whatever that
might be is not known ahead of time to a
final state so unlike the animations and
unlike CSS animations an animation does
not require you to provide a first
keyframe and if you don't we will
calculate that for you this single
feature alone provides significant
flexibility on what you can do with amp
animation
in terms of creating actual transitions
building this has been a big team effort
and on behalf of everyone involved I
hope you find these features useful and
we can't wait to see what you build with
them thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
