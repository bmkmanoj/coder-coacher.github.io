of conferences usually but these are
search marketing conferences so it is
pretty much refreshing for me to be
surrounded by developers usually I end
up debating with them a lot
hopefully not this time not at all I
think I'm delighted actually to speak
today to share a few of the insights and
experiences that I have had in the last
couple of years with amp to maximize and
results to make the moves that a bit
through the optimization process and
achieve results during that so I have
already been introduced a little bit in
case you don't know I have been doing
SEO for a little bit of more than eleven
years I have spoken a little bit about
it around the world and a half of the
book is in Spanish though but if you're
a Spanish speaker I want to learn or
watch to learn Spanish while reading a
little bit about SEO which is fun really
just let me know I'll be happy to give
you a free copy in any case what I do at
a day to day basis or at least this is
what I told to my grandma is this I'll
help brands and companies to connect
with them usually nowadays through
mobile devices in search through search
really usually I help at this point
three pretty big brands but
realistically ultimately speed is an
issue that affect and negatively
influence many different type of
websites from smaller websites to huge
websites to and this from a purely as
your perspective it's also pretty big
it's huge and it will become even much
more important with the upcoming mobile
PageSpeed update in case you haven't
heard about it it's coming in July and
Oulton until now Google had hadn't had
taken spin into consideration and I was
going to be an actual racking factor
coming from your mobile web presence so
we really want to make the most out of
the an opportunity to easily fix this if
at some point we haven't yet right
hopefully you have but in case you
haven't besides given your website I'm
much more delightful experience and an
amazing user experience
and an accessible design and provide all
this magnificent frictional Elise while
keeping UX best practices you want also
to make the mousse at a bit
realistically desired the type of
results that we can obtain what ends
right I have helped websites from huge
websites in the news sector to smaller
communities three blocks to b2c and b2b
and in general have to say that the
results are pretty pretty much
impressive right and for some of my
clients really amp became a requirement
if they wanted to be included in the top
stories color so these were
informational websites that really
wanted to be there right so we went one
of the first I have to say with a few of
them to implement and and to go through
the troubleshooting process and despite
the huge opportunity that I'm give us
this is the reality right this is study
and analysis that SEMRush did across
many countries I think it was eight
countries from the u.s. to Europe you
can see a few of them here the top ones
to identify which were the most
important issues the critical issues
that they had and how correct and
optimized ramp implementation was right
you can see the results there seventy
percent of the publishers had errors and
this is not an exception I have to say
many of my clients like for example I
have plans that have communities on amp
right and they have the typical issue of
user-generated content do all they need
to validate and make sure that user done
at whatever type of character that can
embed any image or video or element or
resource that will make that page to not
be able to validate well and then you
have all the type of website and every
type and different type of websites will
have different types of issues and
scenarios and errors so this is not
unique to publishers for sure and
realistically this can be very well
aligned with your optimization process
right what I have found and what I
repeat again and again
is that the most difficult SEO task is
not necessarily only identified an issue
but make sure first to avoid it and then
to align the optimization process with
your already existing development
process content creation process
marketing process etc etc to make it
viable to make it also relevant and
profitable at the end of the day so
first issue here that we can easily
solve with a correct optimization
process and well maybe I shouldn't do a
boys but let's do a little bit of a
voice typical client on my side
engagement decrease after launching amp
right it's like I expected to see his
huge spike in traffic and all of the
sudden what is this where are these
shitty results you promise me that I
will have an increase right so this is a
typical common and complain of someone
who someone could any really access that
I'm implementation at the beginning
because the decisions shouldn't be
necessarily at this point right can i
implement all these functionalities and
counseling and because we have all this
many components already but what is the
best configuration what is the best
setting in case you have an independent
/ website in case you're doing
responsive web design in case you're
doing dynamic serving right there are so
many different decisions to be made and
so how do we start first we should go
through all of the different types of
components and realize and identify if
all of our current fresh analogies can
be easily implemented through them if
they can be replicated we have all these
resources we can't even troubleshoot
them we can even copy our current code
and use the documentation dirty and go
through it with the development team and
hopefully also with your own a ciose to
see if it is possible also to do it in a
way that is accessible that is correctly
indexable etc etc and we should keep
this also in mind the different type of
settings that we can have we're on our
mobile website right we can use
responsive or dynamic settings we can
have independent mobile website right we
can use
our own as your own website or canonical
and if you can use independent mobile
website with non canonical and then you
will have and you will end up having to
support like three different type of web
properties and at the end of the
language might not be necessarily the
most cost effective way to implement it
right so use an example write two
different implementations F independent
mobile website along a.m. P like we have
wiki hell we can have to have their web
desktop websites there are canonical
URLs the work they want our index at
this point because we haven't moved yet
to the mobile first index which is
expected to happen in a few months by
Google and then we have the ANP version
loading there under the end subdomain
and then we have the independent mobile
website version without the ANP
parameter there so they every single
change every single update they need to
replicate it in three different types
properties which can be a little bit too
much right this doesn't mean that it's
not good or is correct or incorrect it
works for them they have their own
characteristics their own needs there
are restrictions their own goals
resources etc and they implemented it
right there like this and then we have
this other type of setting like with the
Irish Times they have their desktop
website like this and they they have an
independent mobile website implement the
directly through a MP through amp that
loads directly there so every time if
you go to the - - - prom and you emulate
any type of mobile device or you go to
the mobile and you enter here you will
be directly show this result here this
page here whether you have gone through
through the mobile SERPs or not because
this there in the pond a mobile website
directly in a MP so which is better for
you which makes much more sense sense
based on your own restrictions and
capabilities a lot of people right now
is trying to move from independent
mobile settings to responsive of dynamic
serving because of Google upcoming
mobile first index because at the end of
the day during the panel settings will
canonicalize the
if you have them like this you will need
to canonicalize to you that's the one
and this won't make sense necessarily
when the mobile first index come right
so this is something that you need to
really validate check well but if this
is a maybe a good point for you to
migrate first to a responsive setting if
you can directly implement EMP there or
if you want to like minimize the AMT
implementation like this directly also
something very important that in the
past at least with the independent
mobile settings it was not needed but
nowadays we have been asked to include
every single structured data and attacks
in general that we had in our desktop
versions to our mobile ones and also in
a MPs like for example hreflang
annotations if we had extra flag
annotations and our own desktop versions
to specify the language and
alternatively the country that we are
targeting with each single page and
their alternate single sister versions
of each page the ones that are targeting
other languages or other countries to
specify the relationship between them we
need to also implement those in in the a
and Purls and this is a type of setting
that we will have with the independent
mobile organization or a scenario it's a
little bit more complicated right so
again it's important to assess what is
much more feasible to implement by your
internal write because for example here
we have our independent version and of
course we need to specify which is our
amp URLs and the ability to canonicalize
back in the same with the independent
mobile setting exactly the same but and
then again we need to include the
language or alternatively country values
in each one of them a little bit of more
work isn't it what is best for you where
is much more efficient for you right but
you need to go through through this and
understand the specifications what you
can do with each one of them and what is
the best way to apply them then again we
have the relatively new also requirement
Camie plays place this month I think
already about content parity the same
content that is available in your
canonical URL in new canonical pages in
case you are not implemented in P that
are clean them needs to be also shown in
you a and P ones what happens right a
lot of websites they were just using AP
they was using M as a sneak preview and
you need to click on the button to be
referred directly to the canonical page
that was not using M not necessarily
given the best experience in general
speed so we ended up having the same non
ideal situation right so this shouldn't
be the case anymore you should avoid to
do this and realistically there were
many questions around the SEO community
around this because a lot of publishers
they love to have the button in their
original mobile websites how you say
like load more or or show me the whole
cont content that is not shown by
default sometimes and sometimes you're
taking to an additional URL don't
necessarily the initial one so
realistically to keep things clear if
you actually want to do this with your
and Purls you should also be doing this
with your original canonical URLs which
might not necessarily be the best in
order for google to really assess and
run well these pages because you won't
be showing your content then they're
right so if you're showing 10 paragraph
in jewelry need original canonical URLs
you need to show those same 10 paragraph
in am P right so again it's about parity
in this case the content that you
deliver in one way you should deliver in
the other and this is so funny for me
because of course this specifically this
is just an example this is not a website
that I work on but I had this very
typical scenario that I have found many
times the first time that I helped
through an untruth and an optimization
process and the claim was like oh my god
when I implemented API I saw all this
loss engagement the bounce rate is
horrible can you please take a look and
I
and check and I saw that they had no
menu how do you want the users to
continue browsing to your site right do
you eliminate the hamburger menu or the
menu general from from review aap
implementation and you're not allowing
the users to you know to continue
browsing to your site you continue
engaging with your content so don't do
this do this right I've done a little
bit of tests with a few clients and and
I have asked which one is the um version
like when we have finished a process
across a few users right sometimes I
don't even know because the experience
is really replicate it the the
experience is right there and this what
we should be looking to achieve to
implement their UI the functionality the
content that we gave with your with your
original mobile pages with the ANP ones
and if at some point we decide again
that we have an independent mobile site
we implement additional e and-a MP URL
parallely to it like in this case for
example we have the time website right
and this is not the first time that I
see this happening right III am shared
this URL through social networks I click
on it and I go to the a MP version like
this I am not redirected to the relevant
desktop page because I am accessing
through my desktop device right so we
shouldn't forget about mobile
configurations and best practices here
if I am accessing through a desktop
device to a independent URL that is
Target or mobile then I should be
redirected to the relevant desktop URL
because otherwise the experience is not
that well good right I will end up
leaving anyway or the easiest way to fix
this actually will be to implement this
page directly as a responsive web design
then it will be multi device and I
wouldn't be needed to be redirected
anyway and of course if at some point
somehow we don't like the results that
we're getting and we decide to disable
and we need again to follow certain SEO
best practices we just don't remove
the tax and that's it and and start
returning for for each HTTP status in
the OL NP URLs no no no we need to 201
redirect we need to save that traffic
refer that all traffic to keep what we
have gained until now and referred all
this traffic to our wrong canonical URLs
that we are keeping and we are still
working what right like actually there
is really good here resource
step-by-step type of results
independence of the type of
configurations that you have on your
site right but it should be pretty
straightforward so as you can see it's
all about assessing the viability and
the way the best way and setting that is
the correct one based on resources and
and capabilities and goals to achieve
and then these are not a very common
scenario the the amp version is lunch
and then we get all of this huge share
of errors all of the sudden and we don't
know where to start right fixing them so
it's about validating validating well
before during and after the launch is
happening right first thing and it is
very important it's not only about
sharing the specification and how to
implement the components would actually
what are the actual errors that are the
most common wants to find and I want
that should be validated to avoid
also when when the ANP URLs are
generated and there's actually a
reference there or validation errors
these are the ones that are also used
through the Google search console so
this is a good great reference to have
through the implementation process and
then again there are some goo specific
errors that we should keep in mind that
have to do also around content parity
that these are specific to google's but
again if we want to be shown in the
mobile search then i'm pretty sure that
you want to be shown in the mobile
search through your imperials these are
the ones that you should also keep in
mind and this is a list of the most
common errors to look for again this
based on the study of semrush that they
did across
any important publisher that had an
implemented and a lot of disallowed
attributes tax directly from htmls to
invalid URLs at said disallowed
resources so these are the ones that we
should be looking for in order to
actually provide the expected results
how we should do it I have found the
best time to start validating really is
not when the code is already generated
at the end right it's to work alongside
the development team to go and
troubleshoot and look with them for
these errors even before the the the
code is already ready to be tested on a
test environment pre-production
environment that is accessible for
almost everybody that is a stakeholder
in the project right so what I have done
in this case is to use their I'm tragic
validator when you can actually even
copy-paste and you can paste here the
code to look for mistakes on problems
specifically with the top templates the
home page the listings the products the
community the blocks to look for the
errors there there's also a way here to
be able to test specific internal pages
they're not publicly available where you
can also do an interrupter nailing
easily configurable and this of course
is to go to the your top most important
templates once that you have the
implementation done through them you
need to crawl them there are many SEO
crawlers simulators that right now
support and and are able to specify all
of the type issues that the Google
search console will warn about like deep
pro for example that will identify what
type of mobile setting you have and they
will specify here page by page if for
example you have a non-reciprocal mobile
and type of relationship the annotations
are not found which are these pages at
which level of the URL structure they
are the web architecture of our
oversight the same with sidewalk I love
because it's very visual and very
telling that will tell you which ones
our path here where there are no issues
how monies have been crawled
how many have intro with amp which are
the actual issues the one in red the the
the critical issues the ones that will
not make your page to actually be shown
in mobile serves the ones that are
actually advisory desirable not
necessary required but desirable to
include them directly and refer them
right a very key and that you will be
able to generate a list of canonical
URLs and URLs with each specific issue
listed like this segmented by the type
of problem so it's much more easy to go
through them and apply the fixes through
them directly and of course once that we
launch we will be watching the goal
search console this is a new one I love
it it's amazing it's much more visual
you will see how we can do the whole
troubleshooting process through it it's
not just to check their the issues but
actually to to go through the issue and
fix them with that but of course like I
have 2.8 million URLs are valid I have
36 Hey actually I'm very proud of this
just to see Kay from almost 3 million
amazing but then again there are so many
different type of issues that we don't
know where to start right how do we do
we go to and this I love this because we
can go and select only the actual
critical errors there and we will only
be shown those so we will prioritize
those are affecting more pledges right
so we can filter those affecting more
pages and then go through the ones where
we want to really see results the type
of pages that are much more critical for
us from a business perspective maybe the
posts are not the Mosin for the ones on
our side maybe the listings maybe
certain categories etc etc we can filter
them now much more easily the go circles
all interface and then we can select and
go through them we can see which have
been the last identify here and we can
go through them and see the exact
snippet in the code that has the
specific issue and we can go through the
top
of them to identify the pattern there
what is the pattern that we can identify
here the one scenario the ones instance
that is generating again again and again
the same type of error across all these
different type of pages we can actually
check here we can click here because you
say oh this is so weird look like an
outdated version or this is a version
that was actually not the one available
when we finally launched I don't know
how we ended up having this index by
Google at some point whatever so you can
actually go and check the like version
of the page here as you can see I'm
verify it again with the am test to
identify the problems are still in place
or not and then you can share the report
that specific report with the
development team across a team the team
in charge to troubleshoot with you this
type of mistakes this is amazing because
again mostly what it is much more
difficult here is to share the errors in
a meaningful way to make them understand
the ball to go across and give access to
all the people who needs to have access
like this we give access much more
easily and they will see this page here
you see only the specific report with
the specific errors that we have sure so
they can be much more fixed Lee might
much more recent fix once that they are
fixed they tell us oh they're fixed now
you can go and check we go checked again
and if they are valid we have this
option now that is called validate fix
we click on it and we send these pages
to Google to be reprocessed because
again in the past we had this this
problem that we see all these legacy
errors there keep appearing in the
Google search console and they they were
generating a lot of a lot of noise right
we we minimize this type of scenarios
now by being able to get like to have
like also a push type of process to send
them across the the Google search
console interface and of course we will
find situations like this where it says
we cannot continue with the validation
process because we have found that you
still have this
you know this you know this URLs so you
should continue fixing the Asia she just
so it's not just about sending and
waiting again for three days not knowing
what is going on if it is going to be
okay or not but they are validated again
on the go like this
and if they are being processed you'll
you will get an email we're validating
the pages that you have sent etc after
two or three days you will get again
another email saying we have
specifically fix the issue that you
specify about and look this is the
commented in the Google search console
interface like this so when it started
if the validation is looking good or not
when it is done it's also updated there
and you will be able to see here the
evolution over time until you get zero
errors is about a rinse and repeat type
of process so hopefully you will get
here and you will see how the errors
decrease over time and you will have
annotations on when the new issues are
found and when they are fixed too so
it's actually pretty good to identify
the correlation of when you fix the
issues I'm going to actually start
seeing the best possible results which
again will help you show how valuable it
is your troubleshooting work and why you
should tip amp in place in a correct way
so he's about validating through the
whole implementation process right from
the start and then last but not least
this typical issue about we're not sure
which are the queries are generating
much more benefit with amp right like
you have enable maybe all of your
listings or all of your products or what
should be next
maybe the block maybe the community
maybe the quote which are the type of
pages that are giving you the type of
engagement that you're looking for in
order for you to refine and expand even
more your efforts so it's about
monitoring at all the different levels
first from a name that's in perspective
or all these meaningful pages that you
really want to push with am the ones are
being taken into consideration in the
Google index take a look you can
actually now take a look which are those
that are effectively in this when they
were last act as if there are be
refreshes you wish
etc etc then you go to the Google search
so in this case we will need to switch
to the old interface yet I have been
told that in the future this will also
be brought to the new interface but it
right now is still have it and that in
the old interface will we will go to the
the GU search console search analytics
report and will be able to to filter
here and reach and enrich results per
device mobile right now their group
versus mobile for mobile and for each
query and for which page these are being
shown at the moment the average position
the click-through rate the employee the
impressions versus click to understand
better the behavior when they are
included in the in the carousels versus
when they are included in the organic
results right we can't identify here the
pattern which are the queries that are
included in one of the other one of the
type of picture rates that we get
through the swipe type of behavior when
they are including the carousels versus
the other etc etc and then this again is
not so natural hopefully this will be
also fixing the new goal search console
we can actually go through each type of
query on page to see granularly which
are the ones blocked by each type of
page if there's even more opportunities
if additional queries that we may want
to target which are the other topics
that we want to be pushing amp for right
so we can go forward go more granularly
by doing this type of questions and
analysis and not only with the google
search console because at the end of the
day the goal search console will give us
the data for the top queries and pages
for which we are already ranking for we
want to know the opportunities out there
what are our competitors doing with
tools like fistrick source and rush we
can go to their ranking indexes and we
can see for any website for any domain
work that we want which are the queries
that they are ranking and targeting with
amp results and how they are doing at
which which type of pages we can do the
same with rank trackers like like SEO
monitors there are more and more and
trackers let's report amp nowaday so for
example for queries that you're
targeting because you wish to run for
but you're still not somehow ranking for
write your maybe position 30
forty you can see if there are being
they are including and bristles like
this and and if there any other place
rank you for them your competitors like
this too so for example here I am
tracking with some rush my your results
on the one of my competition out there
so I'm seeing all these surf features
are shown for these queries and these
are the players are actually making the
most out of them so that is a nice way
to loop it incentivize your editorial
team to cover certain topic certain
terms with am pages if you haven't done
done it yet until now and last but not
least again a lot of people ask me later
I really want to better understand what
is the type of specific behavior and and
the change of behavior the impact that
the swipe option and impression Ollie
has through the to the the top stories
carousel right if I am included in third
and four position there and people need
to swipe business what is the
click-through rate versus the first one
you can actually track this also wet run
Ranger that is the one rank tracking
tool that I have found that do this like
really easily and straightforward like
this for you to see the impact of being
including number one and then in the
carousel or number two number three
under before and to better understand
this type of this type of settings why
not and that was not least to understand
better the correlation of your index
your rankings and then at the end of the
day of course your traffic and
conversions whatever it is a conversion
for you
in Google Analytics now there is a much
more effective way to track this with
where the the API through the URLs and
pages shown through the see see the
analyzer
there are shown directed by yourself to
make it much more well mean meaningful
and relevant to what is actually
expected from a behavioral perspective
and better understand is all this
aligned with what you expected in first
places is a correlation over there of
trends the results are consistent with
the type of issues that you have had
and and and all your efforts that you're
doing to improve your experience and
optimization along the process so as you
can see it's about following up with
your amp index rankings and traffic to
better understand the correlation of
them and track at every single stage to
identify not only the challenges and the
problems but also the opportunities that
will allow you to continue expanding
with your results and well this is again
all the steps that we have followed
hopefully there will be relevant for you
useful for you as they have been for me
and other clans that I have worked with
and as you can see he's about having a
good alignment good project management
and good communication - and include and
validate and asses across the process
not just at the end when all the
releases are done and then we'll have
all the issues to fix right thank you
very much hopefully it's time to
maximize your own results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
