thinking wait I get that I'm
self-performance issues besides I don't
know better but I do my side is already
pretty fast hey good for you if everyone
was like you maybe we wouldn't need em
in the first place and the mobile web
would have big fast and user friendly
from the get-go so why can't you could
build a perfectly fine mobile site being
Google top storage capsule or anywhere
else and the surface and the answer is
that platforms would love to but they
can't even though I can see that your
page is fast with my own two eyes it's
actually surprisingly hard to measure it
reliably with a computer a bit like it's
relatively easy for humans but crazy
hard for computers to distinguish
between a snake from a shoelace web
developers and platforms everywhere are
working hard but solving the problem of
reliable speed measurement with
promising projects like lighthouse but
in reality we're simply not there yet
and even in future where we the web
community is able to reliably measure
your site's performance we're still only
halfway there and has a few tricks up
its sleeves that go far beyond simple
performance improvement take for example
the static layout system use an app and
ensure that every element on the page
has an own width and height even before
external assets have finished loading
something that's done at HTML can't
guarantee as any picture without its
defined size could push content down and
here's the key by doing that and can
make a prediction of what the user
actually sees when they arrive on a
given amp page with that intelligence a
platform like Google can request the pre
loading of multiple and pages at the
same time because each just preload the
first viewport make it very cheap to do
so this explains ultimately why amp
pages don't just feels task but
near-instant in order to achieve this
intelligent viewport pre loading on
normal website we'd have to quite
heavily change or extend the CSS
specification which is an impossible per
se but we'll take a little bit more time
in the meantime in the spirit of the
extensible web manifesto
we're sticking to a solution that offers
these capabilities and many more today
and death lamp the perfect is the enemy
of the good
but we want to get to perfect if you are
developer help us find the right
long-term solutions maybe even web
standards that will upgrade not just
empty just put every site on the web
