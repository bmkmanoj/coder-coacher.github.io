validate your pages and eliminate any
errors to ensure your M pages are
actually linked to by platforms here's
how the key strength of amp isn't just
that it makes your pages fast but it
makes your pages fast in the way that
can be validated this way third parties
such as Twitter Instagram or Google
search can feel great about serving and
pages to readers in increasingly
interesting ways so how do you check
whether your page is valid app here are
the top five ways number one the browser
developer console the amp validator
comes bundled with the mj's library so
it's available on every amp page out of
the box simply open the browser dev
tools of your choice and make sure the
console is open at development equals
one to the URL of your page and reload
the page to see validation errors appear
or hopefully not appear number two the
web interface if you're just trying
things out and want to see a live
preview while you type but don't have
access to dev tools right now head to
validator and project org for the web
interface of the validator the cool
thing about this one is that it updates
in real time any changes you make to the
HTML are going to be instantly
revalidated number three the browser
extension the possibly most convenient
way of validating amp pages is d
validate a browser extension that is
available for both Chrome and opera as
you browse it will automatically
validate each and page visited and gives
a visual indication of the validity of
the page as a color icon clicking on the
icon shows you any errors in an overlay
the extension has another nifty feature
if a canonical non-m page uses the
paired mode meaning that there's an amp
page available of the same content the
icon will turn blue and a click will
reveal the amp version number for the
NPM package if you want to integrate
validations you have built and test pipe
lines you should grab the amp HTML
validator package from NPM and include
it in your note a space scripts if
you're using gulp
things are even easier get the gut and
HTML validator instead and create a
validation task in just a few lines of
code number 5 finally the command line
tool lets the option to run the
validator from your command line that
comes in handy if you want to validate
lots of amp pages via shell scripts or
if you want to add git pre-commit hooks
I especially like the latter as it means
that a developer on your project won't
be able to commit invalid code the sea
lion ships with the amp HTML validator
and PM package I just mentioned then you
simply run em HTML validator from your
terminal for the second argument
pointing to remote a local amp page so
what happens if you actually find errors
easy looking at the validation output
you see an explanation of why and where
your pages invalid and usually a
reference link that explains the problem
in more detail you can also head
directly to the validation errors site
on am project org which link you can
find in the description and if you're
desperate and think the validator just
messes with you get in touch with us by
your preferred communication channel all
