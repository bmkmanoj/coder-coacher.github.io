product manager and search and my team
and I built the current top stories
experience that you see on Google search
today and today I'll be talking a little
bit about how we built the Google search
viewer and how developers and other
platforms can use our takeaways to build
their own campaign consumption
experiences so how many of us are
front-end developers here
awesome how many of you guys are
front-end developers for platforms that
are looking to build their own app based
experiences some people some people and
how many of us already have and based
experiences on our platform yes amazing
alright so let's get started what makes
an ant base consumption experience fast
now we actually know that amp is already
pretty fast and so I'm going to focus on
the part that makes amp instance which
is pre rendering and the amperior itself
what is an amp viewer the core parts
that the amperior really has to take
care of is it has to talk to the cache
it has to transform an amp URL that you
get into a cache URL and get that app
document back and in our case on search
it handles all the pre-rendering magic
that makes that page seems like it just
appeared to the user the three tenants
that make this possible our format
attributes the pre rendering mode of amp
the amp cache itself and our
pre-rendering strategy so a pre
rendering mode one part of an pre
rendering mode is at speed it makes it
much more achievable for a platform to
pre-render because it takes only the few
first viewport and the resources
available in it and pre renders that
this above-the-fold content is the only
thing the user needs to see initially so
you can play this trick of loading the
rest of the page when the user is
actually decided to visit that page now
the way that aunt makes pre-rendering
much more realistic of a prospect for
platforms as compared with when you want
to pre render non amp pages it's because
of the way the format is set up the
positions of the elements are totally
interval based on the amp pages markup
so it's trivial to show just the ones
that the users that is going to be above
the fold
all right so say a document typically
has three three large images I like to
call this document a study and katnappe
only one of these documents is visible
above the fold and when you're in
improve render mode then the browser can
download and pre-render 3m documents
using the bandwidth that would have been
required to pre render a single non-abs
the consequence of this is that as an
app you can pre render way more
aggressively and ETL documents then you
can have pre-rendered regular HTML
documents the other portion the other
pillar of am pre rendering mode is that
it handles privacy and analytics in a
smart way so you don't have to deal with
it
it preserves easier privacy and
analytics perience since no third-party
javascript can be executed at this time
now on the other side you don't want to
send their data to the publisher without
them having actually viewed the document
and on the publisher side they don't
want to know that you pre-rendered a
view of this document to make it instant
to the user without the user having
looked at it because that impacts their
conversions so amp rear-ending mode
handles all of this for you other than
the casting but now moving on to the
second pillar which is the amp cache
other than it's obvious caching benefits
like proximity the amp caches primary
contribution is that it only serves
valid amp documents so everything that
we just talked about that happens for a
valid amp document ie pre rendering mode
only half mate is ensured by the am
cache because it makes sure that as a
platform you're only getting valid amp
documents for your user experience now
let's dive into the viewers roll for now
we'll talk specifically about Google
searches embedded web viewer and we use
this on Google's mobile web search it's
a set of standby frames that the user
can swipe horizontally between so it's
the one that's tied to the top stories
carousel experience now once the
elements of pre rendering mode is that
the viewer needs to tell the documents
that it should be in pre rendering mode
ie when we think that the user is going
to see this document and it also needs
to tell that document to get out of pre
rendering mode
so we can load the rest of it when the
user is actually signaled that I'm
looking at this document now what this
requires is a viewer to document
communication channel and this is the
post message API I won't dive too deep
into the post message API but
generically it supports communication
across nested iframes without
introducing the overhead of daisy
chaining the messages between windows
it's open source then you can check it
out on our github page now diving deep
into the pre rendering strategy itself
let's talk a little bit about the
principles of pre-rendering that as a
platform you want to respect number one
you want to prove under an EM document
only if it's likely that the user is
actually going to see it pretty obvious
number two you want to prove under AB
documents in the app pre rendering mode
this takes care of a lot of the icky
things that you would otherwise have to
take care developer yourself third you
want to start the pre-rendering after
user interaction and after the end of
the user animation of any so in our case
that be someone actually cook at the end
of the search page search results page
load or if you're scrolling around in
the amp top stories carousel of course
you want to prove under most one
document at a time now this makes sense
because there's only going to at any
given time there's only going to be one
next document that the user is going to
maybe want to see next
FIF you want to pre render only for
modern devices on really great
connections so this is to be respectful
of users data and bandwidth and lastly
one it's the memory conscious and
discard previously pre-rendered
documents that are pretty unlikely to be
seen any more all of this combines into
a pre rendering strategy it's the most
difficult part of any instant user
experiences what to pre-render and so
I'll walk through a couple of naive
examples of how Google starts uses these
for rendering examples for our specific
top stories careful experience in
practice
at the end of the search results page
loads we want to pre render the first
documents associated with the first
careful item now this is the first asset
someone potentially going to see if the
user Scrolls the carousel then we pre
render the amp document associated with
the largest visible care of the item and
we want to do that at the end of the
scroll animation now if user clicks into
an amp documents so now I'm actually
looking at this amp document we want to
pre render let's call this document the
ends document now we want to pre render
the n+ once document so this in the
green box the insulins document is the
one that the user has yet to see but
it's our guess as to which document the
user is going to see next as you guys
know the top stories careful you can
actually select horizontally between
these in the viewer now now that we're
on this now that we have this document
pre rendered let's say the user inside
the inside the Google Search viewer
actually swipes from the ends documents
to the n plus 1 document our next best
guess is that they're going to want to
see the n plus 2 documents so we pre
render this new document and of course
this ultra works in Reverse so if you
want to swipe from right to left then we
printed n minus 2 documents and so on
and so forth in practice that last bit
which is discarding pages that we don't
think that the user is going to see
anymore we do this for I think three
pages so we keep three pages
pre-rendered moving on to how we built
the Ann sewer
well actually we built three of them so
we built one for mobile webs we built
one for Android and we built one on iOS
so we kind of talked about mobile web
houses the postmessage api etc and now
we'll talk about some challenges that we
face and design positions that we made
on Android and iOS so for Android
probably some of the developers in here
have faced some of these challenges but
you've got two choices you choose to
either use a webview or you can choose
to use chrome custom tabs with iframes
now the advantages of abuse can kind of
obvious your app controls this webview
so you run your own JavaScript in the
webview since you can inject it and
that's how you communicate with the amp
document it's the maximum flexibility
and you have complete control over your
UX now the other part of that is that
then you might have to be implement a
lot of things that the browser already
does well also you have to think about
user experience wise what happens what's
the difference in your user experience
between amps and non amp so the other
the other choice the other designs in
route that you can go is chrome custom
tabs with iframes now the pros of this
are you get cookie sharing for free
because users don't need to log into
sites that they've already signed into
on chrome so you get the advantages of
that chrome custom tabs is an in-app
browser that allows the app to pre
render the constants in the browser so
you get pre rendering and there's one
disadvantage of course is that chrome
takes control of the experience so you
might get a performance hit and you get
a little bit more restricted UX because
you're using chrome custom tabs so we
chose to go with route number two it
really takes care of a lot of the
difficult parts of pre-rendering and a
lot of the difficult parts of being a
browser on the iOS side we actually did
the other approach which is while in a
gsa we want the chrome well in the
android version we went with the chrome
custom tabs implementation on iOS we
went full native so the significant
change instead of the amp javascript
managing all the amp articles and the
iOS app actually manages the amp
articles in each WK webview renders one
and only one amp document in terms of UI
performance obviously you get a lot of
speed benefits so we actually have great
animations and actually you can use
Xcode tooling so that's what we did on
iOS so all in all what makes an amp
based experience really really fast it's
these three pillars on how they
contribute into an awesome pre-rendering
experience so the format attributes of
the pre rendering mode the amp caches
insurance that all the documents are
therefore you can actually have
pre-rendering mode for your entire
experience and the pre-rendering
strategy that you choose now you might
be asking how much faster do we actually
make this agreeance well we actually
made it about 20 times faster reducing
the median load time from a search
result quick to getting these are
actually seeing the page to less than a
second that means that in many many many
cases we've achieved instance and as you
guys build your user experiences your
ant base user experiences
think about your pre-rendering strategy
and how that works with your us and we
hope that you can also achieve instant
amp experiences thank you
