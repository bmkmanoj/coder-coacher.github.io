allowing you to shoot yourself in the
foot so what's different an app let's
have a look each M page consists of a
special flavor of HTML we call em HTML
and a bunch of CSS the limitations for
both can be roughly divided into two
categories code you must have in your
page and code that is disallowed let's
start with the mass house first the
basic structure of an HTML page each M
page needs a modern duck type of doctype
HTML contain the lightning bolt or amp
attribute in the HTML tag be formatted
in utf-8 and include its chart set even
more crucial the head of that page needs
to include the amp library script a
decent meta viewport to correctly
display on mobile and economical link to
itself or an on am Persian of the same
page the head of the page finally needs
what we call the Empire plate the
boilerplate is a bunch of CSS that amp
users to prevent the infamous flash of
unstyled content so why is that well amp
components like m carousel need to be
initialized in JavaScript so it looks
ugly for a brief second without that
block of CSS but what if MJS fails to
load well that's the reason we're using
a CSS animation after eight seconds the
CSS will simply display the body
regardless of whether the library has
loaded now that's actually everything
that an M page can't live without
so what I'd have forbidden fruit first
no JavaScript the biggest limitation is
the fact that you're not allowed to load
or embed any JavaScript that isn't
coming from amp itself sounds like great
limitation and it is but the good news
is that amp ships with hundreds of
high-level web components that enable
interactivity like M Karaca em side by
and so on if you need one-way
data-binding and a state machine take a
look at M bind which allows you to do
stuff like interactive product pages
that update availability of your
selection in real time next no external
CSS amp doesn't allow you to include CSS
from external sources for example it's
linked in the head of your page and you
can't use inline CSS within the style
attribute of elements all of your CSS
must be inline within a single style and
custom tag and fit within a 50 kilobyte
limit that's to ensure no additional
round trips are necessary to lay out
your content that you're not reusing a
giant global CSS file on all of your amp
pages
the one exception for the link we will
our custom font from white listed
providers like stance outcome or google
fonts they also likely don't count
towards the 50k limit it is allowed CSS
staying on a topic of CSS there are few
things you must use most notably the
important modifier the filter property
and some more exotic ones like behavior
and moss binding animations are fine but
the only properties you're allowed to
animate a transform an opacity as these
are the only ones that are
gpu-accelerated
if you're now thinking wait that doesn't
sound so bad then you're absolutely
right the rumors of am styling
capabilities being severely limited are
greatly exaggerated now coming to
disallow HTML when it comes to HTML most
common HTML tags are allowed with a
notable exception of image video audio
and iframe we also don't allow stuff
that will generally make one's life
miserable like frame frame set base
object and made an applet but if you're
now thinking that M sounds pretty bleak
without images video and so on we're not
these tags all of amp equivalents namely
amp image and video and audio and M
iframe they main exist so amp can
prioritize the load of important content
over anything else finally what about
forms forms on edge case the generally
allowed but require the inclusion of the
amp form extension script Plus come with
some some additional limitations using
the post method requires specifying an
ajax endpoint and certain input types
like file or password are forbidden to
learn more about forms and amp head to
the amp form reference page on amp
project or walk linked in the video
description that's pretty much it
everything else is standard HTML CSS and
contrary to popular belief you're not
limited to building for mobile either
the best way to check whether you follow
the rules is to validate your amp pages
find out how to do just that and much
more in the description and ask me any
questions on Twitter and HTML or in the
comments below onwards
