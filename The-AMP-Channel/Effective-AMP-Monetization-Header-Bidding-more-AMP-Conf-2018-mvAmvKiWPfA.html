for the user but it's no good if you
can't make any money fortunately we've
done a lot of discussion here at amber
conference about making money with him
about monetization I have with me here
Vamsi at PMI nan talked about ads and
also hetero bidding which I know has
discussed a lot
what is Heather bidding and now what is
possible with the primary idea with
header bidding was to be able to call
out to third parties so they can paid on
the address on on how much they want to
pay for the impression so traditionally
on regular web pages header bidding is
done usually using custom JavaScript so
you've put a piece of JavaScript on top
of your pages it works because that
gives so the publisher access to more
sort of ad demand which therefore
generally tends to drive higher revenue
with amp now we are just announced that
we have first-class support for header
bidding and we're doing it with a
feature called RTC or real-time config
what is real-time config real-time
config is essentially allowing the
publisher to define sort of xhr
endpoints to enhance things before
sending the ad request to the ad server
with amp the way we've built RTC unlike
the traditional world the call cannot
actually be blocked by any of these
third parties so for example even the
publisher specifies let's say five
endpoints we wait about 500 milliseconds
at the worst-case and continue carrying
on making the ad call and therefore we
ensure that the entire lifecycle of the
ad is really fast and doesn't harm the
user experience on the page
yes we've been doing header betting an
amp for about nine months now we
deployed in June we saw from launch some
really strong representing in May so
we're making in December we saw an
increase in revenue of about six hundred
percent which is really strong that's
really remarkable so why does header
bidding get so much better as that users
want to click on more so what you're
doing is you're introducing almost
incremental two-man to your existing ad
set up so it's less about adding more
ads in and more about centralizing time
and getting more people bidding on each
individual app placement I'm here with
Matt Jacobson product manager for a
plexus and for prepaid org and what is
it the prepaid org does yes so preview
org is a open source foundation it's
really just a collaboration of a number
of industry partners and we're all
looking to drive the development of
independent header bidding solutions for
publishers and you see how they're
bidding we say pre bid
what is pre bid compared the header
bidding yeah so this is a question that
we get a lot header bidding is really
the more general term to represent the
technology of calling a number of
different demand partners from the
header of your page pre bid is a
specific implementation of a header
bidding wrapper pre-bid server which is
another project that the pre-bid
organization manages has built support
for to be an amp RTC vendor and able to
provide pre-bid demand via amp RTC and
AM fast fetch essentially all you need
to do is take your existing amp bad unit
and add an RTC config attribute to that
which will specify the actual prepaid
server vendor that you want to work with
and a parameter which essentially just
tells us to look up your demand partner
configuration that you've stored with us
previously
there's been talk here at the conference
about mph email ads which are ads
created entirely an end I'm here with
Heather Douglas software engineer who
works with Google web designer and what
is Google web designer and what are the
example HTML ads so Google web designer
is a tool for creating interactive
animated HTML ads and launching in March
we're adding support for amp HTML ads
the advantages of amp which are you know
no arbitrary JavaScript faster layout
and rendering and so on all these accrue
now to ads yes
and Google web designer helps you create
these without having to know the spec
because you can just visually create
them using the tool and if I want to use
this how do I use it as a adequate or
developer so as an ad creator you can
download it from the web designer web
site you get a workspace where you get
visual editing capabilities so that you
don't need to do code at all you just
add images to your main stage work area
and then you can drag and drop to
animate there's tools for adding
interactivity again all without having
to know how to code
so what is client idea why is it
important for him client ID is how amp
identifies a user each time they enter
the theater an amp page so typically it
takes the form of that cookie and it's
labeled with a MP - a bunch of letters
and numbers and all it does is is
identify you as a user and tracks your
journey throughout the site you're
saying adding a couple lines of code to
your app page yeah
amp doesn't allow JavaScript so do you
guys like what do you add to the app
page to make this happen
yeah so there so there's you actually
need to add code to both your aunt and
Nan amp sites but it's a single line
this is available on am project org and
it's right it's right in the analytics
documentation basically in your you're
saying use client ID true it's really
silly child could do it yeah it's really
simple
and going through those simple lines of
code will solve 80% of grant analytics
but yes I'm concur grammars go to some
resources to find out more about this
that's certainly and one piece of advice
that I would give to give to other
people that are struggling with this is
get involved in the app community submit
an issue submit a question the amp team
and the community is very very good at
helping you understand these problems
I'm active on there as well and so if
you're having trouble you're trying to
do some of these custom dimensions or
you're trying to do this very unique
thing the solution is probably there and
if it's not the amp team is very
anxiously engaged in getting it there
all right well thanks a lot Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
