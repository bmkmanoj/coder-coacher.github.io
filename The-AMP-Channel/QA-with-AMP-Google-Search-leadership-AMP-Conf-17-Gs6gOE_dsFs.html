PAUL BAKAUS: Thanks
for being on the panel.
So this is really your
opportunity, everyone,
to ask questions to both
AMP and Google Search.
The reason why we
did AMP and Google
Search is because a
lot of the questions
that the AMP team gets are
often about Google Search.
So we wanted to take
this opportunity
to be able to answer
both of those questions
with the people that
are uniquely available.
So we have Malte.
We have Rudy, who
will just get to talk.
We have David again, who opened
the keynote this morning.
And we have Richard.
And then we have Ardan,
and Vamsee, and Ranna.
And so, Malte, David, and Rudy
actually work on AMP core, so
AMP, the product itself.
And then Richard works a little
bit on everything, I think,
and assists with
everything that comes up--
and a great, well-known
figure in the new space.
So we're glad to
have you on board.
And then we have
Ardan and Ranna, who
support us from Google Search.
And then we have Vamsee,
who is joining us also
as part of the core
team, specifically
focused on AMP for
[? apps. ?] We will also
have a talk tomorrow.
And now we'll just
go into questions.
What we'll do is
we have two lines.
And now I forgot
the names again.
I think that one of
them [? is Lindsey.
Who's Lindsey? ?]
Right here.
Right here.
[? Melanie. ?]
And then [? Melanie. ?]
So please come up
if you have a question
and you have not
asked it in the slides--
Slide [? Dori, ?]
whatever it's called.
And I'm just going to
alternate between questions.
So let's first pick
a live question.

AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Paul.
I work on FiveThirtyEight
and The Undefeated at ESPN.
And we're new sites.
And we have a lot of integration
and toughpoints with Google.
So we have Google News
in the new site map.
We have AMP, AMP pages.
We have Editors'
Picks, and there's
validation tools, and so on.
And I'm wondering if--
has someone looked
at taking a holistic
approach to all of the ways
Google looks at metadata
and site integrations
and so on to consolidate
those under one umbrella,
to make it easier to
manage, and to take the best
practices from all the tools
and apply them everywhere?
DAVID BESBRIS: Sure, I
can answer that question.
We're trying.
They are all either in
one team within Google--
my team-- or the ones that
aren't, we're talking very,
very heavily about trying to
make sure that we're aligned
on speaking with one voice to
the webmaster ecosystem to make
sure that we don't keep asking--
it fell out?
OK.
We don't keep asking you
to do different things.
Maybe that's a little better.
There we go.
Did anybody hear any of that
or do I need to repeat it?
AUDIENCE: No.
DAVID BESBRIS: No, OK.
So the answer is we're trying.
We're getting a
little better at this.
All of the efforts
that you described,
specifically right there are
all in one team in Google,
and we do all talk together.
And those that aren't, we do
try to coordinate very much
across the company to make sure
that we speak with one voice
to Webmasters.
We haven't always
done a great job
at making sure that we are
aligned with the things
that we're offering to you
as far as APIs and techniques
to integrate with
Google, but it's
a big effort on
our team at Google
to get this to be in
a lot better shape.
I think we've made
a big improvement.
You've seen us start
to unify around
some of these
organizing principles,
AMP being one of them.
AMP is a great way
that you can publish
content ingested into Google.
Google will read it, rather.
And it will use it at all
of our different services.
So AMP is supported in Google
Play Newsstand, in Google News,
inside Google Search,
Google+, et cetera.
And we're doing the same with
things like the indexing API.
We're trying to unify around
very simple primitives
so that you have one place
to integrate with Google.
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

PAUL BAKAUS: So next
is a question from
the [? Slide-doh, ?] which is
[INAUDIBLE] with Analytics.
So what they're
referring to is incorrect
bounce rates, incorrect
unique sessions, be resolved,
which are actually the most
popular items on the list.
MALTE UBL: I can give it
a little bit of context.
So, in particular, Google
Analytics right now
separates the user space
between AMP and non-AMP traffic.
And this has
actually two effects.
One people are sad about, the
other one they cheer about.
They're both wrong, which is--
because they're separate.
If you go from AMP to web,
you're a bounce on AMP,
and you're a unique
web user on both.
So if you look at your
unique users, they go up
and you're like happy, and then
you look at your bounce rate
on your AMP pages,
and it's not good.
So both are basically
incorrect, and that's basically
on our side.
The eBay talk today was actually
exploring some solutions
for this in the short
term, fo example,
to use the referrer from AMP
to essentially add to your--
or subtract from the
bounce rate to get
a more accurate measurement.
But this is,
obviously, only kind
of a patch for this
non-ideal behavior.
And we are working
on several mechanisms
that are going to address this.
So one has already
launched, and it's
more applicable to
your own analytics.
So the Google Analytics
won't be able to use it.
There's now a way to
pass the so-called client
ID from AMP on outbounds
links to your own site
and into your native app.
So you can track that
traffic correctly.
It's, again, not really
usable, but we want to think,
so that team is kind of--
it's definitely looking at
it and unclear as to what
timing is on the horizon.
But they're definitely
trying to address it.

PAUL BAKAUS: Then we'll
take a question here.
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Matt
from the &quot;Financial Times.&quot;
So one of the themes that
came up in the session
this afternoon about
the web platform
was the perceived centralization
of AMP and especially
the Google AMP cache.
So is there any kind of desire
to treat other AMP caches
as more first class citizens?
So, for example,
if Cloudflare has
an article cached, then
showing the lightning bolt
on the search results for that?
MALTE UBL: Yeah, let
me take that as well.

And yeah, it came kind of up on
the web platform panel earlier.
There's a few reasons why
we are using our own MCache,
the primary being that--
it's actually privacy reasons.
So the magic of
instant loading, which
requires you to
load the document
before the user express their
intent to actually see it,
is a very privacy-sensitive
operation.
So imagine you're
going to Google
and you're searching
for something,
and then you're actually
clicking on Wikipedia.
If a merchant that was
selling this product
was prerendered and
now knows that you
were interested
into this category,
you might see remarketing
apps for this around the web,
even though you never
went to their site.
So one of the important
invariants of prerendering is
that the publisher of the
content cannot know that Google
performed this prerendering
until the user expressed
the intent that they
actually want to see it.
And so the way we do this
is, because we control
the [INAUDIBLE]
entirely, we can just
not tell the publisher
that this happened
and respectively have both the
performance and the privacy
in order.
So I think the maintaining this
invariant is the primary thing
in the way of scaling this out.
I think it's actually not so
much the centralization aspect.
Since you're coming from Google,
the cache is run by Google.
They both might go
down, but they're
more unlikely to go
down at the same time.
So if you're coming from Google
and you're staying on Google,
I think it's a-- from a
serving point of view,
it's a good way to do it.

DAVID BESBRIS: And there's
nothing saying that the content
can't--
thanks.
There's nothing saying
that the content can't
be hosted anywhere you want.
The important thing to remember
is that the cache is really
just a distribution cache.
The content still
lives on your site.
You can choose to
host your content.
However, including with
Cloudflare and any other CDN
you want.
We don't view the cache
really as a CDN in that way.
It's just part of the
delivery infrastructure
of Google Search.

PAUL BAKAUS: So next
question online, please.
It's kind of a loaded one.
&quot;So when will the app be
arriving back in Search&quot;?
[LAUGHTER]
DAVID BESBRIS: I'll take it.

So we don't generally
discuss when
or if anything would become
a ranking factor in Search.
There's an awful
lot of signals that
go into determining how things
rank inside Google Search.
And we approach it
extremely scientifically
and methodically, and we
do lots of experimentation
and are constantly
iterating on this.
So I would never
rule anything out,
but I would tell you
that right now AMP
doesn't need to be
ranking signal in Search,
because it's not a signal
that materially changes
how we would rank the results.
It doesn't tell
us much that isn't
told by something
else that's already
one of the ranking signals.
So we don't think we need
AMP as a ranking signal.
If that ever changed
and we thought
it would be a useful signal,
we would incorporate it.
The same thing is true
if the phase of the moon
somehow impacted search ranking.
We're very open-minded
when it comes to this.
But it's not an
important signal for us
right now from a
ranking perspective.
PAUL BAKAUS: [INAUDIBLE].
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
what is planned
for the future of the
lightning bolt badge.
Is that something you guys
plan to keep long term
or sunset it after
a period of time?

DAVID BESBRIS: The lightning
bolt badge in Search?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
DAVID BESBRIS: So I think it's
pretty important that users
know what to expect when
they click a link regardless
of what it is.
And we often label
links in Search,
whether it's opening
in an app or whatever,
so the users know when they
tap what they're going to get.
Today, the AMP
experience is fairly
different than the
regular web experience,
especially inside places
like Google Search, where
there's a viewer.
We render it super fast.
It's prerendered.
It opens typically in a
place with-- inside Search
in an embedded context.
So we just want to
inform the users
that that's what they're going
to get on the other side.
We don't actually expect them
to have any kind of connection
with the lightning
bolt. We're not
trying to build a
brand around it.
It's really just a signal that
this is something different
when you click on it.
We do think that that
same thing is valuable
when it's across
different properties,
so they can get some
learnings across this.
But as long as it's something
that is helpful to the users,
we'll probably keep it.
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Objectively, obviously, we'd
like to get to the day where
it's not necessary to have
the lightning bolt link.
DAVID BESBRIS: Yeah, it would be
awesome if all pages were crazy
fast and worked that way.

PAUL BAKAUS: [INAUDIBLE].

VAMSEE JASTI: So this is a
really deep ads question.
So yeah, it's very specific
to an ad server support.
So I'm assuming you're
talking about DFP.
This is not possible today,
but the DFP team is actively
working on being able to request
all ads on the same page in one
go instead of the
way it works today,
which is an ad request per ad.
And once you are
able to do that,
competitive exclusions
and master companion ads
will just work, so real soon.
PAUL BAKAUS: All
right, thank you.
[LIGHT APPLAUSE]
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah, awesome.
I guess people like that.
DAVID BESBRIS:
People love the ads.
PAUL BAKAUS: [INAUDIBLE].

AUDIENCE: Hi.
On?
Yes, OK.
Andrew from Yelp.
I was just wondering
conceptually,
at a higher level,
what you see--
I guess all of you, to some
extent-- as the longer term
future for AMP?
I know we've started covering
some of that here today,
and we started talking
about progressive web
apps a little bit and how
those can tie together.
And I've seen some
previous talks
where AMP is an
initial page view
and then progressive web
apps take over from there.
But that's obviously assuming
that everybody implements PWAs
correctly, that iOS picks up
support for it, et cetera.
So I'm curious, are
you kind of hoping
that all pages become either
AMP pages or equivalently fast?
Is this an initial pageview
experience and then
hoping PWAs are going
to take over from there?
How does it play with
mobile apps and stuff
as well, and just
at a high level
what the overall
intent is longer term?
MALTE UBL: Yes.
Those were the first
three questions.
DAVID BESBRIS: Maybe I'll add
a little more color to that.
So regarding AMP
and PWA, I think
you described one
pattern, which is
where the AMP can be the initial
page view and bootstrap a PWA,
and it would take
over from there.
But to me, the most
exciting pattern in AMP
is actually-- with PWA is
the combination where AMP
is the thing that starts fast.
It can even boot your
Service Worker up.
And then once you're
inside the app shell
when your PWA is
loaded, your app
can actually load
those same AMP pages.
So really the promise
behind AMP was
that we wanted to
make a format together
with the publishers
and the tech industry
all coming together
to create something
that would work really well
for embedded mobile application
use.
Because it's not the
case today that everybody
just opens the browser on their
phone and browses the web.
Every app on your phone has kind
of got its own browser inside.
They're all showing
content of another form.
Whether it's your
own application
that you've made
that has embedded
WebView or you're opening
something inside Chrome custom
tabs, or it's Facebook, or
it's LinkedIn, or something,
that's how users use the
web today on the phone.
And we wanted to make it easy
for publishers to publish
content that would work
reliably fast in all of these
environments where they could
control the monetization,
and the look and feel, and the
content without a lot of weird
policies, without having to
strike deals with everybody,
just create an ecosystem
where it would just work
and something where the
publishers would benefit,
but the platforms that are
doing the distribution or these
apps-- including
even your own apps--
could rely on it,
could rely on something
with this that passes validation
from AMP is safe to embed,
that it's not going be
able to do anything weird.
It's not going to be able to
hijack the phone and run away.
And it's going to perform
very fast and feel fast.
It's something
that users deserve
when they're using
your app and they're
playing with your
native content,
whether it's a post inside
LinkedIn or something.
When they click on
a link, they want
the links to be as fast
as the native content.
And there's really no technical
reason why that can't be done.
It was just very hard
to do well and hard
to do well at scale in a way
that everybody could agree
with, which is why I'm
super excited that we all
came together as an industry
to help solve this problem.
And that's how we view AMP.
It's an embedded content format.
And that could be
embedded in your own app
and or in your own website,
which might just be a PWA.
RICHARD GINGRAS: In
fact, I should point out
when we started the effort
and were canvassing publishers
and different stakeholders
around the world, one
of the things that came
back to us, particularly
from publishers, was
help us figure out
how we can serve these different
audiences on different devices,
different OSes in a far
more efficient fashion,
so that we can focus on
creating exciting new features
for our users, not simply
replicating functionality
from OS to OS device
to device, right?
So we knew that was
where we wanted to be.
Obviously, it takes
time to get there.
And I thought it was
particularly exciting when
we hear things today about
building canonical pages
and canonical sites
with AMP, that we're
starting on that road.

PAUL BAKAUS: All
right, then we'll
move to the next question.

Yeah, I feel like we have
answered that before.
But the question
is, is there a way
to identify our pages as AMP?
And I'm not sure
if identify means
having AMP up or just
using AMP, but which
aren't hosted by the
Google AMP cache,
because they like to have
control by their own CDM.
DAVID BESBRIS: Nothing is
hosted by the Google AMP cache.
It is a cache.
It's part of the serving
infrastructure of the way
Google serves this content.
It's hosted by you or your
own CDN of choice already.
Yeah, I think we answered it.
MALTE UBL: I think the
answer you actually
gave earlier-- so if you
really want to do this, just
make your pages invalid.
We'll cache them.
You don't get the badge,
because they're invalid,
but it's definitely
a way to do it.
DAVID BESBRIS: I don't think
we would encourage that,
because we actually--
MALTE UBL: No, we
would not encourage it.
DAVID BESBRIS: We
actually expect
most of the AMP ecosystem
will be enforcing validity,
because we do want to
have some kind of constant
that if you're a platform--
even if you're a
non-Google platform,
you want to be able
to rely on the fact
that the page is valid, because
it has certain properties that
come with that, from a
security perspective,
from a performance perspective.
I think if you don't want your
pages to show up in Google,
you can robot your
pages out of Google.
That's always fine
to do as well.
MALTE UBL: So please
don't, but it's an option.

PAUL BAKAUS: Sounds good.
DAVID BESBRIS: So ours
is not the only cache
in the world at Google,
and it certainly
won't be the only cache.
There'll be lots of them.
And I expect all of them
will enforce validity
against the same open
source validity standard.
PAUL BAKAUS: All right, and
then we'll move over to Lindsey.
AUDIENCE: Hi, [? Robin Glenn ?]
from [INAUDIBLE].
I just wanted to ask you
about your rendering of web
components on the server.
I want to know if you're going
to open that up natively,
and if you've been working
with the Polymer team.

MALTE UBL: There
was a lot of echo,
so I didn't understand
the question.
DAVID BESBRIS: Rendering
our web components
for the server side--
MALTE UBL: Oh, so we've
definitely recently started
extensively
documenting everything
our cache does in painstakingly
detail, which is the--
because there is now more
caches, we want all of them
to be as good as they can, so
we just say what we're doing.
Inherently, this type of stuff--
and on our site, it's
very deeply integrated
in Google's production serving
stack because open sourcing is
not always an option.
This might actually
be something.
So, I mean, what I would
be interested in in general
is having something
similar to mod_pagespeed.
If some of you are
familiar with that,
that does similar
optimizations when you're
serving from your own server.
It's definitely
something that would
be interesting to
have in the future.
This technique does not
apply to Polymer directly,
for example, because it relies
on this bootstrapping phase
of AMP where, essentially,
every single web
component of the page has
the exact same behavior
in that very initial step
of the initialization,
so that thi-- our server
doesn't need to understand
what amp-twitter is,
what amp-pinterest is,
and what amp-bind is.
It just needs to understand
that if something says layout
responsive and width equals
400, height 300, what to do,
in that case.
So it's not that you
can't make it generic,
but you can extend it
beyond the Google MCache.
AUDIENCE: Thanks.
PAUL BAKAUS: All right,
and then the next one,
how can we get real-time
validation reports?
How can we force recrawls once
the problem has been fixed?

DAVID BESBRIS: Sorry.

So I think we all recognize
that real-time validation is
actually very important.
One of the things
that we've launched
is a developer tool where
you can put in your URL
and we'll go and fetch it,
and we'll run the validator.
And we'll run the same validator
that we run it in Google Search
to make sure it's correct.
And of course, you can
always validate it yourself
using the JavaScript
console, and when
you're doing development.
And there's even
a Chrome extension
that's been written that you
can just browse AMP pages
and it will validate
them on the fly.
But overall at Google,
we want the pages
that we ingest from you to
be able to give you feedback
much faster than we do today.
Today, the turnaround cycle
for Search console reports
and for things like the
structured data validation
is much longer than we'd like.
It's just a matter of scale.
There's an awful lot
of pages out there.
You guys type really fast.
So it takes us a lot
of time to process.
It's something we're
continuing to work on
to try to make this faster.
But where possible, we're
launching more things that
are like single URL tools
where you could pass in a URL
and have it go and test
it right there on the fly,
so it would shorten the
development lifecycle.
It won't give you
the batch reports
in real-time, because the crawl
does take some time to perform.
There are a lot of
web pages out there.
Additionally, telling us when
there's something that's fixed
and that you'd like to fix it--
you'd like us to
recrawl and reping--
that's also on our list of
things that we're working on.
MALTE UBL: But I
would still recommend
to take the matter
into your own hand.
If you saw Natalia's
talk earlier today,
she was talking in how they
used the amphtml-validator NPM
module, both for continuous
integration testing
and monitoring of
the production site.
So I think actually
getting this integrated
in your alerting
system is really
what you want on search
console, because it's
driven by all crawling.
It's always going to be
indeterministic in the way
that if your business
relies on this working,
it might not be the
ideal way to do it.
PAUL BAKAUS: All right, and then
we have a question over here.
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.
This is one from
[? Marfield. ?] My question is
a little bit more
business-oriented.
When you guys launched AMP
a few-- a year and a half
ago or so, it was
said or at least I
understood that Twitter
would be a big part of that
or at least very well
involved a lot on that,
and I don't see that
happening anymore.
Is there a reason for that?
RICHARD GINGRAS: I
didn't get the last part.
DAVID BESBRIS: So I
think the question--
I just want to
repeat the question
because it's a little
hard to hear over here--
was Twitter, what's
up with that, yo?
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.
DAVID BESBRIS: OK, so, I can't
speak for other companies,
but we do we do work
with Twitter quite a bit.
And they are an active member
of the AMP partnership,
and they have been
since-- as you
mentioned since
the very beginning.
They've launched support for
AMP inside Twitter Moments
today inside their product,
and they're very happy with it.
I do know that they've
been running experiments
to put Twitter support for AMP
in the main feed more and more.
And I expect that
you'll probably
hear some announcements
from Twitter soon.
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

PAUL BAKAUS: Then let's move
onto the next [? Slide-doh ?]
question.
And I think this is a quite
easy one to answer, hopefully.
How long are AMP pages cached
on Google and how to-- well,
at least the second
part is easy to answer--
and how to invalidate them.

MALTE UBL: Where should I start?
The general caching model is
similar to the HTTP header
called stale-while-revalidate.
So what it means is
the cache will always
surf whatever it
has for a given URL,
and then in the
background revalidate.
So that means, especially if you
have a relatively hot document
that gets a lot of traffic, it
continuously gets revalidated,
and the users get something that
has a high median freshness.
This works really well for
relatively popular content.
So definitely, obviously, we--
our heritage basically
is in the news space
where articles get a lot
of traffic for a short time
and then very little traffic
after when it becomes old news.
But this doesn't work
super well for, basically,
longtail content.
And so, that's the second
part of the question.
How can we update the cache?
So there's already an API
that we call update-ping.
If you just google &quot;AMP cache
update ping,&quot; you'll find it.
This is currently
being worked on
quite extensively in terms
of making it more scalable.
So it was originally designed to
basically support the use case
of, oh my god, we got a
takedown request from a judge.
We need to get rid
of this document.
Let's tell the AMP
cache, so something
that doesn't happen very often.
We're extending it so that
you can ideally call it
whenever you know that
you have a fresh document,
because someone hit Save on an
edit box or whatever, right?
Typically, your system will
know when it's publishing,
and you'll be able to
push it into the MCache.
And we're doing this together
with other cache providers,
in particular Cloudflare.
So the system is designed
that in a way that
will enable you
to basically ping
all the MCaches without
having to talk to 15
different proprietary APIs.

PAUL BAKAUS: All right, and
we have a question over here.
AUDIENCE: Hi.
What are your plans
on the desktop?
I understand in AMP
stands for Mobile.
I use a Chrome extension,
which renders an AMP page.
And today's talk by
Senthil has a lot
to say about consistency of UI.
People getting used to 5G
don't want to go back to 4G.
So if I'm serving
an AMP page, I'm
setting a certain performance
and a UI experience.
I want to mirror that on the
desktop as much as possible.
Who doesn't want fast?
Who doesn't want all
the goodness it brings?
So anything on that?
DAVID BESBRIS:
So, of course, AMP
works on the desktop just fine.
The AMP project website is
lovingly crafted by our folks
here.
It works wonderfully
on the desktop.
AMP supports responsive
design, so it
can fit on all these
different form factors.
Not every publisher is
publishing it in that way,
though.
We see-- as you said,
you browse the web
with your Chrome extension.
I'm sure you see
lots of content that
is a tiny little sliver in
the middle of a big, big page.
So I don't think most
publishers, however,
are intending it
to be accelerated
desktop pages versus
accelerated mobile pages.
So it's unlikely that Google--
I think the question is really
directed at Google, because
from an AMP perspective,
it, of course,
works if you do it this way.
I don't think Google is
expect-- will probably
be launching on the
desktop any anytime soon.
Most of the issues
that AMP addresses,
I think it does scale up
beautifully to the desktop.
Obviously, if it's designed
around a terrible environment,
it works really, really
well in a good environment.
But most of the issues are a
lot less acute on the desktop
than they are on the phone.
RUDY GALFI: And I was going
to add to that, I think--
at least on the AMP
side, as Bes was saying--
AMP supports responsive designs.
So you should be able to build
a desktop experience nicely
in AMP.
And I think one of
the things we're
interested to get
feedback on is how can we
be supporting desktop better.
Are there challenges to
getting a desktop experience
on AMP nicely set up?
Are there interesting
ad configurations
that need to be thought
through, because you
want to vary how you serve
ads on desktop versus mobile?
And to Richard's
point earlier, I
think this is all
really critical to start
solving, as we sort of--
as it becomes more interesting
to think about AMP as a format
you can adopt for
canonical pages.
And so, folks who are
going down that path
or contemplating going down
that path, get in touch with us
on GitHub and let us know
where the pain points are,
and what new features are things
we should be doing differently.
DAVID BESBRIS: Yeah,
and without revealing
any names of the
innocent or guilty,
there are several companies
that have talked to us already
about using AMP as
their only format
for publishing on the
web, desktop and mobile.
So I think there's definitely
some interest out there.
And if you're one of them,
please reach out to us
if you're having issues.
RICHARD GINGRAS: In fact, I was
at a conference a while back,
and I was approached by a
publisher of a newspaper
in Lahore, Pakistan, who
had already done this.
He had rebuilt his sites for
desktop and mobile, entirely
with AMP.
They are largely
a 2G environment.
And he was extraordinarily
pleased with the result.
And, obviously, that
wasn't because we
reached out to publishers
in Lahore, Pakistan.
Our reach isn't quite that far.
So clearly, it
can work for folks
if their own situation
warrants it at this stage.
And, clearly, we're encouraging
people to go in that direction.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
a good answer.
Thank you.
And then the next
one, this is also
an interesting specific one.
So is there a way to handle
captures coming to form?
DAVID BESBRIS: Yeah.
We got in touch with a team.
It's getting looked
at, and it's being
worked on and investigated.
PAUL BAKAUS: Great, and then
the next audience question
over here.
AUDIENCE: Hello?
OK.
A question for you all, more
like a clarification question,
because, Paul, I've seen you
in your blog mention this.
You've also mentioned
it in passing today.
With all the consumer-facing
tools that Google has that
measures speed like GA and
PaySpeed insights and all this,
why is it that you say
that you guys can't
determine what the speed is
of a page if it's not AMP?

DAVID BESBRIS: I
don't think anyone
said we can't determine what the
page speed is if it's not AMP.
We certainly can't guarantee
a bound without AMP.
So what makes AMP really,
really fast inside Search
isn't some magic pixie dust.
It's prerendering.
It's just that simple, right?
And in order to
get a prerendering,
the server has to--
or the page has to be able to
talk to the document, which
means all the documents
have to have a shared
understanding of how
prerendering works
and a shared communication path
to and from the host viewer.
To make that work, we have to
have just basically a standard.
And there is no other standard
that is out there today.
We're super open to these
things being developed.
And if there were some really
great alternative standards
that made this stuff
work in a real good way,
we would use them, too.
But we needed
something, because we
want the page to be able
to load it instantly.
And that's really
not going to happen
if we have to make any network
requests off to anybody.
AUDIENCE: So just for
my understanding--
because I just
may not get this--
it sounds like
what you're saying
is that I could follow the
critical rendering path,
I can prerender and all that
as well and be just as fast,
but what you're saying
is there's no way
for you to verify that unless--
DAVID BESBRIS:
Actually, you can't
do prerendering
on Google surfaces
without Google knowing
what you're doing.
That's the point.
Like somebody on
the platform side,
whether it's Google, or
LinkedIn, or anybody,
whoever is going to
do prerendering needs
to know that you support a
certain protocol for enabling
prerendering, that you have
certain guarantees that when
they call you this
way, that you're not
going to do weird, bad things,
which means there needs
to be a validator
to ensure this,
because HTML is
pretty open, right?
It needs to know that you
conform to this specification.
And they need to have
a shared specification
so there's enough mass for them
to bother writing something
that can talk to a
bunch of documents.
And that's all AMP is.
It's just one
implementation of that.
MALTE UBL: Interesting-- one
extra clarification, because I
think this was kind of asked
and the question often comes up
like, why don't we just make
speed a ranking factor and AMP
should participate in this.
And I actually in my role
as tech leader of AMP,
I would say--
and I actually yell at the
Search people all the time.
It's like, yes,
finally do this, right?
And I think it would be
amazing, and AMP would just
be like one of the fast pages.
It would do well
in this context.
It's something that can be done.
I think when you look at the
web from like two years ago,
there was not much fast
rank on It was all--
DAVID BESBRIS: So I think
there's different questions
here about whether something--
how do we treat it inside
Search from whether we can
prerender it and open it,
and whether it has
a lightning bolt,
and whether it's
a ranking factor.
AMP itself is not a ranking
factor at all today,
so it's not like it's
getting a ranking boost,
because there is no
ranking factor for AMP.
Speed is very important to us.
And we do measure speed
when we do things.
It turns out speed is
very hard to measure,
as you alluded to, because
ultimately the speed of how
fast Googlebot pulled your
content is not that important.
What matters is how fast the
users can pull your content.
And that's highly variable.
It depends a lot on the usage
patterns of your content,
but it also depends on your
origin server's performance.
Most servers on the
internet that we see
have very high
variability on latency.
It's often people will
talk about the Google cache
and say somebody's
origin server is faster
than the Google cache.
I mean, that actually
can be very well true.
Google's servers are not
the world's fastest servers,
but they tend to be
the least variable.
So they have a very
low latency tail.
It's very predictable,
the performance,
whereas that's generally not
the case on origin servers.
There's wild variation
across the internet
when you load things.
So if we are going to
measure speed in a way
that we can reliably influence
ranking at scale for our users,
we really want to know
how users are really
seeing the pages, because
that's ultimately what matters.
So these are the kinds
of things we worry about.
AUDIENCE: I've just
got one more thing,
because you made me
think of something else.
DAVID BESBRIS: Sure.
AUDIENCE: So you said that--
no, seriously,
you said something
to the effect of Google
makes the determination
of what's prerendered.
Is that accurate?
Because you said I can't do it.
You guys make that
determination.
DAVID BESBRIS: So you on your
site can do whatever you want.
AUDIENCE: I know, but I get it.
I mean, for Google itself.
DAVID BESBRIS: Like
on Google Search,
we determine what we're going
to prerender on Google Search.
And that's right
now determined only
by a technical
consideration, which
is we need to support a thing
that we can reliably talk to.
And there's only one
thing in the world, which
is the conference we're at.
MALTE UBL: And I explained
earlier, especially
the privacy aspect is
really the key beyond all--
you need the API, and
there's a lot of stuff,
but the privacy
aspect, which, again,
is that the prerendered
page cannot know it's being
prerendered until it's
actually shown to a user,
has to be maintained.
And that means we cannot fetch
the prerendered page from
your server, because you would
know IP address x went to this,
and that would not be something
that users would be comfortable
with.
So that's the
primary reason here.
DAVID BESBRIS: So AMP
is a collective, right?
So it's not something
that's done by Google.
It's done by publishers.
It's done by lots of
distribution partners,
distribution platforms,
technology integrators.
And the reason it's a
collective is in order
to make all this
stuff work, there
needs to be a critical
mass of pages out there
that makes it
worthwhile for Twitter
to invest in something to
show them in their stream.
Because it takes work
for them to build
this kind of technology.
They're not going to
bother with all of that
if there's five pages
on the internet.
And publishers
don't want to have
to reinvent their
content for each person
to invent a new format for
prerendering, for example.
So AMP is just an agreement by
a bunch of different companies
and publishers
that, hey, this one
looks like a pretty good idea.
Let's work together on this.
We can all agree that
if I publish this,
it'll load really fast in
all these environments,
and the platforms
can agree that if I
see enough of these
documents, it's
worth me investing in
building a prerendering stack.
That's just a collaboration.
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so, what
my question was around
prerender is that,
like you said,
sometimes you guys do
from the SERP prerender
that first result. Like, for
instance, if I type in CNN,
you'll see the
prerender for CNN.
PAUL BAKAUS: So I'd like
to interrupt quickly.
I think we should
give others a chance
to answer more questions.
DAVID BESBRIS: Yeah.
We'll have a cocktail later.
You and I will chat.
PAUL BAKAUS: Absolutely.
Yes, feel free to.
And there's a talk at 9:30
from Ranna, who will also
talk a lot about those things.
So please come to
that talk as well.
All right, next question
is when is nap time?
No.
RICHARD GINGRAS: When is nap--
[LAUGHING]
Now.
PAUL BAKAUS: I think nap time--
if I can answer that-- is after
the cocktail hour after you
all had lunch with
each other, and then
hopefully fall into bed to be
really freshened up tomorrow
for another great day
of content, hopefully.
So, all right, on a
more serious note,
a next actual virtual question--
a real question, but virtually.

Does Google analyze
AMP page's content
differently than non-AMP pages?
DAVID BESBRIS: Oh, no.
What do you mean by analyze
is sort of the question?
PAUL BAKAUS: Well--
DAVID BESBRIS: During
crawl for indexing?
PAUL BAKAUS: I don't know.
But yeah, probably that person
should be more specific.
DAVID BESBRIS: So
we'll virtually
answer the virtual question.
MALTE UBL: We validate it.
DAVID BESBRIS: Yeah.
So we do process them a
little bit differently.
As I said, the
fact that it's AMP
doesn't affect the
ranking, per se,
on AMP versus other
documents on the page.
But we do process
it differently,
because we want to validate it.
We want to ensure that it
is an actual AMP document.
And we need to show it a
little bit different in results
so that when users
click on it, we
can swap out the
presence of a canonical
with an AMP alternate,
if there's one provided.
So we do know that it's an
AMP document when we crawl it.
RICHARD GINGRAS: But we don't
analyze the subject matter
in a different way, if
that was the implication
of the question.
DAVID BESBRIS: Tje fundamental
indexing, it's a document,
yeah.
PAUL BAKAUS: All
right, then we'll
do another live
question over here.
AUDIENCE: Hi, John
from Conde Nast.
So a big part of
SEO is Google-- say,
the top three ranking
factors is content,
links, and RankBrain, right?
So when it comes to AMP, it
changes the whole link sphere
in a way, slowly.
Because people now start
getting the AMP URLs and people
start linking to the AMP
URLs instead of linking back
to the site.
So my question is two parts.
One, do you recommend
AMP-to-AMP links within pages
to maintain user experience,
or you don't recommend that?
The second one is, do
you attribute links
back to the CDN for a specific
page back to the actual page?
Is it treated like a 301?
Is it treated like
another canonical page?
How do you take links into
the whole SEO ranking?
DAVID BESBRIS: So it's a
very technical question
that you asked.
We work very hard to
make sure that AMP--
at least on Google's services
and it's structured in this way
that it would be the same
for all search engines--
doesn't impact your
search ranking.
So that signals forward.
That's why we have a
requirement in AMP for it
to be a document-- to be
valid document, that it
has a canonical tag.
The model is such that
you can publish AMP either
as a standalone canonical
document, in which case
it would point to itself
as the canonical entry,
or it's an alternate
form where there
has to be a backlink
to a canonical.
And that's to
ensure that wherever
anybody who is applying
any kind of matching logic
across the web--
and search engines
do this, obviously, for ranking,
and for de-duping, and for lots
of other reasons-- that
we can follow the chain
and do the right thing.
AUDIENCE: And do you recommend
AMP-to-AMP links like
within the AMP page itself?
DAVID BESBRIS: That's up to you.
RUDY GALFI: Yeah, I mean, I
think at the end of the day,
these are your pages.
So I think if that's-- if you
want to link to the AMP page,
you can go ahead and do that,
but canonical works, too.
I think one area we'd
like to do better
is the current
behavior-- at least as
far as Google search
is concerned--
is you click on a link.
No matter what link it's
going-- what kind of page
it's going to, it'll pop out.
And so, with AMP-to-AMP
linking and prerendering,
there's optimization.
There's headroom there to
make a better experience.
And so, that's
something we would
like to look at going forward.
DAVID BESBRIS: So one
of the things that--
SPEAKER: We're having a secret
conversation over my mic.
DAVID BESBRIS: I see.
That's never happened before.
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].
DAVID BESBRIS: By all means.
SPEAKER: Well, yeah.
I worked in Search ranking.
So AMP-to-AMP linking should
be driven by user experience,
not by SEO considerations.
And Search ranking has a system
that finds equivalent links--
equivalent URLs
independent of AMP.
So sometimes, for
example, someone
may be creating
different URL fragments,
but they all point
to the same thing.
So we actually
have a system that
recognizes these three URLs are
the same and add up the points
that they're gathering
from different visits
or different inbound links.
So the same sort of concept
should apply to AMP pages, too.
DAVID BESBRIS: So one of
the things that Cloudflare's
launched recently as part of
their CDN for normal content
delivery is they will be able
to look at the document's links
that are on there and be able
to do URL replacement for an AMP
version for their customers,
and something a publisher can
turn on with Cloudflare.
I think that's
actually very clever,
and I think something
like that is really
a great option for
publishers if they do
want to have automatic
amplification of all
of their outbound traffic links.
RUDY GALFI: One additional
word of advice, too.
So I've thought about this.
And one thing you should watch
out for is sometimes publishers
won't publish--
if they have a canonical
and an AMP page,
sometimes there isn't an AMP
equivalent for the canonical.
And so, when you're setting up
an AMP-to-AMP linking scheme,
you have to make sure that
you handle it correctly
so you're not inadvertently
linking to pages that don't
exist and will 404 on the user.
That's not good for you.
It's not good for the user.
So just be careful with
that kind of thing, too.
PAUL BAKAUS: I think we'll just
take another live question,
because we have a
few people waiting.
AUDIENCE: Hello.
Yeah, is this working?
OK, hi, I'm from
the publisher side.
And it happens that the
demographic of my sites
are pretty young and tech-savvy.
So quick pages is the status
quo at this point with them.
That also requires us to be more
creative with our storytelling,
because now we have Snapchat
and all those examples.
So aside from the publishers
being more creative with how
we're putting our
content together,
do you guys have anything
coming out in your pipeline--
even high level sky in the
pie-- pie in the sky, that one--
ideas that you guys
are putting together
for elevated or changing
storytelling techniques?
SPEAKER: The short
answer is, yes, we do.
AUDIENCE: Would you care
to elaborate a little?
RICHARD GINGRAS: I'll give
you a slightly longer answer.
SPEAKER: Oh, I see.
OK, fine.
RICHARD GINGRAS:
No, we obviously--
we do see a need
and an opportunity
in the market for, obviously,
evolutions in storytelling.
And we clearly would like to
help stimulate and enable that,
and we do think AMP gives us
a pretty strong opportunity
to not only work with others
to explore those possibilities
but then create the underlying
behaviors, and templates,
and so on that can really
help the ecosystem adopt them.
Because one concern
that we have--
and I think others have
had-- is experimentation
with storytelling formats
is expensive, hard to learn.
And we think that's where
we can step in and provide
some assistance.
So that's one of the things
that we're working on
and we'll be talking more
about as we go down the road.

PAUL BAKAUS: All
right, thank you.
There's another
question here, which
is I guess another
one for Vamsee
and another really highly
specific ad question.
You say 85% of AMP
pubs see higher CPMs,
but that's misleading.
We see higher CPMs from AdX--
I don't know if I'm
pronouncing that correctly--
AMP versus mobile web,
but not overall CPMs.
Where's header bidding?
RICHARD GINGRAS: I want to
jump in on that as well.
It's important to us to
understand where publishers
are around the world and
their implementations
with AMP, particularly with
regard to monetization.
So we talked to
hundreds of them.
And the results of that, that
85% came from that survey.
Obviously, there are
variations within that.
And it could be variations that
one ad network is performing
differently from another.
One significant
variation we've seen is--
with publishers is
how much have they
invested in fully implementing
their monetization capabilities
within the AMP pages
versus the non-AMP pages.
And we're seeing
great progress there.
But, of course, at core here--
as you point out
with header bidding--
is we're swapping out the
engines on a jet in flight
and trying to unbreak the ad's
ecosystem, as Malte puts it.
So one of the reasons why
we have these discussions
is what capabilities
you're missing?
What ad networks you're missing?
How do we make sure
they're properly supported?
Now, let's get to
header bidding.
One of the core
philosophies behind AMP
was let's make sure
that every component is
responsible for its
own performance.
And that's a big problem with
web pages today, where one--
as I've often said, the
road to performance hell
was paved by the request
one more line of JavaScript,
because you just don't
ever know what's going
to happen after that line.
Header bidding, obviously,
falls into that in the sense
that it loads in
the header, and it
can degrade page performance.
What we are seeing
is ad networks
begin to develop, in a
sense the alternative,
which is dynamic bidding.
So header bidding
is dynamic bidding
triggered in the header.
So let's support dynamic
bidding but do it
within the confines
of the architecture
and against the
principles where its
responsible for its
own performance.
And there are some ad
networks that are already
supporting dynamic bidding.
MALTE UBL: Just to add some
interesting technical tidbits,
so one of the big, bad
things with ads on the web
is that they're really
slow to get an ad,
because ad servers are like
have to do these auctions where
they talk to other people.
So that takes a while.
And so you want to make the
request as early as you can.
But then the rendering is really
expensive on the client side.

And you now have two
conflicting things.
You want to request
as early as possible
but you want to render
as late as possible.
And right now the request has
a side effect of rendering,
which is really bad.
And so AMP ads can
take this apart.
And we're actually
doing something
that I would call [INAUDIBLE],
where we make the ad request as
early as we can, but then we
render the ad as late we can,
or never, for
example, if you never
scroll to the right position.
And so, I think that is
actually the right way to do it.
I think one of our four
founding principles
is to make decisions
based on user experience
and not based on what is
the easiest to develop.
So header bidding is
a hack to get stuff
working that is great
for monetization,
but it's doing it on the--
while reducing user experience.
So the right way to do it
is to do these requests
in the backend.
That requires, obviously,
all these parties
to talk to each other.
But it's not right to always
just get the easy way out
and say we'll do it on the
client side through that
[? five-frame ?]
[? millisecond ?] latency that
the user has.
So that's really our idea to
finally get all the parties
involved to solve--
to talk to each
other in the backend
and solve the problem there.
RICHARD GINGRAS: By the
way, tomorrow Vamsee
will be doing a
session on AMP ads.
And it's really exciting
for all the reasons I think
we've talked about technically.
But just keep in mind one thing.
One beauty of it is that
AMP ads can work anywhere.
So AMP ads can work
in non-AMP pages.
And so, if we're talking
about really driving ecosystem
change, unbreak
advertising to drive
those markets,
that's really, really
an important step forward.
PAUL BAKAUS: All right, do
you want to add anything?
But you have plenty of time
to talk about it tomorrow.
DAVID BESBRIS: It's all good.
PAUL BAKAUS: Then we'll do
another live question over
here.
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is
[? Sumo ?] from [INAUDIBLE].
My question was since checkout
won't be AMP compatible,
there may be some domain
switching or sub-domain
switching within
the same session.
I'm curious to know how you
advise retailers to measure
conversion performance,
whether it's
in ad GA for organic search and
for AdWords for paid search.
Especially since
retailers are considering
to send paid
traffic, I just want
to understand what you guys
are thinking about that.
And secondly, have you
come across any instances
where anybody's using AMP
as a direct load experience?
RUDY GALFI: Yeah, I can--
OK, yeah.
So there's a couple
solutions we have in mind.
It depends on exactly
how you want to--
what use case you're targeting.
But specifically on the product
detail pages that we're really
trying to get working
in AMP with e-commerce,
we've introduced some
features recently
that enable a form submission
to transmit the client
ID through on the form request.
So that's one way that you
can actually have the AMP side
identifier combined
with an identifier
that you might have
on the other side.
I mean, obviously that's
a very straightforward way
of tracking conversion.
We also support
a similar thing--
I think we mentioned
earlier-- on linking.
So in situations where the user
is moving beween the context
but it's all sort of one
path, one continuous path,
I think these kinds of
conversion scenarios
will be much easier.
There's other kinds
of conversion tracking
that will happen, like you
might come back many, many weeks
later.
And so, we're
working to figure out
solutions for how we
can make the right calls
to be able to track those.
MALTE UBL: And specifically
on AdWords conversion tracking
in the current setup, that
is just going to work.
That should be super simple
and also supported in AMP.
But you probably don't
even need it there,
because your conversion
event won't happen there.
The Google Analytics
space conversion
tracking based on this
magic Gclid parameter
that you might be
familiar with is
suffering from the
same issue that I
was mentioning earlier where
you have separate properties.
And so, you might not be able
to attribute the conversion
in the right spot.
But this is something
we're obviously is--
I know this answer, because
I looked into how to fix it.

PAUL BAKAUS: I'm
going to fire off
three questions from this one.
I'm just going to try to
answer it with one word each.
And you can add two
more if you want to.
When will AMP work in Gmail?
I don't know.
Can we use AMP as a mobile site?
Yes.
Where do I get an AMP
T-shirt and hoodie?
When you become a
speaker at AMP Conf.
Do you want to add anything?
OK, then I'd like to--
we only have two and
a bit minutes left.
So I want to definitely
hear what Dan
has to say with this question.
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
Dan Callahan from Mozilla.
You've said that AMP is not
a factor in search ranking.
Is it possible
for a page to rank
above or alongside the
top stories carousel
without using AMP?

RANNA ZHOU: I'll take that,
since I work on top stories.
So the top stories
block, if you look at it
today, there's a couple of
cases where there's two--
one or two links
above the carousel.
And those we call
the feature articles,
and they rank higher
for some other reasons.
So the carousel has
a bunch of signals
that go into it that
probably you guys can guess,
such as freshness, popularity,
how good the content is.
And those feature articles,
they can be AMP or non-AMP.
And they're in the
top stories block
above the carousel
for that reason,
because they may
be AMP or non-AMP,
but they actually rank higher.
So answer to that
question is yes.
I think one good
example is whenever
there is news about
Facebook, and you
google Facebook,
Facebook.com will still
be the first link,
because most likely you
want to go to Facebook,
but the 500 news
articles about Mark Zuckerberg's
next post are just below it.
So it definitely
can rank below it.
RANNA ZHOU: The
last thing to say
about that is also
that the search results
page is trying to answer
a bunch of user intents.
So whatever best serves
that user intent,
that result is
what ranks higher.
And whether that's the
top stories carousel
is not always true, such
as in the Facebook case.

PAUL BAKAUS: All right, and
I think we're right on time.
We're going to free it up.
Do you want to have
another question?
Do you want to free up
another minute so that people
can jump to cocktail hour.
DAVID BESBRIS: Yeah.
PAUL BAKAUS: See, I
think we can't clear
another question in that time.
The other ones are
pretty complicated.
So please feel free
to talk to the team
afterwards during
the cocktail hour.
Please stay for
the cocktail hour.
We have a live DJ here.
It's going to be fun.
And then just a few
words before I leave you,
you can check your luggage
tomorrow if you want to.
Please bring your badge
that you got today,
because otherwise it will be
difficult to get in again.
And that's about it.
All right, thanks, everyone.
