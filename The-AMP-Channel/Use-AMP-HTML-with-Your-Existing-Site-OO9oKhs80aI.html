but what if you already have a website
here's how you convert it to M HTML we
want to convert your existing site to
amp you should first get familiar with
the fundamental difference as an app it
starts with the fact that you're not
allowed to use any JavaScript on the
page isn't provided by amp in addition
you have to trim your CSS to 50
kilobytes possibly remove a few
disallowed properties and inline it into
the page plus substitute HTML Media tags
such as image and video for your amp
equivalents for better overview check
out episode 6 which dives into what's
all the differences and limitations of
amp I should also note that what I'm
going to talk about next assumes that
you have full control over how your
pages are generated if you're using a
CMS either apply these to your templates
or create or extend a suitable plugin I
also won't go deeply into how to do many
of the following things in practice for
an integrated details dive in a detached
guide in the description anyway let's
get started first in line and simplify
your CSS chances are you're including
CSS via one or many external stylesheets
amp only supports a single inline style
sheet in the head of the page so you
have to merge whatever statutes you have
and inline them into the style amp
custom tag if you've been using a single
style sheet for all of your sub pages
and maybe a CSS framework like bootstrap
on top you'll probably run into the 50
kilobytes size limit and then forces the
first step then is to replace your CSS
framework with something tanja like m
start or get rid of it entirely chances
are you won't need a framework in most
cases not even to build complicated
grids pure CSS codes are now supported
in all modern browsers secondly only
load the CSS required for the current
page instead of a global file that
includes everything
if the valid data still complaints about
your CSS it's probably because you have
a few importance in there or you're
trying to animate stuff you really
shouldn't basically anything that isn't
opacity and transform next substitute
media elements and iframes when you're
done with the CSS you want to replace
any HTML tags that amp doesn't support
the most obvious ones are image video
audio and iframe luckily all of these
have substitutes for amp that function
almost exactly the same and you can
all about them in the amp Doc's next
find em components that replace
third-party ambit's and includes if you
have a content heavy site most of the
JavaScript running on your pages is
probably coming from third parties like
that analytics life were you included or
that Twitter ambit or maybe even social
share buttons every of the ones I just
mentioned have suitable amp replacements
in form of components and you can find a
long list in the reference Docs section
on amp or a talk now in the unlikely
event that some ember trip that requires
JavaScript isn't available as a
component your best bet is to isolate
just a part of the page into its own non
amp page that is then included via amp
iframe next server-side render as much
as you can but how about the things on
your pages that are dynamically
initialized or generated by a JavaScript
like charts image galleries or code
blocks some of these also have
equivalent amp components but another
approach is a server-side render
whatever is possible as an example I now
a server-side render the syntax
highlighted code blocks on my blog as
opposed to doing it on page load by a
JavaScript not only does it play nice
with amp it actually makes my page
faster finally convert into actions to
CSS or amp equivalents you probably have
quite a few interactions on your page
you know like a sidebar that slides out
or a drop-down menu or an image carousel
the good news is that most commonly used
interactions have equivalents in amp
this amp sidebar for a slide-out sidebar
or amp accordion for quarians of all
kinds and carousel for carousels and amp
lightbox for mortals and we've just
launched an bind a component that allows
you to do stuff like if you click this
button load this data into this part of
the code here but if none of these fit
your use case think about whether you
really need JavaScript in the first
place
drop-down menus can be purely done with
CSS using hub pseudo selectors and even
into actions that need to be toggled by
click can be achieved by using the in
famous checkbox hack the CSS community
is incredibly creative have a look at
copán for some inspiration and these
are the broad strokes to go from HTML to
amp HTML when in doubt check out the
numerous ways you can validate your
pages and have a look at some of the
automatic converters that the community
has built for inspiration as always
