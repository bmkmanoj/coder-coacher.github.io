welcome for those of you that could join
us this morning to this introductory amp
101 with Eric Lindley and just before we
kick off there is a live chat in the
corner of the event page if you have any
questions for Eric we can run through
some of those at the end of the session
so Eric over to you
great thanks alright so let me get my
screen up here to present so yes Tom
mentioned I'm a product manager on amp
and I'm here to give a high-level
introduction to what amp is a little bit
of why it is and some of what you can do
with it
so whether this is the first time you're
hearing about amp or know a small piece
but don't have an idea of what the whole
ecosystem looks like hopefully this is
going to be a good starting point so in
a mobile first world speed is really
important we need fast websites to
effectively reach and engage users and
users confirm this every day by not
engaging with and even giving up on slow
sites and despite over half of users
abandoning slow sites over 75% of sites
on mobile take 10 or more seconds to
load on a 3G connection and
significantly longer on non 3G
connections in fact you've probably been
frustrated with slow loading websites
yourself and on top of that they often
use obtrusive ads that block you from
doing what you came to do on a site or
they're totally unresponsive when we
first load them what's happened is that
the the need to monetize has created
bloated sites and bad user experience in
a lot of cases and it's not just this
trade-off of monetization versus
performance reading a fast functional
and beautiful mobile site often takes a
lot of effort and constant
dates it's not always easy to do all the
things you need to do to make your site
performant the all of these are why the
ant project was started it's meant to
help publishers and other webmasters and
developers create fast web experiences
that are straightforward to create and
to manage it's essentially a turnkey
solution to having a performance site
with good UX and by publishing in the m4
format your pages are gonna be fast and
also avoid many of the big user
experience it falls and the idea is that
you can do all this while retaining your
ability to style the page and also
retain the look and feel of your brand
and on top of that and pages are
distributed across a range of consumer
platforms this includes Bing Google
Twitter Linkedin medium Pinterest and
more and what these platforms do is they
link to an pages and provide greater
opportunities for distribution so your
pages appear across all of these
platforms so what is amp actually made
of technically amp is built on three
core components and it's the combination
of these three elements then gets the
superfast native experience first
there's an HTML this is a restricted
subset of HTML and it's restricted in
order to work well with the other pieces
like MJS which is a JavaScript library
that implements amps best practices for
performance and manages resource loading
to ensure that the page renders quite
quickly and finally the app cache
fetches amp pages and caches them and
this improves page performance by
delivering the document in a way that
doesn't depend on a round-trip to the
publishers origin and amp cache also
validates pages to ensure that only
valid amp pages are displayed to users
which is to say we know and the cache
knows and these platforms know that
these pages
are actually using amp as intended using
the guidelines and using these
technologies and one really nice thing
about amp is that it doesn't require a
large development team in budget because
it builds on existing skill sets the
most web developers already have or on
top of the existing framework of sites
built on CMS's like WordPress and it's
flexible amp supports a broad range of
layout style and functionality to say
represent the distinctive style of your
brand look and feel you can see that all
these pages have a fairly different
layout and look and feel but amp is also
meant to support the functional elements
that say encourage onward journeys to
other parts of your site like social
sharing and embeds and and hamburger
menus to enable elements that make the
experience more engaging like video and
image galleries and also elements that
essentially help users to achieve what
they came to your site to do and that
includes things like forms and even
dynamically updating live blogs if the
real purpose that the user came there
for is live updating super fresh and
ongoing content the in format is also
extremely flexible in choosing the right
ad experiences for your users but there
shouldn't be a trade-off of revenue here
your should be able to have choices on
ad server and demand sources as well as
sizes and formats and in fact there are
over 70 ad tech integrations that help
you replicate your existing monetization
models and also supports paywalls and
subscriptions this means that you can
segment your audience to offer more
access to content just for your
subscribers and also many third-party
analytics and view of view ability
providers are also supported to ensure
you can track engagement and ROI and
much
camp supports design flexibility camp
supports many different types of ads as
well you can see here banner ads sticky
ads flying carpet which is this sort of
more engaging but not obtrusive ad
format as well as promoted content and
of course video ads and I alluded to
this before but we know that it's
important to measure how your website
performs an amp has been fortunate
enough to get support from many
analytics providers whose services can
then work with amp and the same is true
for ad tech providers and in many cases
you can continue working with your
existing partners and services in ads
analytics video and social but in the
end you really shouldn't take our word
for it when it comes to the benefits of
implementing amp many publishers and
websites around the world are seeing
solid business results with amp as you
can see here from increased engagement
and retention to audience growth and
monetization amp is really intended and
built to meet or improve your existing
KPIs so what's next well depending on
your current process publishing and
pages could be as simple as installing
the plug-in compatible with your content
management system or CMS to
automatically create am pages for you or
it could be adjusting your templates to
generate amp pages directly there are
how-tos and complete documentation Fram
and those are located in the prod on the
project's website and project org you
can dive in there to help guide more
custom applications and DM community is
growing a growing third-party ecosystem
provides support frame pages including
CMS audio and video media support and
analytics and we're seeing lots of
engagement from the community with
questions and feature requests and
honestly we love hearing from users in
this way we want to hear what your needs
are and what's missing or even what you
like an amp
so yeah thanks for listening and welcome
Dan I'm going to pass this back to Tom
oh all right Tom and and see if we have
any any questions that we can help

really great we don't have any questions

questions that you have after watching
and listening to Eric run through that
today then as eric mentioned hit us up
