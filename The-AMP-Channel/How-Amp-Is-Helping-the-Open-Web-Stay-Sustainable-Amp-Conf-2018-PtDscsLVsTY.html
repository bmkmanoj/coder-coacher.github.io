the ad ecosystem here but I assure you
every one of you interacts with the
adequate system one way or another so at
a high level users go to publisher sites
like New York times.com and try to go
consume consume some content advertisers
have the ability to serve some ads to
showcase their service or brand and
return for paying the publisher some
money in essence you as a user are able
to get rich content for a chance of
seeing some ads the model in theory
leads to a pretty transparent and
efficient ecosystem however there's a
pretty big problem AdBlocker growth has
been exponential and the problem is
worse on mobile and the ad industry is
one of the very few industries where
innovation is leading to worse user
experiences so does this mean that all
ads are bad a surprising survey but page
fare showed that ad LOC users of 77 77
percent of adblock users actually don't
mind some kind of ad formats so the
issue is not the ads themselves its what
the ads actually do and it's an
important distinction here are some
examples for why one would install an ad
blocker first is monetizing publishers
face direct consequences when a random
third-party ad server or ad network
downloads are drive-by malware software
or ends up redirecting or redirecting
users to illegitimate websites there's
no accountability about which particular
ad tech company or ad network actually
served the malware because these
companies have gotten pretty good at
cloaking and therefore serving ads to
proper ads to ad servers when they're
trying to scan for malware or serve like
really good malware when the users end
up end up trying to receive like actual
ads next inspector most of you probably
heard Spectre a vulnerability at the
chipset level that opens up any ad in
the world
to become a privacy nightmare for you
just by you consuming some content on
your mobile device
last but not least crypto jacking I
don't know how many of you heard of this
but there's a bloomin tations in the
wild right now that can actually just
take take consume a ton of battery and
CPU from your mobile devices to
harnessed crypto mining and these are
all pretty bad experiences and there's
one thing that's common across all of
them and just like the Joker from the
Batman movie is pretty unpredictable
volatile and completely unsafe and
that's arbitrary JavaScript the
fundamental architectural problem of the
odds ecosystem is that it allows actors
and and advertisers of potential
malicious intent to serve arbitrary
JavaScript to innocent publisher pages
and we want to fix this architectural
issue however not all javascript is bad
right you want the ability to for
example for a deposit please Express to
your ads in a creative format in a
pretty good visual way or you want to be
able to tell the difference when an ad
is being shown to a bot versus a real
human being and you need JavaScript for
that so we saw the bat-signal and the
amp project is here to help with amp
HTML ads as that can't have arbitrary
JavaScript so in a nutshell it's a spec
based on amp pages and it works great
for embed ability and all of the code is
declarative therefore somebody trying to
you know add some arbitrary JavaScript
with some malware can still do so but it
just won't be valid amp HTML ad anymore
and therefore the publisher or the ad
library or the browser can decide to
just not render it depending on some
code of settings all right so let's take
a quick look at what an amp is you may
live looks like it's pretty
straightforward it mostly looks like a
regular amp document except that it's a
different spec and therefore you need to
comply with the advertising or or the ad
spec and we wanted to make sure that the
it was a more refined spec so we don't
allow things like for example in a pie
frame that would be bad because they add
wood just embed the iframe and I but an
iframe could embed the ad again and it's
not great this is a very simple example
on line 13 as you can see it's it
literally just goes and fetches an image
with static sizes but you know of course
do really creative things for example
here's a timeline based animation
entirely built in the amp animations
framework which is at a high level a
wrapper around the web animations API
with some not-so-secret implementations
for example when an animation is
off-screen amp can actually pause the
animation so saving the battery and CPU
of the device because obviously the in
the regular case you can't know if the
animations on screen versus off alright
so what about spam detection in more
sort of advanced use cases HTML ads are
fully extensible companies that offer
innovative solutions like mote can
easily integrate with amp analytics and
offer viewability and spam detection
services to ensure that you know the ads
that are actually viewed are by human
are viewed by human beings and not by
BOTS when using app analytics there's
also a really nice side benefit where
amp and Alex is able to kind of batch
all of the all of the requirements and
and distribute it out to any number of
requesters off of that data this is a
very simple snippet that mote is
integrating with amp analytics for and
publishers can simply place this or
advertises when creating the ad can
simply place this inside of the ad
itself you can also create really
innovative ad formats here's just a few
examples that we put together by just
combining a few different amp components
and again by doing this especially when
it's served into an amp page we can do
really cool things from from a
innovation standpoint but also pause the
animations when things kind of move
off-screen yesterday you heard about amp
stories and we are working on the
ability to have just the amp HTML ad
infrastructure just work seamlessly with
amp stories
traditionally a bunch of a developers
would hand code all of these ads but in
this particular case it's is really
important to get the performance aspects
right but it I do want to address a
large variety of a developers who do
rely on tools to build really amazing
looking ads basically primarily with
WYSIWYG editors and to tell you more
about Google web designer and its
upcoming support for amp HTML ads I'd
like to invite Heather Douglas who's a
senior software engineer at Google
working on Google web designer hello so
I'm Heather and I'm a software engineer
working on Google web designer I'm
excited to be here today to show you
some of the upcoming features that we've
added to Google web designer for amp
HTML ads so first what is Google web
designer or GWD so gwd is a tool for
creating custom rich media creatives
it's already widely used for creating
interactive animated HTML ads and coming
in March we're adding support for amp
HTML ads so as authors event HTML ads
you may be wondering what does that mean
for you so in addition to the standard
content creation tools that we provide
for HTML we've done some enhancements
specifically for amp HTML ads we've
integrated directly with the amp
components so that you can use amp
components in your ads and we have also
integrated with the amp event action
system so that you can add interactivity
to your ads and then also all animations
in GWD use CSS so we've created our own
amp component that works with the CSS
that gwd generates so that you can
control animation playback and then
we've also integrated directly with the
amp validator so that you'll always know
the status of your ad that it's valid so
rather than just tell you about these
features I'm going to do a quick demo to
show you
so now we're ready to demo and so what
you see here is a pre-release build of
Google web designer that already has amp
HTML ad support enabled so all you do to
create an amp HTML ad is just create a
new file you'll see that there's some
other options here for ads but you want
an amp HTML banner and so you have some
options here for your ad environment the
dimensions for your ad and then the
animation mode you want to be in you'll
understand that after the demo so I'll
just leave the defaults so this is my
main Google web designer workspace now
of course you can arrange the panel's
how you want so to begin with I need to
add some content to my ad to work with
so I'll do import assets add some logos
and a download button and that adds them
to the stage it also adds them to your
library panel for future reference
now I'll just put these into a rough
position of where I want them to be so I
can animate them so now I want to add
some text to my ad and to do that I can
use the text tool and we'll say Google
web designer now supporting amp HTML ads
and of course I can format this text
you change the size and center it now
I'm almost ready to start animating but
I want my text in my button to fade in
later on so I'm gonna go ahead and
select them and set their opacity to
zero so now to animate all I do is add a
keyframe and then change the position of
my content and I'll add another keyframe
and I'll fade in my text and then one
more key frame and I'll fade in my
download button so now you can preview
this animation directly in the tool you
can also go ahead and change the
duration of keyframes and so now this
animation looks about how I want it but
I want to add a loop so that the
animation plays once before or twice
before it shows the download button so
to do that I have to use the Advanced
Mode of the timeline and this is
actually where you can get more precise
editing functionality for your
animations you can edit individual
keyframes for individual elements you
can also scrub the timeline to see how
your animation lines up but what I want
to do is I want to add an event and a
label so first I'll add a label and this
is essentially just naming a point in
the animation so that I can reference it
in events and then I'll go ahead and
I'll add an event and this is also just
saying at this point in the animation I
want to trigger something else to happen
so to configure that you can double
click and you'll see that there's a list
of default or actions that you could
take you could toggle visibility on an
element or in a multi-page ad you could
go to a different page but I want a
timeline event go to and play a set
number of times and my animation is on
page 1 and I want it to repeat once so
now at this point you actually have
to preview in a browser because it uses
the animation runtime and now you have
an animated ad but of course when
someone clicks on the download button I
want it to take them to the download
page for Google web designer so I'll go
ahead and add an event and this time I
have to choose that on Mouse tap when
you have a tap event you have this
special exit event and I want to exit
the ad and I want to go to the download
page for Google web designer so I can
preview this in the browser again and
there you have a fully functioning
animated interactive amp HTML ad so
there are just a couple more things that
I wanted to show you I told you that we
integrate with the ad validator directly
so that's over in our ad validator panel
this will show you the size of your ad
there's also some checks for the
environment that you're going to be
running in and then here is the amp
validation status and you can see that
this is valid amp HTML and just to show
you what it looks like when your not
valid I'll go ahead and add some CSS
which I know is not allowed and you see
you get a little warning message that
you need to check your validation so one
more thing is you might be wondering
what the document that is generated
actually looks like or you might have a
specific change that would be easier to
make in a code view so you can switch
over to code view and this is the actual
ad that you're creating and you see it
uses the amp for ad spec it has the
standard boilerplate and you have your
CSS for the ad and then of course all of
your images are amp images and it
includes the amp components that you're
using and the configuration for the
components and you can even see the exit
event that's been configured using the
event system
so one final step that you're going to
need to do is you're going to have to
publish your ad and you can do this
either locally or to Google Drive and
basically this will give you a summary
of your ad and then it will create a zip
file that includes the document and any
assets that you used so this was just a
quick demo for a basic ad I wanted to
show you an ad that one of my co-workers
created a sample that has some more
interactivity go ahead and preview this
when you click on a product you can see
more details so this was just a quick
intro to Google web designer of course
there's more functionality which I
didn't have time to show you can create
templates you can do multi-page ads and
we are launching with support for the
amp carousel component and support for
other components will be coming soon and
as I said this is a pre-release build
but we're planning to launch this on
march 21st with support for Adwords and
i'm really looking forward to seeing
what you all create Thanks
okay wasn't that great we can't wait to
see what developers do with that and try
not to fall okay so let's let's move on
so from ad creation now we need to talk
about how the serving aspects work of
this ad of the amp HTML ads so if you
paid attention through all of what I
talked about you're probably thinking to
yourself but wait the ad server can
still cheap and kind of call yourself
amp HTML ads but still spread malware
right
however ambition would ship with a built
in trust a trust model we have more than
one ways to do this
three essentially I'm gonna walk you
through the first two but let's let's
talk about the first one first of course
it's called server-side signing
typically the browser makes an ad
request but it's really the ad library
that's making the ad request out to the
ad server at which point an ad server
would conduct an auction in this
particular case let's assume it's oh
it's a car advertiser a bike advertiser
and a bicycle advertiser say the
impression in this particular case the
car advertiser wins by bidding the
highest amount of CPM for it and
therefore returns back with an amp HTML
ad at which point the ad server needs to
sign the amp HTML ad with its private
key and return it back to the ad library
and the ad library using the public key
that's already been submitted by the ad
server on github can verify to make sure
it's actually valid and this is one way
we use server-side signing but the
problem in this case is the ad server
needs to be trusted to have like the
right keys in the right place and it can
also be pretty cumbersome especially if
you're a smallish ad network to do this
and therefore we wanted to ensure there
was another way that that's easy to
bootstrap and also start to sign so
CloudFlare a third party company offers
any ad server to sign add ad responses
the browser ad library in this case
would belong to CloudFlare and similarly
all of everything else stays the same
but Claude Frollo will take care
off on an impression basis or they also
offer you know hosting your your sort of
request by routing them via their CDN to
be signed and delivered but today we're
announcing a third way to manage this
building trust model and to tell you all
about it I'd like to invite James Avery
who's the CEO of AD zerk James hello
happy to be here my name is James Avery
I'm the CEO of at zerk and today tell
you a little bit about us real quick and
then I'll dig into what we've been doing
with amp so we are essentially an API
company so we work with developers at
really interesting publishers like
Reddit and Strava and Wattpad and we
help them build really innovative at
write so we think that there's a lot
could be improved in ads we provide an
API that helps do that so you know I was
a developer in the past and there's a
lot of developers in the room if you ask
a developer what's the first thing they
normally say about ads they say ads suck
right so why do they suck so if you go
to a random page and you look at how
long it takes a page to load or how many
requests there are and then you think
about how many are coming from ads so
we've looked at pages that literally
have 4,000 requests that are made for
ads so you guys are building these super
sleek pages that are super efficient and
then there's 4,000 requests for ads on
them we think that's a pretty big
problem they also you know that's eating
up mobile data right so everybody's
worried about how much data they have
how much you know what's happening on
their phone and you know this is only
eating up that data if you look at the
page load the page size that you're
creating as a developer versus what's
loaded through ads it's it's pretty
depressing this is why so many people in
this room probably run adblock right
because it helps your mobile data and
things like that
it also leaks sensitive data so vamsee
talked about this a little bit with
malware and things like that but also
like it's your cookies are being shared
with third parties that you've never
talked to you know your IP address is
being shared with them all of this stuff
is happening as these ads are loading
and as a publisher
you actually don't have as much control
as you think because of all these
auctions happening and all this stuff
happening in the ecosystem it ends up
where you know there could be people
serving ads on your site that you don't
know who they are it could just be some
third party ad network that bought you
know an ad on your site and now it's
showing up this is only going to become
a lot more important with gdpr which you
know we're in Europe so I think most
people here probably are already worried
about gdpr it's coming very soon
companies are gonna be on the hook for
millions of dollars or Euros if they
leak personal information so how can you
control what's happening on your site if
you're just running people's JavaScript
right also malware and redirects you
know malware is a really big problem but
if you're in add ups and there are a
couple people here probably in add ups
or or deal with that redirects or like
the scourge of that UPS so you know when
you go to a mobile site you're just
you're trying to find a you know a cafe
and you click on a link and then it
redirects you automatically to the App
Store or redirects you to a site that
then pops up like 6 pop-ups publishers
don't want that no publisher wants that
but it sneaks in there and a lot of the
ways they do this is they run those on
you know Saturday night at 3 a.m. and so
that all the guys are asleep and they
get paged and their boss calls them
because somebody posted to you know a
forum complaining about redirects in
your app so another really big issue and
then fraud right because there's all
this ambiguous stuff going on people can
start buying your inventory and then
resell on your inventory you know or
they can do all kinds of stuff like this
that's just costing you money as a
publisher so we've liked we think we
have an interesting solution to this so
how do we fix that right so we think
that I think what what vamsi's doing in
the ads HTML stuff is really good we've
actually been supporting that for a
while we work with CloudFlare one of our
customers cox media is out there
somewhere works with us to sign ads ads
you know HTM or amp HTML ads and that
works really well but we think
fundamentally as developers and you know
as product people ads shouldn't be able
to use any JavaScript right like we just
cannot trust the JavaScript that's
coming
back so we believe there should be no
JavaScript we believe they should make a
single fast call right you know should
be a single call to the server to say I
need ads to monetize this site we
shouldn't have to make 12 let alone the
thousands that sometimes happen and then
also we should turn the minimum amount
of data needed you know we're all
developers we all care about that client
the server relationship and what we're
returning you know why would you you
never write an app that called the
server and the server returned like a
script tag that been executed some other
script tags and then randomly put stuff
in there maybe a couple years ago we
might have but we wouldn't now and then
they should file an explicit interface
right like we should tell the advertiser
is the only thing we're willing to
accept from them and how that will load
on to our site and they should adhere to
that interface so this is partially what
we do it adds er so we have a decision
API this allows server to server calls
and allows client to server calls all
through a simple API I'm not going to
sit here and pitch our product but you
know it's basically ad server as an API
but so talking to the amp team we want
to figure out a way to mash up what
we've done is like a decision API and
how do we get that to work with amp
because a lot of the customers who work
with the server to server you don't want
to necessarily do that with amp because
you want your amp stuff to be cached you
want to load really quick you don't want
to do a server to server call you want
to happen through the amp interface so
this is where we've worked with the amp
team and they've been really great and
helping us figure all this out and how
to do it so we have an amp ad tag which
is kind of a standard amp ad tag set to
ads are and then what we do is we have a
template so there's a template that is
in the amp cache and so it's a I'll show
all this in a second it's just a simple
amp template and then the you make a
call to ads or we return a simple amount
of data and then that's rendered in the
template let me go to the next step so
easier so here's the amp tag you know
pretty simple if you've ever worked with
amp ads this is what it looks like it's
you know type ads are a little data
your site ID and things like that like
what ad size you want and then this is
the really cool part is that all we're
returning is this JSON right so it's
just a simple amount of JSON that we
returned from the server that will
decide what ad to run and so we have
like a URL which is like where we're
gonna redirect the user when they click
we have an external URL which is just
the link to our CD end image we have
like a title with hype and then the
impression URL is what we use to track
that somebody's seen this ad and then
what we have is our simple template and
so this is a template that's loaded is
just mustache it's just loaded into the
amp cache and we load this once so users
loza's templates in their cache and then
every time they see an ad it can render
on this template so I mean this is you
know that'd be kind of anticlimactic to
show an ad but there's an ad and it's
from you know loading to this template
it's kind of all this stuff that's going
on to do that so the benefits of this
you know we have no third-party
JavaScript at all we're just passing
back JSON you know advertisers could
only pass you back that simple interface
that you've accepted all the rendering
is done client-side you know if you guys
are building new apps today you're using
react and angular and stuff like that
right that's so you can do all the
rendering on the client-side so you can
get simple API responses back and do
your rendering of the client-side we
think the same the same thing should
apply to ads the payload reduces over by
50% or payload reduced by over 50% so
because we're not sending back all that
HTML every time or even the amp add HTML
we're just sending back the JSON we
reduced the payload over 50% and that's
on that simple ad and so if you get into
a kind of the complex animated stuff
like that the payload reduction is going
to be even more dramatic and then also
templates are cached right and so I've
talked about this like three times so I
think it's the coolest part is that
these templates are cached in the client
and so the stuff is loading really
really quick so that's that's pretty
much all I want to talk about I think
it's a pretty interesting thing but I do
and I will say to like this is just an
example of a simple template we could
you could run you know you could create
any template you want for any
amp HTML ad so some of the stuff that we
saw in Google web designer like that
cool shopping you know with the
different items you know you could
create that as a template for your site
and then advertisers could bid in with
JSON to promote their their products or
their retargeting products things like
that so that's all I've got
so please if you're interested in
talking to us about doing this on your
publisher site or helping to improve ads
and speed things up like please get in
touch happy to talk thank you James you
also really enjoyed working with you
cool a number of partners all over the
entire ecosystem have already started to
experiment and start to deliver amp HTML
ads you know promoting a safer and a
faster ad standard for those of you who
haven't seen it before
it's interesting to note the comparison
between an app which DML ad and a
regular ad in in real life so on my
right side is an a personal ad and my
left side is a regular ad they
essentially look the same but you can
see how much faster the ad actually
renders so how are these am personal ads
performing from a revenue standpoint
because of course they need to be able
to make money right we've had a few
partners try it out in production and
the results are pretty great first is El
Pais it was a large Spanish news
publisher and they saw that the latency
with am personal ads was reduced by not
close to 90% and as a result the
click-through rates jumped up to 32%
higher logic ad who's a demand-side
platform from Japan also saw very
similar results and to be clear these
numbers are controlled by removing the
benefits that amp HTML ads received one
inside of an amp page from a
prioritization standpoint so ok amp
pages are growing but they're still not
as much as many as you know the entire
web right there's still a small subset
so we wanted to ensure that amp HTML ads
just seamlessly work with non amp pages
too and in a few quarters we're also
working on the ability for am personal
ads to work in
of mobile apps so as an advertiser you
can just create one ad and have it work
across all the platforms be it mobile
desktop em or nan nan em or inside of
mobile app okay so switching gears let's
talk about amp pages and the
monetization of regular ads on amp pages
so from day one we wanted to ensure that
regular ads and the existing ecosystem
just worked however we wanted to ensure
that the user experience elements were
great on amp pages for example we took
care of things like amp pages can't
happen officials blocking the content
that the user in the first place came to
the site for or the fact that amp amp
amp does not allow ads to be non-static
in that you have to have definitions on
the amp page so that you don't you've
probably experienced this where you're
trying to read a content and the ads
like trying to dynamically size itself
so it's pushes content down you're
trying to scroll again it's just a
nightmare so now that's possible in amp
so that's a pretty good user experience
and we also ensured that ads are always
served into iframes with pretty tight
sandbox requirements and therefore auto
redirects will won't we can't happen and
along with all these good user
experience standards we started to
optimize for revenue and do we can do
that because with amp pages we control
the entire life cycle of rendering the
ad and the rest of the page and we saw
pretty amazing stats so this is just
numbers based on double-click Ad
Exchange and Adsense and we're seeing an
increase of 318 percent in terms of
impressions and 3x increase in ad
revenue just paid out to the publishers
over the last 12 months also note that
all of this revenue is purely for just
from ad exchange and Adsense publishers
earn even more by being able to just
directly place their own ads which is
not calculated in these numbers these
improvements come from a few different
places first publishers are starting to
put more number of
ads on their pages and essentially
bringing the number of ads inside of
their amp pages to be equal to the
number of ads on their non amp pages of
course more publishers are starting to
opt in to placing ads in the first place
and finally the amp team and a number of
ad networks are finally trying to
optimize the entire so if you think
about it we've built a pretty tight
ecosystem where will not compromise on
the user experience and keeping that
tight every ad networks and and the amp
team are trying to optimize for revenue
so and therefore publishers are able to
see these big massive revenue gains over
the last 12 months and also from day one
we wanted to ensure that there was a
diverse set of ad networks that are
supported and amp pages so today there's
about more than hundred plus ad networks
that are paying out revenue to
publishers and just to iterate ample
never or doesn't ever take any sort of
rev-share
from any of these ad networks so all of
the money is going directly to the ad
networks or to the publishers individual
publishers are also seeing pretty great
revenue increases so for example india
today who is a large publisher from
india is seeing an increase of 20% in
revenue per page but the amazing thing
is they were able to get this with fewer
number of ads on amp pages compared to
their non M pages so today we're lucky
to have one such publisher who is
working really hard on optimizing their
inventory to see such revenue gains as
well I'd like to invite Adam Leslie
who's the head of commercial operations
at Metro UK to work us through their
sort of journey to get better revenue
hi everyone happy Valentine's Day so for
anyone who has never heard of Metroid I
could okay before we are one of the
fastest-growing newspaper websites
according to the Press Cosette's ABC's
we have were based in London but we also
have offices in New York and we are
written by Millennials for Millennials
covering a number of different topics
everything from news to sport to showbiz
it's also worth noting that were part of
the same group as the mell online and
commercially there's some collaboration
there which is something I talk about
later on in my presentation so header
bidding is a concept that publishers
have been using in their standard web
pages for several years to greatly
increase the amount of people who are
bidding for each individual app
placement and the way that this works is
that you have some wrapper tag in the
head of your page which essentially
initializes calls to all of the
different videos that you have that you
want to work with the wrapper will then
get all of the responses media at the
best price and the output will be the
best price across all of your bidders as
a key value and a cached asset on the
client the price is the key value then
it gets passed to the ad call which is
in a friendly iframe and if the rapper
has the best price then a command is
served it's a command to serve from the
ad server to render the asset from cash
so for amp we start running into issues
because the wrapper itself and the cost
all of the bidders are essentially
JavaScript this is directly on the
client which is not allowed within amp
for speed benefits equally as he
mentioned the iframes that we use in amp
the amp at iframes are not friendly they
are say frames which make passing key
values into them not possible or very
difficult so for these reasons whenever
we initially launched amp by 2 years ago
on the male line we were unable to
replicate this method within amp however
over the past 12 months there's been a
lot of developments within server-side
bidding that has helped us create some
solution within amp pages so for amp
what we've been doing is using the
remote HTML method to call some pre bid
server configuration and what that means
is that before we generate every ad call
we
call some remote document that hosts our
configuration for Prevage on the road on
the remote page we then go through a
similar process when we call all of our
betters get the best price back as a key
value I want to send deliver
to the iframe is a key value along with
a secondary iframe containing the code
for the winning asset now I just want to
clarify this all happens within the
Empire i frame and that the Ampat iframe
that I'm discussing has a type double
click configuration so it's not no no
different from what a lot of other but a
lot of publishers already using so
before you would have been running and
I'd set up which would have your direct
campaigns competing with Google Ad
Exchange potentially bolstered by some
exchange bidding demands however
afterwards you get the direct benefit of
the prepaid demands
however the Google Ad Exchange also then
has to work harder to win the
impressions off of pre bitch so you get
that indirect benefit as well so from
that sugar could ek I rolled the site in
the first week of June there's quite a
lot of use here but I'm gonna go through
all them individually so on the left
hand side I have a stacked view of the
revenue by day so you've got ad exchange
with pre bit demand stacked on top of it
and you can see started start of June if
literally the first day that we deployed
we started making more money with us no
you know tracking it several times the
previous run rate whenever we weren't
running privilege in amp on the right
hand side we have the view of the our
CPM which is the essentially the amount
of money we get paid for every 1000
adverts whilst there's a lot of noise
and variation it's pretty clear that
there's a very strong upward trajectory
and the our CPM suppresses post we're
looking at an increase on the overall on
CPM about 98% with about a 49% increase
in the Google Ad Exchange CPM which is
that indirect benefit that I mentioned
earlier over the period of May to
December which is the window that I
focused on for this presentation we had
due to editorial optimizations in just
general traffic growth we saw an
increase in the amount of available ad
impressions of 198 percent however over
the same period we saw an increase in
the revenue of 573 percent which means
we managed to grow
the revenue at nearly three times the
rate that we most school the rate of
available impressions so this sort of
growth can't really be explained of
anything outside of enabling the the
pre-bid within amperes so after the
successes that we saw on Metro de coeur
de que I was then tasked with rolling
out the same method or framework on
melon line and for the mail online we
went live in about the last week of July
observing very similar trends so the day
one of deploying we were making more
money but it's not tracking it you know
several times the previous rum rate on
the right hand side again we have the
same view of the our CPM observing again
a very strong upward trajectory in the
are CPM supreme IRS's post we're looking
at a 92 percent increase in the overall
amp CPM with a 72 percent increase in
the Google Ad Exchange and CPM the the
amount of available impressions didn't
grow as much however it is worth noting
that the revenue did grow three times
faster than the read of available
impressions grew for the male line
specifically so in preparation for
coming and speaking about this today
I've done a bit of an audit across all
the publishers that I had behind me
these publishers are all ad funded like
ourselves they're all using the
double-click element and only one of the
publishers on this slide was actually
using the method that I've been running
through today which means that there's a
lot of opportunity for publishers to
enable this technology within app to
make a lot more money however it's worth
noting that the method that they use
probably won't be what I've been
describing today because both delayed
fetch and the remote HTML are going to
be deprecated in about a month and a
half however Jesus so due to the
successes that we've seen after enabling
pre-bid within as soon as we found out
about the deprecation we've been working
very closely with both pre-bid and amp
to ensure that some alternative solution
was available before the deprecation
we're very excited to see a lot of the
work that's happening with pre-bid
within the real-time configs protocol
so looking through the real-time
configurations documentation and
understanding you know previa time
working with it quite closely this is a
very rough representation of high
pre-bid could work within remote
real-time configs however I'm actually
not gonna explain this that much because
it's something that we're gonna go into
in a lot more detail later on in the
session so closing thoughts of myself
more published you should definitely be
looking to do this however they should
probably wait until the real-time config
method is available the whilst the
method or the technology is changing the
outcome isn't in fact it may even be
better there's certain benefits by us
not being on by us not by a still using
route HTML that we're not currently
seeing mainly the fast fetch so we're
still using delayed fetch not using fast
fetch so by us moving the same method
across to a fast first infrastructure it
may actually mean that the revenue you
optics are even better because they are
slow faster the next point is that this
method is not unique to pre bid so
whilst from my understanding or from
what I've seen in the market pre bid is
the only rapper that offers a documented
solution for amp technically speaking
any any rapper that has server-side
bidding capabilities shooting probably
could and probably should build out some
sort of solution for amp so if you're a
rapper of choice is not pre bid and it's
not an option for you utilize that then
you should definitely be speaking to the
rapper that you do use to ensure that
this is on their product roadmap the
next point is a bit of an issue that we
spotted with pre bit server specifically
within Europe some of the other bidder
some of the bidders currently don't work
that well within Europe so if you're
tight on dev time and you're mainly
European in traffic you might want to
focus your dev time on just up Nexus and
Rubicon however that issue should be
resolved within the next few months and
finally if you are a global publisher
who trades off a single domain it may be
that you have different commercial teams
in different regions and it may also
mean that you're using different rappers
and different regions and this is
something that is not currently possible
in amp because the
things that you post are global because
this is of interest to us we've been
working closely with the amp team to
come up with the solution on this and
the current thought processes to make
some changes or make some developments
to the amp dynamic CSS classes component
to essentially encompass some sort of
geo differentiation
all right that's everything from me I'm
around for the rest of the day if you
have any questions feel free to come and
grab me but also be in the Q &amp;amp; A literal
thanks very much back to them say
there's a lot that goes into this stuff
doesn't it all right Thank You Adam
so just switching gears we want to make
sure that we give you just a brief
overview of all the features sort of we
launched from a monetization perspective
to help publishers make more revenue
with an amp over the last few months
the first is single request architecture
or SRA it's basically the ability to
sort of combine all their ad requests
into one single ad request all the ad
slots in one single ad request and make
them to the ad server what this allows
especially for larger publishers and
advertisers is stable to tell a story
across the entire page based on sort of
the sequencing of the different
creatives or for example competitive
exclusions where let's say coke is
trying to buy out the entire page they
don't want a Pepsi ad and therefore the
ad server needs to know that all of the
know all of the ad slots within the page
and the sequencing for them next is auto
ad refresh where say a publisher creates
an interactive which only lasts one
single viewport and therefore the user
spending most of their time within this
one single viewport and they want to be
able to and therefore the publishers
should be able to sort of monetize them
by defining sort of a set interval for
the ad to refresh at that point however
we've added South sensible restrictions
where we're saying oh the ad can't
actually refresh in under 30 seconds
native ads are all the rage and for good
reason they are not as jarring and
they're also pretty seamlessly
integrated with the rest of the content
and therefore we've launched fluid ads
and which gives the ability to kind of
take over the entire space available
dynamically by a certain ad for example
in most cases this is up to the device
with often
and I'm a video provides the ability to
start to monetize your video content
it's a free amp component that ships
with a video player and easily monetize
is based on from different different
aDNA or video ad networks including
double clicks it works seamlessly with
with all of the other ad networks as
well and so publishers should take
advantage of this last but not least is
real-time config that Adam sort of
briefly talked about but basically it is
not just for header bidding but it opens
up a number of different possibilities
for publishers like being able to
enhance the audience data on incoming
requests or do sort of geo based
targeting so for example similar to how
a barista might pull up full a shot just
before making your cappuccino the
real-time config allows you to enhance
the ad request just in time before
making the call out to the ad server to
get the highest sort of eCPMs and to
tell you more about just one application
of RTC I'd like to invite Matt Jacobson
who's a product manager at app Nexus to
give you a brief overview of their
integration good morning everybody my
name is Matt I'm a product manager for
app Nexus and today I'm also here as a
product manager representing pre-bid org
so a couple of minutes ago we heard from
Adam and he give us some examples about
how publishers are already using pre bid
solutions publishers like Metro code at
UK and the Mail Online are already using
pre bid to optimize monetization across
some of their amp pages so today I want
to give you a bit of background as to
what exactly is the pre-bid organization
and discuss one of the ways that we're
actively collaborating with these types
of publishers and with the amp team to
contribute to the long term viability of
the open and programmatic advertising
ecosystem so what is pre bit work well
preview org is an open source foundation
and you can find this on github but
really Freiberg is a collaboration
across a number of industry partners all
of whom are dedicated to the development
of an independent and
and source header bidding solution an
efficient programmatic monetization
through fair competition so pre bid work
manages a number of projects some of
which you might be familiar with but
I'll go through a few the key ones here
first in the original project is pre bid
GIS which is an open source and
independent client-side header bidding
wrapper second is pre bid server which
is an open source implementation for
server to server header bidding we also
manage iOS and Android SDKs which are
designed to work with pre bid server and
provide pre bit demand for mobile app
publishers and we've added a number of
other tools as well like header bid
expert which is a browser extension
designed to facilitate troubleshooting
and monitoring of header bidding setups
so just as a sense of scale publishers
are using pre bid today to drive
programmatic revenue to more than 35
billion impressions per day across more
than 25,000 websites and Priebe it's
also a vibrant open source community
with more than 250 individual
contributors and pre-bid offers more
than 100 adapters including both client
side and server side demand partner
adapters analytics provider adapters ad
server adapters and more so despite the
fact that pre bit and amp were
originally created to achieve different
ends really in terms of their core
values they're not too dissimilar from
each other so pre bit in amp are both
open source projects they're both
looking to drive greater transparency
and accountability into the ecosystem
and they both have a deep focus on
performance and end user experience so
given this shared commitment to core
values and principles in a lot of ways
collaboration between these two projects
makes a lot of sense so earlier Adam
explained how he's using a remote HTML
file to fetch pre-bid demand and this
certainly works the problem with this
though is that amp fat fetch does not
allow for the execution of custom
JavaScript so our goal became how can we
enable publishers to access pre-bid
demand through amp fast fetch pipes so
I'm happy to say that in collaboration
with publishers and in with the amp ads
team we're solving for
this issue by enabling pre-bid server to
be called as an amp RTC vendor which can
return slot level targeting through JSON
RTC responses so the story of our mutual
collaboration here probably started last
April this is when the amp ads team
released their first spec their first
intent to implement for amp add
real-time configs and as pre-bid we
recognized the potential value here but
there were a number of issues for us so
first of all the original proposal only
allowed for a single RTC call-out which
means that a publisher wouldn't be able
to say both access header bidding demand
and also other information other
targeting information or other data
pre-auction and also there was no
ability to set a slot level targeting
which pre-bid relies heavily upon to
ensure that we're able to associate bids
from demand partners with individual ad
units so after some back-and-forth and a
few months later a new proposal was
released this time called amp RTC - so
with this new proposal up to five RTC
call-outs were supported and critically
RTC call-outs would be supported per
slot which means that pre-bid had the
ability to associate targeting on a slot
level and associate bids from demand
partners with individual ad units so as
you might expect along the way we
encountered a few other minor issues and
we're still working with publishers and
with the amp ads team to solve for some
of them and we'll continue working to
optimize this type of integration for
publishers but the key result here the
key takeaway is that we have been able
to add RTC support to pre bid and so we
will be enabled we will be able to
enable publishers to access header
bidding demand through amp fast fetch
networks so I'll briefly touch on some
of the requirements here and for running
pre-bid with amp RTC and hopefully we'll
all agree that there's nothing too
particularly arduous here so first
you'll need to be running some amp bad
elements for a network that supports
fast fetch and amp RTC a network like
double-click for example second you'll
need to create some server-side pre-bid
configurations and a configuration here
is
just a list of the demand partners that
you're working with and their respective
parameters and third on your amp ad
units you'll need to define an RTC
config attributes which will make a call
to pre bid server as a vendor and which
will define any parameters necessary for
pre bid server to be able to retrieve
the configuration information
server-side so here's what this looks
like and I won't go through every single
step here because that's what the
documentation is for and I can tell that
everybody's sort of getting ready for
lunch
but essentially how it works is you've
already got your ant bad element for a
network like double-click that supports
fast fetch and amp RTC and you define
pre-bid server as your RTC vendor so the
amp runtime will make a call to pre bid
server which will then use that
parameter value to retrieve the demand
partner configuration server-side and
pre bit server will then make some
server-side bid requests to your demand
partners your demand partners will
return server-side bid responses to pre
bid server essentially containing a
price and creative content and that
creative content will all be cached
server-side and then based on those bid
responses pre bit server will send back
a JSON targeting response to the amp
runtime containing your slot level
pre-bid key value targeting and the amp
network will then use this JSON
targeting to construct an ad request URL
and if a pre-bid if pre bid demand wins
the shell creative that serves back to
the amp runtime will then retrieve the
final demand partner creative content
from the server side cache which will
render into your amp ad unit so we're
all very excited about this and we
should we'll be looking forward to
testing this out with hopefully with
some of you in the coming weeks so with
that I'll turn it back over to Vamsi
cool home stretch folks all right just
to summarize what is four key takeaways
today the first one is that amp HTML ads
are safer and better from an ROI
perspective for both publishers and
advertisers second that the amp
monetization is growing third we've
launched a number of different features
to allow publishers to monetize amp
pages better and fourth header bidding
is supported within amp now using real
time config but it's just one use case
and overall it's a platform and we look
forward to what developers are gonna do
with the entire platform so just briefly
looking ahead we wanted to ensure that
there's a continued interoperability of
amp pages supporting regular ads which
is the vast majority of ads within amp
pages but also we want to ensure that
the amp HTML ads work seamlessly across
other platforms including non-m pages
it's a large ecosystem but our vision
really is to get ultimately get the best
of both worlds but combining the two
experiences we believe that we'll end up
in an advertising ecosystem that is a
step function better in advertising
ecosystem that negates the need for ad
blockers and promotes an open and
sustainable web and I'd like to thank
you for your time today
