PAUL BAKAUS: So I'm going to
quickly introduce the round.
Please give a round of
applause for all my panelists
joining the stage.

And I'm just going to
start from the back.
We have Jeremy
Keith here, who I've
been reading his blog
for like forever.
And he's always been a
hero of the web to me.
And so I'm really glad
to have him on board.
And then we have
Nicole Sullivan,
who is almost the same to me and
has been doing tremendous work
on CSS before.
And again, I'm very
glad to have her here.
And then we have
Sarah Saltrick-Meyer.
Is that how we pronounce it?
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: Yup.
PAUL BAKAUS: Perfect.
Who works as a
developer at Buzzfeed.
This is actually
the first time we're
meeting, at this conference.
But again, we had some
really good conversations
at the speaker, and I'm
super glad to have her.
And we have Gina Trapani,
who actually is both CTO,
is that right?
GINA TRAPANI: Director
of engineering
PAUL BAKAUS: Director of
engineering of Postlight.
But I'm also really
interested in her past,
because I've been
reading the blog she
founded for a long
time called Lifehacker.
And so she has a
publishing background,
which I'm pretty curious
to have in that mix.
And then we have Mike Adler,
who is working for Etsy.
And Etsy in general is quite
performanc-minded, I've heard.
And he would be
probably the best person
to talk about how to achieve
great performance at Etsy.
And that sums up the round.
I'm really glad to
have you all here.
Thank you for joining the panel.
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
Thanks for having us.
PAUL BAKAUS: So, I want to
jump in the conversation.
I guess I want to
start with Jeremy.
JEREMY KEITH: OK.
PAUL BAKAUS: Because
I know that Jeremy
has both written
critically about AMP,
but also publishes
his blog in AMP.
JEREMY KEITH: Yes.
PAUL BAKAUS: So he has
some interesting thoughts
on probably what it means
to the web platform.
So why do you publish in AMP?
JEREMY KEITH: That's a
really good question,
and I'm not sure
what the answer is.
I guess the best
answer is why not?
Like, I publish in alternate
representations already.
So for example, I have an RSS
feed, as well as an HTML page.
So that's an alternate
representation.
It just seems like just one
more alternate representation,
so yeah, why not?
I'll play around with it.
And so I publish that.
But I'm not entirely
sure why, because it's
kind of like when [? Nataly ?]
was talking earlier
about the Guardian,
and you compare
the speed results of the non-AMP
version to the AMP version.
And sometimes the non-AMP
version is actually just fine.
So yeah, I'm not
entirely sure why.
And I've got to admit.
It felt like it was a
bit of a bait and switch,
because when it came
along, it was like,
it was the Facebook--
what did they call it,
instant articles, Apple News.
And then AMP seemed to be
Google's version of those.
But the big difference being
that you actually host it
on your own website, right?
It's a URL on your
website, unlike Facebook
instant articles,
unlike Apple News thing.
So I thought, OK, well,
I approve of that.
That's good thinking.
But then the whole AMP
Cache thing kind of
flips that on its head.
It's not actually being
hosted on my domain at all.
PAUL BAKAUS: When it's
consumed, that's right, yes.
JEREMY KEITH: So it's tricky.
When we talk about AMP,
I feel like we probably
need to distinguish whether
we're talking about the format,
you know, the collection of
web components, whether we're
talking about the
script, you know,
that turns those things into
being basically [INAUDIBLE]
into being something
more useful, and then
the AMP Cache, which is
a whole separate thing.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
true, actually.
And we can talk about all
of these individually.
And--
MIKE ADLER: I just want to
say, you mentioned RSS, right?
So two minutes.
It took two minutes.
GINA TRAPANI: Two
minutes to RSS.
We had a bet in the green room.
MIKE ADLER: Yeah.
Just want to say that.
Sorry to interrupt you.
PAUL BAKAUS: No, no worries.
JEREMY KEITH: Never
forgive, never forget.
PAUL BAKAUS: We've seen that
comparison come up a few times.
JEREMY KEITH: Gina,
the real challenge
would be to see if you can
work Google Wave into the--
GINA TRAPANI: Oh.

You did it.
You did it for me.
Rest in peace, Wave.
PAUL BAKAUS: Sorry?
GINA TRAPANI: Rest
in peace, Wave.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah,
rest in peace.
Exactly.
All the other
products that we miss.
Google Reader.
But yeah, so yes, you're right.
We should separate the AMP Cache
discussion from the rest of it,
because my guess is--
and please, correct me if
I'm wrong-- my guess is
that each of us
agree on the problem,
that we have a pretty slow
web on mobile today in most
instances.
But my guess is that not all of
us agree on the same solutions.
And so this is
interesting to me.
Whenever I hear negative
feedback with AMP--
So first of all, my perspective.
I joined AMP a few months
after it was incubated.
And I knew Malte from before, so
I knew he had a genuine agenda
to do good.
But I also initially
thought controversially
because of things
like AMP Cache.
But then when I started to learn
about all the reasons for why
those things exist-- some
of them are actually fairly
complex--
and so when I started
blogging about them,
learning about them
in more detail myself,
I then basically challenged
everyone else who
gave the same feedback.
Well, what would you come
up with as an alternative?
And so far, I have not
seen a single good idea.
JEREMY KEITH: Well, hang on.
We're talking about some of
the companies implementing AMP,
like Etsy or Pinterest.
You know, these big--
I'm pretty sure they actually
have caching solutions already.
Like--
PAUL BAKAUS: Oh, that's true.
JEREMY KEITH: They probably
don't need Google's help
when it comes to setting
up a resource quickly.
PAUL BAKAUS: The
question is, how do you
validate that Etsy is indeed
fast and user-friendly?
JEREMY KEITH: I think this
is one of those situations--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I mean,
you could go with real user
measurements, for example.
PAUL BAKAUS: Real
user measurements?
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah.
Measure how fast it is,
to see if it's fast.
GINA TRAPANI: You also
mentioned validate.
But from his perspective,
from the perspective
of the user making the choice
between clicking on an Etsy
page and clicking on
some other search result,
or what kind of validation?
PAUL BAKAUS: So this is the
validation for both the user
and the platform.
So what it means is the
platform can be reasonably
sure that if there's any
traffic to that AMP page,
then it is in fact probably a
fast and user-friendly version
of the website.
That's one level.
The other level is actually
establishing the AMP lightning
bolt as a sign of
trust to users.
So, OK, if you click
on that result,
it's probably going to be
fast and user-friendly.
And that content
will not jump around,
and ads will not jump around.
And so I've done the performance
drum for a long time as a web
developer myself.
You might have seen
some of my work before.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: So is this like
a, oh, shoot, it didn't work,
so let's have something
more restrictive?
PAUL BAKAUS: Well,
to some extent.
So I felt that for
the couple of years
I did performance
outreach, I felt
that I was preaching to the
choir, because web developers--
I never had to convince
a web developer
that performance matters.
I really didn't.
It's usually the
people higher up who
you have to convince,
in my opinion.
What do you think?
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I
struggle with that, though.
As I've started to get more
involved in product decisions
and not just completely
engineering-focused,
I've realized that we're
all trying to make decisions
about what's the best thing to
do with imperfect information?
And so, I mean, you
cross the street
with imperfect information
about whether you'll
get hit by a car.
But you look, right, to check
if there's any danger ahead.
And so I think on
the product side,
we're all trying
to make decisions
about what's best for users and
what's best for the business.
But we really need
more information
about how to do that.
And I saw a lot of people
speaking this morning
about the need for metrics.
And I think that's a call for
I have important decisions
to make, and I'm
struggling to make them
with the amount of information
that I currently have.
JEREMY KEITH: I'm not
so sure that the--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I thought
you would disagree.
JEREMY KEITH:
Users' end goals are
what they're thinking
about when they're
deciding product decisions.
It tends to be more
bottom line than that.
And that's how we end
up with the situation
we're in with the
mobile web, where
every page is big and
bloated and full of hundreds
of tracking scripts.
And it was frankly
depressing here today
about how everyone wants to--
we want to get our analytics.
We want to be able to know when
people swipe or tap or scroll.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: But
how do you decide
whether to let them
swipe or tap or scroll
if you don't have analytics?
JEREMY KEITH: To let
them swipe or scroll?
NICOLE SULLIVAN: It's
an experience, right?
Like, you choose the experience.
JEREMY KEITH: Yeah.
You're just good old-fashioned
user testing, right?
I mean, do we really-- ah.
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
Well, but one, you
have user testing, which is
qualitative and quantitative.
And I mean ideally,
companies do both,
because one is much more
expensive than the other.
JEREMY KEITH: Exactly.
There is a nice middle
ground there somewhere,
and it's not let's track
every single possible gesture
that the user makes on every
pixel of every screen, which
is how we ended up with the mess
that AMP is trying to solve,
which is that you
load up a URL--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I disagree.
I think--
JEREMY KEITH: Browser, and it's
full of nasty, nasty tricks.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: No, we
ended up with the mess
where we are, because the W3C
did not implement things like--
JEREMY KEITH: No.
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
--carousels and tabs
and other things that are
on, like, every website
in the known damn universe.
And yet, they haven't become
actual in-browser components
yet.
Why?
JEREMY KEITH: Look.
If AMP didn't even have
the web components part,
and you had to make your own--
it was just using image
and video and audio--
it would still be
so much faster,
because of the other part,
which is the ban on scripts.
That's what makes AMP fast.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: But
the ban on scripts
couldn't exist
without the components
to do the things the
scripts would be doing.
JEREMY KEITH:
There's some of it.
Sure.
But you know what,
even if we just
use regular old-fashioned
images and videos and audio,
AMP would still be super fast.
It's that ban on scripts that--
you're right.
For years, we're telling
developers, oh, performance
is important.
Developers know.
They're not the ones choosing to
put this crap on the web pages.
It's the business people,
the market people.
PAUL BAKAUS: I would
actually say, I mean--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: We're not evil.
I did change a little bit.
PAUL BAKAUS: To be
fair, I would actually
say that companies
like Buzzfeed and Etsy
have a real need to measure
a lot of their users'
interactions, to
actually fine-tune.
But maybe we don't need to do
it with five different analytics
scripts at the same time.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: That's fair.
PAUL BAKAUS: What do you think?
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
Well, but we don't, either.
And we don't do it with five
different analytics scripts.
If you're a company at
Buzzfeed's level of maturity,
you're inevitably going to have
your own in-house analytics
solution.
And so-- I mean, this is
actually sort of the way
that we feel about AMP, I
would say, as an organization
right now.
Principles that we agree with,
a strategy that we agree with.
But a lot of the work
overlaps with the work
that we are obligated
to do, even without AMP.
So we do feel like probably
we would get more out of it
if we were less advanced as
an engineering organization.
PAUL BAKAUS: What
do you think, Mike?
MIKE ADLER: I wasn't
always at Etsy.
I've been in the content
publishing world as well.
And I see both immature
and mature companies
having a lot of trouble
with performance.
Like, at the small
end, you may not
have the expertise
to do something
as optimized as
the worst AMP page.
And at the big end, you have
so many different people
that inevitably the
worst, the weakest link
is going to drag down the
performance of the site.
So it feels like,
in my experience,
companies at all different
levels of the spectrum
have a really hard
time delivering
a consistent mobile
experience that the user can
expect to be good.
And so, you know,
I can appreciate
that that's a big problem that
AMP has made real gains on.
That said, the solutions
that have like worked really
well for content publishing
don't necessarily
work for the rest
of the industries.
And so it will be
interesting to see--
I was very interested
in the talks
earlier today about
the other industries.
But it seems like the solutions
that are being provided
might need to grow or adapt.
PAUL BAKAUS: Right, yeah.
And Gina, probably
you know a lot about--
I mean, you've built solutions
around converting from HTML
to AMP HTML.
GINA TRAPANI: That's right.
PAUL BAKAUS: And so
you have probably
learned a lot of why people
actually are motivated
to use AMP in the first place.
GINA TRAPANI: Well,
in my experience,
people are motivated to use AMP.
I'm seeing this from our clients
at Postlight because of SEO.
I mean, they wanted in
that top stories carousel.
They want the lightning
bolt of approval
in regular search results,
which is happening now.
And that-- you know,
that concerns me.
I'd rather that the
concern for them
was about performance and
better user experience.
But it's about CEO
and search ranking.
How many publishers would use
AMP if that weren't a factor?
PAUL BAKAUS: Right.
GINA TRAPANI: Fewer.
PAUL BAKAUS: You're right.
And it's kind of
interesting, right?
I mean, sometimes I say
someone can do the wrong thing
for the right reasons.
But maybe they're
doing the right thing
for the wrong reasons.
GINA TRAPANI: The right
thing for the wrong--
but this is the--
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
That's a stretch.
GINA TRAPANI: I mean, I just--
so the lightning bolt--
let's just-- I
think we all agree
that AMP is a great user
experience, a much better user
experience.
And the lightning
bolt, as a user,
certainly represents
to me something that's
going to show up right away.
But hearing you say that
the lightning bolt is
a symbol of Google, you know,
verifying and validating
and hosting this page,
like that's scary to me
as someone who cares
about the open web.
If you talk with
the open web, you're
talking about standards
based and decentralized,
where content isn't privileged.
And AMP does all those things.
It's not a W3C standard yet.
PAUL BAKAUS: True.
GINA TRAPANI: It's
not decentralized,
because at least all AMP pages
are hosted on Google's cache.
So if you search Twitter
for google.com/amp,
there are lots of results there.
People are sharing that URL.
And so it's not decentralized.
And what was the other one?
Oh, and content
isn't privileged.
I know I'm sort of conflating
net neutrality here
a little bit.
But like, AMP
content is privileged
in Google search results.
And that concerns me.
And I think that it
concerns publishers.
And I think that these
are valid concerns.
And here's the thing.
Like, no one this panel
or even in this room
has thought about these
problems as much as the AMP team
at Google.
PAUL BAKAUS: True.
GINA TRAPANI: So I
don't necessarily
have a better solution, and
AMP is a better solution
from what we have.
But I think it's
important to understand
why it could be perceived
as scary and sinister and
frightening to people
who are considering
whether or not to publish AMP.
PAUL BAKAUS: Now, the
good news is-- sorry.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: And if you
think super, super long term,
and you imagine a world where
Google is no longer a company,
it's difficult to think that
so much of the world's content
is on the set of URLs
that could just not exist
/ one company didn't exist.
PAUL BAKAUS: And I just
wanted to quickly mention,
like, the good thing is that we
now don't just have one cache,
but we actually have
more caches coming up.
And the first one that
was publicly announced
was CloudFest cache.
So you'll actually learn
more about it tomorrow.
GINA TRAPANI: That's great.
That's a step in
the right direction.
PAUL BAKAUS: The cache,
and this is something
that some people
don't understand,
is that as a publisher,
you don't choose the cache.
You choose the
cache as a platform.
So as a platform,
you make a decision.
Let's say you're Bing, right?
You make the
decision whether you
want to use CloudFest cache.
You want to use Google's cache.
You want to use your own cash.
And and so it's up to the
platform to make a decision.
But now, you could say, OK,
now all my content is still
mirrored on those caches.

The question really
is, are there
any better ways to do this?
JEREMY KEITH: Well, if it's
the cache side of things, or--
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
Let's talk about the
cache for a second.
MIKE ADLER: I guess I would
say that I think a lot of it's
gone well, to Google's credit.
But I feel like there's a
lot of unspecified policy.
So there could be more
clarity around policy,
more fairness in that.
Like, I don't understand what--

is there, I don't even know,
is there policy around, like--
that's stated, like who
gets the badge, or when
it would go away,
or what happens if I
don't like the decisions of--

forget that.
But are there any stated
policies around that?
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes.
Now, there's two sets of--
two levels here.
One is the AMP level, unrelated
of any platform that's
serving AMP, like Google.
So purely on the
AMP level, we have
released caching guidelines
to actually, pretty in detail,
to make sure that
those guidelines
actually, that people follow
those guidelines, people
implementing caches.
And other words, we won't
endorsed them as a team.
And they're fairly detailed.
For instance, they
say that you have
to have a faithful visual
representation of the content.
Now you couldn't
just sneak in ads
and then get away
with it as a platform.
So it's a cache.
That just wouldn't fly.
MIKE ADLER: So are
you badging content
that's hosted on other CDNs?
PAUL BAKAUS: You mean
on the Google side?
MIKE ADLER: Yeah, on the
Google search results.
PAUL BAKAUS: No.
So Google is using
the Google cache.
MIKE ADLER: Gotcha.
PAUL BAKAUS: And so the badge,
really, is not tied to cache.
Now, of course in
our case, we think
it's a stronger guarantee.
Guarantee is maybe a hard word.
But a stronger signal that
what you see is what you get.
But because if you wouldn't
have the cache, right, then--
and there are some companies
that publish without the cache,
[INAUDIBLE] AMP
caches in the index--
sorry, AMP pages in the
index without the cache.
But then, of course, you have
to trust a publisher to never do
invalid AMP in the first place.
GINA TRAPANI: So
Google's only going
to give the lightning
bolt to content
that's hosted on Google's
cache, not any other caches that
come out?
PAUL BAKAUS: Correct.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
That is very interesting,
given the long history of
Google actually doing research
on basically sites that
are not hosted by Google
and giving users of Google
Search some information
and some validation of them.
Historically, Google
doesn't feel the need
to host a site to give it the
green checkmark of, you know,
this is a safe site.
JEREMY KEITH: Or
the mobile-friendly
symbol we were
getting before, right?
Another example.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
MIKE ADLER: There's a
lot of trust involved
in giving a site a high rank
that Google's view of it
will be the same as
the end user's view.
PAUL BAKAUS: I mean, this is a
topic that was discussed a lot.
And we're not going to
go too much into detail,
because I'm trying to represent
the AMP team more than Google.
But AMP does not
influence ranking.
So yes, you're right.
That has--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah,
but the carousel.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes, fair enough.
So you could argue that it has
a great position on the search
page, if you can be
in that carousel.
But the carousel is a
specific type of content.
It's just for
newsworthy content.
That's why it's called
top stories carousel.
It's a very selective
vertical, I would say.
MIKE ADLER: I guess my
point is that there's
a history of Google
trusting third parties to--

like, they analyze
and they rank based
on their perception
of the sites,
like mobile-friendly, malicious
content, quality content.
And then it presents
it-- it doesn't actually
proxy all of those requests.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
a good point.
MIKE ADLER: It trusts.
It has a long history of
trusting the rest of the web.
And so it seems
like maybe there's
room for that in the
AMP ecosystem as well.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
I think ultimately--
I mean, you're
making a great point
that AMP is a symbol of trust.
And it is increasingly going
to be a symbol of trust
as more and more
content is mobile.
But if you're a sort of both
a publisher and a platform
like Buzzfeed is, and if you're
kind of a platform like Etsy
is, sort of substituting
your own brand's trust
for another brand's
trust is not something
that we are necessarily
going to want to do, right?
Very naturally, we
want Buzzfeed to be
a trustworthy name for
people to click on links for.
And so it may be to
our benefit to try
to work solely on
buzzfeed.com pages,
and not invest in AMP
if it's going to wind up
being increasing the trust
of AMP as a platform,
rather than increasing the
trust of Buzzfeed as a platform.
It's just a matter of
alignment of incentives.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
a fair point.
JEREMY KEITH:
Actually, Paul, did
you get any pushback from
security people at Google,
saying we spent all these
years educating people
to always check that URL bar
to make sure it's actually
the site that you
think you're on,
and now that URL
bar says Google?
PAUL BAKAUS: I'm not sure.
I don't think so.
But I mean, there's
just been concerns
from various external folks.
But it's a fair point.
I mean, you're right that
not having the URL in there--
well, it's in the whole
link, but it's not
the top of the main.
That is also a sign of
trust in the browser.
And we're kind of breaking it.
Now, there are very good
reasons for why we're doing it.
But it's kind of
unfortunate, I would say.
For instance, so just
a quick explainer.
But if you come from
a search result page,
and then you click
on AMP result,
it opens inline in a view.
The reason why it's
opening inline in a viewer
is because that's the only
way to achieve pre-rendering
in the way AMP does to
actually just pre-render
the first viewport.
So we have to initialize an
IFrame, pre-render the first
viewport.
And that's why we just cannot
navigate to the next page.
JEREMY KEITH: But
the anecdata I've
collected from users,
people, friends of mine,
who have clicked on those search
results is that mental model,
it seems at odds.
Like, I'm on a search results
page, I click a search result.
I expect to go to another place.
And that feeling when
you notice, oh, wait.
I'm still technically on Google.
I'm still technically
in the results.
It violates the principle
of least surprise, I think.
PAUL BAKAUS: It would be great
if you could use the history
API to replace the top
level domain, but you can't.
JEREMY KEITH: There would be no
security implications at all.
PAUL BAKAUS: No, no, not at all.
So that's one of
the big reasons why,
well, the big reason why
we're in this scenario.
The question is,
could we do anything?
Do you have any ideas?
And this goes to
any of you, how we
could do this in a
standards-driven way, how
we could actually solve this
with an actual navigation.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
Don't you guys
have a relatively
recent solution
of having a little UI
element for the actual link
at the top of the AMP page?
I could swear I've seen
that lately on AMP.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah, that's true.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: I
think that, given that-- so
obviously, having the URL
that you're on the pointing
to the actual piece of content
is an extremely important web
principle.
But AMP is also trying to
push a bunch of other really
important web principles.
And I guess it's
not surprising to me
that that's the one
that fell behind.
But I think the solution
to it is more transparency,
is making it obvious to
users, especially not
technically adept users,
where exactly they are
and what exactly is
happening to them.
I don't see it as necessarily
a purely bad thing
as long as it's well messaged.
JEREMY KEITH: Maybe
it should actually
look more like you're still
in the search results,
and less like you've
left the search results.
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
Except I've found
having content without the
subtle details that the--
different publishing houses
have fonts that only they use.
And when I read
something in that font,
I actually associate
that with the brand,
and it changes my feelings about
the content that I'm reading.
And so I think
being more divorced
from that would actually
do more damage on the brand
side of what we were talking
about before, where we really
want to have that trust be
in the brands, not in Google.
JEREMY KEITH: You
can use whatever
fonts you want with AMP, right?
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
JEREMY KEITH:
Which surprised me,
seeing as the whole
performance thing--
that felt like a
pretty big gaping hole.
PAUL BAKAUS: Fonts, I would
say, is probably the one thing
where we had to give in.
But we have mitigated it.
We have done a lot of
optimization on fonts.
We have a font component
that times out very quickly.
And it's the only request that
really has to be made in order
to lay out the rest of the page.
That's the one exception, sadly.
JEREMY KEITH: And it would be
great if the rest of the web
worked like that.
Slowly but surely,
we're getting there.
And it's what
worries me about AMP,
is like, the attitudes-- like
you said, I feel for you.
For years, you've been
saying performance,
performance, performance.
And you've talked to developers.
Actually developers understand.
That's fine.
It's like, OK, our
existing website
is this dumpster fire of scripts
and bloated images and things.
What do we do?
Do we go and fix it?
No, we'll create this completely
separate thing over here
that will be really fast.
And so I'm kind of in
two minds about AMP,
whether it's like
showing the way.
It's like, oh, look.
It is possible to have a
web page that's really fast.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: That was
mobile before, though.
Remember, before the
business people realized
that mobile was a thing they
should be concerned with,
mobile was like lightning--
I know, I can see both sides.
JEREMY KEITH: So on the one
hand, AMP could be that, look,
it's an exemplar of how fast
pages can be, so why don't you
take all the lessons and apply
it to your existing website?
But what I see more and more
is more people going like,
oh, we got our fast AMP
pages, so let's just
let the existing website burn.
Let's throw even
more crap in there
and make it even more
bloated, because we've
got our fast AMP page.
PAUL BAKAUS: It's a fair
point, and we should probably
talk about this.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: I don't
see that as a bad thing at all,
though, if it does
make web pages faster.
I think if we learned
anything, it's
that having a
performant website that
is meeting all of the business
needs is, it is real hard.
And it shouldn't be
so hard, but it is.
JEREMY KEITH: I'm not sure it
is that hard, because I mean,
AMP doesn't have any magic.
It's basically a
couple of rules,
and lay off the JavaScript.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
Well, the magic, though,
is that social pressure.
It's that the magic is people
wanting to be in top articles.
And these are things that
developers can bring back
to their mean PMs
who are making them
put in all of those
awful tracking scripts.
MIKE ADLER: It's not me,
it's the Google validator
that says no.
So--
JEREMY KEITH: Exactly.
That's exactly it.
That's the problem
that AMP solves.
It's a political problem.
MIKE ADLER: It's more
powerful than even your CEO.
That's the thing.
JEREMY KEITH: Put this
crap on the web page.
Can't.
Google says we can't do that.
That's really powerful.
GINA TRAPANI: Yeah, the SEO
consultant tells my client
that they need AMP--
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: I think
that's my favorite thing
about it,
GINA TRAPANI: And
then, so AMP happens.
MIKE ADLER: Thank you
for being the bad cop.
PAUL BAKAUS: You're
very welcome.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I also
think that, for years, there
have been--
I'm going to sound a little bit
like back in my day right now--
but for years, people
have been complaining
about different
aspects of the web.
So whether it's I can
only have so many images,
or before they worked, I
couldn't have rounded corners.
Or whatever it was,
there was something
that somebody wanted
but they couldn't have.
And I kind think of
those constraints
as like a poet writing a haiku.
Like, you don't
complain that you
didn't get one more syllable.
It's part of the art.
It's part of what's
beautiful about what we do.
And so I do like the way
that AMP is basically like,
here, this is what a haiku looks
like in this particular case.
JEREMY KEITH: I agree.
I think one of the best things
about AMP is the constraints.
And again, that's why it's
a little disconcerting today
to hear about all these great
new features that are coming
that are basically loosening
all the constraints and saying,
yeah you can have--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: It's
interesting to think
of eventually, that
will end up basically--
JEREMY KEITH: Yeah,
we'll just go back
to having big bloated AMP pages.
PAUL BAKAUS: Well, we still have
some pretty hard rules that I
don't think we'll--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: We're teasing.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah, I get it.
I get it.
But, and this is actually
interesting, because--
and this, I think we
might be able to document
this better in the future.
But the founding ideas of AMP
to me are really interesting.
For instance, Malte has
this pet peeve of him
that he just hates
when content loads.
He was reading a
paragraph, and then
an ad loads in front of it,
and it pushes everything down.
And so this is a rule that
I don't think we'll ever
break, as far as I can tell.
So yes, we might introduce
more dynamic elements
to be able to do, hey,
toggle this image here.
But I don't think we'll ever
break the founding principle.
JEREMY KEITH: But
that's something
that's getting fixed in
browsers, too, right?
[INAUDIBLE]
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yeah.
PAUL BAKAUS: True, yes.
Scroll anchoring.
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
How much are you
pushing the Chrome team to start
making these things integral to
[INAUDIBLE]?
PAUL BAKAUS: And that's
actually a good point.
And we already
have a [? threat ?]
with the Chrome
team, where we try
to bounce ideas off each other.
But ironically, both
open source projects,
both with lots of Googlers.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: But if
you look at all the, like--
I mean, obviously this is my
bias towards CSS component
libraries.
And JavaScript
component libraries.
But if you look at them, you
can see what we need, right?
We've been expressing those
needs for a decade now,
and it would be really awesome
if those things existed
in browsers directly, so
that all we were doing
is configuring them similarly
to writing CSS, rather
than actually writing
a carousel or tabs.
PAUL BAKAUS: I absolutely agree.
That's actually a good point.
And I see two sides to AMP.
One side is the actual
format innovation,
we call it, which is creating
web components and semantics
around web components.
Let's say, how
should an accordion
look like semantically,
as a web component?
So that's one specific task.
And then there's
another task, which
is, let's build a JavaScript
implementation on top
that actually drives
the UI of the component
and makes it work.
So those two, they're kind
of intertwined right now,
because the same teams are
working on most of the things.
But I wonder, do we need an
isolated format innovation push
on the web?
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
An isolated what?
PAUL BAKAUS: Format
innovation push.
So basically, do we
need to work together
to come up with new, high
level web components?
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Yes.
Yes.
MIKE ADLER: Next question.
JEREMY KEITH: [INAUDIBLE]
for the whole extensible web
theory.
You'll create what you
need to solve your problems
in isolation, and then if
enough people use them,
that will find its way back
into the standards, right?
That's the theory.
But what's the victory
condition for you for AMP?
If in a few years' time, we
got blazingly fast web pages,
but they're all AMP pages.
And regular HTML pages are
still big and bloated and slow,
and nobody goes to them anymore.
Is that a victory?
PAUL BAKAUS: I don't
think so at all.
I mean, but this is
my personal opinion.
I have opinions like many other
people working on AMP, I guess.
But my personal
opinion, and this
was my time back in jQuery
and [INAUDIBLE] as well.
Our goal was always to not
ever need jQuery again.
That was always our
goal, to essentially
have browsers become good enough
so that we can replace it,
actually remove it, evolve
it into web standards.
MIKE ADLER: And hardly
anyone uses jQuery now.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
I think that's great.
MIKE ADLER: I was
being sarcastic,
but maybe I'm just out of date.
PAUL BAKAUS: Well,
no I mean, there
is a lot less people
that use jQuery.
Well, jQuery, I guess,
is still pretty strong.
[INAUDIBLE], I
think, had its time
and is now being
replaced by a lot of more
mobile friendly solutions.
So I'm not sure.
It's been my baby, but
I'm not sad to see it go,
because there's better things.
JEREMY KEITH: So is the
ultimate end goal of AMP
to make itself
redundant so that nobody
would need to use AMP anymore?
PAUL BAKAUS: I would
say that's my goal.
And every time you
mention something
like we're going to remove
or replace AMP, you're going,
the people who invest
their career in AMP
might have strong
emotions about it.
So it's-- in every open source
project and every product
in general, this is a
hard topic to talk about.
But I do think that the
long-term vision will
be to have a lot of the driving
technology in AMP be standard.
MIKE ADLER: I think it's really
great that AMP has demonstrated
what the mobile web can be.
If you focus on a constrained
set of capabilities,
you can take the
browsers we have today
and demonstrate what a
great mobile web can be.
Or at least great
in some dimensions.
At least it's great in terms
of performance and experience.
And so yeah, I share
the concern that,
how do we push this
beyond AMP and get--

a developer I work with
was talking about, OK,
what if we implement AMP,
and it's obviously great.
And then, that means we have to
rewrite the rest of the site,
right?
So I hope the
might of Google can
help push this
back into browsers,
push this back into more durable
standards and things like that.
PAUL BAKAUS: It's difficult,
but I mean, I actually
think about this every night.
And I'm having constant
nightmares just thinking
about how to work
with the W3C to create
great systems like the
static layout system in AMP.
That's just so foreign to the
world of CSS that I don't know.
What do you think?
Do you think there is a path
to do some of those things?
JEREMY KEITH: Well, it's going
to be slow, because that's
the way standards work.
It's slow, and we
need something now.
So AMP is here now.
Let's use AMP.
But I do worry that it's
almost like a copout.
Like, ah, our website
is really slow.
Ah, we'll just use AMP and
spend our effort there.
And like I said,
the theory would be,
and that will then find its way
back into our regular pages.
But the practice is, you
got entire teams working
on AMP stuff.
And we've seen
presentations today
from people saying all
the work that they've
put into the AMP site.
That's great, but
could you imagine
if you'd put that
same amount of work
into your regular HTML pages?
We saw some examples
today of things
influencing and finding a
way back, which is good.
But I'd like to
see more of that,
rather than, yeah, our
website is a done deal.
It's beyond saving, so we're
just going to concentrate--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I'm seeing it,
though, the other way, though.
When I was consulting with
Facebook back in 2008,
and there were all the
spinners all the time,
and it was almost
unusable, they started
an initiative called Facebook
Lite, which was meant
to be sort of mobile Facebook.
And it was really fast
and really snappy,
and it lit a fire
under the folks
doing the regular website.
And in six months,
they actually went
from, I can't even
remember, but terrible,
terrible performance times down
to a couple-second page load
for a full interactive app.
So I don't know, I think
sometimes it can work.
JEREMY KEITH: It would be great.
I would love it if
that were the case.
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
I want to believe.
JEREMY KEITH: I, too.
Like, yeah.
Glass half full, glass
half empty, right?
I don't know, please.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: Look, even
in that worst case scenario,
where they can't get it
together as an organization
to parallel the
work that they're
doing with AMP on
their own website,
at least then there
are some fast pages.
And at least then, some
thought about web standards
did have to happen for
whatever they were doing to get
turned into the AMP format.
I mean, I really see
AMP's greatest value
as first like a
political constraint
and an educational tool.
I mean, because even if
those, say, a developer who
can't get anything done with
organizational constraints
to make their site faster,
to make it better, at least
they have an example of
progressive web enhancement.
At least they have an example
of a good caching strategy.
It does make it, I think--
it's an accessibility tool
for performant web.
And an accessible web has
been quite a hard thing to do.
If I only had a
WordPress website,
and I had very little web
development knowledge,
that AMP WordPress
plugin is a massive tool.
And it isn't just
a tool in the sense
that I can turn it off and on.
It's a tool in the sense that I
can continue to learn from it.
I can try to duplicate it.
I think that can only
be a great thing.
JEREMY KEITH: I agree.
It's great that AMP can
be seen as, like, this
is what we're aiming for.
This is what our
regular site could be.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: It
strikes me as kind
of the other side
of the coin of like,
the tools, like WebPagetest
or YSlow or any of those ones,
where they're like, let us show
you what you were doing wrong.
And people were like, oh,
cool, now that I know,
I can work on it.
But AMP kind of goes
a little further--
JEREMY KEITH: Here's
how good it could be.
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
--and says, and here
how you could
actually be better.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
Plus, the constraints
it places on content are
actually really great.
So much of what we
do on the web is just
serving up a couple of P tags
and a couple of image tags.
Like a couple of P tags
and a couple of image tags,
and all this for that?
JEREMY KEITH: And we
heard that this morning.
Somebody said, you know,
it's actually amazing
what you can do
without JavaScript.
Yeah, right?
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: We
got to preach, preach that.
MIKE ADLER: That's going
on somebody's tombstone.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Just a
couple images and a couple--
JEREMY KEITH: But it
does feel like we're
kind of tackling the symptoms,
rather than the cause.
If the cause is, you've
got these developers,
hardworking developers who
care about performance,
but they're in organizations
where they're being told
to add more crap to the page.
And they try to argue,
but politically they're
in a bad situation.
And so AMP helps that situation.
It helps tackle that symptom.
But you know, what
is the real problem--

GINA TRAPANI: Desktop
sites that are slow.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
a fair point.
GINA TRAPANI: [INAUDIBLE]
insights tool.
Like, if there was immediate
feedback to the marketing
people, that after we added
this script, we got deranked
or that there was some sort--
it's not the lightning
bolt, but something else.
Like, that would be
have the same effect
as AMP without requiring
a whole different format.
PAUL BAKAUS: So I would
actually love that.
So I don't know if you're
surprised to hear that.
But--
JEREMY KEITH: We have consensus.
PAUL BAKAUS: I would love that.
It's also really, really hard.
Because to have the confidence
that a page is slow or fast,
it's very difficult.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: Yeah.
PAUL BAKAUS: Page
speed insights, sure,
is a tool to get you the
first set of recommendations,
you know, basic recommendations
of what not to do.
But it still doesn't tell
you that a page is guaranteed
slow or fast, or for instance,
how long does it take
to render itself interactive.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: It could be
just an agreement, though,
not to have scripts.
Like, that alone would be--
JEREMY KEITH: Didn't Tim
[INAUDIBLE] have some proposal
like this, where like almost
like a content security policy,
but a content--
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
It's now called feature
policy, I think.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: I
would have thought, though,
that the search team was
already incorporating kind of--

Images are not
promoted in search.
But I would have
thought that, if you
had a page that had all the same
performance principles as AMP,
that page would probably
get some lift from SEO just
by virtue of those efforts
that were going into it.
Because the search--
GINA TRAPANI: [INAUDIBLE].
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
Because the search speed--
GINA TRAPANI: Is speed not
a factor in regular search?
PAUL BAKAUS: Page speed?
I think so.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: We talked
about it a few years ago.
PAUL BAKAUS: I'm not exactly
sure, but I think so.
That's not a topic
that I usually work on.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
That's-- totally.
That's why.
MIKE ADLER: We believe you.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah,
but again, page speed
doesn't go far enough.
I want to be able to
say, OK, this page loads
and displays what's useful
to the user in, I don't know,
three seconds.
I have not seen anyone
solve that problem.
There's some in-house tools that
we're building like Lighthouse
that try to do some of it.
But it's really,
really difficult.
GINA TRAPANI: So you're saying
that you can't guarantee
that kind of speed
from any server
that Google doesn't control.
PAUL BAKAUS: How do
you do it without
a constrained framework?
For instance, how do you know--
let's say you want to know
if the first viewport is
available and interactive.
Because that's usually
what counts to the user.
How do you know
what the things are
that have to be interactive,
or the things that
need to be painted?
For instance, there's a huge
ad, but then the rest of it
is actually important.

Those are real hard problems.
GINA TRAPANI: But the
Google bot knows all.
JEREMY KEITH: Hey,
you're smart people.
You can figure this out.
PAUL BAKAUS: That
would be fantastic.
GINA TRAPANI: How
does it not know?
No.

PAUL BAKAUS: But
yeah, I don't know.
That's the beauty and danger
of JavaScript and CSS, right?
NICOLE SULLIVAN: It's
not about knowing.
I think Sarah brought
it up earlier.
It's a trust agreement.
It's saying, we're
agreeing to do this thing.
We're agreeing to trust you to
do that thing and, you know,
occasionally
verifying that trust.
But I don't think it's about
enforcing so much as it
is about establishing
that SLA or the agreement
that you have with
the content provider
if you were going to do it.
PAUL BAKAUS: Well,
trust can be--
MIKE ADLER: There's trust
between Google and a publisher,
and there's trust between
the end user and--
GINA TRAPANI: And Google.
MIKE ADLER: --whatever is on
the other side of the glass.
PAUL BAKAUS: Now,
of course, there's--
I mean, my guess is that there's
always an implicit effect on,
you know--
and this is [INAUDIBLE].
Performance actually
drives numbers.
And so of course, if you have
a very fast website, then just
organically, that web page
will be used by more people
and would probably have a better
effect, even in terms of--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: But it
won't be in that carousel.
PAUL BAKAUS: Sorry?
NICOLE SULLIVAN: But it
won't be in the carousel.
PAUL BAKAUS: It won't
be in the carousel.
JEREMY KEITH: No carrot for you.
PAUL BAKAUS: Sure.
GINA TRAPANI: Yeah, and
we keep saying that AMP
doesn't affect search results.
And I don't know that's--
I don't know if everyone
understands that.
I think the carousel--
and I think, legitimately
and rightfully, people
see that as affecting
your search ranking.
PAUL BAKAUS: Right.
Again, a big, big
point of contention.
Because again, you could
argue that yes, it's
very visible on the page.
GINA TRAPANI: It's that's at the
top, because you like Tinder,
like.
[INAUDIBLE]
PAUL BAKAUS: But then
we have knowledge cards.
We have knowledge cards
for all sorts of things.
If you're searching
for something
that can produce a
knowledge card that
produces-- you search
for Apple, and then you
get the Wikipedia
knowledge card for Apple.
We also-- this is another
specific format that is trying
to help the user get informed.
And you could also argue,
why does that Wikipedia page
rank higher than the rest
of the blue links below?
JEREMY KEITH: I'm
still trying to get
at what the secret sauce is with
AMP, because with this issue
of how can you measure
whether a webpage is fast.
When I'm looking at search
results, and one of them
has the lightning
bolt, and I hit it,
and it opens up super fast,
is that because of the format
AMP and those web components?
Or is it because of the caching?
And if I have an existing
webpage that's already fast,
can I--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: It's too
fast to be the format.
You can't get that kind
of data back that quickly.
JEREMY KEITH: So it's the
caching is the secret sauce?
PAUL BAKAUS: It's both.
But even if you wouldn't
have the cache thing,
then the static layout
system, first of all,
guarantees that you can render
the page without any assets
loaded, which is huge.
Imagine doing that in a
standards driven way for all
of the pages on the internet.
That's--
MIKE ADLER: Except
for the AMP asset.
PAUL BAKAUS: Sorry?
MIKE ADLER: You need the
AMP asset, do you not?
PAUL BAKAUS: You need
to use the AMP-specific
tax, yes, the component.
MIKE ADLER: And you
need the AMP JavaScript.
PAUL BAKAUS: Oh, that's right.
Yes, yes, yes.
You need the AMP js library.
That's true.
So that's the one--
JEREMY KEITH: Which is one more
JavaScript file than I want,
really.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
hopefully going to be cached.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Does Chrome
keep the AMP JavaScript
in the browser?
PAUL BAKAUS: It's
just normal caching.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Just
like a normal cache.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah, it's
just normal caching.

But yeah.
So you can layout
the entire page
with just having the AMP js
library and the original HTML
file.
So you can render the
content even if there's
nothing else available.
And then, everything else
cannot block the rendering
of the page.
So there's no way to
do document [INAUDIBLE]
in the main document.
There's no way to block
the rendering of the page.
And I think this is
probably the biggest thing.

MIKE ADLER: I mean,
I think that--
I can be wrong, but can
that work without the cache?
PAUL BAKAUS: This works
without the cache, sure.
MIKE ADLER: But you can't
have Google validating that.
And so you can't-- you don't
have the same guarantee that
the content that's coming from
that third party publisher
truly is valid and
within the constraints.
But you can pre-load it and
you can do the same exact--
PAUL BAKAUS: You cannot pre-load
it, because you have to-- well,
if you trust the page,
yes, you could pre-load it.
If you trust the page.
MIKE ADLER: But you're--
now Google is pre-loading
other people's content.
PAUL BAKAUS: But trusting the
page to not do any cross-site
scripting attacks on
the main host is--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: But you're
putting it in an IFrame, right?
So there's at least that.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah, sure.
Some of it is mitigated.
But there's still some
validation in place
that checks for security.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: I
have to say, ultimately, AMP
as a format is more appealing
than AMP is a caching strategy,
if we're going to
make that distinction.
For a publisher, you're
again, publish a platform.
But distribution really is
part of our business strategy,
and I can't ever
see that changing.
But a format that
is a subset of HTML
that you guys can do some
kind of formal validation on?
Yeah, that is
incredibly appealing.
It is just much more
appealing than giving up
a measure of control over
the only thing that we have,
which is our content.
PAUL BAKAUS: So nothing--
JEREMY KEITH: That's what
I meant about the bait
and switch, right?
It felt like a bait and switch.
You said the great
thing about AMP
is it's on your own website.
Fantastic!
Wait a minute, this
isn't my own website.
I'm still on Google.
PAUL BAKAUS: Here's
the cool thing.
You can actually do this today.
You can use just AMP, remove
the lightning bolt from the HTML
tag, which means that it
is technically invalid AMP,
but it would still
render or produce
any kind of other invalid
thing on the page.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: I
know, but right now we
don't have any-- that's
not going to show up
in search results or anything.
PAUL BAKAUS: No, it will
show up in a search result.
It would just show
up as a normal page.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
Without, yeah.
GINA TRAPANI: No
lightning bolt, yeah.
PAUL BAKAUS: In my case, for
instance, I have my blog.
And my blog is running a custom
version of the WordPress plugin
that I hopefully will--
so we talked about this earlier.
But it's one page.
It's canonical AMP.
It's just one
website that happens
to have some AMP going on.
And not all of it
is valid, actually.
So the leaf pages,
the content pages,
the blog posts
themselves are valid AMP.
But the overview pages are not.
And I still get some
benefit out of it.
And they still get indexed
on Google, but just
without the lightning bolt.
JEREMY KEITH: So he's
talking about how
the problem is that Google
can't trust that the site will
be performing.
You just don't have
that level of trust,
because it's not measurable.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: To be
fair, we haven't quite
earned it, have we?
JEREMY KEITH:
Well, I don't know.
This proposal--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I think
about adding Google Analytics
to something, then adding
[? Segment IO, ?] then
adding something--
JEREMY KEITH: Oh, I agree.
I agree.
But if I'm not doing
any of those things,
then trust me, right?
Like, you can measure that.
I can check how many
scripts are on this page.
Are they on this blacklist
of horrible tracking scripts?
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
I would love it
if this all wound up
with a bunch of websites
not having any
JavaScript on them.
That would be really cool.
GINA TRAPANI: That would
be a great outcome.
JEREMY KEITH: But it seems
to me that Google saying
that we can't trust all
those sites claiming
to be performant, and yet
Google is expecting an awful lot
of trust from us, right?
PAUL BAKAUS: What
are we expecting?
JEREMY KEITH: Well, you want
our entire websites, basically.
You want to host
them for us now.
GINA TRAPANI: Can we talk--
we've got 10 minutes left,
and this is about the open web,
and we're talking about trust.
Can we talk about
governance over AMP?
So it's an open source project
with lots of contributors,
some of whom are here.
But it's not a W3C standard,
and the governance document,
Google is the only
company mentioned, right?
And Google determines--
JEREMY KEITH: The buck
stops with Google.
That's what--
GINA TRAPANI: --for committers.
So like, so let's talk
about that a little bit.
Is that-- are there plans?
Is that changing?
Is that-- what are the
internal thoughts there?
Not very many?
PAUL BAKAUS: You want to
become a co-contributor?
GINA TRAPANI: Will you
[? bus ?] me right now?
Would We'd love to have you.
No, really.
I'm not even kidding.
The lack of non-Googlers in the
core AMP team is not by design.
GINA TRAPANI: So are you saying
that's just lack of interest,
or--
PAUL BAKAUS: So we're
doing a conference,
as you might have seen today
to actually grow the community
and invite more people
to the AMP project
and actually contribute,
because we want to do that.
We actually-- we're
very much interested
in creating a more
healthy government model
and contribution model, frankly,
with lots of participating
companies, like with Chromium.
Chromium since long ago is
not just governed by Google.
There's just a lot of companies
contributing to Chromium.
And we'll try harder.
So this is my promise to you.
We'll try harder in the
next month and years
to invite people to the project.
I mean, we started out
in very rapid iteration.
And so a lot of
the processes were
internal for the lack
of trying, but also
because it made us a lot faster.
But we just actually a few
weeks ago started to a,
open all the format reviews.
So you can actually
tune in every Wednesday
into the Hangout and
actually participate
in talking about
the new components
and making decisions about them.
That's one thing.
We opened that to the public.
We created much more
detailed instructions
on how to become
a co-contributor.
And we created this conference
to drive the ecosystem of AMP
and not Google.
This is the important bit.
We want to have AMP be a shared
solution that a lot of people
think we need and not make
it a one-company thing.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: I think
the awkwardness will come about
from--
I mean, from the perspective
of a publisher and somebody
relatively outside the project,
the kind of ideal universe
for AMP is that AMP is an
accepted format under the W3C,
and that there are
different companies that
provide AMP hosting and that
all contribute to the project
and that compete.
And obviously, from
Google's perspective,
that might be a little
bit uncomfortable.
But we would love
to see that happen.
PAUL BAKAUS: No, I
think that's fantastic.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: And I
we think that Google could--
PAUL BAKAUS: I think that
would be fantastic, because--
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: All right.
We're all on the same page.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's the
only way, in my opinion,
to make it healthy
in the long term.
There's just no
other way to do it.
And that's-- I certainly believe
that there might be situations
where AMP is trying to go
a different direction than
Google.
But that's a good thing.
It's a good thing if more than
one company governs a project
and is trying to do a
compromise that works for more
than one company, right?
And so far, we've been trying
to make those decisions
the best we could.
But it's much easier if you
have other companies on board.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: So
are you setting up
some kind of advisory board
that includes the large content
contributors or
something like that?
PAUL BAKAUS: Sorry?
NICOLE SULLIVAN:
Do you plan to have
some kind of advisory board
or something that includes--
PAUL BAKAUS: I can't
speak about the details.
I think you would
have to ask Malte.
JEREMY KEITH: You
did have, like,
a shadowy cabal before AMP
was made public, right?
There was like secret,
behind closed doors.
No, it was, because--
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Are you
trying to make it all
sound more dramatic?
JEREMY KEITH: This
open source project
that suddenly landed one
day with a marketing site,
and it already had a bunch
of publications on board.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
not completely true.
I mean, this was before
my time, first of all.
But it did start as part of
the digital news initiative.
And there was actually a few
founding members on board,
including WordPress, that
knew about the project very
early on, that
participated in creating.
Now, who wrote most of the code?
Yes, a bunch of Googlers.
But the project was not
started in a silo at Google.
JEREMY KEITH: And who
decided who made that list?
Who decided who got
invited into that initial--
PAUL BAKAUS: I don't know.
JEREMY KEITH: We never know.
GINA TRAPANI: You know, I
think seeing another major use
case for AMP in addition to
mobile search results on Google
also would be tremendous for
adoption, for the community,
and for a sense of like,
this is a collaborative,
cooperative effort, versus the
carrot on the stack, you know.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: I did like
to see this morning Lo's
presentation and how she talked
about some of the limitations
that she'd run into, and
then sort of responsiveness
on Google's side to
those limitations.
But I guess, I think
we need that same kind
of responsiveness to people
you were working directly with
to build a site for you with
the rest of the community.
So I think the more
you can aim for that,
the better off we'll all be.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
a good point.
And by the way, I
initially thought that once
we achieved certain milestones
that more developers would
actually offer constructive
and destructive--

SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER:
Again, I think
you're running into
an issue where,
if a company has the development
resources to contribute
to AMP in a really
significant, helpful way,
then chances are still
good right now that they're
going to pour those
development resources back
into their own
projects and platforms.
JEREMY KEITH: And rightly so.
I mean, that's a good place
to spend your time and money.
SARAH SALTRICK-MEYER: I
mean, again, AMP, I think,
is so much a Google project
still at this point, and how--
it has to be in somebody else's
well-defined business interests
to make AMP a priority.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's true, yeah.
But if you're implementing AMP
and betting everything on AMP,
then my guess is
that is a priority.
JEREMY KEITH: Ooh, I don't like
the sound of betting everything
on AMP.
I mean, truly.
And I quite like it if at
events like this, it's like,
AMP and other solutions
are also available.
It's not just like, oh,
you want a fast website?
It's got to be AMP.
There's no other way.
It's impossible to make fast
websites other than AMP.
PAUL BAKAUS: No, that was
never the message, to be fair.
But you're right.
NICOLE SULLIVAN: Paul
wouldn't make that message.
JEREMY KEITH: I know.
You wouldn't make that.
But there's a danger that
that's the messaging that's
coming across--
PAUL BAKAUS: I mean,
you can absolutely
make fast websites without AMP.
That's clear.
JEREMY KEITH: You
just can't trust them.
PAUL BAKAUS: I can't trust them.
GINA TRAPANI: Oh, wow.
PAUL BAKAUS: I can't
trust them to be fast.
And this is, by the way, this
is our own failure, right?
This is, in some
sense, our own failure
to produce the right tools
to be able to correctly
measure and trust them.
And so far, I mean, true.
I worked on dev tools before.
And we have the
timeline in dev tools.
And it's just still--
I mean, we iterated
on it for years.
It's still really,
really difficult to--
JEREMY KEITH: You
mentioned Lighthouse.
I mean, that's doing
some good measurements.
And in terms of trust--
I mean, switching over
to progressive web
apps, which are separate
from AMP, despite what
you might hear.
There is this element of trust.
If you fulfill these criteria,
right, you're on HTTPS.
You have a service worker.
The user visits more than a
few times over a certain space.
Then you get this
at the screen thing.
That is actually showing
some give and take,
some trust on behalf of
Chrome, in this case, rather
than Google search.
But still, this idea that,
OK, I can't guarantee
that this will be
fast, but it seems
to fulfill some
fuzzy requirements.
OK, I'll trust you.
PAUL BAKAUS: It's a fair point.
I think we can learn a lot from
the progressive web app effort.
But I think we're also on time.
I think we need to wrap out.
I thank you all a lot
to be on this panel.
If you liked it, give
a round of applause.
[APPLAUSE]
If I can leave you with one--
if I can leave you
with one thought
is that I would love to have you
all contribute to the project
and to make AMP your own.
And this goes for
everyone in the room.
Thank you.
