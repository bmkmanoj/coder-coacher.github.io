everybody and welcome to the first amp
conference ever it's quite an amazing
achievement that that we've all gotten
here and we've all come together we have
about 300 of you here live in New York
City and they've traveled from
everywhere as far as China and Russia
and Brazil and we people even came all
the way from Brooklyn it's crazy
we also have a thousand plus people who
are going to watching on the livestream
and amp is really about this this is
really about a family and speaking of
family even my mom is watching on the
livestream I got this last night hi mom
I'll call you later so I better not mess
this up
so we've we've been here we've been
launched for about a year and we've made
actually some incredible progress and
I'm really in awe of all the work that
folks have done it really hasn't been
that long since a bunch of technology
companies and a bunch of publishers got
together to kind of figure out how we
could make the web work really instantly
how could we could deliver on an amazing
experience for users on their phone
we've made tremendous progress but it
really all comes down to doing this
together this is not something that
could be done by one company this has to
be done by all four pillars here the
technology platforms the ecosystems the
power of the web the publishers and the
webmasters that make the content the
contributors the most important folks
who actually check in code into the
github and and make this thing work so
this is really an effort that is a joint
effort of all these parties and its
first time I've ever seen anything like
this in the industry where everybody's
really coming together to rally around
one common cause one goal which is to
make the mobile web awesome so let's
start with publishers yeah so this is a
list of some of the publishers that have
started creating amp content in just the
last few months more and more coming on
all the time and while we started with
news content which really been adopted
quite broadly by a wide variety of
different verticals you see everything
from e-commerce sites here we see some
movie sites we see obviously some great
news news publishers and it's really
amazing to see the moment and the people
are having in the success that people
are having on am so today web sites of
all sizes are actually making
good progress so notable ones that I
want to talk about today Snapdeal which
is one of the largest ecommerce sites in
india and they've recently amped up all
their listing pages in fact I wouldn't
look to the camera this morning on
Snapdeal it was awesome
which is turned that is about 70 to 80
percent of all of their content and as
expected you make things faster you get
better performance fifty-two percent
average increase in their orders in a 59
percent average daily traffic increase
on their on their pages does a pretty
substantial improvement for an
e-commerce site to see that kind of left
and that just comes from making your
pages perform really really well
LinkedIn which is one of our earliest
platform distributors has launched amp
and they see almost a 10 percent average
lift in the time spent on an amp article
versus an article that is a non amp site
and that's one of their key metrics in
LinkedIn and it's a very important thing
to see people actually spending time and
engaging longer on the content when it's
faster tarah which is one of the largest
online media companies in latin america
has noticed as their amp pages load
twice as fast as they did before and not
surprisingly they get twice the amount
of time spent on amp pages as I do on
their non amp pages and blick who is a
large publisher in Switzerland making
135 millisecond load time versus their
2.3 seconds long time so we're seeing
tremendous progress we're seeing lots of
companies having great success adopting
this as publishers and the thing that
excites me most is the diversity is it's
not just the news publishers it's not
just the static web pages that people
think of when they think of amp it's
actually all sorts of new use cases and
for everything from e-commerce to to to
blogs etc and we even are starting to do
some things that are kind of crazy so we
have a presentation I'm going to show
you now a little sneak preview into it
into a talk that's coming up later today
which is called I can't believe it's amp
and I saw this and I couldn't believe
that this was amp either so I thought I
would show it to you this goes in the
list of things you probably shouldn't
actually try to build an amp but it's
just too fun
all right cut over to them all right so
this here is a messaging client built-in
amp because of course why not
this is hot off the presses so I have no
idea if this will work let's see it's
not working so I have a contingency plan
if it's not working I was going to have
Sebastian who wrote this masterpiece
come up on stage welcome Sebastian and
he's going to make it work
she actually said these are the things
you probably shouldn't do in amp it
wasn't intended to build applications it
was intended to build content sites but
content sites can be incredibly rich and
incredibly diverse and now everybody's
staring at your JavaScript debugger it's
amazing
did I click the wrong thing I probably
it's a user error isn't it
yeah all right there we go so this is
actually just using off-the-shelf amp
components this is using live lifts and
and and find a bunch of other crazy
things so stuff that you'll see
announced later today so stuff is going
live with the conference and I really
encourage you to check out his
presentation quick cut back to the
presentation which is I can't believe
it's amp it's just going to be presented
by Madison from what mobile and
Sebastian and it's going to take you
through how he built this thing and
hopefully when his presentation I'm sure
it will work just fine
so you can't talk about amp without
talking about distribution platform
that's really one of the great things
about amp and one of the promises of amp
is that you can make content that works
insanely fast the load smear instantly
feels like it's maze mode you know
native mobile content and have it work
that way
across a wide variety of platforms it
really is a builder page once you
control the monetization you control the
layout the business project the content
and have it just work across a wide
variety of platforms that's really been
the goal from the beginning this is
something that we wanted to embrace and
the platform's have embraced amp you see
a bunch of incredible partners that are
up here today that have actually gone
live with amp
some of which you'll be hearing
of presentations throughout the
conference so make sure you check it out
in fact up next will be Pinterest it's
pretty exciting but today I also want to
talk about a few new companies and
welcome a few new members to the amp
family
so first Yahoo Japan I think Yahoo is a
pretty well-known brand name but Yahoo
Japan is one of the largest search
engines in the asia-pacific region and
they're announcing today that they're
going live with amp in the search
results this little video there that
looks really familiar I didn't seen that
site before next up is Sogo which is a
very fast-growing website it's the
number two search engine in China and
it's growing like a rocket and they are
also launching amp live and starting
today and of course you can't talk about
the Chinese market without talking about
it I do so I'd like to welcome on the
stage leg out who's some where they are
all right
senior technology manager at Baidu who's
going to talk to you about what they're
doing with it
hello everyone sacrifice
Thank You radiation through this
conference Flemish by missing my phone
because my poor English my name is
khalid i worked at the largest search
engine search engine Baidu an invite to
and in the Church of the Weber
performance now as we know the speech is
the most important factor for the mobile
pages and the M he is helpful in solving
these problems when we found out her
path the NP we were very excited because
it is aligned visual vision by now
Baidu has started to index the ANP pages
and the page was catch is available for
the empty pages small over as a
foundation as visa NP as a foundation we
have completed some extensions in China
because many things are different in
China we call this extensions on IP but
in the near future
we welcome you today the extensions to
the NT project in the past year we has
influenced all the websites that catch
traffic from the by 2 and we have
validated more than one pill images that
pass the MIT validator P divides the
code and the catch we would like to do
mouth to improve the user experience of
the mobile page and we would love to see
more websites and more engineers
multiple offers to join this NP project
Thank You our standbys thank you
so with the addition of Baidu and the
others that I mentioned today we have a
tremendously increased the reach of
where your aunt pages can go so it's
over a billion new users are able to
access your amp pages with the new amp
family members that are joining today so
thank you all very much for for
participating in amp I think it's really
fulfilling the promise that that it's
had since the beginning which is this
build your build your file once and have
it work the same way and work well
everywhere
the next important pillar of amp is the
technology platform and one of the
things that's different about amp is
that it's the same as the web that's not
typically the case in the distribution
platforms and by being part of the web
you really get to take advantage of the
entire web ecosystem as you build your
pages and that's one of the the goals
that we've had is to not branch off from
the web but to be really part of the web
and embrace the web ecosystem you get
amazing tools today amp is supported by
all the major CMS vendors that are out
there including some big ecommerce
companies that are starting like big
commerce there's a tremendous ecosystem
that's grown of integrators and
technology companies that do everything
from building your own cash like
CloudFlare has to supporting transcoding
of documents on the fly like ream a
relay and marvel and of course all the
regular embeds that are on the web that
you know and love everything from Vimeo
to YouTube to Brightcove they all work
inside amp as well and it keeps getting
easier to publish amp documents today
I'm also very proud to announce that
tumblr is going to be rolling out in q2
335 million new blogs in amp so
welcoming tumblr to the amp family at
this round of applause
and and obviously one of the biggest
components of the tech ecosystem is
monetization and it's really important
that monetization works very well for
for publishers and that includes not
just a rich and diverse ads ecosystem a
rich and diverse analytics ecosystem but
also support for paywalls and
subscription content today we have over
125 domains that have adopted amps
native a subscription model native
paywall solution which lets the
publisher control the paywall just as
they've always done and has support for
it built into amp we also have 70 ad
servers which support amp today over 25
different analytics companies and it's a
growing list it's actually one of the
things that we can rarely keep keep
up-to-date on the slide because there's
always someone checking in the new ad
network it's amazing how many there are
and what what we would all expect is to
be true is true speed drives revenue
users come to your page they're more
likely to see your page if your page
loads fast or less likely to bounce and
they're more likely to see your ads and
your and your monetization what we're
finding is that from our internal data
eighty percent of amp publishers report
high review ability on their content 85
percent of and publisher see a higher
CTR and the majority see higher CPM as a
result if you implement amp the way you
implement your mobile website you
program the same number of ad units you
have your sales team actually sell
against the inventory you serve your
content over HDS you can actually get
really great results and we have a best
practices guide up on our website and
I've encouraged all of you publishers
that if go take a look and make sure
that you're engaged on the monetization
side of your content as well and last
but certainly not least are the
contributors these are the folks that
are checking coding to the github
repository that is actually what what
makes am special and we've had nearly
10,000 developers have engaged with amp
on the github over 300 contributors from
a wide variety of different
organizations and individuals and there
are actually 10 of you in this room
today so if you wouldn't mind stand up
if you're one of these 10
there we go let's give them a big round
of applause thank you thank you all
you're the ones that are making amp what
it is today
and we have a special gift for you at
the contributors lunch table you'll get
it later
so amp is really all about the community
it's really about the contributors the
publishers the tech companies the
distribution platforms all coming
together is one really focused on
building something new something that
can make users experiences on their
phone light-years better which is
instantly loading web pages and we're
really grateful to have you all as part
of the amp family and welcome to incomes
