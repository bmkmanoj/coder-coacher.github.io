pages past the point where their load
time feels almost instant I like to
switch it but how do we do it how do we
get to that ludicrous speed I'm glad you
asked
here are the top seven components number
one never stop the content take this
Domino's here for example they represent
our load chain and that's the total
amount of time required to load your
page most websites include assets and
scripts that are synchronously
downloaded in the order specified never
block the rendering of the page this
could for instance be a third party ad
like this red Domino here that appears
between two blocks of content and stops
the rest of the page from rendering
until the ad is fully available now and
solve this by making all of its own
scripts and components load entirely at
the same time here we go and by not
allowing any custom JavaScript that
could break those rules now instead the
interactive page features handled in
custom environments the custom
implements may have childhood under the
hood but they're carefully designed to
make sure they don't hurt performance ok
waiting it no jobs good at all well one
way to get around the limitation our
iframes why third-party j/s is allowed
in iframes it still cannot block the
main page from rendering for example if
third-party Jas uses a terrible document
bright API it does not block rendering
the main page next number two asset
independent layout on a normal HTML page
the browser often doesn't know what the
layout will be before all assets are
loaded take this picture in its raw
state
now it's rolled unloaded state I have no
idea how that is going to end up being
and if I still have enough space for the
rest of my content until it's fully
rolled out in amp all external images or
apps or iframes mistake the size in the
HTML so that amp can determine each
element size and position before the
actual resource is loaded
so am close to layout of the page
without waiting for any resources to
download that's what we call static
layouting and it's a crucially important
concept in the amp world and uncouples
document layouts from resource layout
only one HTTP request is needed to
layout the entire document but even with
these in place
CSS blocks all rendering a page load
plus it tends to get bloated which
brings me to number 3 inline slides down
to CSS let's pretend these green
dominates here our style sheets now in
amp pages we allow only a single
stylesheet and that one is inline
compared to most web pages this removes
one or often more HTTP requests from the
critical rendering path in addition the
inline style sheet has a maximum size of
50 kilobytes while this size is big
enough for basic Vista gated pages it
still requires the page author to
practice good feels as hygiene number 4
web fonts are super large so web font
optimization is crucial for performance
on a typical page that has a few
synchronous scripts and a few external
side sheets the browser waits and waits
to start downloading those huge funds
until everything else is done the amp
system requires zero HTTP requests on
tip from starts downloading and it is
only possible because all javascript in
amp is like we just learned a
synchronous and only inline spreadsheets
are loud number 5 minimizing style and
layout recalculations each time you
measure a change something by a script
on a page the browser has to layout and
recalculate the page and these
operations get really expensive so
assume that those are two pictures that
are already loaded on the page when this
picture from earlier is half loaded then
the content is over here but when it's
fully loaded the collet is pushed
further down the browser doesn't know in
advance what will happen to the layout
of the page until all assets are loaded
now most pages multiple scripts to
various dynamic things at the same time
causing lots of free layouts but
and mediate or render operations the
intelligently combines reading some
changes to minimize effort for example
we can get away with just one or two
layouts before the page is displayed
number six GPU accelerated animations
for the longest time all work to display
a page in the browser was done by your
computer's processor or CPU well it
turns out that your graphics card
specifically your GPU it's much more
efficient at pushing pixels around so by
uploading a lot of the visual work to
the GPU a browser can free up CPU cycles
and make your page run faster when the
CPU lay out the page it creates so
called layers or textures that are then
sent to the GPU for further manipulation
the GPU can take those layers and
transform them for instance shrink them
save them rotate them move them around
everything what you can imagine
basically CSS allows you to animate all
sorts of CSS properties but
unfortunately to stay in a fast lane by
only allowing those that can happen on
the GPU namely transform and opacity and
finally number 7 prioritized resource
loading when amp downloads resources it
optimizes download so that the currently
most important resources are downloaded
first images and ads are only downloaded
if they're likely to be seen by the user
now above the fault or if the user is
likely to quickly scroll to them and so
we make a prediction that they will be
seen on screen remember we know what's
above the fold because of the previously
mentioned static layering system and
also prefetches lazy loaded resources
that appear somewhere the load of salt
but are going to be important later and
the key is that resources are loaded as
late as possible but pre fetched as
early as possible that way things are
very fast but ppreciate CPU cycles are
only used when resources are actually
shown to you this now you've learned
about seven smart optimizations that amp
does for your pages but it only gets us
to
pretty fast not instant so check out
