of questions I bet one or two just
degrees up but we also have again we
have two mics over here if you want to
ask many questions and there are some
questions that were asked in the link
that we shared so to get started one
question that I was curious about is amp
is often seen as way so you know - amp
is often seen this way to get quickly
into the top stores carousel right but
it seems like there's a really this riga
story around easier publishing and
development so do you think story is
friends of that amp for email amp in
general are actually easier to build I'm
actually curious to hear your opinions
you repeat the last part of the question
do you think do you think building for
amp is actually easier than building
like a just done that website or I said
like what I think each comes with its
own challenge so I think the
sanitization part of the puzzle is
pretty difficult because of what we've
encountered with different CMS and that
is definitely amp specific challenge so
I wouldn't say that F is easier to vote
for but I think that it's probably equal
everything is gonna have its own
challenge I think we're one thing I've
been hearing is that while design that's
already easier to build actually
maintaining high performance in good
quality over time is definitely easier
if you for example integrate the
invalidate or into continuous
integration and so ensuring compliance
with best practices over time because I
think what happens a lot is that you
know you really invest in optimizing
your experience but then as like
priorities change and you know maybe
some other developer starts working in a
project that don't really know as much
that's what's going on things requests
and so having this continuous like check
that's things are in good state nice
actually helpful great
well now I jumped around this document
okay
I'm back again so let's actually jump to
the Moslems audience questions so we
actually have a few of them I'm first
gonna have some questions that we got
through the slide Oh things called the
first question is are there any plans to
enhance the M story experience for
desktop users to utilize increased
screen real estate so it's definitely
something that we are thinking about
it's a difficult problem because
although you have more screen real
estate the content of the article or the
content of the document is still the
same right so having a much larger piece
of screen real estate with a very short
form content might create some awkward
experiences but we are working on
through some ideas to allow publishers
to sort of customize that experience and
make sure that it is up to what you
would would hope for right with all
platforms support on a surface M stories
is another question for you I guess
for instance supporting amp enough to
support M to support AB question I'm
stories so yeah I guess is this let me
rephrase this question I think it's it's
about like do you think the places where
amp is currently supported will also
support stories in a significant way so
we actually put a bunch of thinking into
that to make sure that amp stories are
actually just amp documents so anywhere
that amp documents are supported and
theory could support amp stories as well
without doing any additional work right
so you can like share them to you know
Facebook or Twitter and that just works
and obviously it would be nice to have
first-class support and one you know one
platform or the other and you know we're
kind of taking this one step at a time
and are excited to see what's ahead
right so a lot of these so I just
noticed that
these questions are about stories
perfect today I wanna I want to give
some others a chance to chime in here
are there any other questions for the
speakers in the nuts Dog sessions any
won't want to ask a question animation
or parallax are you all so shy okay
that's one here hi I just had a question
about it was more about the in the tasty
demo when you got to the bottom of the
kind of feed there was a button to load
more content in that list and I was
wondering if there's a way to
automatically load more content when you
get to the bottom of the page and it
seemed kind of like you could do that
with the animation stuff that you were
talking about but is there a way to do
that right now
not currently but for this quarter we
are actually working on infinite
scrolling supports for amp lists and
that is the right way for us to support
essentially infinite scrolling when you
get to the bottom okay do you know when
that would is there a timeline on that
it's plan for this quarter all right but
there's not a lot of time left in this
quarter so okay thank you okay then we
just do another em stories questions
because they're very popular do you
think that M stories could generate and
I could work with user-generated content
on let's say a recipe platform for
instance so what would you recommend to
start with I mean there's nothing that
would prevent that I think that it is a
good idea actually there's you could to
get started just try building the story
statically but there there is nothing
that would keep you from I mean is at
the end of the day it's all HTML and CSS
right so any way that you can use HTML
and CSS with a normal web page you could
do to generate a story as well okay
can I add something from a user
experience perspective that sounds like
a great idea and the way the format is
set up is that it lends itself really
well to native videos as
as text so I think recipes having the
text and showing a video is a really
great execution for that type of content
so there's another question for senior
and this is actually my question Vegas I
was curious about this so you're
integrating stories into arc at your own
in-house publishing system where would
you like those stories to appear ideally
like what's what's the ideal way to
surface them and integrate them with the
rest of your site and I've been having
curious about this for a lot of our
clients the amp users come from organic
search so from the carousel so I think
it's it's very natural the same way that
they get to the amp pages they would get
to the stories probably there would have
to be a little bit more of a visual cue
that you're not getting into an article
traditional article but something more
like a Instagram or snapchat story but I
think it fits really well within the
ecosystem right to have any more
questions in the audience so I think
this one you know oh yeah
yes thank you with the logical and and
maybe inevitable extension of amp across
screens and more discussion about amp
only sites are we looking at a fork of
the web and what are the implications of
that that sort of question online them
Twitter I think so no that's what I
would have said yes I think one of the
important aspects to this matter is that
is is just a lot Java school library
that renders in the browser the browser
doesn't make any particular affordances
for it and it really doesn't
particularly care about em so you know
we will the way I think we talk think
about it is to create like a well-lit
path to a good experience but you know
if you don't want to use it and you want
you know I think you can do a better job
with
you know often Kenan with the right
investment and you know more power to
you I think it's it's absolutely not a
zero-sum game whatsoever and we
absolutely you know welcome you know
people you know doing their own thing
and using whatever they they like right
thank you and I think we have a question
over here yeah how do you balance
sanitization of content with
preservation of editorial intent
do you have metrics on how much content
you end up removing to deliver amp pages
and do you look in and see sort of what
was removed this might be questions yeah
yeah that's that's a difficult question
about what you're sacrificing right
you're either choosing for the story to
not surface on the search at all or
you're choosing for the experience to be
a little downgraded and when you're
handling thousands and thousands of
stories it'd be kind of hard to see the
big picture and what is the right answer
to that question there for one of our
clients there's one type of video embed
that they just want to remove from all
of their stories so yeah that definitely
changes the amp content and that is a
big big problem for the user experience
usually it's third party integrations
like I've talked before you know sports
scores or horoscopes or
election results and stuff like that a
lot of the time you have to build like a
custom amp solution for things like that
did that answer your question yeah I
guess do you do anything to sort of
quantify where you're at with it in
terms of like you have you have a
provider who has a rule that they know
internally that if they use this it's
just not going to be there
yeah not at this point but in the future
we have been asked to provide newsroom
tools for validation as they're writing
the story so that choice is not you know
delegated to the developers but rather
the content creators they can get
alerted that hey this embed or this
video might not be the best thing for
amp and ether the story won't surface or
it get stripped out and then they can
decide like what they want for each
particular story that is a way better
solution because we have no way of
really gauging what part of the content
is really important as developers but
giving that power to the newsroom would
be really great and that's one of our
next steps great thank you this shows
the importance I don't know do you want
to say something matter but I mean this
shows importance of how important is for
third parties to contribute to amp in
fact a lot of the contributions that
we're getting are from third parties
let's say ad vendors who want their ads
to be supported like embeds and the more
we can get the better so we're actually
very open to contributions that make
make these things work better and allow
less exclusions if I am yeah I think I
mean for me it's a pretty interesting to
hear the perspective that sanitization
is the thing at all like because in my
head you know why would you have that
because we I mean we're obviously aiming
to support all content that could
possibly exist and but obviously the
reality is that if you have an existing
publishing system and and people you
know in the hardest case can actually
copy paste Hobbit or HTML into there
into the content then it'll be you know
it's a possibly intractable problem to
do the best possible job I think it's
our job to at least make sure that
there's no fundamental limitations that
you literally cannot support something
right even if you try really really hard
great
cool yeah so next I'll increment hey so
my question is when you started out and
when he started out it was accelerated
mobile pages and Andre kind of removed
the mobile it's all going to be about
the web going forward I assume so
initially when it was mobile only then
most publishers took a stand as to the
mobile the amp portion would have less
content than the full desktop experience
obviously due to mobile dim tations and
all that stuff but I think in the recent
past Google you guys kind of came up
with the recommendation warning
publishers not to cloak content between
the amp and the full versions so that's
part like that's part one of my question
and part two is if you have an existing
kind of publication you have millions of
pages is there any kind of tool or
recommendation you have to migrate to
amp because you have an existing code
base and something like a tool which
would help you come up with a markup for
migrating that content over to ampion
what's the check this take the first
part if I understood right there was a
question about the content parity
message that for example this Google
search console it's offering if there's
a parity mismatch and I'm trying to
channel that Google search after this
this is actually it would be a really
great question to ask at the at the
Google booth over there because you
there you'll find the actual experts you
know none of the people usually I'm
working on amp are like actually you
know familiar with the search engine so
much but I think in this like if you
just think from a user point of view
what it means for you know a search
engine to surface the content right you
if you you know if you rank based on the
canonical but then there's a version of
it that doesn't have all the stuff then
you know we probably want to show the
one that has more content right and
because in the end it's about user
experience and and so because we've
observed that there sometimes is a mess
match they the the console just surface
this as something you know that you
either fix or you know if it's it's a in
the end its recommendations up to you
but basically the search engine will
choose not to link to the limited
version if that's not the right thing
for the user in that moment yeah that's
a good answer I if I can add to that
just one thing the thing I really liked
when I thought about this for the first
time as a user I realized okay I
actually don't think as amp as something
standalone actually like if I I see a
search result and I click on it that's
the website for me
right that's basically the page that for
me as a user that's the page I'm going
to if that's not complete and it has
like a links I go to the full page like
this is weird I just clicked on that
page does anyone recall the second
question really clarify could I find
maybe doesn't have any limit to the
content size or anything from yes I
think it's about it was about like does
this justice actually mean that we
should build more pages more sites
continue the tool for migrating all non
amp pages to am compliant markup okay
tooling particular vibration tooling so
well
barb you founded the company for doing
this so but in the I mean obviously it's
it's it's an actually really hard
problem to just convert arbitrary HTML
to M and it has limitations
right so you can't you know as soon as
you have for example you know even like
a menu and you use some jQuery to
implement it it's very hard to detect
that that's what you intended and then
you know converting that to something
like M sidebar all right so it's there's
it's new there's no super welded path
one thing that you know we're definitely
going to build sometime this year and
actually has a lot of solutions already
is what I call HTML snippet conversion
so more the task of I've a CMS and
stored the article content in HTML and
in unstructured fashion and then having
a good really reliable tool to convert
that to amp it's something that I think
really useful in almost everyone needs
it and it has been implemented many
times I think there's like five NPM
modules for it obviously WordPress has
this built in Drupal etc so getting that
into more like uniform basis will be
really helpful but yeah there's no magic
answer unfortunately for seeing like you
press this button and it'll be happy
thank you all right thank you for the
presentation especially about the
parallax part I want to address the
question in that particular way I think
it's very interesting and also all the
animation kind of stuff but I think it's
still very technical so knowing that the
average journalist or designer out there
will have a lot of trouble coming up
with the CSS required so my question
would be are you working on solutions to
make it more non code or frankly already
or is that rather in the far-off future
because I know they are demanding it and
most of the times don't have the
resources to support developers or to
hire developers for that so our solution
to that is essentially the amp effects
collection the idea that we will provide
an easy-to-use component that will have
some built-in visual effects that is
easily configurable the idea that you
find the element that you want and
essentially add a few attributes on it
and it will get you the effect that you
want so you don't have to go to the low
level position observer or an animation
to be able to create that so we already
have that but only one only the parallax
effect is currently in that collection
so we'll be adding more and more and
hopefully as you know people come up
with you know demand for this type of
transition this type of visual effect is
important for us maybe people can
contribute to that collection or
can you know raise the issues for us for
us to include those I think one more
yeah definitely for stuff like that file
an issue tell us what you're looking for
the more that like we know that you want
that and other people would use it too
that's really great I mean one one thing
that I want to mention is that I almost
lost my point
yeah one one other point that I have
which is not as informational as the
other one which is you know remember
those early 2000s right you know there's
a lot sites i had these like snowflake
effect right like midi background
animated Christmas music whatever can we
have like an amp FX particle effects
that renders realistic particle effects
please okay great
cool and then sorry actually yes now I
remember my coin so my actual point not
my actual point was that I think this is
goes to the other question that we just
had I think the yes one ideas to
collection what the other ideas that the
way Washington Post has built tooling on
top off the effects is something that I
would like to see more often for these
kind of things so yes it's true that
journalists might not be able to write
the actual HTML code and CSS but I think
we the framework is fairly easy to
convert into something that that can be
a visual tool a visual GUI I would say I
think the very technical answer is that
you know having something declarative is
actually perfect for having a tool bill
on top because you can both easily
generate it and you can even if it's
then manually edited you know get as
much information back as opposed to
having like a touring complete
programming language which you know you
can't really observe without running it
to know what it does this is actually
not the case here and super easy and you
could like invasion for example the
wordpress plugin having like a extra
little talk all saying like put a
parallax on this factor of 0.1 like
building a tooling would actually be
quite easy maybe too easy and everything
is going to move in crazy snowflake ways
but okay yeah time to move on to the
next question
does am and this is kind of a more of a
general question but I think it relates
to amp as your website in a in a
interesting way because it becomes much
more important and the question is does
m support a and be testing a be testing
of your website and yes how what are the
challenges for this to be dynamic
for instance contents you have to the
user based on his ad tag answer this
anyone else so there there is a
component called amp experiment and well
basically with that you can define user
groups based on you know but basically
you know you can use it for ABC icing
which is saying half years go this way
have users go this way or you can you do
whatever combinations you want like have
a 1% group here
or 1% control there and 98% somewhere
else right so that's that's all up to
you and basically the way it works is
that it just had to see this class to
your document based on that selection
and then it creates a variable that you
can use in the analytics then downstream
make the metrics associated with the
variant that was selected for the page I
think that's the long answer for saying
yes I'm - experiments yes absolutely
and then this is another em stories
question actually so is there a timeline
for at support in am stories and
specifically DFP support I don't know a
timeline for those things we're
currently investigating we're
experimenting with advertising in this
format we're going to probably start
with publisher served ads so the same
way that you would create my example if
you remember from from my talk was the
five most expensive cities the same way
you would create one of those pages for
a city you could create a page for an
advertisement
and you could you can control that
yourself and and to handle the
advertising yourself but we're working
on sort of dynamically or programmatic
ads support and trying to figure out all
of the complexities involved with that
no timeline as of yet right and then I
would say the final question and unless
we have more audience questions after
that one and then we can release your
early to lunch is what about
user-generated content on them
we are having an amp to show the results
but most of our content is
user-generated content and we still need
that when we had a variation of that
question earlier I guess but um yeah I
think the story is the same right you
just have to sanitize in a certain way
yeah users generally Cana can be all
kinds of stuff right so if someone
uploaded a photo like sure you can
you know render that's an EM page
obviously it could be that they uploaded
HTML it's not that common unless you
make like have it'll get blogging
platform so I think in the in the in the
most common use case it would be you
know I I couldn't see how they will be
actually even a challenge to support it
yeah I think the only the only real
issue would be if like you said like
some of those form editors support like
pasting HTML into them and yes if it's
arbitrary HTML that might be tricky but
yeah I think the the way I would answer
this is to say um I shouldn't even be
answering all these questions but it's a
it's just making sure that whatever -
whatever form or - you're building to
submit that user-generated content
doesn't allow you to go off the rails
okay do we have one more question if not
yes question there was a great question
there about multivariate testing and I
was wondering about other capabilities
that are often supplied by third-party
JavaScript components all those
capabilities that you'd normally see in
typical
ecommerce publishing sites what is the
most requested features that are missing
from amp today and what are you
prioritizing for for working on next I
think this is a question for tomorrow
almost because we'll have a panel on
e-commerce but we can try at least I
mean it would be even better if we had
like a product manager on stage take
their bread and butter you know I mean
and so the you should definitely check
out the talk we have but Rudy and I'm
doing tonight it has like our roadmap
laid out which is you know the indirect
answer to your question of what's
missing I do I would absolutely actually
declare us as pretty feature complete
for the publishing space in many ways
you know in the e-commerce site there's
certainly if any bigger bigger holes and
so it's you know there's no one answer
because it really kind of depends on on
what exactly what kind of vertical
you're in and yeah that's I think that
the rough answer right I I think we can
close at that point thank you very much
for yes one more question all right
maybe when are you going to implement
built-in split traffic testing to test
between amp and canonical Vince which
traffic testing tuple split traffic
traffic between amp and canonical so the
what I would like this to be a feature
in search console or you can say like
you know send some traffic here some
traffic there but that feature doesn't
exist and I don't think there's any
plans to do it but it would be nice for
now the best you can do is that you
publish parts of your pages in one way
post your pages in the other way and
then try to make an assessment over that
obviously from a like soundness of the
experiment you've run into issues
because they're not the
exact same pages and this traffic isn't
exactly the same but that's I think
right now the best you can do right yeah
we've been trying to measure conversions
impact for probably six months now so an
able to do it
yeah that should they should probably
work you definitely want to if you if
you saw the keynote you want to install
that Google Analytics fix yeah we did
that right that's that's very important
I do think that specifically for this
case if you are using it for Adwords you
can use the existing experiment setups
in Adwords so for example run your M
campaign versus your non-aligned
campaign and directly and also very like
statistically sound compare conversion
rates yeah we don't do AdWords just
search engine thank you okay so thank
you to all the morning speakers please
give a big round of applause and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
