live here at AMP Conference 2018 right
here in Amsterdam it's been a big day
full of some exciting announcements some
major news let's see some of the
highlights today we're launching both a
Developer Preview on on AM site and
there's going to be surfacing of these
stories in Google search
so I'm also really excited to announce
today that we're releasing the amp tool
box optimizer which is basically a
toolkit that developers can use to
optimize amp documents serve from their
origin I'm super excited to announce a
temp is in fact coming to email so
imagine that you could complete tasks
directly inside of your your email so
with that for email users can quickly
take actions on things like RSVP'ing to
an event
now as we do with many new experimental
features an amp we have collaborated
with publishers to help innovate in this
space with the goal of building a
stories format for a rich storytelling
by bringing you app to email we opened
up a whole new world of possibilities
for what what can happen inside of email
and a whole world of possibilities for
users to engage with your content so one
of the biggest initiatives has been to
expand amp experiences from just organic
to paid as well and last year the
AdWords team launched their amp
experience where clicking on ads when
I'll lead you to amp pages
overall development time and workflow
was just way easier having the full amp
site and just the one source of truth
for the site so for example bringing it
back again to my time working on
BuzzFeed the article pages comparing a
too tasty the build time we see 85
percent faster build time the web paxil
but we want to allow all of you to write
javascript in your amp documents so all
the showers will run in a web worker and
those were some highlights from day one
of vamp cops to see more of the talks in
more detail just subscribe to the apt
channel and tune in tomorrow for live
coverage of day two thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
