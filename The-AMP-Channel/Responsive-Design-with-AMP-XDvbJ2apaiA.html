site trick question the answer is both
as amp pages and responsive design go
together like peanut butter and jelly
the mobile and accelerated mobile pages
didn't really help alleviate the myth
that sites built with amp can absolutely
run fine on other form factors like
tablets and laptops if you don't believe
me just look at our own website it's all
am from top to bottom and works fine
everywhere and the neat thing about this
is that we have only one single codebase
that just happens to be using amp as a
library so how can you do this yourself
the first advice is to make use of the
capabilities that CSS already gives you
namely CSS media queries you can use
almost every CSS on an amp page and
media queries allow you to create break
points to change your layout based on
the current width of the page but what
about making individual elements
themselves responsive so they respond to
the size of the container they're in a
non em Paige you could set the width and
CSS to 100% and the height to auto and
image width size itself to the width of
the container keeping its aspect ratio
but that doesn't work well with other
elements developers have come up with
weird hacks like the infamous padding
hack to give you an element like a div
or an iframe a force aspect ratio in amp
that becomes a lot simpler almost all em
prefixed elements support the custom
layout attribute in addition to width
and height layout supports value such as
responsive field and fixed and
responsive does exactly what you think
best of all it works on all embeds
iframes videos and so on in addition to
layout em image supports or certain
sizes so you can load images at the
right size and dpi for the given screen
and user now if you're one of the few
who's really doing their homework and
wants to go above and beyond you might
have used a picture element before to do
art direction and image format
optimization there's no AM picture but
both of these are supported our
direction refers to not just loading the
image at the right size but maybe even
cropping the image based on how big your
viewport is so that the most important
part of the picture is visible for that
to work you need to load an image not
just at different sizes but possibly
different aspect ratios the easiest way
to do this in amp is to just have to amp
image text next to each other and
controlling width which gets shown with
a media query to do this on a pair
element basis
and at support for element Media queries
for this one-off cases you can add the
media attribute to an element and set
the value to something like min with 650
pixels exactly like you would do with a
CSS media query and finally sometimes
there's an image format that compresses
extraordinarily well but isn't supported
in all browsers that too is supported an
amp but not the way you might expect an
amp many elements have the ability to
fall back to a different element if the
source is not supported and it's exactly
the same with amp image if the outer
image is a web P for example but the
browser doesn't support it then amp will
load the nested amp image instead and
there you go fully responsive web pages
with amp read more about styling a
layout and amp on our home page linked
in the description and get in touch
through one of the support channels if
you have any questions ideas of feedback
