one of the cofounders and CEO of
CloudFlare and we're really excited to
be here to talk about what we're doing
with the amp project and how we're
addressing some of the biggest concerns
but before we did that a lot of you in
the audience are actually claps our
customers but some of you might not know
what CloudFlare is and at some level
we're sort of a boring infrastructure
company that sits behind the scenes I
wanted to tell you a little bit about us
first
so cloud fleurs mission is to help build
a better internet and we run one of the
largest networks in the world with
pointed presidents over a hundred points
of presence in 50 countries around the
world spanning not so exotic places like
Newark New Jersey just across the river
here too we have 25 points presence
across mainland China we're building
across Africa Latin America a lot of
places around the world where people are
consuming the Internet and where the
Internet is largely mobile and where
it's just too slow and too expensive to
actually be loading we see about 10
million requests per second through our
network about 10 percent of all internet
requests pass through us you all in this
room even in the probably the first few
hours of this morning have probably used
our network maybe hundreds of times and
when we're doing our job right we just
make things work better behind the
scenes now we have literally millions of
customers over 6 million customers and
the ones that were really focused on
today are the ones in sort of the media
and ad text space that we're providing
services for we solve a lot of the
Internet's hardest problems performance
security reliability insights the
analytics and data but one of the things
which is core to us is making sure that
the Internet is extremely fast and
mobile performance has been one of the
key issues that we've been thinking
about and working on for a long time and
so when Dane connect who is a senior
member of our team brought me this
mission statement this list of bullet
points from the amp project over a year
ago and said you know this is going to
be the future of the
mobile web and this is really important
we look down this list and we said well
this this really aligns almost exactly
with what cloud Flair's mission is our
mission is to help build a better
internet our mission is to give
developers the tools to make sure that
they can actually build great products
great services publish great content
regardless of where they're trying to
deliver it online and we want to make
sure it's as easy to use as as
user-friendly as possible and great for
developers as as we're going along this
is our mission and this is the amp
mission as well and so it was just a
no-brainer that we should be involved
with the amp project one of the things
we also believe incredibly strongly in
is that the future of the web needs to
be open and it needs to be something
that we all share it shouldn't be
dominated by one particular company and
you know there is another company which
is out there that is working on another
sort of version of the making the web
faster and and there's there's a
contrast you know really between these
Google isn't the only one who wants to
make the internet faster and and I mean
I don't want to be overly dramatic but
it kind of reminds me of another story
of sort of good versus evil that
involved a lightning bolt
and again what we think is important is
and what we've really really liked in
working with Google is that they believe
that the amp project shouldn't be owned
and controlled by Google it should be
open there should be other caches there
should be others that are building and
supporting this project and so when we
heard that we said that's awesome that's
exactly the sort of thing that we can
get behind and it's important for other
providers to be providing parts of the
amp ecosystem because again Voldemort v
Voldemort isn't a very interesting story
we need to be the Harry Potter's of this
world and be open to what it is and
that's in everyone's interest in this
room and what I'm encouraged by is
Google thinks that's then their interest
as well now it's not all sort of flowers
and roses not everything is perfect
listen to the talks yesterday you heard
a lot of different challenges with the
amp ecosystem and I think there are sort
of three that we've identified as three
of the largest challenges one is there's
limited discovery second is that the
brand that you have right now there are
negative brand effects that are possible
if you're embracing amp and the third is
modernization just isn't there so let me
walk through each of those and give you
some sense so 90 percent more than 90
percent of traffic to amp pages starts
with a Google search and that's that's
just wrong that's not what the open web
looks like that's not what an open
protocol looks like if you look at non
amp traffic and non amp refers the vast
majority of traffic is referred from non
Google sources and if amp is truly going
to be an open standard then we need to
make sure that non Google sources can be
driving traffic to amp discovery is a
problem that needs to be solved
second is there's a brand challenge and
a lot of people have talked about this
and the fact is that if you're Bloomberg
and you're on amp the URL at the top of
the page says Google and that has real
brand risk to you but it's more
important than that
because the domain that they is
delivering the content is the one that
gets to drop the cookie and the cookie
is who's going to be able to deliver the
audience and if you're doing this if you
are the one who is delivering content
across Google then the risk is that the
unique audience that you've developed
yourself you're losing potentially it is
not a good enough answer to say trust us
we'll give you the data right again we
don't want to be the project that's like
you know instant articles we want to be
something which is open publisher
friendly developer friendly and it's
very important that there's a way that
if you're building and curating a unique
audience you can actually deliver that
the other thing is if you go to an amp
experience now do it run a search on
Google for Trump and you'll see the
carousel that comes up click on one of
those amp ads swipe to the right you
just go to another article on Trump
nobody reads the news that way right
editor
actually matter and if you think about
how what a great experience it is when
you see a well curated publication where
you're going from one story to a story
that goes deeper on that story to a
story that's related and tangental
that's exactly what we need to be
delivering to people we need to have
curated experiences and M can actually
make that better but right now it's not
doing it because again there isn't
enough control for individual publishers
the last piece is monetization and you
know our friends over at thirty three
across did a survey and they said what
are the top problems yeah go
thirty-three across I see Eric's out
there you know the number one and number
two concerns with amp or one you got
less revenue per page view and two even
though there are ads on amp pages those
ads load slowly and that's actually more
of a problem when the page loads fast
because people scroll past the ads
before they even see them your view
ability rates go down and publishers
can't monetize that content
there aren't enough options to actually
make amp at pages monetize and if we
can't monetize those pages like people
who are creating content they need to be
able to eat and so we need to have ways
that people can actually monetize those
pages and it's critical array for eating
yeah thank you yes thank us that's good
yeah so we've been we've been working
with with Google on on this and don't
know why there are six builds there
we've been working with Google to try
and solve these top three issues and I
am super excited today to introduce what
we're calling ampersand and ampersand is
the first non Google cache that you can
white label and make your own and
control in the ways that US publishers
should be able to control it it's served
from your own domain it's as fast as the
Google cache and we have data to back
that up it's secure by default because
we're a security company and we care
about that enormous Lee we made it
incredibly simple to
applications and other widgets that you
can use to either enhance your app amp
pages or add monetization units and it
allows for a fully curated experience
where your editors and your storytellers
can actually sit down and drive tell
stories with amp pages better than
you've ever been able to do before now
this wasn't easy we've been working on
this for over a year we've built an
entire team in Austin Texas to build
this out and in the early days of the
amp project there wasn't a lot of
documentation and it's not as simple as
just saying you know we're gonna deliver
the content like a CDN across our entire
network there are actually server-side
optimizations that have to be built in
order for this to work there's actually
cryptographic code that needs to sign
all of this and so we have been and a
very very very extensive partner in the
amp project to make sure it just works
and the cache that we deliver is not
only fast not only delivered from around
the world but it's fully validated
against the amp spec and as the amp spec
changes as there are changes to that we
are updating our side of our code to
make sure that you are getting all of
the benefits from the latest and
greatest of amp even if you're not even
if you're using ampersand and not the
Google cache so how does ampersand solve
the three biggest challenges of amp
today discovery brand and monetization
let me go through each of those and tell
you how we're thinking about those
challenges and how we're addressing them
so first of all discovery the problem
with amp today is again 90% of traffic
which is delivered to amp is driven from
a Google search and yet there are all
kinds of other platforms out there that
are trying to get people to have the
fastest possible mobile experience and
they've tried various things to
integrate amp to a lesser or greater
extent but it's obvious I mean it's just
painfully obvious that if you're Bing
you can't be driving content to Google
it just won't work right in the long
term there has to be an independent
flavor of amp that allows you to
continue to control the audience that
you have and yet get all the benefits
and all the experience that you've got
other organizations like Twitter are
driving people to the native amp that
the local amp version of the page and
yet you don't get any of the
distribution from the the global network
if you do it that way you also don't get
any of the server side optimizations if
you do it that way and so it's not an
ideal experience we needed a better
solution and so starting about two
months ago we launched out what we call
accelerated mobile links or Amal and
what Amal does is for any provider which
is on cloud floor they can click one
button and we have an API that
automatically will run on their pages
and identify links on those pages and if
there's an amp version of the link then
someone is accessing it from a mobile
phone
then we will automatically rewrite that
link to drive traffic to the amp version
and it's been amazing in terms of the
success we thought it would be adopted
by the smallest publishers on our
network exactly the opposite has
happened some of the largest publishers
on our network have adopted Amal and
turn it on on their on their sites we
have 24,000 different publishers that
have already signed up for Amal and
again that works in a just make it
extremely easy sort of way but for most
of people in this audience you need
something that's a lot more
sophisticated and so what we're
announcing today is the full SDK where
you can take the Amal experience and
integrate it into your app we have an
API that you can hit for any link on
your page that will tell you if there's
an amp version of that link available
and then you can drive that experience
to the actual ampersand cash which you
can actually skin and brand and make
your own so the discovery experience can
actually be controlled by the discovery
engines and you're not losing that
traffic as it goes on we've built a full
amp viewer which you can now white-label
and turn into your own and integrate
into whatever application it is that you
are there and you can tell stories with
that viewer
so imagine reddit turn this on across
their platform when you went to an amp
page and you swipe to the right it
wouldn't be going to the Washington Post
or the next publisher it would be going
to the next
related story that reddit has on their
pages so they continue to build the
engagement with their audience that they
are delivering traffic for what we want
to make sure we're able to do is take
social platforms other non Google search
engines content aggregators and make
sure that they can drive the amp
experience because the amp experience is
a better experience but we need to make
sure that other providers are able to
drive that discovery directly and what's
amazing about this is we've already seen
the effects of it from our amel launch
where we see that two out of the five
people that click on an amel link then
click the X button and return back to
the original site which means that the
site which is providing the discovery
engine is actually driving more
engagement with their users you're not
losing that visitor as they leave your
discovery engine and then wander off to
the west rest of the web they're using
you as a launching point and then coming
back to where they started and that's a
great experience for those people who
are content aggregators search engines
social networks that are driving
discovery out there we need to bring
them into the amp fold and we think
ampersand is a is a really great start
in doing that the second big challenge
that exists in this space is around
brand and you know brand is important
for a lot of different reasons but it's
especially important in this space
because what we can't allow to happen is
for content providers to be just
complete completely commodified it's
important that we that we reward the
people who are building unique audiences
and let them control those audiences and
tell stories to those audiences and the
problem is that if if you're serving all
of your content under somebody else's
domain then you are losing control of
the unique audience that you have built
and that's one of the biggest objections
to the amp project that we're hearing
over and over again so we thought it was
critical that we that we actually solve
that so for publishers we're now
providing a way for you to have a white
labeled amp cache where you can deliver
your amp
content under your own domain and that
can be true either in the iframe that is
behind whoever is the the ultimate
top-level domain or it can actually be
true in the top-level domain as well so
that again you control your audience and
again I think this is so important
editors are important it's important to
tell stories where people can start with
one story and then dig deeper on a
particular topic the way that the amp
experience works today we're a Google
search for Trump takes you to one story
and then you just read the same story on
Fox News and then Bloomberg and then and
then slate and then the Washington Post
that's not what people want to do what
people want to do is start with a
publication land on that page and then
go deeper as they swipe to the right and
what we have now provided is a way that
you can control how that carousel works
on your own publication and you can make
sure that your editors your storytellers
are the ones that can actually use the
platform use the technology in order to
tell stories better
it's your content it's your users it's
your data you should be able to have
control of that and we think it's
incredibly important that we don't just
commodify the the publishers that are
creating unique content over time again
amps strength is its openness and
there's been a lot of criticism of
Google that they're trying to build a
walled garden just like our friends over
at Facebook are doing I don't think that
criticism is fair and I don't think that
is what we have experienced when we have
worked with the Google team Google
really does believe in a free and open
web a free and open world it is critical
a free and open web is critical to a
free and open web and that's a story
that we have heard firsthand from Google
over and over again and I think it's
important to recognize some of the very
valid concerns that they have had in not
sort of saying let's have a bunch of
other caches that are out there they
were worried about speed right they
wanted to make sure that that it was as
fast as possible because if it wasn't
fast then it wasn't good for the user
and the number one priority of the amp
project was be good to the user and so
had to be
and if all of you are out there building
kind of half-baked caches they're not
going to be fast you have to build a
giant Network in order to make that work
they were worried about data leakage
right which is that when you run a
Google search and there are amp content
on the page if you have if those pages
are being pre-rendered then there's a
risk that the end publisher can get that
data and if you had a rogue publisher
that was out there that was stealing
data then they could potentially take
data from individual users in a way that
that just is icky right and that's a
real concern and it's something that we
should really respect and think about
and then there are security concerns the
way M works you're serving JavaScript
that's on a page that is first-party and
and if all of a sudden that javascript
is able to find some sort of security
vulnerability in google then potentially
it could steal Google's own cookies or
Google's own security information and I
think these are all incredibly valid
concerns I don't think that the reason
why Google is serving things under their
own domain is because they're trying to
build a walled garden I think it's
because there are these are these are
real and we need to respect them what's
a good thing though is the way that
we've built ampersand we've addressed
all those concerns we've made sure that
it's as fast as Google everywhere around
the world and in those places where
we're not as fast yet we're working to
make it faster and in a lot of places
especially in in China and other places
where it's hard for Google to
participate we're already significantly
faster from a data leakage perspective
we can actually work with them to say
we're gonna be that party that doesn't
actually transfer that data on to rogue
publishers and we can find a way if we
don't have a thousand caches but we have
a limited number to make sure that you
can keep that data private and from a
security perspective again we can make
sure that we're not delivering rogue
JavaScript that could potentially
compromised Google's users there are
ways to overcome these objections and if
we can overcome these objections again
you answer every single one of the major
concerns about adopting amp every
concern that was brought up on stage
yesterday every concern that was drawn
up on stage going forward we can address
if we make sure that there is a limit
number of responsible caches out there
that are fast that protect data and are
secure from the beginning and again
we're really proud to be one of the
first to have launched that which then
takes us to the big topic of
monetization none of this makes any
sense none of this works if you all
can't actually make money from
delivering the content which is across
the pages you're on and again the
biggest concern about Amp is it's great
we're getting higher engagement we're
getting more people reading more
articles but unfortunately we're not
able to monetize these pages and there's
some confusion here there's a confusion
around amp amp ads versus regular ads
and AD on an amp page is not an amp ad
right and what happens is again if you
look amp ads actually load incredibly
quickly and load with the content
regular as delivered on amp are actually
significantly less effective than amst
then ads delivered on slower pages
because by the time you know the page
load so fast people scroll past the ad
before they even it's even in the
viewability state so you need to
actually deliver amp ads on amp pages
and make those as fast as possible and
so we announced about a month ago what
we call fire bolt and fire bolt is amp
ads delivered for amp pages that load
incredibly quickly we've been testing
this with a number of different partners
triple lift was one of the partners that
we've been working with we've been
working with Time Inc on this and what
what they saw was for the same audience
with the same content with the only
difference being deliver it with
firebolt they saw a 13 percent lift in
revenue they saw that the as loaded six
times faster and that the the weight of
the ads the number of bytes to deliver
they as was was one third of what it
would have been before and that last
point is extremely important because on
mobile especially in the developing
world a lot of times you it cost more
for a user to download the data for the
ad then the then the publisher is
getting in the CPM for that particular
user that is the definition of a
deadweight loss
and so it's important that as we build
ads for a mobile ecosystem that they
work in a way that supports that mobile
ecosystem and amp ads or Firebolt ads do
exactly that and we've been working with
that and we've seen incredible results
as a part of that so what we're able to
do this is not a replacement for ad
networks we're not building an ad server
again we are just the distribution
platform for existing ad servers that
are out there we can sign the ads we can
do all the server-side optimizations and
we work with a number of different ad
networks and ad servers and other types
of publishers and again openness is key
here we can't allow whoever are the
dominant ad networks to use amp as a way
to further entrench their particular
control over an entire space it's
important that this space stay open and
regardless of what ad networks or add
tags you choose to have on your page
that you can get the experience at each
different step with each different
provider
we can't allow one provider to say we're
going to use this new technology to
further entrench ourselves as the
dominant Network again Voldemort v
Voldemort isn't an interesting story
we've got to make sure that the amp
ecosystem stays open so here are some
different things that we've been doing
in order to help publishers monetize so
one is a partnership way done with the
Vig link if you're not familiar with
viglink what viglink does is if somebody
posts a link on a page and it's for a
particular product viglink will
automatically associate referral codes
with that product so when you click on
that link and go to that particular
product if someone buys that product
after we automatic and the publishers
will cut it with that rata froofy on
them or that they do it automatically
unfortunately for viglink because of the
way they rewrite content on pages they
can slow pages down and think that's
against one of the core tenets of what
amp is delivering and so we said is
there a way that we can deliver viglink
without slowing pages down and we worked
with them and we're gonna make sure that
server-side we can actually rewrite the
links on the page without slowing those
links down and they can deliver that
through our now
this is a way of us taking modernization
technologies which were previously not
allowed under the amp standard and
finding ways to make sure that
publishers continue continue to monetize
without sacrificing the user because the
ad tech space has gone wrong in the
sense that it sacrificed the user and
sacrificed speed it sacrificed privacy
we need to take those things back but we
still need to make sure the publishers
can eat so we have to continue to have
ways the publishers can monetize their
content we've made this one-click simple
with viglink made it so that you can
continue if this is one of the ways that
you monetize your traffic that you can
continue to get this advantage while
still staying amp compliant another
partner that we've been working with is
33 across and it's really a it's just
incredible to see what we've been able
to do with them we've made it one-click
simple for you to insert amp adds
incredibly fast incredibly performant
amp ads on the fly as content is passing
through the network so that those ads
load simultaneously with the content
which is actually on the page again we
want to make this extremely easy for
publishers to be able to actually
monetize their content and we want to
work with as many ad networks as
possible to make sure that they can
deliver content on the app amp format
with true amp ads so that those ads will
perform and in the future you'll
actually get more revenue for per amp
page not less one of the big criticisms
of amp has been that you can't build
interesting content with it I think
that's even we saw yesterday where an
entire chat service was built within amp
and that's incredibly powerful the same
is true for ads where there are you know
you can build incredibly rich content of
advertising through the amp standard as
it exists today what's been missing are
the tools to do that and yet they're
starting to appear and so this is CELTA
they're a drag-and-drop
what-you-see-is-what-you-get ad creation
product where it actually delivers an
amp compliant ad it's automatically
signed by ampersand and then delivered
across any amp valid delivery network
and again look how robust you can make
this this is drag-and-drop simple one of
the keys is we have to get more amp
creative that's actually being delivered
and Sela is doing a great job of that
and again they've been a terrific
partner for us and there are other ad
networks that were that we're working as
well so this is again one of the fine
global financial ad networks it's become
incredibly simple to integrate Firebolt
the thing to take away from this is that
they were within less than a week able
to build a fully compliant amp Delivery
ad system across their entire network
simply by hooking into Firebolt and
delivering it across there we want as
many different ad networks to be able to
support amp true amp ads as possible
today there are only five right one is
Google the other four use Firebolt we
need to make sure that every single ad
network out there is doing that and so
if you're a publisher here and you're
using an ad network that's still still
delivering slow ads to your customers on
your amp pages make sure that you work
with them tell them that there are ways
now that they can actually start
delivering that content because that
means you know again what we've seen is
13 percent revenue increases from from
that that content and it's not just ad
networks we're starting to actually see
ad servers other than Google that are
delivering amp content and so ad zerk is
the first non Google ads ads server to
actually be delivering amp content for
amp ads across different pages and
they've rolled this out again powered by
fire bolt to be able to deliver this
content across all of their different
customers and they're seeing great
results as a result of that when I think
about what's exciting about amp again
it's it's Harry Potter versus Voldemort
we have an opportunity to throw out all
of the bad pieces that were wrong with
mobile development and start from a
really fresh clean slate where we can
build a much better mobile web
experience and an open web is a better
web if we're all locked behind one
monolithic app that's out there that's
not good for anyone in this room we want
people to be able to innovate create
tell great store
raise get paid for that content that are
creating and have an open and innovative
network as a part of that and we don't
want anything of the new technology that
is being rolled out to further entrench
one particular provider in another
openness is the strength of amp and we
need to make sure that that ecosystem
continues to get richer continues to get
more open and it continues to be able to
deliver great content so we're extremely
excited to be working with everyone in
the amp community it's been great
working with Google their vision very
much is for an open Internet and aligns
very much with what it is that we think
is critical for the future of the web
and the future of amp we it's important
