my name is Malta I'm the creator and
tech lead of M business Rudy I'm Rudy
product manager Nia so we're almost at
the end of the day here how is everyone
feeling good actually I think we've had
a really great sequence of talks I hope
it's been really helpful to hear from
folks you know in first person their
experience building amp and I'd actually
like to just have everyone give a quick
round of applause again to all the great
speakers we've had for today yes so
hopefully you've been learning a lot
hearing from all these folks who are
working on amp or building with amp and
you know ultimately doing what we're all
looking to do here which is help bring a
better mobile web for users all around
the world through amp so right after
this talk we're gonna move to a Q&amp;amp;A as I
mentioned so get those questions ready
but what we're gonna do now is we
thought we'd talk a little bit about
some of the next steps that you know
Malta and I and all the others working
closely with the project c4 am so before
we dive in it's worth stopping to just
kind of note that the question of what's
next in amp is really something that we
all play a role in helping to shape the
answer to and why is this well whether
it's filing issues or the chats we have
in slack or even on email and face to
face meetings whether we're separated by
screens or not all of the activity that
you all do all of your contributions and
input help propel amp forward each and
every day and you know sometimes the
paths on you know the next steps on this
path they're relatively easy to
anticipate and then sometimes there'll
be a github issue or some discussion
there's something totally unexpected and
that's totally by design you know when
we started am I couldn't imagine setting
the project up in a different way than
how we have it which is an open source
collaboration where ideas can come from
anywhere
features can be built by anyone and bugs
can be fixed by anyone and so you know
we're stronger at this working together
and I've no doubt that the trajectory of
amp is changed by the fact that we're
meeting here today that we're having
discussions that we're sort of learning
about each other's work
and and we're gonna carry that forward
in determining what next steps we do
take so you know just to recap as we
think about the future of vamp it's
worth sort of reflecting on the early
days of vamp and they were reasonably
straightforward you know we we had
really you know discussions with news
publishers to help shape this initially
and the steps we wanted to take were
we're pretty easy to see we wanted to
ship a j/s library that would run really
fast and and show static news content
you know blazingly fast we wanted to
make ubiquitous interactive features
like image carousels
and in light boxes we wanted to support
those through nice web components of
course ads it should support ads at
least a little bit and you know maybe
tracking pixels are okay for the first
launch which is what we had in the
developer preview and a full-blown
analytical solution could wait maybe a
quarter so and finally you know with
news publishers of course paywalls are a
pretty critical feature and so that was
another one that we had our eyes on
right from the get-go so again
reasonably straightforward kind of like
a checklist but then from there things
kind of branched a bit so this is when
we started listening a lot more and and
hearing the feedback that was coming in
and so you heard from Natalia this
morning about you know publishers who
wanted to do even more effective onward
journeys and so we built features like
amp lists that let you sort of
dynamically populate these these onward
journey links at the bottom of news
articles or we heard hey would it be
nice to take this page and sort of give
some insight into the broader site
structure be able to help navigate users
to the different sections of a new site
or any site and so we build navigational
menus supported by M sidebar or you know
thinking more about dynamic experiences
and live blogging it was an election
year in the US this past year Sports is
always going sports always coming in and
out of season and and people love
keeping up with these events so we built
things like amp live lists to enable you
know live updating content pages and amp
and so this is all to say that feedback
has helped drive the product and
building out that product over time has
helped drive even more feedback and so
let's go and keep those wheels turning
together right and when we kind of
talked about what we should do in this
talk we're not really going back and
forest making a list like what's in this
what's much will be in this talk and
then we realized this list that's just
our okay ours so who here knows what OPR
so it's like it's a thing that many
companies do Google is one of them it
stands for objective and key results
which is management speaks for goals and
so every quarter we like write this down
or at least every year and we kind of
really think hard about the things we
should do and then we try to execute on
them and so we thought it would be like
the best thing to just say why don't we
like present our okrs to the the group
of all of you and the goal is really to
kind of give a good overview so the real
list is kind of long so well kind of
short a little bit but we really want to
be like super transparent and again the
way this kind of works is you know we
had it in the panel you know who's
working the open source project and so
so so my team is doing it full-time
obviously so our goals are very
important for the direction of em
because in the end you know that's the
code that's being written is driving
stuff forward and so our first goal for
for this years is that users love em yes
just as simple as that we want you know
our okay ours begin with end users we
want all users to love amp so what's
going on there well there are a couple
ways to approach this one is to think
about you know is the page doing what
the user wants it to do is that a
pleasing experience and then of course
there's is the page like visually
pleasing and and and nice to consume so
let's start with that second one so you
heard earlier today that we we launched
a project called amp start and so this
is the beginning of a pretty serious
investment on our part we wanted a place
where you could go and quickly be up and
running with some nicely styled amp
pages and we have a bunch of different
full page templates and you know one of
the tricks is when you're getting into
amp you have to learn like okay there's
some CSS restrictions there's various
like format restrictions and so this is
a way to get something nice that you can
start from and then you can just slowly
add bits to the page based on those
capabilities and yes they're responsive
too so you know because all developers
of amps should be increasingly be taking
advantage of the fact that amp supports
responsive design and so you should
build pages that look
not only on small smartphones but also
on large desktops and so the fact that
these responsive templates you know we
we want to basically sum that out of
those message like you should be
thinking increasingly about how do you
make sure that these pages look good on
all screen sizes and so amp start really
joins a lineup of one other resource we
have which is amp by example and which
has been out for a year so if amp I
examples where you had to figure out you
know how do I get something done in amp
you've heard a lot of cool talks today
where people have kind of given some
insight into some of the tricks you can
do with with using components and
perhaps unexpected ways well then amp
start is a place you can go to ensure
that the new experience is your building
or looking great out of the gate we're
also planning to work with CMS providers
over the coming years you know and with
this project finally out so that anyone
who wants to use amp start as a baseline
for templates or to offer template
choice for the users can go ahead and
take advantage of that
so more stuff so you heard you know
earlier today we had enemy with with
animation so you know some of the
investments were starting to do are to
make you know just the on page
experience much nicer at the small
touches so we're adding support for
things like parallax effects and
generally like scroll bound sort of
events that you can add your pages you
also heard more about the things we're
doing with with images so we have a you
know plans to upgrade the the way you
can handle the carousels and the light
boxes so that you can expose thumbnails
and and really make that a much better
experience and also we have some plans
around improving video we'd like to do
more with the interactions with video
and of course we've heard a lot of
feedback around video analytics and we
want to do some more things there and
then one last thing to really call out
is you know so responsive design is
supported in amp and you've heard that
just now and in the talks earlier and we
want to make sure that everyone's aware
that you can also you know be thinking
about building a PWA with amp and so
alex has a great talk coming up tomorrow
which you should check out and and you
know this is is something that really
puts folks on a path toward building
pages canonically an amp which is
something we'd love to see happening
more and if you're interested in this
you know I bet there's there's some bits
- you know launching a canonical
experience in amp that we haven't even
sort of uncovered yet you heard a lot
about the experience around
the end project at org site itself is a
canonical amp so get in touch with us if
you're if you're kind of going down this
road because we think it's an important
one for everybody to be taking into
consideration right our next key result
is that we want amps time to first
contentful paint
so that's the first paint of the page
that somehow makes sense that in the new
sense would for example show you the the
text across the search corpus so that
means coming from search Google search
is reduced to a median of 400
milliseconds right now it's about 700
800 900 milliseconds so this would be
roughly a doubling in speed and that's
not counting free rendering which is
makes this instance so we would we
really want to be under under one second
and so there's actually two big things
we're planning to do that we hope will
put push us over this finish line
the first one is so-called foreign fetch
serviceworker now who here knows what
this serviceworker is almost everyone
awesome so here's a graphic actually
mariko trolly you should check out a
torture their feet for more of these
which is basically it's just explaining
a small aspect of how service requests
work they can do all these magic things
with like notifications blah blah but
they they have one core features which
is to act as this kind of cache that
sits between the you know the user and
the network so that you can always
respond from the serviceworker even if
your network is offline or you like on
the wrong planet so that's kind of a
baseline and and the way this works
which isn't even that intuitive is the
serviceworker belongs to the website and
now your typical website would talk to
like all these i mean to your own server
to maybe your other server and to 5cd
ends right but the caching is really per
website so if say you load react from
like JavaScript CDN and
he was catching a serviceworker it'll be
in your cache on the other side caches
the same resource from the same URL
it'll again be in their serviceworker if
they have one right so foreign fetch
kind of turns this around so we're each
CDN can have their own serviceworker and
this is nicer because for I mean the
other one is very important because it
can request reply to your main request
but this allows very nice well like
great control caching across all these
students right and this is a feature
coming to Chrome as we speak and in the
concrete case for 4 amp it means that we
basically have the serviceworker sitting
on the domain that delivers our
JavaScript and all the amp pages talk to
it right so there's a single web service
worker that's shared across every single
and page on the internet and we have one
very simple goal which is to never ever
again fetch any amp JavaScript from the
network asterisk like within the
critical path of the user requests
that's the basically I'll promise that
whenever you live in temptation it says
I want this JavaScript it never has to
go to the network to this it always
comes from the local device so what does
this serviceworker do it has two primary
things actually it's pretty simple
except it's entirely complicated which
we'll talk about IO is it's it's not
easy but like so one of the things that
we're doing on the am cache so you've
heard like sometimes the n cache is much
faster than the the origin website so in
other things the I'm cache is doing is
its rewriting the drama script URLs so
the one that you have to put on your
page the between 0s which we by the way
shouldn't have called v-0 dodges has a
relatively short cache time because we
kind of have to be able to push new
releases and it's always the same rial
so it cannot have the very long cache
time so when you surf from the cache we
rewrite that URL to be a specific
release and so that lower URL can be
cached forever because whenever we
actually have a new release that
y'all just gonna just going to change
right and so the first thing that
service worker is doing is it's doing
this particular rewrite of the URL on
the client side and that means that this
optimization which so far only applied
for amp sir from the M cache now applies
to every M page serve from your own
origin which i think is really nice
there is however one problem with the
scheme which maybe is only a small
problem but it's a problem but you know
we try to push once a week and so
because you know next week there's a new
release ID you know release hash and so
as a user if you for example you're 70
active amp user you have at least one in
quotes bad experience per week because
we pushed you don't have the new release
and your cache so you get a cold cash it
which is very sad right and so the
service worker does something which in a
way is very different from how the WEP
usually works but I think it's quite
awesome so here's the dialogue so the
you know the page says I would like to
have amberleigh's and and then the
service worker will just say well I
don't have it I'll just give you the
last one even though you asked for
something else and so what that means is
that the service worker even though it
might not have the version that the user
once it can always give them the version
that it has hopefully from from a week
before and then what I will do is in the
background it will fetch the new release
so that when you look at the next m page
you get the fresh version but for that
transition period you can you always get
whatever you have on your device and so
together you get the the promise which
is that the fetching that JavaScript is
never in the curl capacitor rendering
the page all right so that's the first
one the second one is server-side
rendering on the am cache so to
understand what this is we have to look
at the flow what is actually happening
in the browser when you load an EM page
obviously the road has to load the page
like there's really no way around this
and then you've probably all put like a
little DM boilerplate Java SE is ass
into your page
its main function is that it makes the
page be basically blank be a white page
and then M JavaScript loads and the M
JavaScript inserts a bunch of CSS in the
page basically like the main styling for
like how am pitch looks get the CSS for
this all those you know those layout
attributes in place and yeah and then
finally it goes and that's what we call
bootstraps the web components so for
example you might have seen that stuff
like amp YouTube can like reserved the
box even though we don't yet have
downloaded am YouTube extension that's
one of the things we do but that's this
like reserving the box part of the
equation that's being done throwing page
boot and then finally when now that's
done we show the page so we undo that
first step where with a bar that played
hit the page and all the phases work
it'll take some time it can take around
200 to 400 milliseconds on a shitty
phone so we'd like to not do it so the
the again that the main work here is
really this part it's the hard part so
going from web component to the HTML
that you need to actually draw what the
what the user expect and for example
you've probably all put like layout
responsive on the element what it does
it creates the HTML for this crazy hack
for responsive images which physically
puts in a diff that has like a heading
that's a percentage that's based on the
you know aspect ratio something you
hopefully have never done before but
like that's that's what it does and when
we what we are going to do is we go to
server-side render this and it means
they all go away in particular you know
first of all we can like kill that first
step we can kill the boilerplate because
if you do all the others we don't have
to do it anymore
we still need to load em JavaScript but
it no longer blocks showing the page
because its primary function
it's being on the server we are just
going to insert that em built-in
JavaScript on the server side and then
we'll go and implement all the stuff
that we have done in JavaScript in our
serving stack that's the most important
part the bootstrap part and obviously
that last step of showing the page is no
longer needed because we literally did
never hide it right and so loading em
pages becomes this which as you see cut
out five steps which and and in
particular drives down the the load time
to ideally only exactly want to request
CSS online there's no JavaScript at all
in the critical path right
let me quickly address this there was a
question on the panel actually about
fonts so fonts would still be in the
critical path but there are a mortised
constant time if any money word for it
never takes more than three seconds
empezÃ³ is a nice trick in it if you
have a link tag for external fonts we
will kill that link tech after three
second wait for the page to draw and put
it back in so you get the same effect of
flash of unstyled text that you would
get after the timeout just a little
aside alright a little technical
excursion but I think this is super
exciting I'm excited for this to launch
cool
think about this so so next up
continuing on the main objective which
is we want users to love am as as I
think many of you sort of heard today
one of the next frontiers for amp is
e-commerce so alright specifically our
goal is that we want to drive you know
broader ecommerce site adoption and
platform adoption so you know that's a
really big goal for this year and and
one of the you know things that you saw
in the talks was that we're building
features that are hopefully you know
really gonna help address these use
cases when we started thinking about
e-commerce and and and you know
companies like eBay and we go have been
super helpful in terms of helping us
sort of frame this thinking learn more
about the use cases we realized that you
know there's a lot of things that
possibly are supported in certain
e-commerce flows but then you turn to a
different kind of page type like a
product detail page and the
things that just aren't supported so
features like can't bind are sort of an
answer to that very general sort of
usage but it really helps nail this kind
of canonical use case where you have
color pickers and you have an inventory
restriction and sizing and you want to
be able to offer that sort of light to
medium weight configuration on the page
so we're super thrilled about that and
you heard much more about that in Wills
talk and so in find is coming soon we'd
love to get your feedback on it as we
proceed and we think that's going to be
really important to solving a lot of the
kinds of e-commerce use cases we heard
about and yet that's still not going to
leave us with having solved all of them
so here's just a sampling of some of the
other things you know that you might
expect to be on the list things like
search autocomplete or or which are ways
to customize the forms of course
ecommerce analytics tracking we have a
pretty robust analytics package and amp
today but when you pivot and start
thinking about e-commerce there's yet
another you know set of new things that
you need to be thinking about and
including things up to like real-time or
new modal affordances so really all over
the map but amp bind really solves a
good chunk of ones that are kind of
similarly defined and then there's a
whole host of others that are kind of on
our punch lists and we're gonna start
working through so next up I want to
move on to our next objective which is
advertising on iam so advertising is
obviously very critical it got like an
applause like just earlier and I was
talking about it briefly it's something
we've been thinking about from the start
you know when we launched the developer
preview for amp we had support for for
advertising and you know it's one of the
biggest things we focused on and because
of that we have over 100 or so ad
networks who have now integrated with
the project which offers trace to
publishers who want to integrate ads and
amp we've also done a lot of innovation
on the format and you got all of this
and by that I mean like in terms of the
different sort of ad formats that you
can apply and so all of this you know is
still happening in the context of a
legacy sort of ads ecosystem and one of
the first things we noticed when we were
you know observing the first amp pages
out in the wild is you do have a
blazingly fast page that loaded almost
instantly and then you'd have like blink
boxes and you're like okay what is this
thing and what it is generally is an ad
that is still taking its sweet time to
load and maybe by the time it's loaded
the users already scrolled past it so
that's really good for nobody it's not
good for publishers it's not good for
Kaiser's and so going forward with amp
we think there's a really cool
opportunity to just say what if we took
the amp format and all of the security
and performance gains that we've
achieved with it and start applying it
toward building add creative and so that
really factors into our OKR which is
specifically unbreak display advertising
on the web and so that you know that's
gonna be our next big effort or
involving ads throughout this year and
so you hear you may have heard a lot
about amp ads and you'll be hearing more
about it going forward but it's really
to take the m-spec a subset of it and
allow for the construction of ad
creative ad creative that'll be more
performant can cooperate with the rest
of an amp page if it's loaded in an amp
page but these ad ads can also be loaded
inside of 90 amp pages where they'll
still carry with them the the speed
improvements that everybody knows from
the amp format and so Malte is gonna
dive deeper into our specific goals
around driving this throughout the year
right so then the next goal I think is
think about so one of the rules about
okay artists they're supposed to be
really ambitious I think this definitely
falls in this category so our goal is
that the battery consumption at frame
rate of an M page with a pets is better
or equivalent and the same page load
with an ad blocker so we really want to
be able to say why are using an app
Locker and if you say because excuse
battery and they make me not be able to
stroll and we want to say this is not
changing with amp ads you you know these
problems are just going to go away and
the most awesome thing about this goal
is it actually allows us to use M
parameters in AB
so and this is not a joke so we have a
test lab that has devices running and
they have their power supply replaced so
that you can measure exactly the energy
consumption that's happening during
their work and so you can actually you
know test these things so this is
happening I'm really excited about it so
the work we're actually doing is so we
were introducing animations framework
that's in particular important obviously
for 4s because they like to animate
stuff there's work to enable third
parties to collect spam signals that
kind of thing
I think the the most important way how
to get energy savings is currently ads
often any made when they're not on
screen which wastes a lot of energy so
cutting that out will be very important
and obviously we're doing other stuff
like ensuring that animations actually
happen the GPU which uses less battery
than the CPU all these kind of things
there's a session tomorrow at 1:30 that
kind of goes more and more in depth into
what this actually means cool then the
next objective is a bit different but
it's very important for me like in my
role as a tech lead that I find very
important that we keep em healthy so
you've seen how we went from something
that was designed for news to adopt more
and more use cases so it's apparently
even capable of building a messaging app
and so the requirements change and that
means that the framework has to change
because we couldn't anticipate all the
things how how it should be so we're
doing a few things our goal is that all
performance regressions that we have are
caught before we fully roll out releases
we're not there yet but again this is
these are goals there's Justin D Miami
kind of we were supposed to be happy I
had to fight for this key result because
physically it's like all the others are
like measurable you know I'm sorry about
like how you actually objectify that
this is happening
so this is but again this is a purely
subjective thing we want to be happy
with our framework and when we not we
say okay you know stuff each development
we're going to make changes that enable
us to actually you know do the thing we
want to do and then we're obviously
investing a lot in working and making
work on end productive finally and most
importantly all of you are obviously
very important we want developers to
really love em and we're doing a few
things to do this one of the most
important one is documentation so our
goal again is to make em be the best
documented JavaScript library out there
we would definitely and absolutely love
to have your feedback of where it's not
and then we would like to fix it we have
people like dedicated on this working on
it and they just in all the other places
we really are driven by what what people
want some of the things we have done is
we've translated into 13 languages and
again if there's one thing that you
think would be important we be happy to
prioritize it not always like it's not
our like Doc's site but I think the the
best way to really get started with amp
on a on opponent on the mark-up level as
my example
so these annotated code examples really
allow you to understand how things work
and have the the visual feedback
together with a code and we're continue
to work on this like rolling from this
is how you make an image on your page to
going way more in depth and having more
complex examples on this on this side
and then finally Paul is starting a
video series called amplify that is
going to be on the YouTube channel
together with you know the videos from
this conference again next topic I think
is super important which is one of the
interesting things about amp is that
you're all working with JavaScript that
is you know just on this server and you
don't really know what's coming back
and this you know crazy team is shipping
new versions every week and that you
know if you ship a new version of your
dependency to your site it might break
it right so but our clear goal is to not
unintentionally ship breaking changes
this year we so the unintentionally is
there intentionally so we sometimes have
strong opinions about stuff and are
willing to to make breaking changes one
of one example that we didn't have here
is that we now have ad placeholder which
is technically a breaking change where
think everyone's happy with them but we
obviously need to know when something
we've done has unintended side effects
so the main thing we are investing in is
visual dipping so we're are going to at
scale render not completely
insignificant subset of all your pages
with version N and version n plus one of
em and just see if there's anything
different and then use that to judge
whether we maybe did something that
where we didn't anticipate that it would
break any pages and you know which would
be for something we edits like some CSS
and some of your pages you know needed
something else stuff like so that's I
think it's gonna be very very helpful in
in making a more stable even further we
really really would like to have more
external regular contributors on github
we I think have an extraordinary high
number of contributors 300 is what we
broke through like last week we just I
mean absolutely amazing and humbling and
thank you for that but what we were
aiming for is having more people
regularly contribute in the process Paul
was speaking earlier about some of the
things we've been doing so first of all
we've really really invested in making
our contribution doc so not the the docs
that explain how use and but the docs
that explain how you work on amp make
them really welcoming and really easy to
follow we have
we're working on having great first
issues so this is something we had for a
while but we realized we have to do much
better with this so each of these issue
will explain all the steps you need to
do from A to B the CSD to fix that
problem so we'll like on purpose not fix
it so we can have one of you do it so
you have you can get your feet wet
working a nap so I think this has been
really nice and then finally we we're
doing these weekly design reviews or
basically anyone from the community can
come and say I would like to make this
change to em or I would like to do X and
this is my plan what do you what do you
guys think about it and so we've been
doing these for a while in our team and
at some point we said like why don't we
just like it son hang out anyway since
we're like distributed across the United
States why don't we why don't we open it
up and have everyone participate which
doing this like three times I think and
and it was really well received and
worked really well in it we had great
input from from the community final
point hoping is it's working we're
hoping for am calm to be a smashing
success you know see how this is going
to work out but I think I mean I've been
actually really really happy with this
so anything the talk quality was really
really high this venue is amazing so
opening of that works yeah we have one
last thing which is one of the reasons
why we've been doing this event is last
year at Google i/o many of the
developers on the M team we're just
hanging out and answering question and
we realized like how nice this works to
get feedback into the team because it's
sometimes hard to get you know have
empathy with developers who are working
not you know on amp but with them and so
I would like to invite my team on stage
because so you can see them all and I
checked with them so come on I think
it's yeah let's give them a round of us
it's it's not quite everyone there was
some babies on the way and stuff like
that but it's most of them so yeah if
you if you find any of these fine people
like feel free to check them up I think
it's it's very interesting in the am is
entirely built on web technology so all
of us are web developers we have exactly
the same problems as you all like we
think about these same things with the
same blocks I think there's a lot of
stuff to discuss yeah that's right
that's all we have thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
