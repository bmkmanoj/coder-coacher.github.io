lead publisher marketing at Google what
that really means is I have publishers
make money with ads that they can fund
their content and today I want to tell
you why I love my job I love ads there's
a lot of Snickers in the room right now
probably a lot of you have blockers
installed but truly deeply I love ads I
remember even as a child I used to look
forward to watching the latest
commercials from Cadbury's and Pepsi on
TV just as much as I look forward to
watching Mickey Mouse and ducktales on
Sunday mornings so when the time came to
make a choice I decided to start my
career working at a creative agency in
advertising and it was a lot of fun I
mean think about the intellectual
challenge of figuring out ways that a
really compelling story that people
would want to relate with in a 30-second
commercial even harder to do that when
you're faced with a fixed rectangle
whether that's in a newspaper on a
computer screen or today on a mobile
device but that intellectual challenge
is not the only reason why I love ads
I'll have free access to content you
know I like not being NPR for the daily
news I love getting to go to tumblr and
see what happens in adop's absolutely
for free and all of that is only
possible because advertising is a
lifeblood of the Internet this free
exchange of ideas that we love about the
web all the content out there is in part
of not entirely funded by ads by
advertising that said I do have to face
one real fact and that is that ad
experiences particularly on the mobile
web are really really bad I mean let's
face it you clicked on an article on
your phone today and that's a blank
white screen at the top of the page
because the ad is still loading and once
the ad loads the content jumps around
the screen a little
it and when the content finally is in a
place where you can find it or if they
add is something that you can engage
with you click through to a landing page
that takes absolutely forever to load
these bad ad experiences is why what I
said earlier about loving advertising
that makes it seem so incredulous right
ads are important it's the experiences
that are bad and that need to be fixed
in order to ensure that the free
exchange of ideas the free access to
content that we love about the Internet
continues to exist that's why when we
click start at the amp project we
realize that we couldn't fix the web if
we didn't fix the ads that went on it
and while many of our initial efforts
were actually focused on ensuring that
the existing advertising technologies
out there worked on amp pages we knew we
had to do more and we knew that we could
do better so in parallel we launched the
amp ads initiative what is this
initiative it's about applying the
principles of amp and the amp framework
to make advertising on the web something
that's faster better something that you
don't mind engaging with absolutely at
all it's changing the foundation of
digital advertising by shifting the way
people build deliver and measure ads so
how does it work and what's the magic
sauce behind it to talk of this very
thing I would love to now call onstage
bomb Z Jesse who's the amp ads lead
thank you how many hi everyone my name
is MC Jesse I am the PM for advertising
mm thanks for being here
so as the AMA mentioned unfortunately
our industry is tiled up the knob 2:11
there is an amp in the picture I hope
you get it anyway let's look at some of
the common problems with ads first one
is excessive drain on battery and CPU
some battle badly authored ads typically
take up too many resources that don't
end up leaving enough resources for
rendering the primary content for the
user to actually consume their
experiences some value tests have shown
that ads can drain your phone's battery
up to twice as much in a two-hour
session depending on the type of AD why
don't we play a quick game anyone who
can read the next three sentences are
going to come up stage wins a free
coffee energy shirt ready
okay anybody get that this is pretty
much the worst thing in the internet
just when you're about to deeply engage
with the content Wham and that comes
shows up and you know pretty much
disturbs you from your experience this
is not great this generates great high
view ability but this is definitely not
the perfect way of generating that high
view ability and I think we can do a
better job and finally the
unpredictability of an ad click it's
always a gamble what happens next you
know is the click going to open it in a
new browser window is it going to be a
top-level redirect or is the next click
going to send me to a landing page which
they're going to install malware on my
desktop or mobile page and that's not
great and it always keeps things
interesting though so with the amp ads
initiative we're building a user
experience first at the ecosystem what
do I mean by that and it's just jargon
speak for saying that we're going to
make ads do whatever you whatever a
reasonable user would expect them to do
so how are we going to do this by fixing
the biggest mistake of display
advertising and that is when the
publisher said I want you to put an ad
on my page basically the publishers
allowed people to or advertisers or
whoever it is in this case you can run
arbitrary JavaScript on my pages this is
a huge problem because the third-party
JavaScript has full rein on whatever it
wants to do with the rest of the page
and again taking away from consuming the
primary experience for the user
I bet most of us wonder what if there
was a game combined with Super Mario
Brothers and Contra like you do what if
we never allowed third-party JavaScript
ads to run on publisher pages and that's
exactly what we're trying to do with amp
ads so what is an amp add an app that is
just a type of an app the format spec is
a subset of the original amp spec the
key there's two key differences the
first one is the top level tag has to
have an amp for ads tag in it and the
runtime is slightly different instead of
including amp user asu's amp for ads v-0
GS right now they're identical but in
the future we actually plan to do a
bunch of
optimizations that are very specific for
the ads and that's it the ad formats
back itself is a bit more restrictive
for example we don't allow amp iframes
and the reason for that is we don't want
to embed sort of arbitrary third-party
JavaScript as part of amp iframe but you
get the point we want to make sure we're
able to essentially control the entire
end-to-end experience so how does how
does one get an amp ad on to the web
page so what we've been talking about
move for the most part is on the left
you know a publisher has an amp page
they run it through the validator and
you know the ad is on on the on the
mobile device similar to that on the amp
ad side the creative developer usually
creates and creates an ad similar using
the similar spec and runs it through and
this is the important part they have to
have it validated using a proper sort of
signing service typically you can do
that with an ad server double-click for
example is announced supporting they're
going to do that Cloud Player for
example is a huge supporter and going to
sign creatives as well and once the ad
is signed invalid it's delivered to an
amp page and therefore combining sort of
the amp page and an amp and an app pad
on an app page combination so now that
we have amp ads what are the type of
problems we can solve with this I'd like
to talk about three buckets of issues
the first one is the asymmetric
incentives problem the way I describe it
it is when two different parties work on
the same problem but the incentives are
not aligned in that one of the parties
is more incentivized to do a lot more
work than the other and this this shows
up perfectly in in a case where
publisher is or advertisers putting a
creative on a publisher page so
typically the publisher cares about the
first performance and they're like
telling the advertiser or creative
agency saying hey make sure to follow
creatives are performant and the ad
developers like yeah sure but there's no
way to actually measure what performance
is is because it's kind of context less
the advantage of the amp standard is
that once the ad is created Eve in amp
even the ninetieth
of the slowest creative can perform much
better than normal standards so in this
particular case new times can actually
simply tell the app developer or the
advertiser saying you know what just
give me and I'm creative and the app
developer doesn't have to care all they
have to do is build a creative that they
need make sure it validates run it
through the validator and if it runs
it's there kind of for know for sure
that it's always going to be performant
and that that's how we're pretty much
try this sort of publisher being able to
request a standard performant creative
and the advertisers are being able to
deliver it next up we have a similar
problem with third parties the third
part of the issue is the third-party
tags on regular creatives is that you
know there's no sort of orchestration so
for a good example is viewability VOD is
important it what allows display
advertising to be much more effective in
print advertising because you can
actually say that a person viewed an ad
impression versus in non digital
advertising you can't be sure about that
the problem though would with
viewability and the way it's measured
today is you know typically a publisher
has a viewability script a third-party
javascript and the advertiser puts one
because they don't trust the publisher
and the publisher doesn't trust the
advertiser and then there's usually an
ad server has their own implementation
for viewability
and then there's probably a media
ratings agency who wants to have sort of
an industry-wide way of saying what the
viewability on a certain publisher pages
so they have their own tags so finally
you have like these four JavaScript tags
doing very similar things asking for the
same resources but really not
coordinated in those asks and the one
that's ultimately suffering here is the
publisher again we've already solved
this in amp it's called amp analytics
and using app analytics we can collect
all of the viewability information
signals and distribute to them to any
member of endpoints as necessary the
cost of adding an endpoint does not
increase linearly the second bucket of
problem is the malicious intent problem
malware riddens ad ads are you know a
huge problem in the publisher industry
it's very hard
to argue with someone when they say that
oh yeah I don't I don't actually like
ads because they install more where I
mean that that's pretty reasonable with
the sign amp ad we know exactly what's
in the ad and therefore it can be a
problem anymore
another huge consequence of getting rid
of JavaScript that we talked about
previously wouldn't be great if the
publisher simply said yep my side cannot
install malware for the advertisers
that's that's huge you know their brand
is safe and they're able to advertise it
with that particular publisher also if
you've ever experienced this which is
pretty annoying Auto redirect ads with
amped since there's no custom JavaScript
being embeddable Auto redirects are not
possible at all
the last ones my favorite which we refer
to as the coordination problem when I
think of a browser scheduling and
rendering of pages this is what comes to
mind so there's no sense of priority
between the different things that are
happening being requested from the
browser and as you can tell no one's
dying but things could be much less
chaotic right with them when an ad is
served to an app page the amp page can
orchestrate the entire user experience
since amp is opinionated about what's
important to the user and pretty much
gives preference to the content instead
of the ad really amp can orchestrate the
end-to-end experience of what the user
would prefer to see depending on
resource constrained constraints or
battery availability now let's talk
about animations for a sec add
animations are what allow ads to sort of
have a you know very a punchline based
advertising messaging if you will for
example when a car is subtly appears in
an ad or the text appears later than
when the car appears that that's kind of
what we talk about when we say allow the
creative developers to being able to
create sort of beautiful ads one of the
issues that exists with animations today
is the page actually has no relation or
even knowledge about the animations that
are run on the page
so it's not uncommon to have an
animation run when it is way below the
viewport and therefore you know even
when there's like bandwidth constraints
for example there's just pure wastage
we'll be launching an amp animations
framework soon which allows ad
developers to create beautiful timeline
based animations amp can selectively
start and stop depending on whether the
user is currently viewing a certain ad
or even pause an animation when it
realizes that there's too many resources
being allocated to the animation versus
painting content on the page
and finally simple since amp always
gives the priority of things you know to
give the end user a great experience
with proper orchestration amp can also
eject elements when it realizes that a
certain pages stuttering now we've
talked a lot about publishers so far and
and why it would be a no-brainer for a
publisher to adopt amp ads and and and
we hope sometime in the future the
publishers would simply say yep the only
thing that I'm putting on my page are
amp ads but we're not there yet but we
also should talk about what's in it for
the advertiser so let's talk about some
things that are important from an
advertiser perspective first being
monetization so a few months back triple
live became the first non Google ad
network to deliver amp ads in
collaboration with CloudFlare they were
able to sign the amp ads and actually
deliver them as Matthew discussed in the
talk today and you've seen this demo
before but why don't we watch through it
again because the difference is kind of
pretty stark on the left is amp ads and
they write as regular ads as you can
tell the the difference is kind of
incredible the ads on the Left load 6x
faster 3x lighter and are 13% more
viewable it's also 13% more driving more
CTR and eCPMs
for triple lift when deliver on timings
properties which kind of makes sense
right like if you have an ad and it
doesn't even appear before the user
Scrolls by obviously the viewability is
going to be lower
obviously the clip the rates is gonna be
much lower and our idea is you know
let's make performing creatives which
end up showing on the page but also they
don't impact so the rest of the user
experience so another angle we wanted to
talk about is you know it's it's not
about just boxes and banners how do how
do you enable a brand tell an amazing
story so we wanted to make sure when we
announced the amp spec for ads that it
was pretty allows people to innovate a
lot of creative developers to innovate
based on that so based on that cell Tara
took the amp ads back and built a bunch
of amazing looking creatives when we
look at one subtle animations ability to
interact and a way to tell the story
beautifully
so I'm pads will work not just on amp
pages but everywhere on the web so they
can work on other mobile web devices
which are non am they can also work on
desktop pages and that's what we're
really excited about even just solving
you know the ads problem for amp pages
is amazing but as you probably know
there's a lot more naanum pages than am
pages in the world today and if we can
actually fix the ads in non em pages
serving amp ads to them I think we would
have accomplished a lot last but not
least amp landing pages so when the
landing page embedded is embedded with a
NAB ad which is written in amp we can do
intelligent things like prefetching and
pre-rendering wonder why the ease down
there anyway the best part is the
landing page can be triggered with with
zero redirect clicks what I mean by that
is if M knows that the landing page
itself is written in that written in amp
as well it can get rid of the click
redirect and make the click redirect
asynchronously because we can trust that
the landing page that the user is going
to is a you know a trusted domain and
delivers from the CloudFlare cash or am
cash so why don't we look at this in
action
okay let's try that again
trust me it's just really fast you
couldn't even see it anyway in summary
here's how the waste products from the
app vanish iPads initiatives look so we
talked about app ads where you have the
ability to deliver sort of ads created
in the am formats back and deliver them
to amp pages amp add embeds where you
create an amp ad but you're able to
deliver to anywhere else on the web the
regular mobile web or desktop and
finally the ad landed landing pages
where you're able to click on the
landing page and the landing page itself
is in amp and therefore we are able to
eliminate things like redirects and
prefetch in pre-k a preload the landing
page the beauty of this solution is they
all work independent of each other so
you as a publisher or an advertiser an
advert company can use each of these
technologies but we think the the
experience will be incredible once you
combine all of these in sort of a single
system so I think it's time we
standardized right this is the marketing
technology landscape from 2016 I can I
can't even begin where to start
the ad sixth I could not take the system
is a complex one there's a lot of
players in the ad industry and whether
we like it or not
ads kind of the lifeblood of the
internet what we all agree though is
that we need to work together to fix the
existing bad ads that are prevalent in
the system the good news is you can help
we've been working with a number of you
on the publisher advertiser and the ad
tech side to see how we can accelerate
Ampat adoption the momentum is
incredible we've been working with
triple lifts CloudFlare CELTA google
double-click is a huge supporter and
many more joining the effort every
single day so I hope you would come join
us in implementing respect for fixing
the display ad system thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
