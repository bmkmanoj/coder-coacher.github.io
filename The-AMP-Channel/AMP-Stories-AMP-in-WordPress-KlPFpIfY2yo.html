expectations for how content works right
and that long from article might not
always be the right choice and that's
why we're introducing em stories so if
I'm a developer I want to make an app
story how do I do it
amp stories are an extension to amp so
first you'll import the M story
JavaScript and then just add an amp
story tag to your page amp story has a
hierarchy where within an M story tag
you'll create multiple amp story pages
within each page there are multiple
layers that are stacked back to front
and then shown on top of one another to
create the desired visual design you can
have one layer in the back that just has
a video that's playing just to be just
sort of a background rich media asset to
just make the visuals kind of pump and
then on top of that you can have for
example say text so you might want to
have like a a portrait that somebody
said you want to have an animation
running that adds to the visual effects
and you can sort of again mix and match
and combine these things to create the
visual layout of your story so I'm
curious our how is the format developed
for stories so for stories basically we
established this partners engagement
program we worked with eight bundles
from the music system to develop
together a format for visual
storytelling on mode so stories began
with snapchat Facebook has stories now
what's the use of stories in this case
why do we need more stories out there I
think a the goal here is really to have
stories available in the open web
ecosystem so not necessarily only
available in closed platforms where you
have to basically sign in and that to
access the content we want the gun to be
potentially available on any site
discoverable on the open web anyone can
then in addition embed the content in a
in a in a platform like Facebook or
snapchat that the content is still
sourced from the origin publisher so
it's still from for example CNN or
Washington Post so basically it
maintains the key aspects of the open
web one key aspect of us am stories is
that they're just regular web pages that
adheres to D am forma and so you just
need to produce these stories put them
on your site and then Google search
engine will just discover them and the
stand on search at this time because if
we are in a developer preview you will
only see the stories in is the developer
preview environment which is the GOM
stories link that we've been sharing so
it reviews these stories you will see
them going to G dot slash charm stories
WordPress is a large part of the web and
it's now easier than ever to use amp
with WordPress
this is Alberto Medina from Google and
Alberto what are you working on over
here what is all this stuff so we have
been working on innovations who make all
experiences in WordPress so a world in
which basically users can just have
their site activate the plugin and half
a full WordPress XP and experience in
WordPress so we started collaborating
with automatic like mid last year and we
with the goal of advancing the blogging
the unplugging the day pioneered to
adopt a scale and so automatic did this
plug it in the first place
can you say more about the plugins
history and how it came to exist and
your involvement with the project now
yeah so we we care about the future the
web you know and we want to democratize
publishing that's that's what we're here
for and so things like amp that make the
web more accessible and and improve
performance for users the user
experience is really important to us so
that's why we got involved with Google
and with workers convey IP we look after
some of the the biggest enterprise work
by supplicate applications on the web
and our focus on those is performance
and security and amp delivering amp for
people helps us to help our clients to
deliver performant WordPress
applications at scale so what's possible
in WordPress now so until today only
some of the or mainly the articles were
converted to amp with the WordPress em
plug-in and that was released through
the paid mod which which for the users
they had a completely different visual
experience between the non-m version and
the amp version that was mainly caused
because some of the WordPress components
weren't aim valid and with 0.7 all
WordPress components are now AM valid
and that opened the doors for Native em
in WordPress in other words now users
can have only one version of the
websites which is the native amp version
and native amp experience so there's no
longer a need for a pain mode and two
versions and what's coming in the future
for this project we're version 0.7
what's gonna be a version of 0.8 and
beyond because WordPress allows you to
do absolutely anything amp enforces
certain best practices for how a
wordpress theme can be designed and in
the kinds of things that I WordPress
theme can output so with those that base
line of best practices in place that
opens the door for us to introduce
things like progressive web apps and to
do the kind of offline caching
experiences that really make a website
much more engaging to close I would like
to say that the development of amp in
WordPress with the am plugin has come a
long way since we have been working in
this project with together the plugins
available today and github so please
download it and test it and file issues
and tell us what you need let's make amp
in WordPress awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
