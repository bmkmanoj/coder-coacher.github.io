having a fantastic time at Google i/o
we're super excited to talk to you today
only because only the most dedicated
developer audience will show up for a
talk at 8:30 a.m. on ads but in all
seriousness we have some exciting stuff
to share with you today so thank you for
being here I want to start by telling
you a story I grew up in South of India
where access to the Internet and
Technology was considered a luxury I
believe that student growing up but once
I reach college I was pretty good you
know generally ranking in the firt up
five students in class so what changed
but first time in my life I had access
to the Internet and having access to
Internet allowed me to consider multiple
different sources and draw my own
conclusions instead of having to rely on
a prescribed textbook and I think this
access to free information and exchange
of free ideas is really what helped
bootstrap the internet advertising as we
know it is the lifeline of the internet
and I think it makes the internet truly
for everybody instead of just to select
for you and for businesses to put their
content online and make money off of
them today we're going to talk to you
about how we're using amp to make
advertising better on the web so I
realized that not all of you are
probably working in the ad space so I
want to just start by talking about two
definitions very simple terms so when we
refer those terms they actually make
sense for you first is a publisher a
publisher is anybody that puts content
online and when I say publisher you can
think of somebody like New York Times
and obviously publishers range from
large ones to small ones the second one
is an advertiser who generally has a
product or service offering and wants to
advertise it online and think of
somebody like coke wanting to advertise
with New York Times by showing display
ads okay with that out of the way for
those of you who haven't used em before
or looked at it before amp is an open
source framework to build really fast
pages with
very little engineering effort as you
can see in the demo it shows this was
one of the first implementations on
Google search and you can see how quick
the experiences you tap on a link and
the page appears in an instant an amp
was born out of a collaboration of a
small set of publishers of when they
felt that the experience of the mobile
web was offering was not great and they
thought they could do better and today
amp has evolved into a diverse set of
publishers with an open and sort of
collaborative approach with a bunch of
publishers advertisers attic companies
with one goal to sort of make the mobile
web much better and since launched just
eighteen months ago we've seen some
tremendous adoption we're seeing in the
search index about two billion amp
documents
spanning over 9,000 different domains an
average web page from a recent study
showed that it's an average web page
loads in about 6.9 seconds for the
search corpus we saw that Navarrete page
loads in under one second median time
for all those amp pages and all of these
numbers are just from one platform a a
number of other platforms are coming
online including Twitter Baidu LinkedIn
thing and most and a number of them that
were introduced yesterday in the amp
keynote and in ante amps year two we
want to focus going beyond just static
static content use cases so we'd like to
make sure amp works for more advanced
use cases like e-commerce retail and
travel but there's one problem the
problem is that all of these advanced
use cases generally require a ton of
interactivity on the page and we're
super happy Don's that including
yesterday at including yesterday's
keynote we've been working on a number
of features that promote interactivity
within amp
I'd like to talk about just one and
that's am find think of am bind as a
programming layer on top of M it allows
developers to define sort of a state of
an amp document based on user
interactions
this gives developers the flexibility to
sort of mix and match different amp
components and while ensuring that
developers are able to provide great
interactive experiences not worrying
about performance because the ampere in
time takes care of all of it so at the
end of the day amp is just a bunch of
web practices put together on the web
and you know which other area requires a
bunch of wear circuses that's ads and
I'd like Michael to tell you about all
the problems that are there present
today with ads on the web and how we're
using amp to fix them Michael thank you
very much hi I'm Michael clever oh thank
you I'm a software engineer at Google in
the Cambridge Massachusetts office and
my job for the last nine years has been
to try to make the ads ecosystem faster
and more efficient there have been a
bunch of improvements in the technology
of the web the web platform has really
grown recently and we try to make use of
all the most recent best practices in
the ads world just like people who write
web pages try to well today amp is a new
incredible tool that I think can really
change the landscape of what display
advertising on the web looks like so
when we started this idea of using amp
to make ads better we looked at a few
core issues that show up in today's ads
ecosystem and let me talk through three
issues I think the one of the keynotes
yesterday mention these as well so this
might sound a little familiar so the
first is disruptive user experiences and
we've all been there you're in the
middle of reading an article and then
you slam into a disruptive roadblock
which says you have to wait five seconds
before you can keep going or you're
maybe you've seen that thing where you
start reading a page and then while
you're looking at it suddenly something
shows up elsewhere on the page that
makes the texture in the middle of
reading move around from under your eyes
which is just a horrible user experience
they're trying to convince people that a
web is kind of like a book and you can
read it and then it suddenly moves while
you're trying to look at it it just
breaks the entire thing so that's those
are terrible user experiences which
we've come to think of as standard but
we would like to add to do better than
that
second thing that's a problem with ads
is that as often load slowly frequently
that is caused by heavyweight scripts
lots of heavyweight JavaScript that is
involved and sort of a poster child for
why this happens is the question of
viewability right the ability is not
something that most people outside of
ads think about but advertisers
unsurprisingly want to know whether
their ads actually got seen by the
intended audience right it influences
how much they're willing to pay to buy
some space on that web page in the
future right so it's common for
advertisers to work with a viewability
vendor that runs JavaScript inside of
the page to measure whether the ad is on
screen or how much of it is on screen
for how long but of course the publisher
also wants to know that about their own
site so they probably also have a
viewability vendor and maybe the ad
network that put things there has a
viewability vendor as well that does the
same job and the result is that there
might be a bunch of different scripts on
the page coming from different places
that are all trying to do the same basic
operation but depending on how it's
implemented it might be a relatively
heavyweight cpu-intensive thing to do
there's no coherence between these
different scripts that are performing
what's more or less the same task
there's an enormous amount of
duplication all this makes the ads
slower if I remember there's only one
JavaScript thread in a browser so if all
this stuff is making the ads slower it's
actually making the whole rest of the
page slower also so the ads are slowing
down the experience of the rest of the
page the third common issue that we hear
about a lot is that ads are not safe and
it's not news that ads create security
concerns you might have heard a horror
story from a couple of years ago where a
publisher asked people to turn off their
ad blocker for that particular site and
then when they turn the ad blocker off
they got malware installed on their
computers this is a horrible story but
the sad truth is that right now it is
very hard for the publisher to do
anything about that
because want to publish our left ads
onto their page they very often don't
know where the ads are going to come
from they leave that up to their ad
network and that ad network might end up
talking to other ad networks and the ad
itself can end up coming from a wide
variety of places and in the end we're
left with trying to solve a problem of
is it okay for content from an untrusted
source to run here is it going to do
something bad can we
trust this content that comes from an
untrusted source that is a very hard
problem I mean we try to do it certainly
but if you know there's an arms race
between people who are trying to solve
the problem of protecting everybody from
untrusted sources and people who are
trying to get malicious code to run on
your machine okay so given this set of
core issues let's talk about how we
address things in app when app first
launched 18 months ago publishers who
wanted to use app for their pages had to
rebuild their pages they had to rewrite
their pages in this new way and it would
have been an impossible task if we had
asked them to rewrite all of their ads
at the same time because remember the
ads aren't coming from the publishers
they're coming from some advertiser out
there in the world somewhere so in order
to get out amp off the ground we had to
make sure that the existing ways that
publishers use to get ads right now
still work even on amp web pages so we
did a few things that we thought struck
a good balance between end user
experience ad safety and the ability of
publishers to monetize their pages the
first thing we did was require that all
ads have a size before making the ad
request you might think that that should
only be the case for the entire web but
it's not but it is on app pages
that means that the amp runtime does not
need to wait for a response from the ad
server before it can layout the page the
way it's supposed to look for the user
if an ad server turns out to be slow you
might not see to ad you might see a
blank rectangle where the ad is supposed
to be but at least it won't cause things
to jump around later when ad is supposed
to when when the ad finally comes back
another huge positive here is that the
fact that everything needs to be laid
out in its proper place when the page
starts and can't move around later means
that you can't hit interstitials that
pop-up and cover up the content when
you're partway through second thing we
did was to separate ads from content by
putting them in a sandbox cross-domain
iframe the point here is to exclude is
to ensure that the content of the ad is
somewhat isolated from the parent page
that it's inside of browsers offer
sandbox iframe agains and prevent a
variety of types of behaviors that might
happen in
side of the add that adversely affect
the rest of the page this is something
where the web platform is growing right
now the set of things you can detect and
prevent using sandboxes keeps improving
over time as browsers add more
capabilities in some cases it's even
possible to learn that an iframe is
doing bad things like consuming too much
CPU we're slowing down the framerate
when you're trying to scroll on the page
and in those cases the app runtime could
actually destroy the iframe get rid of
the ad inside it and reclaim that
performance that the ad is dragging down
amps had frame also provides some modern
API is that not all browsers have
implemented yet things like intersection
observer so that the JavaScript inside
the ad doesn't need to do these kind of
heavy weight high intense high
computational intensity things for
determining viewability the amp runtime
knows where everything is on the screen
and it can just tell the ad where it is
as opposed to a lot of JavaScript
involved in answering that question the
third thing we did was gave ads lower
priority compared to the rest of the
contents of the page even with all the
safeguards we put in place ads to still
drag down performance once they start
running so delaying them gives the rest
of the page a chance to render properly
first we made this decision so that
content is always prioritized over
anything else on the page and user ends
up always experiencing the page like the
author of the original webpage intended
so that was all to give users a better
experience with the ads on the page but
of course the question of what did it
mean for the publishers whose pages we
were messing around with monthly go
thanks Michael so we took a number of
user experience best practices and
applied them to ads on amp but do they
actually monetize well because think
about it if a publisher that's an ad
printed web site doesn't actually make
any money or less money why would they
choose to publish amp pages and make the
mobile web better maybe they want to but
overall not everybody would do that so
we asked our friends at double-click to
tell us how amp pages were doing
compared to non M pages in terms of
publisher monetization the results were
compelling and more than 90 % of the
publishers were experiencing a higher
click-through rates on the ads over 70%
of the publisher we're seeing a higher
view
and now 70% we're seeing higher eCPMs
which translate to overall revenue so
how can pages with some restrictions on
ads actually perform better than pages
with no restriction at on ads we think
the secret sauce here is the amp pages
the fact that the amp pages load so fast
compared to a regular page the resources
that are meant to usually go to the page
instead end up with the ads helping them
load much faster compared to even though
the ads are relative to the amp page
appear to load slower in absolute terms
the ads appear much much faster than a
non amp page also publishers typically
work with a number of different ad
networks and it would it would not been
great when amp launched to say that oh
you can only use one or two different ad
networks and from day one given amps
open source DNA we wanted to ensure that
a number of different ad networks could
seamlessly participate in the amp
project so today we have a hundred
different ad networks that are supported
with an amp think about it 100 different
ad networks has spent developer
resources to commit their amp ad
extensions into the amp project and
we're super super happy with that we're
constantly launching a number of
different ads related features and we
want to ensure that all of these
features are available for all of the ad
networks that would like to implement
them and I'd like to talk about just two
features that would help with help
monetization even better for publishers
the first one is amp Auto ads so the
Adsense team at Google worked with the
amp ad project to create the amp Auto
ads framework traditionally website
developers usually have to put sort of
multiple different tags on a page to
talk about different sort of to say
where exactly the ads go and also need
to say what are the different sizes of
the ads you know this works but it's
obviously not optimal if you need to
experiment some sort of monetization set
up you need to have developer resources
which you could probably use to actually
help create greater content instead with
amp Auto ads you place a single tag and
now
since over time we'll optimize the right
setup including things like the
placement of the ad and the size of the
ad think about think of think of it as
if you're on a highway placing one
billboard and having the billboard sort
of automatically move itself to the
right location and the right size
depending on which viewers viewing it
okay that wasn't a great analogy but it
kind of helps convey the point
additionally the absence team ensured
that all of the all of the amp ads for
every Auto ads framework was available
for any ad networks to implement and the
second piece I want to talk about is the
amp
I am a video component amp is always
supported playing video ads along with
video content there's a tremendous
amount of video content that gets
generated every day online and APIs and
pages are no different so we wanted to
make it super seamless to for publishers
to monetize all of that content and
there comes in the amp ima video
component all the publisher has to do is
plug in an ad URL from an ad network and
the content URL and that's it depending
on how the configuration is done within
the ad network your ads can start to
play in the pre-roll post-roll or mid
role places and pages can monetize
because the I'm a plug-in ships with an
inbuilt video player same consistent
with amps principles of user experience
we ensure that in none of these pre
roles would actually autoplay so if you
learn more about any of these features
we do publish a public road map so
please do sign up for that so ok I think
we're in a good path for monetization of
regular ads on amp pages but I think we
can do a step function better with all
of em sort of performance capabilities
and security measures and to tell you
all about it I'd like to invite Michael
back on great thank you
okay
so what if we could fundamentally
rethink how ads themselves are built
using the app framework what if we could
make it so that the ads themselves load
as fast as the rest of the content on
the page and where as smooth for user
experience we're guaranteed to never
hurt what was going on in the rest of
the browser I mentioned a variety of ad
badness problems and what amp did to
mitigate them but that was sort of just
a band-aid what we really want is for
ads not to do bad things in the first
place right why is that so hard I mean I
mentioned the things that ads do it's
basically impossible for us to look at
JavaScript and figure out if it's going
to do something bad for performance we
try to address the sorts of issues by
requiring ads to have fixed dimensions
and serving them in sandbox cross-domain
iframes which helps ensure that the user
experience consistent with amp's
principles that offers kind of some
protection to the page that has the ad
inside it but when the ad is really bad
there's only so much that we can do to
detect that it's happening or to recover
from the fact that the ad experience is
harming the rest of the page it turns
out that amp offers a path to genuinely
solving these problems let's write the
ads themselves in amp also that's the
idea behind the amp ads effort when an
amp web page no yeah sure thanks that's
how I feel - I'm glad that you did thank
you for joining me I appreciate that um
when an amp web page knows that the ad
that disappearing inside it is also amp
it doesn't need to do things like
worrying about sandboxing or worrying
about slow running scraps or be
concerned about embedded malware things
written in amp even if their ads cannot
have bad performance that's kind of the
cornerstone of the amp is that
everything written in amp is guaranteed
to have good performance properties that
extends to ads also so it's easy to say
let's just write the ads in amp as well
but it turns out there are a lot of
technically challenging pieces to make
this work for example ads need to Saul
serve from there
domains which means that we can't rely
on a single trusted domain lame like
cDNA M project org which is what the
Google search results page uses as a way
of knowing that an ad is certainly the
knowing that a page that it shows is
certainly going to be valid up instead
we had to add a new cryptographic
signature based way for an amp page to
be sure that the ad served onto it is
valid amp as well this is already in
place double click and adsense are
experimenting with it right now
earlier this year CloudFlare launched a
new ad delivery acceleration service
Firebolt that supports the same
validation and signing flow so that's
how we serve ads and know that the ads
we serve really are amp rendering on amp
pages it's controlled by a JavaScript
runtime whose job is to harmoniously
handle the needs of all the resources on
the page so we made a way to incorporate
the ad requesting logic directly into
the amp runtime on most web pages right
now the way that ad requests are issued
is by loading an external script or
sequence of external scripts that are
served by the ad network and once you do
that you have sort of given up control
we're bundling that behavior directly
into the amp runtime so it's a code
issuing ad request is again guaranteed
to be performant and is checked into the
github repository second once the ad
response comes back we added a way to
stitch the ad response directly into the
rest of the page if the ad that comes
back really is F no cost domain I
framing or sandboxing is required and
since the ad and the page are both valid
amp neither one of them has malicious
JavaScript that is going to mess up the
other one and the same amp runtime that
harmoniously loads all the resources
together can appropriately deal with the
loading and rendering of the app content
along with the rest of the publisher
content without hurting performance
we've augmented amp with a bunch of
features that are necessary for
advertisers that are useful for writing
ads in F we've done things like visual
effects like CSS based and scroll down
animations that you might have seen
demonstrations of an earlier
cenotes we put an advanced user
interactivity features like amp thein
which Vamsi mentioned earlier in the
talk
we've also added less obvious
capabilities like analytics view ability
monitoring that I mentioned earlier
Connect protections and all the types of
invisible add tests that you don't see
on your screen but that are necessary
for an ad ecosystem to successfully
function on the web today and these
implementations are all written in
high-performance JavaScript either
written or reviewed by amp team members
so that means that they work well you
don't need to worry about animation
that's going to drag down the
performance of scrolling on your page or
that's going to keep playing even when
the ad is off-screen and chewing up CPU
and every amp ad uses the same code for
these sorts of features so the code will
already be in the browser cache for most
users if it turns out that something is
actually implemented in a way that's
inefficient then somebody will report a
bug on the github repository and
somebody will go in and fix it we'll
merge the change into the amp code base
and a week or two later every amp ad in
the world will become more efficient all
at once so we're in the middle of
launching the change that I mentioned to
move at to move the ad requesting from
add tags into the app runtime
no more GP t.j.s for double click
publishers and amp pages coming in the
near future that's a change that we can
do all by ourselves and you'll
automatically get the benefit and it's
speeding up the median time until an ad
is visible by 850 milliseconds and at
the 90th percentile for the slowest 10%
of ads it's saving around 2.7 seconds
and these numbers are just for the first
ad on the page the one that's most
likely to be visible on screen when the
page load the limits of most likely to
be above the fold and where the latency
gains the time until rendering games are
the most valuable but as I said the real
benefit here comes from making the ads
themselves and also our early tests
indicate that the median time to show an
amp ad is 1.6 seconds faster than the
time to show the non amp ad
and it's a 90th percentile that speed up
is five seconds now I have to admit I'm
sort of cheating a little with these
numbers here that's not quite a fair
comparison because we don't know how to
render all the ads in the world in amp
yeah right so the ads that we do know
how to render an amp we're actually
already a little bit faster than the
rest of them before we rewrote them in F
but half of these performance gains that
I'm talking about are because of
rewriting the ads in HTML as one example
of this efficient implementation benefit
that I was talking about we recently
conducted an experiment to measure the
impact of amp ads on the battery's phone
life on the phone's battery life
we took a hundred ads that were built
using a standard html5 canvas based
animation library and we converted them
to visually identical animated ads using
keyframes animations which were written
using the now experimental amp animation
component coming to main
non-experimental status in the near
future we let each version of each ad
load and run for 30 seconds and then we
measured how much of the phone's battery
used during that time and here is the
scatter plot every point below the line
y equals x in the middle is an ad that
use less battery after converting to amp
you can see there are a lot of points
below the line and no points above the
light so on average putting it animated
amp ad on the page through 80% less
power from the phone's battery over
those 30 seconds then that same ad
would've if it had been implemented
using canvas animations yes
so the benefits of amp ads are so huge
that I don't actually just want to put
amp ads on amp pages I want amps to
become the standard way for to write ads
for the rest of the web also that's why
we're adding the infrastructure to make
it easy to embed ads written in app on
regular HTML pages as well with their
efficient yeah if you absolutely
essentially not that much help that they
need athol render inside of cross-domain
iframes right now but not every one of
the features is available if they're
sitting inside of iframes they need a
little bit of help from a shim library
on the outside to provide a small amount
of extra functionality rolling it out
now so with their efficient JavaScript
they're dramatically smaller number of
bytes and their ability to guarantee
good behavior amp ads offer something
that is really new to wait for web page
owners to integrate fully functional ads
on to their page while retaining the
same sort of predictability and
guaranteed performance in the browser
that they would have with the page that
didn't have any ads on it at all so now
all we need to make this vision work is
for lots of people to create ads using
app
bump see great thank you Michael thank
you so we're really excited to see what
the ads ecosystem does with app ads and
I'd like to share one recent early
success story with you after
implementing their amp ads timing saw
some incredible results with with native
apps provider triple lifts so triple
lift in this particular case use
CloudFlare spiral signing service as my
as Michael mentioned before to
cryptographically sign the ads and
deliver them but before we look at the
results of how those ads perform from a
metric standpoint why don't we look at
it from a user experience standpoint so
in my next slide on your right is a
regular ad on your left is an amp ad
notice how how long it takes for the ad
on the right to load ready
man I'll let that just loop again and
that's just just incredible it take
takes feels like an eternity for the
regular at the load and of course the
chances are the users probably scroll
past the ad and the advertiser that
thing for the impression is not really
getting getting the value but worse the
publisher pages themselves appear pretty
broken there's black light rectangles
instead of where the content or the ad
needs to appear in the amp case the odds
just there and ready for the ad to be
interactive by the user in terms of
metrics they were looking great too so
triple F saw that amp ads were three
times lighter six times faster and
generated thirteen percent revenue over
greater revenue than non amp pages
overall and this shouldn't come as a
surprise right the lighter the ads are
the faster they appear on screen
the faster they appear on screen the
chances are for the user to actually
interact with them which generally tends
to increase revenue so up until this
year we're focused on two things one
let's make sure regular ads monetize
pretty well on publisher pages and I
think we're in a pretty good track on
that the second one is to ensure that
you know we we built our the
infrastructure that Michael was talking
about to serve amp ads and deliver them
render and render them seamlessly on a
page ascend on on pages but if you want
amp ads to be sort of the de-facto
standard on the mobile web we need to
get three things right the first one is
the ability to create beautiful looking
amp adds the second one is to help ad
servers actually deliver these amp ads
with things like cryptographic
verification signing and delivery and
the third one is measurement because
what good is an ad if publishers and
advertisers can't measure how well
they're doing I'd like to share some
early adoption stories and examples of
how we're doing in each of these three
areas so there's a misconception out
there that amp ads don't look great in
that the most most common app as you see
are only text and image ads
farther away from the truth so we built
six great-looking ad templates in amp
and put them in amp by example for you
to copy modify share and distribute I'd
like to take you through just three of
the examples here the first one as you
see is an is carousel ad which basically
uses the amp carousel component to allow
the advertiser to showcase beautiful
sort of product images using a slideshow
slideshow type of interaction the second
one is the video parallax ad which uses
a bunch of different components for
example users scroll down to animations
it uses an amp video component and all
of this is combined using an bind as you
see as you scroll down the video starts
to sort of move to the top right corner
you can play it in stream but also when
you hit play it starts to play in stream
again and finally the lightbox format
also similarly uses scroll down
animations but when you tap on the link
it actually goes into a lightbox viewer
mode which allows you know the lightbox
landing page itself could be working in
amp which helps the landing page to load
incredibly fast because it's working in
amp and usually under one second okay
this is great
but what if you don't have developers
and you don't have developers to modify
these templates and upload them and you
generally use sort of creative tools to
to create your ads so first I'd like to
talk about one of the integrations we
work with which was with the Bhoots
ultra which is a creative management
platform company whose sort of share our
thinking that you know ads need to be
light and fast especially this makes a
ton of difference in developing
countries where ad bandwidth bandwidth
in general is pretty expensive so
software is used by 3,500 different
brands serving delivering and optimizing
ads over over over a million websites
each month so cells are now supports amp
ad creation using their ad builder tool
using sort of a WYSIWYG interface I'd
like to show you a quick demo for how
easy it is to build amp ads using
substrates to
the add peter tool is so super easy to
use and intuitive so you don't have to
be a developer the ability to build
these ads anymore you can easily drag
and drop components you know embed
timeline based animations to be add and
adjust sequencing of elements on the
screen you can also use the preview tool
to view how the ad would look when it's
exporting onto a mobile device and all
of the output from here is always valid
amp and therefore it will load in an
instant
subject a demo to show you the
difference of what it looks like for an
ad built-in amp vs. would add not
built-in amp the regular ad again is on
your right I'll start counting how long
it takes one two three four five six
okay that's pretty incredible and the
answer is there it's ready to be
interacted with when the users arrives
at that particular location okay so now
I have beautiful ads but I need ad
server support to actually get them to
deliver to a page so DfE one of the
world's largest ad server later this
summer will have the ability in their
custom creatives to input amp ads
there'll be a new radio button called
amp and you can basically input any
valid amp ad and it also integrates with
the amp validator seamlessly so if you
make any mistakes it tells you what's
wrong with the amp ad you can fix them
and immediately deliver them all of
these creators by the way will be
cryptographically signed and delivered
for free and later the summer DfE also
plans to add new sort of creative types
including image and D Fe native now onto
the third area measurement
lastly we work with mote which is an ad
analytics company and widely used by a
number of advertisers and publishers to
help with capturing things like
viewability
and spam detection spam signal detection
so mode is integrated with amp ads using
amp analytics framework and the way it
works is mode basically requests the amp
or on time for things that cares about
the amp analytics the way it works is a
combines all of the requests for
information and publishes them to
anybody that cares about them and
analytics is designed in a way that if
you end up adding more such vendors for
viewability as Michael mentioned which
commonly happens the performance impact
doesn't be great linearly instead
because amp can sort of coordinate and
get the information for all of those
requests one time and distribute them to
any number of endpoints the performance
sort of remained stable over CPU and and
battery life and we've also seen a
number of early pioneers sort of
implementing amp ads already so I'd like
to just give you a quick overview of
what the status is right now so
publisher is like my net or also by the
way building a great app and PWA app and
Vox media are already implementing amp
ads and delivering them so you have to
signing service options one is from
Google and another one is cloud for the
google products you only tend to use the
Google one but any other ad network can
use cloud slurps fireball signing
service to sign the creatives and
deliver them we talked about celtris in
terms of using creative tools to develop
amp ads but also super excited to
announce that Google web designer is
going to also support outputting amp ads
and so is Adobe animate the all of these
tools are really big have really big
market share to create a badge and and
we think we're in a good path for
creating amp ads easily with with sort
of a WYSIWYG in the interface in terms
of ad server support it is a bunch of
options here including triple lift ads
that are dyno me and of course DfE for
publishers our goal is not to stop just
at the display ad it also matters what
happens after you click on the ad and
which is the landing page and a common
pattern starting to appear in the web
which is publishers and advertisers are
working together to have amp ads
delivered to amp pages and when you
click on the amp add the user send to an
amp landing page which makes sense right
if the amp landing page loads in under
one second instead of whatever 19
seconds or 6.9 seconds depending on
which server you look at
the chances are the user ends up
obviously spending more time on the
landing page for the ones who actually
end up there but also there's way less
bounce because the user doesn't go away
because the page doesn't load and with
them you can use the same components
that you use to build your pages to also
build your ads so to summarize as you
saw this is a pretty complex space and
if we really want a pad to get adopted
widely it's not going to happen with the
leadership of one we need a leadership
of many and then this world of
ever-increasing walled gardens a free
and open web is the only ways our
publishers advertisers and ad tech
companies can control their own
destinies so let's work together to make
the mobile web as fast as it can be and
make it a delightful experience for our
users
it's 2017 and it's not enough just to be
fast we need to be instant both with our
pages and our ads and finally for all
you developers in the room did I mention
that we're an open source project I'm
obviously biased but I think we have an
amazing community with things like great
first issues to get you acclimated to
the codebase and get get you started
really really easy fast and able to
commit code pretty quickly so please do
join us in making amp as the absolute
best as it can be I'm going to leave
some resources up here on screen for you
to consider and please do ask questions
if you have any I think we're sort of
running out of time but we want to thank
you for your time and hope you have a
fantastic day - at i/o</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
