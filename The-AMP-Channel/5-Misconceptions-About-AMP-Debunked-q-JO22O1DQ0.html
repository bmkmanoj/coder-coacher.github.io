you who has heard about amp both good
weird and scary you've come to the right
place let's debunk the five most common
misconceptions about amp number one amp
replaces websites let me go back one
step amp is both a web components format
and library compared to other libraries
and frameworks amps biggest difference
is that it takes a whitelist approach in
what you're allowed to do so why take
away things because it's too easy to
degrade a site's performance with a
seemingly innocent little piece of code
and too hard to debug would cost it many
months later but amp doesn't just take
away things it offers lots of custom
tags with advanced building
functionality and comes with a spec that
documents what kind of standard HTML
tags are okay to use when following
these rules amp and shoe as the site
stays on a fast path but wait isn't
there more to it
actually no ampere sweetie just that a
web components ecosystem but because
it's so easy to confirm programmatically
that our pages about it amp it enables
all sorts of cool things
among those cool things are for instance
a fast free caching system for all valid
amp pages through an amp cache a pretty
good bet that are validated amp pages
fast and user-friendly and amp pages are
self-contained and can be safely
embedded into third party platforms and
this last point in particular allows
these kind of platforms to do cool
things with it such as the top stories
carousel and Google search were linking
to amp pages on Pinterest or even
consuming and pages as data source
within a progressive web app number two
and restricts my layout and design
abilities you'll be surprised how much
you can do an amp pages all things
considered there are very few
limitations on how you can start your
site
want to go crazy with a five times
nested flexbox layout gopher crazy
pseudo-element space UI sure your limit
is your imagination
number three amp is for light
experiences well light in the sense of
not hogging my CPU and battery sure
light as in another crappy MDOT
experience that strips away most
functionality definitely not and be
strictly speaking
target at static content but set static
content is getting more and more than
kind of crazy cool art directed
animations side bus light boxes
accordions carousels and more check out
some of the advanced examples over and
by example and don't let the simplicity
of amp and the fact that you're not
writing JavaScript fool you
number four amp is just for mobile the
mobile and accelerated mobile pages
definitely doesn't help to debug this
but it is in fact far from the truth amp
is an extraordinary powerful solution
across all surfaces was designed with
the objective of allowing publishers and
developers to shift engineering
resources from the grind of supporting
multiple platforms to instead focus on
creating great new content that can then
be easily available for all users on any
device type so contrary to popular
belief amp is built from the ground up
with responsive design in mind most
third party platform integrations are
currently focused on mobile but you'll
still get many of em's benefits on
desktop check out our docs in the
description to learn how to use em
across all resolutions and device types
number five I can't use amp with my
current website now that we've debunked
the styling and mobile questions there's
no reason why you couldn't use amp with
your current website as you now know
from the previous points and is really
just a web components library in fact
the amp home page itself uses amp
exclusively of course like with any
library out there amp isn't for everyone
think about whether you can live with MS
in post restrictions and only if the
answer is yes make the switch for a rule
of thumb if you don't have static
content and your pages aren't leave
pages meaning pages that are entry
points for instance that people click on
in search engines and might not be for
you so there you have it 5
misconceptions with 5 debunked answers
hopefully giving you a bigger clearer
picture of amp and whether it's a good
fit for you have any more questions get
