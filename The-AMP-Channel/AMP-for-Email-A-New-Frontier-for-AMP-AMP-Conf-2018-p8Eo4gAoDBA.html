lunch and is excited to hear a little
more about him in email so I am like I
mentioned earlier I'm a product manager
on the Gmail team at Google and I'm
really excited to share more about the
announcement we made earlier today which
is like a whole new way to use amp we're
gonna talk about what's possible with
amp for email show off some super slick
demos from the three partners that that
Paul just mentioned and tell you a bit
about how you can get started so let's
start by talking a little bit about amp
itself and how it's changed over the
past few years as we've all witnessed
amp has had a huge impact on the
Internet at large and like we heard this
morning 31 million domains are serving
over five billion amp pages today so
that's really staggering and what's more
that's more than three times what those
numbers were about a year ago so amp is
growing really really quickly the
momentum is tremendous and with that
growth in usage there's also been
significant growth in what's possible
with amp and what the library is capable
of when it started amp was focused on
improving the mobile web by making it
easy for publishers to build pages that
load superfast but over time and
capabilities have expanded dramatically
amp is no longer just for articles that
load fast it's now the best way to build
all sorts of more general web pages and
includes interactive components like
carousels and accordions and pages can
take user input using forms and with amp
bind and amp lists you can build custom
interactions maintaining state and
updating parts of the page dynamically
so your aunt page can even end with amp
lists your amp page can even connect to
a back-end of your own to fetch
up-to-date data or submit a user's input
so the possibilities have broadened
quite up quite a lot users and
developers can do so much more with
these new tools and as a bonus they
still continue to load SuperDuper fast
so last year we looked at everything
that amp was capable of and we saw a
huge opportunity for amp to modernize
one of the most popular and widely used
communication channels there is so we're
very excited that today we're announcing
that we're bringing the power of amp to
email we think the potential here is
enormous all of us rely on email to
communicate
to get information to stay up to date
over 270 billion emails are sent every
day and while our consumption habits
have changed you know the majority of
emails are now opened on mobile the
content of email messages and how we can
interact with it has stayed mostly the
same email messages like the ones you
interact with today built in HTML are
static so they get out of date quickly
and users are very limited in the types
of interactions they can actually take
using these HTML messages in fact most
of the time when you get an HTML email
there's a link at the bottom that you
can click on and it'll open a new tab to
go to some landing page this experience
is is a little frustrating because it
takes the user out of their context
it adds friction and it makes them wait
by bringing you app to email we open up
a whole new world of possibilities for
what what can happen inside of email and
a whole world of possibilities for users
to engage with your content so here are
just a few examples that'll show on the
screen and then we'll dive into the
demos so for example imagine how
seamless it could be if you could
complete these tasks directly an email
so within for email users can quickly
take action on things like submitting an
RSVP to an event scheduling an
appointment or filling out a
questionnaire right from inside their
inbox and with this animation you can
see how quick and seamless some of these
tasks become the user just clicks that
they're going to this to this birthday
and and they're done they don't have to
leave their inbox as another example
take a promotional message showing me
new apartments that I might be
interested in renting now normally with
an HTML email if I wanted more detail
about one of these places I would have
to click on the image and then open up a
new tab maybe go back to the message
open up a couple more and this could go
on and on but with M for email I can
browse this interactive catalog of
listings right from my inbox I can swipe
through the photos save listings and
probably find that apartment a lot
faster last example here many people
rely on on email for information about
flights events news purchases and so
much more
with amp for email information can be
kept up to date in the inbox so emails
never get stale and the content is
accurate
whenever the user actually looks at it
so when you open up a news briefing you
can see the latest articles and weather
and stock prices right there in your
inbox so with interactive components
forms and bind and amp lists the
possibilities for ant based emails are
endless so we're really excited to see
what you all develop which kind of begs
the question how do you develop these
fancy new emails well historically
empezar email has consisted of two main
parts the plain text part and the HTML
part plain text is used by command line
email clients and end in low bandwidth
environments and the HTML part is used
by most modern email clients in bringing
amp to email we're adding a third part
to the email the amp part using a
separate mind part means that you can
send a single email that will appear as
amp content inside of clients that
support amp and fallback to HTML content
and clients that don't you can also
independently design the amp version of
your email without affecting the HTML or
plain text versions now within this part
of the email the amp part you can use
any of the amp components that are
inside our proposed amp for email spec
the spec includes many of the amp
components that you know and love with
some special considerations for user
safety and security in web-based mail
clients and today we'll be publishing
the proposed spec on the amp project
github repo so we invite you to take a
look also today we invite you to sign up
for the Gmail developer preview of amp
in email so you can start building and
testing your own dynamic emails and be
ready for these features when they
launch to Gmail users later this year
we'll share some links at the end of the
presentation so you know where you can
actually sign up and lastly and this is
an important point because this is based
on an open amp spec we along with the
amp team really look forward to working
with other email providers in adopting
this back so that we can all together
push the email ecosystem forward all
right so now this is the super fun part
we've been working with three amazing
companies who have been experimenting
with amp in email for the past few weeks
they'll need to be coming up and showing
us a live demo of what they've built as
well as giving us a quick overview of
how these emails contributes to their
products and their businesses and
ultimately to delivering a better user
experience
so let's get into it first up we have
Michael joining us on stage to tell us
about what they've built over at Doodle
it's really really really really really
really really exciting to be here
because I feel in a way we are part of
making internet history the N for email
is such a massive announcement that it
feels really cool to be a part of this
so Who am I my name is Michael we're
glue and I am an engineer at doodle if
you've never heard of doodle before we
make applications that make it simple
for you to decide on dates places or
anything else think back on the last
time you tried to ask multiple people
question like when should we meet or
where should we meet these might seem
like simple questions at first but it
doesn't take long before everyone's
answers start to collide with each other
one person is gonna say this time
doesn't work somebody else is gonna say
this date doesn't work and these
collisions are just gonna keep happening
until all you're left with is a mess to
sort out so that's where doodle comes in
doodle makes this process simple because
all you have to do is suggest some
options invite some people to
participate everybody votes on the
option that works best for them and from
there it's easy to pick clear winner so
why is amp for email interesting to
doodle well first it lets us put doodle
features directly inside your inbox but
looking deeper it gives us access to you
unprecedented and absolute game-changing
features inside your inbox it gives us
dynamic content which means your emails
can be up to date which is huge for a
application that's centered around
scheduling and coordination it gives us
access to form submissions which
basically means we can chef shuffle data
back and forth to our doodle API
endpoints any way we see fit which
literally means that the possibilities
are endless so I know you're all dying
to see what what this looks like in the
real world so let's let's move into a
demo let's assume for the sake of this
demo that we want to create a workshop
around
male so for that we'll go - doodle comm
and see if we can find a good time for
this workshop so we go to doodle I'll
create a doodle with the title of save
the world with dynamic male because
that's a great name for a workshop
create doodle poll okay it will add a
optional location of Earth and will let
everyone know what this workshop is all
about this is really awesome
let's click continue now we need to
select some dates for the poll for the
workshop tell everyone who I am and now
the poll has been created now we need to
invite people so I could send them this
link directly but I'm going to choose to
send them imitations through their email
addresses so now everyone's been invited
last thing is for me to choose the time
that works best for me I click done so
now at this point everybody has been
emailed I have been emailed as the poll
creator and all of the people who have
been invited to participate have also
been emailed so now let's switch over to
Gmail and see what that email looks like
this is the email that was sent to the
poll creator in response to this poll
that we just created here hope we are
locked down raymond's everyone thank you
nobody hack Raymond okay so one thing I
want to stress is that we are inside a
live gmail account and this is a live
email that you're about to see so I'm
going to open up the email and at first
glance this looks like it might be a
regular HTML email except for the fact
that there was a loading indicator you
might have missed it but it was there
what this loading indicator implies is
that it's fetching something so this is
the moment in time where everyone in the
rooms mind should be blown because this
is a dynamic email so this is up-to-date
and current to the exact moment when I
opened this email so because this
fetched fresh data from the server I
know that
fresh because this fetched fresh data
from the server I can see that only four
out of eleven people have participated
but because this workshop is going to be
awesome it seems like a really good time
to use the send reminder feature so I'm
going to click this button and this form
input has been automatically populated
with all of the email addresses of those
who have not yet participated so I'm
gonna click send and boom a form
submission from inside and email so now
I need everyone to imagine that some
time has passed I'm gonna click the
refresh button and let's all just
pretend that three hours has gone by
okay so here we are looking at the email
three hours from now and we notice
things have changed not only does it
appear that more people have
participated but also a feature that was
a feature is here that wasn't there
before this choose final option didn't
exist before but because the the
templates are flexible they can update
depending on context so we decided that
since 90% of the people have
participated this seems like a good
chance to let the poll creator close the
poll so if I click this button I get
this cool little interactive form these
form options are also dynamic the doodle
applications sent back the three most
popular poll options I could click more
and go see the rest of the the options
that people voted on but this one right
here actually looks promising because 10
out of 11 people voted for this one
so I'm gonna click that click done and
boom it actually submitted another form
inside an email but this time it
physically closed the poll at doodle so
if I want they can the poll creator can
add this directly to their calendar so
now we can switch back to the slides and
reminisce a little bit on how awesome
this was
Thanks okay so that was really cool we
just saw a lot of things that you've
never seen happen inside of an email
before so now let's talk a little bit
about how it's done so what you're
looking at here is a basic boilerplate
of what you might need to pull off the
same effects that I just showed you in
the email you start off by declaring it
as a aunt for email document then you
just import amp and your amp component
scripts just like you normally would in
amp then things start to get interesting
you can use aunt State and amp bind to
declare and bind to State directly
inside of your application and notice
how I just referred to an email as an
application because I can so if you
haven't heard anything else that I've
said today and for email lets you embed
applications inside of your emails and
that's pretty awesome so moving back to
the code the markup okay so we use I
think four different forms in our
example here we just have three what I'm
not showing you in this example is that
you can bind to your state objects you
can bind your form values to your state
objects directly before sending them to
your endpoints and then you see on line
24 and 27 how we're using the on tap
event to programmatically submit the
forms and this whole email is dynamic
which means you can go fetch data from
anywhere you want so on line 21 we're
using amp lists to go fetch some data
and then you see we're dumping that data
into a mustache template we use multiple
techniques to decide which sections of
the email should be shown or hidden on
23 we're using the dynamic hidden
attribute which you can use to derive
from your state objects and then on line
26 we are using mustache conditionals to
decide if one section should be shown or
not so it's really it it feels a lot
like amp development so your amp
development that you already know today
and your future amp skills all feel
relevant there's only a few minor
differences but all in all it really
feels like amp development okay so this
is just really the tip of the iceberg
every single day at doodle we think of
new and exciting edge cases for amp for
email though it's really really really
cool thank you for taking the time to
explore this with me
that was amazing thanks so much Michael
so next up we have Antony Malone from
booking com2 show us what they built hi
guys
good afternoon yeah so I'm from booking
comm I started around about March last
year as a senior product owner in direct
marketing and hopefully most of you have
heard of us but if you haven't were
based here in Amsterdam which is it's
great that everyone from amp is joining
us here in Google and yeah we employ
around about 17,000 staff worldwide
selling every accommodation type 1.6
million hotels homes and everything in
between and so I've been working in the
Eamon Martin industry now for 14 years
and to me this is big big stuff right
it's so what can I really do for us and
also for booking comm but not only that
but for the rest of us and personally I
think like it's probably got the biggest
potential and it's like the biggest
thing that's happened to email since
email and I'll say that again it's
probably the biggest thing that's
happened to email since email and we
truly believe that and it's either that
or it's probably about the same as an
out-of-office reply amp in email it
really does enable us to pull the
customer at the forefront and it's a
completely unique and engages the
customer in completely different ways it
allows us interactivity that far
surpasses basic features currently
offered by third-party providers and
currency s the opportunities are
completely endless we have the power to
rip up the user experience in email by
using am so going to show you the
booking demo now and basically as part
of our annual hackathon some of the team
actually created this relatively quickly
and and it just gives you a couple of
ideas of what we could potentially do so
this is a what looks like a normal
booking email you might get one or two
of them
and basically here the first
functionality that we have is a carousel
now some of you might think right yeah
we can do this in CSS already but the
great thing is about this is that you
know it's it's a much smoother
transition and enables us to as a cast
shoulders you know click on more things
show more content and a much more
engaging way so imagine a world where
you as the customer can decide what
content you want to see in emails the
emails that you subscribe to without
fail everyone in this room for sure
definitely receives email that's
irrelevant or parts of emails that are
irrelevant and complex algorithms and
machine learning helping us along the
way but you know there's there's no
better way really for us than um it
gives us the ability in real time to and
hassle-free feedback the relevancy of
our communications can be improved
massively giving a much more richer
customer experience customers have a
sense of ownership and belonging and we
want to begin to better understand their
needs and one way of us doing this is in
the second example so here you can see
we've got some offers ranging from a
certain price per euros and what we can
do is actually update these prices and
the actual locations in real time which
is super cool for us because it means
that we can learn what the customer is
doing and also improve the way that we
communicate with our customer going
forward in the last example that I'm
going to show you the third example is
to do with the subscription management
now it's probably nothing more
frustrating for a customer to go off to
a website and need to do that here we've
got an accordion that actually shows
more content we can select different
ratios or different frequencies of our
newsletters and
also we could potentially unsubscribe
with reasons why we would like to
unsubscribe and this is super cool for
the customer it means that we're
stopping them from that delay of
actually doing things and in or coming
away from the email and doing it all
within the email so things like reviews
and it's going to be really really
impressive for us to be able to use this
going forward so just to summarize in
the demo we've used the amp for carousel
data request accordion and forms and we
believe more we work with them the with
email it more will unlock additional
features to our customers increase in
engagement and driving smarter
interactions with all of our customers
and I hope you've enjoyed all the
examples are shared with you today and
please reach out to me later on I'm
around for the rest of the day if you
have any questions thank you
fantastic thanks so much Anthony the
next step we have Seth from Pinterest
showing off their and paste emails hey
everybody hey live streamers out that
way maybe really excited to be here
today to talk about am free mail for a
couple of years we've been monitoring
the interactive email space and we're
really excited about what amp is gonna
do to bring standards and scale to a
more customizable inbox experience can
we switch to the demo
thanks first I want to talk a little bit
about Pinterest at Pinterest I work on
our growth traffic team the growth
traffic team owns email communications
and for our emails our goal is to really
extend the core value proposition of
Pinterest both in look and feel as well
as content so the the core value of
Pinterest is helping people discover and
try new things in their everyday life if
we look at how that manifests we have
our core home feed which is a
personalized stream of content
recommendations laid out in this grid
format pretty pretty well-known layout
here but I can tap on it and get more
information I get this deeper in deeper
view of the image larger image more
information and of course I can save it
into a collection was thinking about
Amsterdam on the way out getting some
inspiring ideas to try if you haven't
found yours try Pinterest so in email
what that means is that we're really
trying to extend that experience most of
our emails are recommendations they're
personalized content just for you today
our emails really have that look of the
product they've got that layout they
don't have the feel though you know they
can't provide that interactive
experience so this summer we started
working on some experiments we added a
hover to our emails a little bit extra a
little bit something nice but it was an
enormous amount of work making this
cross-platform really functional and
what we found was that today's
interactive email is all kludgy HTML and
CSS hacks that rely on inconsistent
rendering quirks in email clients trying
to make a website like experience that's
not convenient scalable or easy to
develop with am for email that really
changes so right now in production this
is where interactive email stops with am
for email we've extended it now I can
tap in and get a bigger view of that pin
right just awesome I get a large image
right there more information about the
pin I can navigate back check out some
more pins pop into this one it's just
great stuff and provides a lot of value
for the consumer too because today what
has to happen is I've got to go back and
forth between Pinterest trying to get
more information
deciding what I'm gonna make for dinner
tonight but now the recipe is right
there on the right hand side I can also
see some other people what they've made
how they made the tacos how they've
tried it get more ideas it's really
really powerful for extending what email
can do and as was said earlier many
applications in the inbox so it's not
just page transitions it's also flows so
we can save right here in the inbox too
and I can put this right on my healthy
living board we do a form submission on
success we do a light box and I get a
confirmation so this email is pretty
simple it's a couple light box effects a
little bit of navigation I can save
right here in the email boom another
save one this is fantastic stuff really
fundamentally shifts how we think about
email at Pinterest and what it means to
send these communications out so one of
the really exciting things that this is
going to allow for is clearing toasts
one of the things that's really exciting
that this is going to allow for is
people to pin more and
more means people learn the value of our
service it means we get more signal to
personalize and it's ultimately just
less steps and we all know less steps
means more engaged consumers better
retain consumers so this is the pin
email I've got one more I want to share
which is really where we started our
interactive email journey when somebody
new joins Pinterest I'm going to zoom
out so we can get a little bit better
view of this there we go when somebody
new joins Pinterest or somebody visits
for the first time in a long time we ask
them to select some topics so we can
kick-start that personalization standard
onboarding flow they have to select five
topics and that's it but the reality is
not everybody finishes that and if they
don't finish it we don't get to kick
start that feed we don't get to show
them the value of Pinterest but with
interactive email we can send a
follow-up email and we can give them
that ability to select topics right here
in the inbox so one the cool thing about
this email is that overall it's governed
by a global state right now that state
is selecting topics and we can tell a
couple of things about what's going on
with this email I've got to follow five
or more topics we can also see the CTA
button is grayed out and disabled I
can't click it
I cannot proceed until I select topics
if I choose one of these we see the
state changes we see the counters are
decreasing at the top and the bottom in
real time we just use a simple amp bind
for this and if I deselect it goes away
counters increment so let me select a
couple of these and we also have these
great filters here this is a simple
selector component tap on it instantly
the topics are filtered just to those in
food so this is also really simple we
just use an amp state dictionary
it's got topic IDs and category IDs you
click on a category all the things that
are in that category get filtered real
easy money to choose one of these let's
get five topics protein looks good
mmm DIYs not for me travel San Francisco
I'm from San Francisco uh will do the
Riverwalk some an art you know the the
movement here is just great fad
photography oh great I got five buttons
enabled header change - all set before I
tap this though I want to tell you a
couple of things when I click done it's
going to change the global set at state
of the email to building home fee that's
gonna send my selected topics back to
the serve server via form submission
there's gonna be this cool loading
animation on the top while we wait for
the reply from the server that I got the
information and my personal home feed is
ready it's also gonna change a bunch of
the content so as a reminder let me
deselect these I've got all of these all
this content here I can scroll all
around I click done and this email
instantly updates I got this loading
thing and we saw the we replied from the
server header and button were enabled
and we see that the view of the emails
actually changed so it's kind of hard to
say like this this is an email because
there's so many parts to it it's so
nuanced it really is a mini application
in the inbox so these are the core
things that we've built a couple of
really cool things one is that this from
conception to completion took us about
four weeks that's including two weeks of
design so the engineer who worked on
this ting team taught herself amp and
built these emails in two weeks these
are almost production ready really
really exciting stuff design also loves
this I cannot tell you how much Hana is
excited to have this it brings
consistency and scalability to our
emails in a way that we've never had
before and ultimately it's really gonna
the most importantly really gonna
empower people to use an email in a more
interactive form and to provide a better
service to them right why do we need to
force them to come back to Pinterest to
look at their recipes when we can give
it to them in their email
so with that I just want to say if
you've got any questions feel free to
reach out to me later you can also stop
me on the internet and find me on
LinkedIn or send me an email I'm set
that Pinterest calm thanks everybody
Thanks okay all right thank you very
much guys I hope you guys enjoyed the
the demos there I think I had one slide
that was really awesome so I hope they
give you a feel for what's actually
possible using amp inside of email so we
saw you know clickable UI so that users
can more quickly manage polls inside of
doodle interactive components and
dynamic suggestions to help people book
their vacations more quickly with
booking comm and print wrist being
bringing some core experiences into
email to deliver a better overall
product but also sending this brand-new
email the topic picker email that we
just saw that they've always wanted to
send via email to get more engagement
and better personalized Pinterest for
their users so really exciting to see so
amp is coming to email I hope you're as
excited as we are have a look at the
proposed spec on the amp projects github
repo and sign up for our Developer
Preview in Gmail the link is up on the
up on the slide right now so feel free
to write it down or take a picture
they'll also be listed on the amp blog
and the Gmail blog later today so I'll
be around for the rest of the day and
for the Q&amp;amp;A later today if you have any
other questions but thank you very much
appreciate it
