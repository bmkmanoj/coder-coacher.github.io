PAUL BAKAUS: So a quick
round of introductions.
We have-- so this
platform is really
from a completely
other perspective,
we're now here to talk about the
perspective of the platforms,
of the surfaces,
as we call them,
that enable great
AMP experiences, that
give your content wings,
as I would call it.
And so I'm really
pleased to have Zack
from LinkedIn here to talk about
what they've done with them.
And then we have--
and this is kind of
cool, you know, I--
first of all, we have
Marcelo from Microsoft,
and specifically from Bing.
And then we have Dane
Knecht from Cloudflare,
whose name you have heard
before in the opening keynote--
I would say, the mastermind
behind many of the AMP products
that Cloudflare
has been producing.
And I want to start by giving
each a little bit of time
to explain where they've
been coming from,
why they have done AMP in the
first place, why they have
embraced it, and what their
offerings are, and also
what they've learned so far.
And I want to start
by just saying--
I want to start with
Marcelo because--
I have mentioned
this a few times--
I've been giving a
few talks about AMP
in the last couple
months and I had
these slides about companies
supporting AMP ecosystem.
Every time I made the same joke.
Hopefully, if you've
seen many of my talks
it didn't become too repetitive.
But I made the
same joke, saying,
I've never thought
that I, as a Googler,
would stand here
talking about Bing.
And so it's been very
surprising to me,
and very positively
surprising, to see
Bing join the AMP ecosystem.
And it's really a
sign for AMP making--
becoming more open, in general,
and beyond just a Google thing.
And so I'd like to
hear from you first
to see what your
motivations were, why we
see this change at Microsoft.
And please let me know.
MARCELO DE BARROS: It's a
pleasure for me to be here
at the Google conference.
I'm a group manager at Bing
and my team is responsible
for the visual system
of Bing.com as well
as the development of apps--
primarily iOS apps.
And last year we
took a look at AMP.
And we saw that there was
a significant increase
in the volume of AMP.
And we decided to
collaborate with Google.
We actually went down
there to California.
And we did the first
implementation of AMP
on the Bing app,
which is a great app.
It's a four-and-a-half
stars app.
And in search, what you do
is you never ship anything
to production to 100%.
You always do experimentation.
You always do A/B test.
And you let the numbers
tell you what to do.
And we tried our first
experiment with AMP
and the results were great.
We did all of the tricks that
have been taught here before.
We do a lot of prefetching.
We do pre-render.
And when the numbers came they
were very green, very positive.
Abandonment of the
page when down.
Engagement went up.
And that's when we decided
to move forward with AMP.
And I was telling
Paul that it's--

in my mind it's part
of the transition
that Microsoft has
been going through
for the past two
and a half years
with Satya Nadella as the CEO.
The company is definitely
much more open.
You see a lot of people writing
code for Android, for iOS.
Azure is running lots of
virtual machines in Linux.
And we are here.
And that's part of the
reason why I'm here
is I don't know if it would be
the case, like, 10 years ago.
But now I see this positive
change in the company.
So we are very pleased with AMP.
We just started embracing
AMP into our platform
and we're not
going to stop here.
We are going to continue
to move forward.
PAUL BAKAUS: It's great to hear.
It's especially
great to hear that it
was a logical conclusion,
that it wasn't just--
we're different
companies so we're not
going to do it, right.
But it really was driven
by analytical measures,
by A/B testing.
So that's super,
super good to hear.
With LinkedIn, how
was the story here?
ZACK HENDLIN: Sure.
So the genesis was, as
any social platform--
Facebook, Twitter,
LinkedIn-- you're
trying to reduce balance.
You're trying to get
people connected to content
that they really care about.
And so any performance
improvements you can do,
whether it's improving the
time to load the LinkedIn app--
you'll get more
people who eventually
view a news feed and
engage, and post, and share.
Likewise, if you can get people
to content a lot more quickly,
you reduce bounce rates.
You reduce them switching
into another app.
So, we think about how we
get people to come back
to LinkedIn
frequently, how we get
them to read more
content that they're
interested in and share.
And what we actually saw
when we started testing AMP
was that we were able to
increase the average read
time by about 9.8%,
which means that people
are getting to content they like
and staying there for longer.
And then, if you actually
look at that distribution--
we looked at bounce rate for
three-second and 10-second.
Both of those dropped.
And then we looked
at longer reads--
30 seconds or more on content.
And that actually increased.
So we were getting the
distributional shifts
that tell us, hey,
we're getting people
to content that they
care about more quickly.
And then the nice
knock-on effect
as a social network is
when people read a thing
and don't bounce, they're
more likely to share.
So we actually saw
a stat increase
in sharing, which is
exactly the sorts of things
we look at when we're
implementing AMP
or even features that we
might build separately.
So we've seen pretty good
impacts on feed, generally.
PAUL BAKAUS: Cool.
And so we had a conversation
earlier where you told me that.
And I'm really
curious about this.
So let's jump into this
topic for a second.
You created a separate
version of the lightning bolt
that is a little bit custom
that you're using on LinkedIn.
So what was the
motivation behind that?
ZACK HENDLIN: Sure.
So on LinkedIn, you can create
content on the platform.
We call it first-party
content, where
you can write a long-form
article, similar to what
you might do on Medium.
And for that we actually
already have a really, really
performant native reader.
So in that case there's not an
incremental benefit for AMP.
We can do-- do do a lot of the
things that AMP tries to do.
So we have it on our CDNs.
It's fast.
If we think you're likely to
read it, we could prefetch it.
We don't have a
ton of JavaScript,
all that kind of fun stuff.
So what we ended
up doing was, we
said, well, we want people
to know that content is fast.
And it really doesn't
matter whether it's
Facebook instant articles,
AMP, whether they access it
through Google or
Bing, or whatever else,
or a really, really fast
native experience on LinkedIn.

The exact logos or style
of the lightning bolt
may differ across platforms.
But in my mind, it
doesn't really matter.
What matters to an end user is,
this thing needs to be fast.
And so we didn't want to
give lightning bolts just
to AMP stuff but not to our own
stuff that was just as fast.
So we came up with a
similar-ish lightning bolt.
We apply it to anything that we
know is going to be really fast
loading, whether
it's AMP content,
or whether it's native--
natively rendered
LinkedIn content that
renders in our native viewer.
PAUL BAKAUS: Nice.
I really like that idea--
I mean, the fact that
you're treating AMP
as an implementation detail.
Initially, we published it
as a developer brand, too.
And the fact that you're
highlighting user experience
and speed as opposed
to this specific thing
is really interesting.
And I hope we can
shift everything
towards that way in the future.
So now, Dane, we have
heard about Cloudflare
before this morning.
But I think not everyone was
here in the room at the time.
So can you give us a quick
recap of what you're up to
and where you're coming from?
DANE KNECHT: Yes,
so, for you guys that
don't know about Cloudflare,
we have [INAUDIBLE] network;
a hundred data centers
around the world; 6 million,
plus customers, ranging
from small, free sites,
up to major media and financial
institutions that are on us.
About, I guess,
a year and a half
ago, we would get
a lot of feedback
from our customers
that are always
looking for us to help them--
do things that Google's
doing, Facebook's doing,
best practices--
and help them apply
it to their site
without large development teams.
One of the things that we were
hearing a lot about, actually,
was people were asking us, can
we help them with ad blocking--
anti-ad blocking.
And we went in and
did some research.
We did some surveys.
We found that, to my
surprise, the majority
of people that use it use
it for performance reasons
and not for privacy reasons.
And we kind of looked at ways
that we could help in that--
help, meaning, avoid
getting hit by them.

And we took a step
back and said,
that didn't really
feel like Cloudflare.
It didn't really feel like we
were making the web better.
Because those solutions actually
slow down the page even more
to get those ads.
And we felt the real root
cause was slow web pages.
And so someone came along
and showed us the AMP pages.
And we were like, this is
what our publishers should
be doing, whether they
are small or large.
We need to help figure
out how they can basically
get users to trust the
mobile web as a place that's
going to be fast and not want
to go install ad blockers.
So we set out and
kind of started
by actually reverse
engineering the Google's cache
because we wanted to be able
to serve it from our network.
We wanted to be able to preload
it the same way Google can
preload it for our publishers.
And so we came
out with that then
got involved with Google doing
things with the ad network,
the AMP ads--
and then have
rolled out products
for platforms that also want
to white label their own AMP
caches, to also offering
things for our free customers,
where we actually are
kind of a giant discovery
network in ourselves.
We have 26,000 sites that have
turned on a feature called
accelerated mobile
links, where we
take all the links on the page
and see which ones have the AMP
alternative and add the little
lightning bolt and [INAUDIBLE]
automatically.
So we'll insert the JavaScript,
we'll insert the viewer.
We'll do the preloading--
kind of everything you get
on the Google experience,
but, you know, for
sites of any size.
We roll that out.
That's a free feature
from the platform.
And really
surprisingly, our paid
customers turned it on more
than our free customers--
some very large sites.
And especially in the
countries will kind of
surprise you, of where these--
they're very specific--
[INAUDIBLE] surprise you, but,
India, Indonesia, Pakistan,
Brazil are the top
countries of the sites that
are turning this on.
And there are a lot of
forum sites and places
where you see a lot of links.
And AMP is a great
way for their users
to see the content
that they want
and then get back
to their experience.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
so cool to hear.
I have to admit--
so the first time
I read about the accelerated
mobile links project,
I'm like, I don't get it fully.
But now that you explain it, it
makes a lot more sense to me.
And the fact that you're
bringing the same advantages
that we heard in Rana's talk--
from AMP viewer,
to the organic web,
to web-page--to--web-page
linking--
is really interesting.
I'm really glad to hear
that a lot of people
have embraced that.
Very cool to hear.
Now the next interesting--
I would say one of the
most interesting questions
to the audience, and to me as
well, is the kind of challenges
that you had, and
that you're still
having, and challenges
that you had implementing
the AMP features, but also
what you're still missing--
what you still want
from the project.
Anyone, feel free to start.
MARCELO DE BARROS:
So, in terms of Bing,
the way that we implement AMP
is that, once the query comes
and the results are
ranked properly,
then we actually do sort
of what AML is doing.
We go and we parse the page.
And we parse the results.
And we figure out which ones
have an AMP associated with it.
And whenever we find it,
then we replace the URL.
We add the icon.
And then we also have
a lot of conditions
that we decide when
to do a prefetch.
For instance, you
have to be on a Wi-Fi.
And your Wi-Fi has to be
good in terms of bandwidth.
So-- and also the same
for the pre-rendered.
So there's a lot of logic
that we had to implement.
And I think one thing that I was
discussing with the Google AMP
team is to see if we could
make it an open-source project
for the viewer--
something that is smart,
that we can collaborate.
We have a lot of
learnings in terms
of when to prefetch when not to
prefetch, when to pre-render.
So if that can be
in a package, that
would be interesting for us.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's actually
really interesting because--
so I've been hearing from
various completely unrelated
parties over the
last couple of days
that they want to have an
open source AMP viewer.
MARCELO DE BARROS: Right.
PAUL BAKAUS: And the
AMP team internally
has talked about
this for a few weeks
so I think this will
certainly happen
and we would love to have
your contributions on it.
So let's kick that project
off after AMP conference.
ZACK HENDLIN: Fair enough.
Once you've caught
up on your sleep.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes.
Exactly.
ZACK HENDLIN: On
the LinkedIn side,
I think we've seen
two things that I
think were a little bumpy.
One was analytics.
So if you have a publisher.
And you're directing
all the traffic.
And you have a refer tag.
And they can see that
it's coming from LinkedIn.
Or we can provide
them analytics.
That was what was working.
When a lot of those URLs
are now cdn.ampproject.org,
a lot of that ceases to keep
working in the same way.
And so we had
publishers who said,
whoa, our referral traffic from
LinkedIn has dropped a lot.
And we're like, no,
we're implementing AMP.
It's for the good of all of us.
But ultimately,
that was something
where we had to do a little
bit of retooling to make sure
that we weren't effectively
losing track of those people,
and effectively losing track
of what distribution they were
getting from LinkedIn, which
determines how much time they
spend posting content to
the platform and all that.
So analytics, I think,
was one of the things
that we had to sort
of work through.
And the second that is still
maybe not quite where we would
like it to be-- and I think
some of the publishers that
I've spoken to here
have mentioned--
I think Cloudflare
has been thinking
about it-- is, there is this
notion, if I click on a link
from Washington Post or
the Business Insider,
or whatever it is, that
it's their content.
And I should see, you
know, businessinsider.com,
or wallstreetjournal.com.
And I think you
lose a little bit
of that when you get
to cdnampproject.org
and all of that.
So we're using Chrome tabs.
And so we still have
this AMP project URL.
I know there were some
recent announcements around
effectively offering a
set of URLs we could use.
But I think that's
still a point from a--
cool, a member is on LinkedIn.
They click on a link from
the Wall Street Journal.
They're at the Wall
Street Journal.
I think that continuity
is maybe broken
a little bit with
currently the way
that URLs are being displayed.
So that would be one ask.
And then a secondary ask, I
guess, or secondary point,
would be, as a platform that
relies on most of the value
that we can provide
folks being logged in,
all this stuff
around authentication
and all that probably
doesn't make as much sense
for us to build
LinkedIn in a totally
amplified way on mobile--
on mobile web-- relative to
the apps and stuff like that.
So I think you see
this if you look
at Linked-- if you look at
eBay, if you look at Eventbrite.
A lot of the other
folks who have been here
have said, cool, for the
first hop, we amplify that.
And then for the
more involved stuff--
we can't show you a
great amplified version
of your LinkedIn
news feed, right.
We rely on a lot of stuff--
of you being logged in
and how we rank stuff.
So I think there will always
be some limitations when
you need to serve dynamic
content where it won't make
sense for eBay to make
their whole site in AMP just
because you can't really
get all the things you need.
PAUL BAKAUS: That makes sense.
But what do you--
I'm just curious what do
you think about the AMP
to PWA story?
ZACK HENDLIN: I
think it's cool--
I think-- if you compare
it to the set of things you
can do in a fully mobile app.
If you have iOS and
Android developers,
and you can do a lot more, and
you already have everything
there, and you can do
performance improvement
to make that work
really well, and you
need people to be
logged in, and you
need a lot of these special
hooks and photo uploads and all
the other stuff, I
think you're still
going to see that exist
in its current form,
in apps, to be honest.
But I think it's
good for the pieces
where maybe you don't need--
PAUL BAKAUS: I mean, true.
We are always going
to play catch up
on the web, when proprietary
ecosystems can always
operate at a fast pace.
But I'm quite hopeful.
We have a lot of
things that we didn't
have two years back now in
the Progressive Web App story.
ZACK HENDLIN: One interesting
comparison versus Bing
is we don't do any of
that prefetching stuff.
And I think a Google--
I think you guys
do some prefetching
on some of the top results.
We don't do that because
if you think about it
you guys have intent
which is a super strong.
Hey, I want to read about
this particular topic
and I'm pulling a couple
results related to that that I
know are going to be fast.
In a feed, which is more of like
a discovery type of surface,
let's say--
I'm making up numbers here--
but let's say your
likelihood to click
on anything in your
LinkedIn news feed was 5%.
I actually don't
really want to have
to prefetch 20 things
to have one of them
load a second or two faster.
So we haven't implemented that.
There could be a
world in which, if we
knew we had a super relevant
thing at the very top of feed
that you were, like,
50% likely to click on,
that we would do
something like that.
I think, to your point
about figuring out how,
when you should do that or when
you shouldn't, that's actually
like a probability calculation
if you were to really optimize
it.
So we haven't implemented
that just because
of the dynamics of our system
being different than the search
intent that Bing or Google has.
PAUL BAKAUS: This
actually gets--
so the intent thing is
actually interesting.
I see your point.
This is actually harder
on mobile than on desktop
because on desktop you can
have the mouse be a signal--
you know-- the
direction, the velocity
of the mouse,
which is often used
as a signal for
pre-rendering, prefetching.
But you don't have that on
mobile because you will touch.
And you don't have a
trailing hover state.
ZACK HENDLIN:
There's some fancy--
if you really want to
get fancy about it,
you can look at
dwell-time on that story.
So, is somebody staying on
that particular feed unit
beyond, let's say,
the average time
they spend on other feed units?
Which suggests they're
reading it, which suggests
they're more interested.
Then you could
trigger a prefetch.
But that's probably
a little bit fancier
compared to some of
the other feature work
we could prioritize.
PAUL BAKAUS: Just for
clarification, so prefetch
and pre-render-- these
are two concepts that
are sometimes interchanged.
But, in fact, on the Google
search result pages we
pre-render, as
opposed to prefetch.
So prefetch is the first
step, where you basically
just fetch the content
in a network request.
We could do that
without the AMP cache
The pre-render step is
actually the hard part where
things get really tricky
without an AMP cache.
So that's why we need
the viewer as well.
So the pre-render
is the thing that
makes it really performant
at the last mile.
MARCELO DE BARROS: And I
think that that was a mistake
that we implemented.
We realized in the beginning
when we were doing the prefetch
and pre-render early last year.
Because we were pre-rendering--
we prioritized pre-rendering
from the cache,
but in some situations
we would pre-render
from the canonical AMP URL.
And sometimes that
was a problem.
Especially like
a year ago, where
we would see on some sites that
were not actually conformed
with the AMP rules--
then they would come with
heavy JavaScript or things
that we didn't know what to do.
And then you pre-render
that on a hidden web view.
And then all sorts of bad
things can happen, right,
if you have this
massive page with lots
of JavaScript running, which
you don't have any control of.
PAUL BAKAUS: That, right
here, is a nice advertisement
for the AMP caches.
MARCELO DE BARROS:
Yeah, absolutely.
PAUL BAKAUS: [LAUGHS]
MARCELO DE BARROS: Don't
pre-render if it's not
coming from the cache.
That's a lesson that we learned.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
That's one-- thank
you for saying that.
Because that's a huge
reason why the cache exists.
So now, Dane, I want to
hear about the challenges
that you had.
And you built, actually,
you built a solution
for that problem, right?
DANE KNECHT: Yeah.
PAUL BAKAUS: But I
also want to hear
what other things
that you run into that
have been problematic
that you want to have--
that you want improve.
DANE KNECHT: Well,
we kind of originally
thought it was going to be a
couple-week project, where,
we figured we already do
a lot of these performance
optimizations, minifying,
replacing JavaScript, doing
some other validation things.
We figured, OK, this would
be a breeze, a few weeks.
And then it turned out that the
amount that the AMP cache does,
is just--
between re-writing, things
between the validation rules,
between the continual evolution
of the validation rules--
it turned out to be
a much larger project
than we expected
and didn't realize
just quite how much you guys
were doing inside the cache.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
Yeah.
It's an interesting
challenge to actually--
to make people actually be
aware of all of the things
that we're doing
while also making sure
that they know that we're not--
that we're still following
strict guidelines, right.
We have created those
AMP cache guidelines
that you know very well.
Whereas, where we
say, for instance,
we need to faithfully visually
represent the content,
which means that we cannot just
sneak ads onto the page, right.
What we can do are things like,
image transformations, actually
to reduce the file size further.
So that's why we've
worded it quite carefully
to say without visual impact.
But yeah, what's happening
behind the scenes in the AMP
cache is much more
than just single thing
like validating or
restructuring the content.
DANE KNECHT: And then
even more for the AMP ads,
where, literally,
things are being
precalculated so the JavaScript
doesn't have to do it later on.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
That's right.

So, from the future,
are there any things
you would wish to see
from the AMP project that
would make your lives easier.

MARCELO DE BARROS:
For us, as we talked
about building that
viewer together.
PAUL BAKAUS: The viewer
is a great point.
MARCELO DE BARROS: Open source.
That would be a good win-win
for both companies, for sure.
DANE KNECHT: We would love
to help, at least partially,
solve the cdn.amp project
problem for publishers
that are using us.
And we can guarantee that
it meets all those cache
guidelines as well as the
data privacy aspect of it.
We would love to be able
to extend what we're
doing on our cache to be able
to do that on Google's cache
as well.
ZACK HENDLIN: Yeah.
I would echo Dane's
point around--
because when publishers
share to Facebook or LinkedIn
or Twitter, there's a
couple of things-- either
they're getting more followers,
more people following
their content.
But ultimately they
want the referral link.
That generates one of
two things for them--
ads revenue or subscriptions.
If I simplify the
world, there are people
who don't care about that.
But most big, successful,
commercial, stand-alone
publishers that are not
bloggers at home care about one
of those two things.
And I think in doing that
some of the ways that people
do try and make their
AMP site successful
is by driving
those subscriptions
or whatever else
which means they
want to retain their brand.
And retaining either--
whether it's a logo
or whether it's
their URL, l think
that's actually important.
In fact, if you look at
Facebook's instant articles,
they did not have a paywall
or some of the stuff
that you can use to drive
subscriptions in as focused--
maybe is the nice
way of saying it--
a way as AMP had and does allow.
And I think that
was always something
that publishers had asked for.
So I think maintaining
the publisher brand--
I think one other
thing is we also see,
on some of the AMP articles
we lose some of the richness.
So you can think about--
and there's other ways
you can get around it.
You embed a-frames, or whatever.
But infographics or
interactive graphics
or some of those things--
which actually are
really cool on mobile--
and some of the things
that differentiate-- hey,
this is an article about
X. Instead it's, hey,
this actually walks you through
how these private equity
transactions work or
how a self-driving car's
LIDAR pings around
it and figures out
where it is spatially.
I think some of that
richness sometimes gets lost.
And trying to figure out a
way where people don't just
have to drop all that
stuff when they do,
effectively, say, hey, I've
got this piece of content.
I want to share it out to
AMP, to instant articles,
to my mobile website.
But I'm going to drop the
cool stuff, effectively,
on AMP and instant articles.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
I think half of that is
probably a misconception,
to be honest, that
AMP is just a thing
to do really light experiences.
But the other half of it is
we still had some work to do.
Yes.
But I don't know if you've seen
the amp-bind stuff yesterday.
ZACK HENDLIN: Yep.
PAUL BAKAUS: I
think amp-bind will
make a lot of these
concepts possible,
a lot of these interactions.
I'm really excited about it.
I mean you probably
saw the chat app.
The chat app is really
impressive in my opinion.
And so I hope that
we can see much
more of that in the future.
MARCELO DE BARROS: Yeah,
I saw the presentations.
I think it's great
that we try to add back
all this richness to the page.
For us-- for platforms
like Microsoft, like Bing--
if we can keep the page
fast and very structured,
but at the same time with the
richness that we can have back,
I think that's
going to be great.
I mean for us, same as
Google, right, the challenge
is to not only structure data.
Once you have
structured data then
you can do a lot of
interesting, cool magic
to make the page load
faster, more reliable.
But when we have [INAUDIBLE]
structure one and tons
of things that you
don't really understand,
then it becomes really hard.
So I'm excited with the
direction that AMP is going.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
actually a good point.
MARCELO DE BARROS:
But if we keep
the principle of a light
page, a mobile-first page,
then we can do a
lot of good things
from the platform standpoint.
PAUL BAKAUS: The whole
structured data aspect to me
is super interesting
because we have-- in AMP,
we have all of those much
more high-level semantics,
where, usually when you do
an accordion on the page
it's just a div
stoop, where we have
fifty different divs listed.
But then in AMP it is
really one web component.
And as a platform, you
know, OK, that person
has an accordion on their page.
Or that person has an
image carrier on the page.
So I'm actually surprised that
we haven't seen more platform
experiences that use that
fact, that actually really make
use of it.
And say, OK, we're going
to highlight images.
We're going to build
a specific experience
around image galleries.
Because we know which of these
pages have image galleries.
We can pull them out, display
them in a really nice way.
I'd like you to talk about it.
Yes.
I think this is a really nice
opportunity for platforms.
So we're on time for the
first half of the panel.
So now, if you--
happy-- if you want to
end something on a note.
If you have something to
say that you didn't yet,
happy to give you the last word.
Otherwise, we can
open it for Q&amp;amp;A.
ZACK HENDLIN: Yeah.
I'd love to hear any questions.
PAUL BAKAUS: Q&amp;amp;A, again, we have
just a few questions coming on
[INAUDIBLE] but I also want to
give you all the opportunity
to ask questions to platforms
in particular, live.
So, again, we have
Lindsay and Melanie.
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes.
Here we go.
On both sides of the room.
Please come ahead and ask
away any questions you have.
And I'm going to do the same
thing again as yesterday.
I'm going to go back and
forth doing online questions
and live questions.
So let's start over here.
AUDIENCE: OK I just had to
ask, being the first one up.
So is AMP a search
uprank signal on Bing?
[LAUGHTER]
MARCELO DE BARROS: If it's
the signal for the relevance,
the ranking, no it's not.
We don't use that as a ranking.
As I said, the way that
we implement today--
we let the rankers work
the way they are today
so that we get all the results.
And right before we
render on the page,
then we do the AMP trick.
We go and we replace any URL
that has an associated AMP URL.
And we replace--
we add the icon.
But we don't-- that's not
a signal for our rankers.
PAUL BAKAUS: That's a
really interesting question.
MARCELO DE BARROS: That's
the same with Google, right?
PAUL BAKAUS: Same
with Google, yes.
[LAUGHTER] But
it's interesting--
ZACK HENDLIN: Except
you guys add a carousel.
You guys--
PAUL BAKAUS: Well, yeah.
ZACK HENDLIN: --Help
it along a little.
DANE KNECHT: Just
a little, yeah.
PAUL BAKAUS: But it was
an interesting question.
It was great that
you answered it.
Cool.
Then we'll do a
[INAUDIBLE] question.
And this one is for Dane.
&quot;Does using Cloudflare
Ampersand mean
that our pages on our
own domain can still
be available in the
Google search carousel?
I have a lightning bolt.&quot;
DANE KNECHT: Yeah, so I kind of
alluded to that a minute ago.
So, basically, how
it would work today
is the Google-- we would still
be an upstring for the Google.
And we know when Google
calls the AMP page.
And we don't do the
optimizations in that case
but let it do its
own optimizations.
But we do add in the things
like the monetization things,
like the big link integration
or any of the other integrations
that you might have
with Cloudflare.
And then they go
into the Google cache
the same way as they did before.
PAUL BAKAUS: Cool.
And by the way, one thing
I want to add to that--
and I had this conversation
earlier with some AMP team
members--
in doing AMP
outreach, we realized
that some of the outreach
we did initially was--
the direction of it was maybe
not the right direction.
Because you can do AMP
outreach in two possible ways.
You can say, hey, we built
a JavaScript library.
Here you go.
Use it.
And then you get all the
developers to complain
about all the things that--
all the constraints, right.
But then if you advertise it
as a content delivery format,
similar to all the other content
delivery formats, like RSS,
like [INAUDIBLE], whatever.
Then I think it comes away
more favorable and as more
open than the rest of the bunch.
And so one thing that
I want to mention is--
and this came to my
head earlier today,
but let's say I built an app
that uses Twitter, right.
And I get a Twitter feed
to display in the app.
Twitter actually tells me
in the API guidelines--
to cache those things
because I shouldn't
hammer the API all the time.
So if you think about it purely
as a content-delivery format,
then it's pretty obvious that
any platform should cache
the content in their own terms.
But just one note, how
you could also see it
in a very different light.
Anyway, next question.
Thank you, Dane.
Actually, over here.
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Gil, a
software engineer with Airbnb.
Can you give a quick
overview of what
it takes to display AMP
inside of the Bing app on iOS?
MARCELO DE BARROS: What
it takes to display
AMP inside the Bing iOS?
AUDIENCE: Yes.
MARCELO DE BARROS: Yes.
So, what-- as I said,
what we do today--
we already had the app running
before we added the AMP.
And we worked with
the Google team.
We actually-- we
got the same icon.
We worked with them.
And we added a little
bit of JavaScript
on the page that actually does
what AML is going to be doing.
And it parses all the news
articles and figures out
which ones have an AMP
associated with that article.
And if so then we
replace the URL
and we also add the icon there.
And of course we changed some
for our own instrumentation
so that we can know what is--
which links we replaced,
which ones we didn't replace.
And that's how it works.
When we-- I just want to
add that when we started
the project, I think it
was May of last year,
we saw that the percentage of
news articles on the Bing app
that had an AMP associated
with it was about 8%.
So out of all the articles that
we had on the app, 8% of those
were like AMP.
Right before this conference
I ran the same query
and now it has jumped to 62%.
So in about a year we
have seen an increase
from 8% coverage for AMP to 62%.
So that's a massive increase.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
That's massive.
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.
Everything you described--
is that, it sounds like you
could do that in the web view.
Is that-- I actually
haven't seen the app.
So, is that what you're doing?
MARCELO DE BARROS: This
is for the iOS app.
And, yeah, it's in the view.
AUDIENCE: So you could
do that in any platform?
Or, no?
MARCELO DE BARROS: Yeah, but
right now the [INAUDIBLE]
we have is specifically for iOS.
We do some tweaks there
because we have to do--
we have all the code that
actually does the prefetch,
for instance.
And that's conditional
over whether or not
your network is good.
So all that code
is kind of combined
inside that web-view for iOS.
AUDIENCE: So you have
native code and JavaScript
code combined to do this.
MARCELO DE BARROS: Yeah.
AUDIENCE: OK.
Thank you.
PAUL BAKAUS: All right.
Next question online
is, again, for Bing.
&quot;Any plans to integrate
AMP into the Bing results
outside of the app?&quot;
MARCELO DE BARROS: Yes.
Right now we only
have it in the app.
But we are running
some experiments
as we speak, trying AMP
on the amp.bing.com, which
is the web version of Bing.
And that's where most of
the traffic comes from.
By the way, Bing is, for
those of you who don't know,
it's the second
largest search engine.
[LAUGHTER]
It's behind the number one.
But we have like 30--
32%, 33% of the market
share for EMEA and US,
which is significant.
We are a profitable business.
We make a significant amount
of money for the company--
and based on the
initial results of AMP
with the app, which
was extremely positive.
As I said, we're not
going to stop here.
We're going to try new
surfaces that we have.
One of them is definitely
going to be amp.bing.com.
PAUL BAKAUS: And now let's take
another question over here.
AUDIENCE: Hi.
I'm Serge from Yandex.
I would like to ask
you about your vision.
Am I right that your--
Microsoft and LinkedIn have
owned cache for the AMP pages?
Or are you using the Google one?
MARCELO DE BARROS: Right.
So right now we are using AMP
project-- cdn.ampproject--
which is the one that
was built by Google.
AUDIENCE: But are
you going to follow
the description of
the cache itself
and go and build your own cache?
MARCELO DE BARROS: If we are
going to build our own cache?
Is that the question?
AUDIENCE: That's the first
part of the question.
MARCELO DE BARROS:
That, I don't know.
Right now we're using
the Google CDN, which
has been working great for us.
We have a good
partnership with them.

I don't know if
that's in our plans.
But as far as I know
right now, things
are working well
with Google CDN.
AUDIENCE: But for
you guys at LinkedIn?
ZACK HENDLIN: Sure.
We use the Google CDN--
cdn.ampproject.
I'm not sure that we'll
build a cache anytime soon.
I think to justify
that, it's like, hey,
do we think there is either
an incremental performance
game, where we can do
it faster than Google?
Or is there some
other optimization
that we think we can offer,
or something like that?
I'm not sure that there is
such a compelling reason
to justify--
because our primary-- what we're
good at at LinkedIn is helping
you connect to your
network, finding
people who you want to
connect with, reading content.
And so I think on some
of those performance
optimizations for our cache--
I'm not sure that
there's enough benefit
there to justify doing that
versus building a really
cool new feature or introducing
more interesting content
types we're interested in.
AUDIENCE: But since
it's going to be
wider usage on your website, are
you not afraid about the laying
down on the company
infrastructure
for providing the key
service of your websites
for Bing and for LinkedIn?
ZACK HENDLIN: Ah.
So your question is, hey,
are you actually losing
something pretty important
by hitting the cache instead
of owning it yourself?
AUDIENCE: Sort of.
And you also need
to be guaranteed
from the other company
that your business is not
going to be ruined
by the mistakes made
by other companies, for example.
So it's a question of
safety and the full control
of this stuff by yourself.
ZACK HENDLIN: Yeah.
So I think the way we've
implemented it, especially
without prefetch, pre-render,
right now, really it's
the same as clicking on
a link to anywhere else.
So we're not necessarily
sharing the information
that you're seeing--
x-article, y-article,
z-article in your feed--
because it's the same as you
clicking on the link out.
So I think because of our,
call it, more minimalist
implementation,
there's less of a,
hey, here's the information
on every single thing
someone has seen on their
news feed if it's AMP-enabled.
So I think there's probably
less of a concern just given
the way we've implemented it.
I think it's an interesting
point you raise.
And if you went further
down that path and said,
shoot, who has access to
literally everything I'm
serving?
If I were prefetching and
pre-rendering everything--
I think that's actually
a pretty deep question.
MARCELO DE BARROS: I want I
want to add two points here.
One, before we
used the Google CPN
we actually-- of course we had
a conversation with Google.
And so I think from a
business-to-business
standpoint, we had that
conversation already.
And number two, from
a code standpoint,
we implement our
code in such a way
that we don't have a strong
dependency on the CDN
being up or being available.
So we have all the
safety mechanisms.
So if know the CDN is down
then we go to AMP URL.
If the AMP URL is down then
we go to the original URL.
So any code that we
develop there is very--
it has all the defense
mechanisms in place,
trusting that things
are going to be
down or not available to us.
AUDIENCE: And you're going
to check this online?
Like, monitor the stability
of the Google CDN?
I mean--
MARCELO DE BARROS:
Say that again.
AUDIENCE: You're going
to monitor the stability
of the Google CDN?
MARCELO DE BARROS: Yes.
Oh we do that.
AUDIENCE: OK.
And let me go to the
second part of the question
about the component
part, itself.
Are you interested in taking
control of the JavaScript
and CSS implementation
of AMP controls
as well as controlling
the cache part?

Do you think you can implement
your own AMP components
library?
DANE KNECHT: So the Cloudflare
AMP cache-- we do that.
We actually serve the
AMP JavaScript off
of the same domain.
That if it's our platform
or if it's another platform
that we're building for--
white labels for them--
the JavaScript is also
served off of their domain.
AUDIENCE: But you're not
doing any transformations.
You're not replacing
any of the JavaScript.
DANE KNECHT: No.
No.
I mean, the integrity of AMP,
you want to keep it up-to-date,
in-sync--
that, we work actually really
closely with the Google
team to come up
with a build system
so that each week we are
in sync on our launches
and their launches.
PAUL BAKAUS: I think
the answer here
is that it's possible to do so
but it's really impractical.
Because yes, you could
create your own JavaScript
implementations for all
the things that AMP does--
AUDIENCE: But if you create
your own implementation
of the component
library, you can
reuse the part of codes already
you have in your website,
like you can reuse the core
JavaScript from your Bing
website, and also you can
reuse the style guides
and make the default components
look more like Bing style,
not like a material
design style.
PAUL BAKAUS: So it is possible,
but it's a massive investment.
ZACK HENDLIN: Yeah.
LinkedIn-- we have no
immediate plans to do that.
PAUL BAKAUS: I think the
much saner choice would
be to become a core
contributor in the AMP project
and actually make sure that you
have a voice in the AMP project
itself.
MARCELO DE BARROS: And I
think that that's a direction
that we definitely want to go.
We definitely want to contribute
to the project as well.
PAUL BAKAUS: Yeah.
So before we have
to fork everything,
let's just try to
figure it out together.
AUDIENCE: OK.
Let's discuss it further.
OK, thank you.
ZACK HENDLIN: We're happy
to chat [INAUDIBLE] coffee.
PAUL BAKAUS: Let's move
to the next question,
but you can chat afterwards.
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
Thank you.
PAUL BAKAUS: Thank you.
All right.
Then, we'll do one more here.
AUDIENCE: Hi.
I am Mejal, I am a software
developer from [? Mikabali. ?]
I have a question for Marcelo--
whether you guys are planning to
provide in the Webmaster Tools
the ability to see
how many pages you
know about on our site.
I randomly just
checked a page that I
know is showing up as
AMP on the Bing iOS app,
and it didn't show up for me.
So what is my recourse
as a developer
to figure out what you guys
think about my site and my AMP
pages?
MARCELO DE BARROS:
So I think you
are talking about
us giving telemetry
to the publishers about how
many pages have been surfaced
and the clicks,
and so on, right?
AUDIENCE: I'm
talking specifically
about how many AMP pages
on my site you have indexed
and you know about, similar
to what the Search Console
provides for Google index.
MARCELO DE BARROS: Yeah.
I think we do have plans
to do that eventually.
We haven't done that
yet because, as I said,
we only implemented
on the Bing app.
And even though the Bing
app has been doing well,
it's a very tiny
percentage of our market.
And as we expand and
go beyond the app,
absolutely we want to
be building for those
and getting more information
to the publishers like the one
that you're saying.
PAUL BAKAUS: Just
for my own sake
and for the audience's
sake as well,
do you have something similar
to the Search Console,
to the Webmaster Tools?
MARCELO DE BARROS:
I'm pretty sure we do.
PAUL BAKAUS: OK.
MARCELO DE BARROS:
I can't remember off
the top of my head.
PAUL BAKAUS: OK cool.
Great.
Then I think we'll do the last
question over here and then
wrap up a little bit early so
you can all have a nice lunch.
AUDIENCE: Hi.
I'm Ryan, a web
developer at Twitter.
There's been a lot of talk over
the past day about responsive
AMP pages and things.
And I'm wondering, is anyone--
search engines or
LinkedIn-- experimenting
with showing AMP on desktop,
as well, given its speed gains?
PAUL BAKAUS: Yes.
Thank you for that question.

MARCELO DE BARROS: Yes.
We have a road
map of experiments
that we are going to be trying.
The first one was the
app--was successful,
second one is
mobile, [INAUDIBLE].
And, yeah, we want
to give that a try
on the desktop,
eventually, as well.
PAUL BAKAUS: Just to know,
you'll be my personal hero.
Whatever platform comes
up with a desktop--
with a great desktop for AMP,
is going to be my personal hero.
I think that's
going to be amazing.
ZACK HENDLIN: We haven't yet.
I think it's an
interesting idea.
It never hurts to throw
it behind an A/B test
and see what happens.
It's probably the way
I would think about it.
DANE KNECHT: So
at Cloudflare, we
have an internal Chrome
extension that we use
for debugging our own software.
And one of the
developers actually
just added in our
AML codes so that
gets inserted on every
page on the internet
that he goes to so that he
can get it on the desktop,
get the AMP pages.

ZACK HENDLIN: One
thought that occurs,
though, is the whole
point around richness
before, if you talk
to a lot of publishers
and you said, hey, you've built
this cool desktop experience
where you have your
video player, and all
this related stuff, and stuff
coming in, and maybe ways
to entice people to
consume more content,
and all those other
things, I suspect,
and I look forward
to having some
of these conversations over the
next couple of coffee breaks
that that's probably
something that's worth
discussing with the sets
of folks who do invest
in their desktop experiences.
And let's take the
example of that really
cool interactive
infographic that right now.
Not all publishers do this.
But a lot of publishers,
if it won't work in AMP,
they just toss it away, right.
Do you want to
lose that richness?
If I actually am on a desktop,
I'm less bandwidth constrained.
I'm not battery constrained.
And now you've actually
degraded a little bit
the content experience I have.
So I think that's actually
probably the really big thing
that would probably give
me a little bit of caution.
PAUL BAKAUS: Good summary.
And just one thing
I want to note.
It's also kind of a
chicken and egg problem.
So, for once, you know,
platforms, well there's two--
so the chicken and egg here
is, publishers don't really
build for desktop
with AMP because there
are no platform experiences
for desktop for AMP.
And there are no platform
experiences because publishers
don't build responsively.
So you both have an equal
half of the job here to do.
So, publishers in the audience,
please just build the AMP pages
responsively so that we
can have those experiences
in the future.
AUDIENCE: Does Google
plan on testing anything
on the desktop?
PAUL BAKAUS: I don't think so.
So it's all the more
important for you to do it.
[LAUGHTER]
PAUL BAKAUS: Anyway, I think
that wraps up our panel.
So glad to have you all here,
Dane, Marcelo, and Zack.
I'm very glad to have you.
I hope you enjoyed
it as much as I did.
Please give them a
round of applause.
