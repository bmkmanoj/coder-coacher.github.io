the web content assistance team at
Google and we'll tell you in this
session how it is possible today for
publishers to take advantage of the
benefits of using amp when they are
publishing content with WordPress but
first let me put this work it was the
first slide let me put this work in the
context of what my team at Google does
so you think about okay what an
ecosystem is basically it's a community
of interacting part and organisms and
their environment and the important
things here is that every member of that
ecosystem is important to all the other
members so you cannot get rid of the
trees and then have birds for example
right so that's a big deal with global
warming right so this is the essence of
what an ecosystem is and this thing
happens with content ecosystem a content
ecosystem is a community of content
creators and content consumption
participants interacting between
themselves and their environment and
there are many of these ecosystems
continuous systems in the web and I like
to think about the web as a sort of like
a Federation of this continent of
systems and for the purpose of my team
there is one important thing that is all
these ecosystem share one goal the
experience that the users get when
accessing consuming or polishing content
in the Aussie consistent ecosystem
should be an awesome experience
and since amp is all about achieving an
awesome experience for all users we are
interested in seeing how can we bring
the power of and to as many of these
ecosystems as possible so one of the
most relevant content ecosystem arguably
and we're gonna see why of content
ecosystem in the web today is WordPress
WordPress I can be fine it as a content
management system for for websites and
as multa said it was one of the early
earth of the earliest adopters of am
historically when people hear the word
wordpress usually used to associated
with a platform that enables bloggers to
polish the content an easier way but
WordPress has been evolving steadily
since it started back in 2003 and
nowadays is like basically powered
website across a wide variety of
verticals you know you name it
blogging the initial one travel ducation
real estate you name it so it's a very
very powerful platform in this sense and
it's reflected by definitely the largest
contain management systems in the out
there right now with 59% of the open
source content management systems market
share so that is impressive and what is
more impressive is that nowadays 1/3 of
websites are powered by WordPress so
these stats are very very impressive but
again they tell me one thing so 1/3 of
the web is a lot of the web so there are
many many many many users both
publishing and consuming content via
WordPress and my goal is all of them
should get an awesome experience when
they are doing that so one of the you
know may your strength of the WordPress
platform is the flexibility that they
offers and that is reflected by a very
very large and ever-expanding ecosystem
of plugins and themes ok so there are
like this many on each of those sites
you can use themes and plugins to
basically customize your WordPress site
in a myriad of way you in any way you
can imagine it now this virtual also can
be turned into one of the major
challenges of the platform right because
even if you take into account plugins
that are code it perfectly there are
very performance and they behave nicely
you know the probability of having two
plugins or more that collide when
installed at the same time in aside or
affecting the performance of a site is
this is not negligible and this what I
like to think about this duality between
a virtue and a challenge it is parallel
to the very challenging in the open web
right so in the open web nothing
prevents a developer to basically screw
the performance of a site by following
development practice development
practices that are counterproductive
like you know loading script
synchronously or like not optimizing
images and things like that and even if
you know the developer does an
impeccable work and codes an aside that
is extremely efficient and optimized
installing one third-party JavaScript
could spell I perform a disaster for the
side so so you think about it and emerge
as a response to that reality and
bringing to the ecosystem a set of
design principles and control mechanisms
that allow us to create sites that offer
predictable performance and since both
amp and the output of WordPress are just
web content WordPress publishers can
also benefit from the power of M in
order to offer radicular performance on
their sites so when we talked about and
in WordPress we basically talked about
two things one is a capabilities enabled
by a plug-in and also the integration of
that log in with the other components of
a site like the underlying theme and the
other plugins that provide functionality
for whatever the side does so the
plug-in as well mention the plug-in work
for enable and in WordPress was
pioneered by WordPress by automatic and
and it was it was developed to satisfy
the needs of after you have heard about
the VIP platform vlp plasm is a fully
managed cloud platform provided by
automatic and that basically they offer
full solutions to their clients they
offer support customer advice and so on
and so on and the interesting thing for
me is that it has a diverse diverse
partner ecosystem around them and there
are basically two type of partners
there are agency partners that is where
most of the advanced WordPress
development takes place and then there
are technology partners that basically
team up with automatic to integrate
technologies to the VIP platform Google
is one of those partners for example if
you want to integrate and a Google Drive
to the viable platform then we qualify
as a technology partner now the plug-in
definitely satisfies the need that they
set for themselves for the VIP plasmon
you know they report like around 700
million pageviews per month both across
wordpress.com and the VIP platform and
the plug-in also has been adopted
you know relatively good size you have
200 more than 200 thousand installs and
it also has been used as the core of
other plugins that have been built
around it okay but thinking about the
initial goals of the plug-in that it was
basically satisfied in it so the VIP
platform that usually have agency
partners working with them the
characteristics of the initial plugin
implementation make sense basically it's
a developer oriented plug-in basically
you offer minimal functionality with a
set of core abstraction that enable amp
but all but then allow developers to
extend in a custom IC to satisfy the
needs of specific sites but you know
that means also that for sites that do
not have strong engineer support the
plug-in was very difficult to adopt
because you got you get play is that I'm
going to show you in a second that makes
it difficult as barb so yes I mentioned
to the plug-in enabled millions of pages
in thousands of sites in WordPress and
on the outside we heard a lot of
feedback about we generated pages and
most of the feedback that we heard was
like well but all the amp pages looked
the same and they looked a little bit
kind of lame right so here on the Left
we have you know so-called canonical on
the original sorry the canonical side
original content and on the right is a
page
that was generated using the plug-in
version point zero point four and here
you can see two problems one is that
there is you know doesn't matter how the
page on the left looks like the page on
the right is going to look pretty much
like this right I know the second thing
you can see how we basically that's what
I call a visual gap right so there is a
little difference between them and then
you see for example here there is no the
hamburger menu the low updates button
with not present here and there is a lot
of functionality that is is gone and the
reason for this is that you know you can
take this output tweak the plug-in and
then make it look nicer but if you don't
have engineering support then you cannot
do it and your pages are going to look
like this so Google and automatic
started collaborating around meet last
year with the purpose of taking the
plug-in and evolving it to a point in
which budget can be adopted as scale so
we started working and we release
version 0.5 a little while after we
started collaborating and this release
brought support for new embeds for
example via SoundCloud Pinterest we also
changed the the original version of the
plug-in use a black list sanitizer or
preprocessor that basically you know
take you know you have to get rid of
things that are not and we change it for
the preprocessor that add a lot of
intelligence to it and also allows the
plug-in to stay in sync with the amp
specification so everything that the UM
projects evolve the plug-in stays up to
date with it you know whatever use of
code and documented documentation
improvements and we added a basic UI to
analytics to the sides short after we
finished that we were okay up on top ok
sloths let's move you know towards the
path to getting an old ant experience
and by mere chance
somehow we came across with the awesome
fox with the or the xwp engineering team
and we start the talking yet we are
doing this we are doing that and it
should turn out that we shared a lot of
our visions and we decided to start
working together so we join forces
together with automatic and we not long
after our collaboration started we
released 0.6 and
0.6 is loaded with a lot of new things
but I'm very excited about I'm going to
show each of them here for example you
can see before in the previous version
of the plugin you could only preview the
latest pose that you were working in amp
you know did you want to see how the amp
version look you had you can only
preview the last post and the preview
functionality was separate from the
integrated or the normal workflow in
WordPress for doing the previews here
you can see you know this is just a
regular WordPress role flow and now you
can see they can preview the changes in
the normal WordPress and next to it you
have the little lamp icon they say okay
preview how the amp version looks like
so this is pretty cool because then the
developer doesn't have to leave the
normal workflow in WordPress to see how
amp is behaving or the version of ambe's
looking at other thing is that the
initial version of the plug-in only
supported the post content type you know
in WordPress there are different type of
content that you can create post content
type is one set of the of them and it
was the only one supported by the
plug-in in this version we had the
support for pages that was one of the
things that the community was asking the
most you know we need support for pages
here there's not much to show only that
this is a page and then it's been
converted to amp and the other thing
that we added is like because of the
plug-in was evolving we wanted to give
the user the power to say for this
particular piece of content I want em to
be disabled for whatever reason they
have a functionality that is not
supported for any reason so they have
now they really need to say for this
particular post disable amp or vice
versa you can see the Sonam tin which is
actually very good to give the users the
capability although you're gonna see
soon that this is not one IV needed and
it's very nice it is gonna tell you all
about it
and another thing that was very cool
it's like also in WordPress you have the
ability to create what is called post on
post types you can create your own
layout and you define up a account in
time that you'd if you create and before
in the initial versions of the plug-in
in order to add an support
then you have to go to the code like in
the lower side of this slide and you had
to manually you know say okay I'm gonna
put you know this specifically I want am
support for this content type now on the
upper part you see now you can't do it
in the seed 0.6 version you can just
click and say I want an support for this
post for this post content time and so
on so this is very good because adds a
lot of flexibility and don't require the
user to go to the code now beside those
you know the seed 0.6 has many of the
things we added Auto loading
capabilities that basically allows to
simplify the code because you don't have
to be including all classes and
interfaces manually we integrated the
ant customizers with the regular
customizer in the regular WordPress
workflow a lot of you know one of the
this is important because one in the
content ecosystem team one of the thing
that we want to do is to bring coding
and performance based practices to the
WordPress ecosystem and we are applying
those principles in the plug-in by
adding a lot of code quality checking in
the build process of the plug-in itself
and you know the zero point six version
also enhance the preprocessor a lot
added a lot of intelligence and actually
fixed some box that prevented the
plug-in to be actually completed in sync
with the amp specification now since the
beginning when we started this work we
had our site in an all and experience in
WordPress we can call it native and or
all amp and it's an experience in we're
not per mode is needed but if there are
you know
no visual gaps and not functional gas
between the regular version and the on
version then you don't need two versions
and I'm gonna invite theory my colleague
and friend from xwp to tell you the
progress that we have made towards this
goal with version 0.7 of the plug-in
the 0.5 and 0.6 included great features
no doubt about that but like any early
versions of software's it also came with
its limitation and by that I mean until
today the WordPress M plug-in only
converted certain type of pages imagine
a user coming from Google search and
landing on the WordPress amp article
what they would get is the default
styling that the WordPress plug-in
provides and that would be the same
across all WordPress websites which uses
the M plug-in not only that but when
this user is done reading the article
and goes and click on the logo to go
back to the home page then they land to
a non M version which provides a
completely different visual experience
and that is because until today the
zero-point-six version of the plug-in
did not convert the home page by default
now we've thought with the team how can
we come over these limitations and we
brainstorm and we came to the conclusion
that we needed to combine this non M
version of the website with the M
version into one beautiful native M
experience when building beautiful
WordPress websites users and site owners
have accessed your large built in
libraries of components the WordPress
components but these are not all am
compatible
now this obviously expose great
challenges and what we wanted to do is
take the power of these WordPress
components and make sure that what
powers one-third of the web today is AM
valid and in order to achieve that we
had to completely rethink the way the
amp integration in WordPress was done
well I'm so proud to announce that
through collaboration with the Google
aim team as well as our friends at
automatic we overcame these challenges
and that via the new version 0.7 beta of
the wordpress and plugin not only does
it convert all WordPress components and
make them n valid it also allows
WordPress developers to continue coding
the WordPress way and let the plug-in do
the rest and I think the best way to put
this in context is to actually look at
the real world example before we do that
we're going to look at a website without
the EM plugin and that is a beautiful
news websites and it's a non amp website
and it has a fairly complex layout with
a drop-down and on the right we have a
search which animates our click and of
course this website looks beautiful and
mobile we say with the hamburger menu
nobody knows why why is it hamburger but
everybody knows what it does now at this
stage before 0.7 people would install
the 0.6 version of the plug-in and what
they would get when they activate the
plug-in is the same looking homepage an
on M version of the homepage and then
they would have the same nan M version
of all the articles and on top of that
another version with a completely
different styling now with 0.7 and we're
going to activate the plugin in the
admin we were able to provide this
native amp experience and let's look at
the same website again
this is native amp in WordPress we still
have our drop-down we still have our
search the mobile looks as beautiful and
we see the amp live list in action
allowing us to click and see the latest
article and we obviously still have our
drop-down and while developing these
sometimes I found myself wondering am i
indeed amp is the plug-in activated and
look at the console powered by amp
passing validation indeed and to give
you an idea of the speed that this
website is providing what using right
now is me browsing the website and just
recording my screen that's what we are
getting helped us out of this WordPress
website now let's recap there is no
longer a need for paid mode there is
only one beautiful version of the
website there is no longer need to
maintain two version of it and then from
a development perspective people or
companies like we have heard the
Washington Post early on don't have to
put this hard work into converting
WordPress components and make them M
valid it is done out of the box with the
zero-point-seven release I mentioned
early on it doesn t convert the M
components it also allows developers to
continue coding the WordPress way and
what we see on the screen is a typical
wordpress website wordpress snippet that
we will find on any wordpress website
today and what it does is it just tells
wordpress please anchor stylesheet in my
HTML head like we see on the screen
right now now obviously link stylesheet
are not valid and WordPress developers
would have to convert that into in light
inline H inline CSS the employ and now
it is no longer need to do that because
with the plug-in is done automatically
and we can see the difference here
WordPress developers do not have to
change the code snippet we saw early on
the M plug-in does that for them and it
imprints the CSS inline the M valid way
now we didn't stop there
we want to make it better and we working
in the prototype which analyzed the HTML
Dom and compares it with the CSS that's
loading on the page and make sure that
only the CSS needed for this page is
printed in the in the custom style HTML
tag
now that really much aligns with the EM
philosophy of keeping CSS under 50
kilobytes as I mentioned earlier on
WordPress is made out of multiple
components and one of the components are
widgets they are small blocks that users
can place in the web sites in multiple
areas and if we look at the backend of
WordPress we're dropping a gallery
widget and selecting images which is the
standard WordPress experience and we're
going to be adding this widget in our
sidebar and change the categories widget
to be drop-down and you'll see why now
so when we look at the front-end and we
scroll down to our sidebar this this is
the non without the M plug-in right
there is a list of images and if we
inspect the drop-down will see this
inline JavaScript and this JavaScript is
obviously not invalid and instead of
developers converting that by themselves
we activate the M plug-in and the first
thing we see is that we have a beautiful
image gallery and that's leveraging the
amp carousel component of course and
then for the JavaScript issue it has
been replaced with the M bind components
and that allows users to just select a
category and get the expected behavior
now at xwp while working on some of the
major publishing websites in the world
we have identified that very often they
end up replacing the WordPress comments
where
alternative solutions and we believe
that one of the reason is because out of
the box the WordPress comments
experience is aging a little bit it's
requiring the page to reload and while
converting these WordPress components to
be am valid we also wanted to improve
the user experience by leveraging some
of the M components such as the AMPA
mustache the M form the M by Nat the amp
live list so on the page we're going to
scroll down to the list of comments and
I'm going to add a V useful comments
very good feedback as usual my name and
an email and then when I post the
comments then the M from Eustache
displays the success message and the amp
live list goes and fetched the comment
in the back end and tell us immediately
there is a new comment which I can
obviously click on and then we scrolled
up and we see the new comments we
haven't left the page and developers
didn't have to do anything on this team
other than wrapping the core comments
function with the amp live list HTML
deep they get that out of the box this
new WordPress comments experience now we
have seen the style conversions we've
seen the widgets we've seen the comments
but 0.7 includes a lot more than that
there is pretty much all the WordPress
embeds are now converted to BM valid
liberate leveraging some of the M
components such as the M Facebook M
Twitter
M video and so much more wordpress cool
components are predictable we know what
to expect from WordPress and so we could
easily convert that to be an valid but
with WordPress powering one third of the
web and a huge ecosystem of plugins and
custom integrations is really difficult
to predict what's going to be rendered
on the page and while this will be part
of the future phases what we wanted to
make sure of is that anything
which is random and the page is M valid
and for that we took what was before the
sanitizer and what we what we would want
to call it the preprocessor and it
essentially it takes whatever is rainin
on the page puts it through your funnel
and outputs it in the M valid way while
doing that we obviously saw an
opportunity to make things even better
and since we had access to this rendered
or this output we thought why not
automatically including the M components
on this page we see at the bottom it
uses for M components and under this
content we'll add a snippet a code
snippet using github gist in the backend
we just use our snippet and when we
reload the page if we look at the
console right now we can see that the M
gist component javascript has already
been added to the page without the
implosion site owners would have to call
developers and say hey on page ID 54 I'm
using a gif snippet could you please add
the gif component and that's no longer
needed during the panel talk there was a
question about what about the content
creation experience well now we have
turned WordPress to be WordPress M but
we also wanted the people editing the
content to be made aware when they
actually add something which is not M
compatible on the page and that was
really tired with the editorial
notification of the editorial workflow
so in the WordPress admin we see that
there is a script tag and an on click
event which is not allowed an amp and if
we save the draft and we see there's a
notification saying hey this content
will fail invalidation it will be
stripped out anyway but you should
really remove it and then we remove the
event in the disallowed script and when
we save again the notification is gone
so editors in WordPress now
know when they're doing something wrong
and the technology behind that is
actually quite cool is using the
preprocessor and we have a prototype
using the WordPress REST API to which we
can send content to and it gives us a
report of what the priests process has
stripped out from the HTML that will
open the door for so much and so and
actually even outside of the WordPress
context also maybe you know other people
using this NPAPI endpoints and that
would also allow us to inform users when
some of the plugins may not be good
citizens at this stage and they will be
one day when doing such improvement on
an existing software backwards
compatibility come in mind of course and
that's really dear to the WordPress
community it's really dear to us as well
well 0.7 is a hundred percent backwards
compatible and that is because to get
this new native amp
experience seems have to add one line of
code telling the plug-in hey I'm M
native ready when they diff am pretty
and if they don't do that then the
legacy paid mode will just be rendered
as usual so site owners can upgrade to
zero point seven with a peace of mind
that their website will not break now
before continue as you would imagine
this is a huge step forth and is that it
has taken a tremendous amount of work to
get there and I would like you to give a
round of applause for the team was been
put in an outstanding job or to do that
this is not like any release this is a
huge step fall for the WordPress world
and actually for anybody trying to
create native amp websites this allows
WordPress to now power these websites
and I haven't spoken much about
Gutenberg and more stuff really exciting
stuff coming and for that I like to
invite Alberto back on stage to tell you
more about it
thank you man super exciting I'm so
excited about this I can hide it so I'm
glad that you mentioned um Gutenberg
because something that we want to do as
I mentioned before the WordPress
platform has been evolving steadily
since the beginning and the latest thing
that they is coming for them is
Gutenberg which is a new content
creation experience that is going to be
rolled out if I am not mistaken with
WordPress 5.0 basically Gutenberg is
based on the concept of blocks for
content creation right now in WordPress
if you want to create different type of
content you have many ways to do it you
have like short code you have embeds you
have custom post types you have made a
box that you have widgets you have many
ways to do things with Guttenberg
everything is going to be a block so I
believe that were a Gutenberg is gonna
revolutionize the way that WordPress is
used because you wanna streamline the
creation of content and because of this
you know notion of blocks is at the core
of Gutenberg I think that there is
strong synergy between em and and
Gutenberg and let's see why this is an
example of Gutenberg in action basically
you know everything is a blog here we
see that you have different you know
blocks for layout format in standard and
so on so for example here you know let's
create an image you can go select from
the media library that's it and that's a
block and then here you can create a
paragraph this also a block
and so now we can create a embed let's
suppose that we want to add a tweet to
our post so when you put the URL and
boom that's it and here on the right
side you can see that there is the blog
section on there to see how the blog is
configured that you can see how the
block is laid out and so on and then
Gutenberg is extensible you know it
comes with this block but you can say
well let's add new blocks to the editing
experience they suppose that I would
like to add a lightbox and get them to
Gutenberg right so the lightbox is this
functionality I click and that appears
if I want to do it the standard way I'm
gonna have to do the decorative part and
I also have to then put the JavaScript
that supports that functionality but
what about if we use and components to
create Gutenberg blocks right the only
thing that we would have to do then is
to do the declarative part and amp is
going to take care of all the rest so
it's gonna be much easier to create
Gutenberg blocks
so definitely Gutenberg is one thing
that we want to do in full integration
with it and remember that I am part of
the content ecosystem team so the work
that we do with the unplugging is in the
bigger context of the WordPress
ecosystem as a whole so we are going to
continue working on the unplugging to
reach as close as possible to this
native all aren't experiencing WordPress
one of the things that I am excited
about is what Aundre talk about services
rendering for amp we are going to port
the code that they growth to PHP and put
it also as part of the kinetics
deploying so that can it be integrated
then we WordPress caching plugins so
that the amp pages are already rendered
so that's something that is gonna be
very powerful now and as I said in in
WordPress you have plugins and you have
themes so there is a lot of work that we
want to do in the area of themes to
create what I like to refer to as
progressive themes that are themes that
integrate calling and performance best
practices enable all the new
technologies of the web platform and
also integrate seamlessly seamlessly
with the unplugging I mentioned
Woodinville integration is a big deal
we're gonna continue working on that and
another project that we are working
coincidentally with the X of you folks
again as well is called tie and tie is
important because we need to empower
WordPress users to make decisions about
which plugins and things use based on
concrete quality metrics not only on
popularity okay and the type project is
seeking to do that and also we want to
use another project that we you know
that we are spearheading and Google that
is called the HTTP archive we want to
create or keep track of the performance
the WordPress ecosystem and we do things
to it so like how is the performance
today how we evolve it it's important to
keep track of how things are progressing
and and also we want to continue
engaging with the WordPress community in
general with theme and plug-in makers
and everybody in the community to make
sure that the whole blogging ecosystem
is compatible with amp there is a quite
a bit of work there but I think that is
very doable with the world that we are
laying out one particular collaboration
that I would like to call out is with a
company that is called Marshfield
Muirfield is a it's a very cool company
based in Spain I think they have around
80 engineers and they have been involved
with the UM project for a quite a bit
and they have doing contributions and
one of the particular things that I'm
very interested in is what a protein
that they build that is called Muirfield
press Muirfield press is a plug-in that
was built on top of the unplugging that
we are working on and it offers
progressive web app capabilities to
corporate sites basically they
implemented the amp shell model on top
of the shadow API which then allows
WordPress publishers to use em as a
embeddable data unit which is one of the
most powerful things that I like about
amp is that you can take and embed it
anywhere so we want to have that
capability ubiquitous in WordPress
something that there is a lot of room
for us to collaborate they did a lot of
things they also have this what you see
what you get kind of experience that
they implemented so that's something
that is very exciting so
certainly the development of the and in
WordPress has come a long way in the
last since I'm started and I want to
again take and acknowledge the xwp team
that have done a super job with us and
also the collaboration that we have with
several teams in the automatic like the
jet pack the team's team the VIP theme
so it's very very very remarkable they
were that that has been happening and
I'm really looking forward to the future
