really really bad jokes to start off-key
notes but this year they're
exceptionally bad so I'm saving them for
the ask me anything booth later on come
and find me in the in the booth and if
you really want to ask me anything you
can get a really bad joke in response
but first of all I want to say welcome
to everybody for the second annual amp
Kampf I'm really excited to have
everybody here in Amsterdam we've never
been here before last year was in New
York and also a big welcome to everybody
on the livestream who's watching today
including my mom so we heard two years
into building the amp project and we've
made tremendous progress together for
example now they're over 31 million
domains on the internet publishing amp
and they're published over 5 billion
pages this numbers been growing a lot
over the last year and the types of
publishers that have been making amp
pages have changed quite a bit since we
launched in fact amp is now used for
recipes and travel and retail and
dictionaries and you know rap genius and
many other use cases and in fact over
60% of all the clicks to amp pages from
Google search go to non news pages so
companies are investing in amp and
seeing great returns in fact we've asked
Forrester to make a study on this topic
and to see what they've found is the
publishers are doubling are seeing a
doubling of time spent on their page
with with a 20% increase in conversion
that's pretty impressive stat and we
think that these stats are showing this
amazing momentum that we're seeing in
the ecosystem we're really excited to
talk about what's going on today we have
an incredible lineup including the man
himself Malta Whoville who's the tech
lead of amp and I'm really excited to
pass it over to Malta now thanks guys
hi everyone can you actually see me
against the backdrop it's like poor
choice of shirt color so yeah my name is
Malta and I like the engineering team
working on amp for Google today I'm
going to talk about several big efforts
that my team and the wider community has
been working on and to kind of give you
a little bit of an overview most
sections still kind of end and pointing
to talk that has the like deeper dive on
the topic as obviously we're like
the keno and we gossiped over everything
so you do make sure to watch those talks
cool s it's the first thing what I
wanted to kind of talk about is Em's
vision as a project which is to create a
strong user first open web forever and I
really want to draw on that user first
part so what we're trying to do is kind
of reinvasion the web along that user
centered user focused kind of model and
it kind of really drives everything we
do we might not always get it right so
in that case we really also ask you to
call us out on it only the other hand we
won't stop to challenge the status quo
in terms of user first principles and I
think there's one particular way in
which M is different from other efforts
along these lines because we're not only
trying to you know change a hundred
website or a thousand websites or 10,000
website right like our mission is really
to make big chunks of the web more
excellent the the way I I call this is
to commoditize excellence so you're
really like uplift large chunks of the
web to a higher standard right and and I
think we've had pretty good success in
the performance space right so best just
said that we have over five billion M
pages and then looking at Google search
when you when people come from web to M
pages the load time we're seeing is
consistently at the median under one
second right so I think that's pretty
good and definitely an improvement over
you know the web before amp but I'm also
like not standing here with a big
mission accomplished banner so I think
there's a lot more we can do along this
theme of commoditizing excellent and the
topic that I wanted to talk about first
in with this respect is content
consumption because it is changing over
time and people on mobile have different
expectations for how content works right
so they might only have one to two
minutes they want a snack and that
long-form article might not always be
the right choice right and then given
this inside we felt that it wasn't
really like that easy to publish
content in a form that would actually
you know match that user need and that's
why we're introducing em stories so you
might have heard about this and the
press before I think the Wall Street
Journal wrote about it a while ago but
now it's actually a thing
it's been coming together on the open
source project and today we're launching
both a Developer Preview on on amp site
and there's gonna be surfacing of these
stories in Google search to give you a
little bit of an impression of what this
actually is let's take a look at this
video
so with them with them stories you're
getting rich visuals with native video
there's great support for animations
with capable interaction it's very much
designed mobile first but it works
remarkably well on desktop and because
it's just and all the things you might
already know and might expect still work
so for example amber the lead 8 to
support it
obviously right out of the box and
there's um it's important as a
technology for many groups so for a user
what are you getting are these you know
snackable bite-size pieces of visual
content for your mobile device as a
publisher you can focus and creating
content while relying on the well text
tested technology basis and then finally
these part these stories are part of the
open web so there you know linkable
shareable and they're not locking you
into any particular native app walled
garden they're just a web page you
publish them to your web server just
like any other document and so today we
have the Developer Preview there is a
resources at M project.org slash stories
and you can actually try it out in
Google search by going to GCO slash I'm
stories with these brands having created
stories this is just a short overview of
what is to come there's a talk right
after this keynote by Joe John and Andy
light so definitely check that out if
you don't want to learn more about em
stories as the next topic we're going to
talk about what I think my team has
spent the most time over the next year
over the last year which is ecommerce
and for that place welcome on stage Lee
so long was the product manager for
e-commerce on the Google team
hi I'm Lisa I'm a product manager on amp
and I lead our e-commerce initiatives
and to start I actually want to reflect
a little bit so last year at amp Kampf
we announced the launch of amp bind
which basically opened the door to
building interactive experiences in amp
so now not only can you build a
beautiful user friendly content page you
can also build a beautiful user friendly
interactive experience and today I'm so
excited to announce that amp find is
currently being used on over 150 million
URLs and over 80,000 domains and it's
growing really strongly so if you
haven't yet I encourage you to take the
time to check out amp bind see if you
can build out the interactive
experiences on your own site with it and
with the support of amp bind and the
support for interactivity we really
believe that amp is now ready for the
full scope of e-commerce so everything
from retail to travel to classifieds
- listings and more but that's not to
say that our job is done so we're
continuing to build out support for
these new verticals that demo that you
see on the on the right here is of a
date picker that we are working on to
better support travel and this recently
went into experimentation so if this is
something that your site needs please
feel free to try it out and let us know
your feedback and we're seeing that
sites are also continuing to push the
boundaries of what's possible in amp so
that middle demo is a product details
page and Add to Cart experience that
Aliexpress built and you can see that
it's fully interactive it's full of
features and it really just looks like
any other webpage and the amp team we
also continue to try and put ourselves
in your shoes to make sure that building
out experiences that we think can
benefit from amp is really as easy as we
think it is so that last demo there is
some stress testing we were basically
doing of testing out different payment
providers and making sure it was really
easy to integrate with an amp form and
you can see the demo there and for all
three of these experiences and more I'll
go into the technical details tomorrow
morning in my talk 9:00 a.m. right back
here bright and early so I'll see you
then for that and as we've supported as
we've moved our support into new
verticals we've seen that many of the
top ecommerce
across verticals and around the world
have really embraced him and for a lot
of these brands they started out by just
building out their simpler landing pages
or their content pages with amp but as
they saw the immense return on
investment they were getting they've
started to build out more and more pages
in the funnel with amp so moving into
the checkout flow and the payments flow
really trying to give their customers
that end-to-end seamless and fast user
experience and so these are some of the
top the logos of some of the top
companies that have adopted amp and we
really hope that next year we're able to
see all of your logos up here as well
now of course the best part about
adopting amp
aside from getting your logo on our
slide once a year is really the immense
benefit that you can see to your revenue
numbers so a few quick examples here we
go is a travel aggregator that was able
to see a 95 percent increase in their
partner conversion rates by converting
their landing pages to amp u.s. Xpress
is a shipping company that saw 1 million
dollars in yearly projected savings just
by changing their recruitment pages to
be built in amp an event ticket Center
which is a ticketing company saw 20%
uplift in conversions over their
responsive site so over a site that was
already optimized for mobile and so we
really believe that the value of amp
free commerce is really clear and really
large because if you can get your
content in front of your users more
quickly they're more likely to engage
with you and interact with you and
hopefully make a purchase whereas if you
stick them with a loading spinner and a
blank screen they are more than happy to
jump to a competitor site and see if
they can get what they need more quickly
oh I actually need to put on my Google
hat now it's not the great we are
obviously a tech company and not a hat
company but it's fine now I can
officially speak on some of the cool
stuff that Google is doing with amp so
one of the biggest initiatives has been
to expand amp experiences from just
organic to paid as well to paid search
as well and last year the AdWords team
launched their amp experience where
clicking on ads when I'll lead you to
amp pages and they're already seeing
some really great success with this so
Murch ology was a retail brand that when
they did this they saw that their amp
pages were 286 percent faster and with
that they saw 39%
higher conversions so if you use Adwords
and you have amp pages you should
definitely take advantage of this and if
you have use AdWords but you don't have
amp pages this is probably a good time
to check out amp and see what it can do
for your site and if you're familiar
with the shopping carasau on the search
page where you can swipe through
products and basically browse through
them Google is also piloting serving amp
trap serving amp pages from here and
they're seeing some really encouraging
results from this already so if you're
interested please let your account team
know that you want to participate in the
pilot cool I can get rid of this now I
want to take a quick minute to just talk
about the best approach to building amp
pages so when we first launched am we
provided a way for you to link your non
amp page with your new amp page at that
time it didn't really make sense for you
to switch completely over to amp because
the format was still new and it was
still developing we were still building
out functionality but now we've seen so
much success with amp and the
functionality has grown so much that we
feel confident in saying that amp is the
right core technology to build your site
with and we're already seeing this
happen at scale and not just with
content sites not just with publishing
sites but with e-commerce sites so today
I'm so excited to announce that
Aliexpress one of the largest e-commerce
companies in the world has gone all-in
on amp we don't take my word for it so
we'll watch a quick video from their
technical lead gram lock on why they
decided to choose amp hi everyone I'm
grandma technical leader of the Express
mobile site as a cross-border e-commerce
prayer Alice press firmly believed labs
the mobile site is a key components of
the global shopping experience
we constantly optimize our mobile site
performance from Pizza ready to amp in
the past two masses will remove our form
and let in pages we're using only and we
shortened Elise one second in page load
time which is very exciting now we are
getting closer to two second page load
time properly wiped away use on the app
you ask me
just tell you it is unanimously agree
lat faster loading Spain will deliver
better user experience all right
rebuilt our landing pages with only Hank
was very changing we bump into quite a
lot of difficult situations including
Lee an ethics of host right close o
affecting at least Larry render of a
page like box mm by the issues of Empire
where the list goes on about our
solution was consistent for every single
issue we encountered we just go straight
forward through the program and cut it
down with massive and components and
general support from the Anton we've
made it our Brenly mobile site was
launched on January 22nd at last it's
quite a pity that I can't join you I
wish you guys a good time in the vectors
and biggest and conference and lo lay
back
thank you I'll see you guys thank you to
Graham and the Aliexpress team for
joining us remotely I just wanted to
emphasize one thing that stuck with me
as I watched this video which was that
going all in on amp at Aliexpress was a
decision that was unanimously given the
greenlight because they believe and we
agree that delivering pages faster to
their users will lead to a better user
experience now if you do decide to go
with this approach which we're calling
canonical amp traditionally there's been
the challenge that serving amp pages
from your origin isn't as fast as
serving them from the amp cache
so I'm also really excited to announce
today that we're releasing the amp
toolbox optimizer which is basically a
toolkit that developers can use to
optimize amp documents serve from their
origin and right now it includes all
those performance optimizations that
make delivery from the amp cache really
fast and you can see that in this demo
the optimized tasty page loads about two
seconds faster than the regular amp page
so the benefits of this can be really
huge for your site and we'll have more
details on this on in a B and Andres
talk using amp as a library to build
user-friendly
later on today and now I will pass it
back to Malta to talk about ads and
analytics or as I sometimes call it you
know something something has to pay the
bills because you know we all enjoy that
free content on the internet but it you
know it doesn't come out of thin air
someone has to be you know make a living
making that content and while we're like
actually super big fans of you know
alternative ways of you know monetizing
content like subscriptions or micro
payments I think everyone realized that
you know ads and especially display ads
do have to play you know at least some
roll and you know financing that content
that we are looking for on the web and
coming back to that that vision I
outlined at the beginning of this
keynote you know of the web in you know
re expressed in terms of the user first
principle you know I think everyone
would admit that you know display ads on
the Internet aren't always the greatest
user experience right and and then you
know lately I've seen headlines like
this right wear hats decided that you
know maybe crypto mining on your machine
is a great idea right and and and what
we found is that the way ads work today
on the Internet
there's really nothing you can do at
scale to prevent this you can obviously
audit things and you can you know make
sure you trust people but like there's
no nothing there that really helps you
ensure that it's secure so there's an
architectural issue that the the way the
system works by injecting third party
Chavez took from random people you know
doesn't really produce great results at
scale and so we're on a mission to fix
this and because with the emptying we
also obviously want to make everything
super fast along the way and so I think
that's a good summary of what amp HTML
ads are they're you know a way to make
fast and beautiful looking ads but
primarily they're just purely
declarative right so there's no right
you know arbitrary JavaScript execution
and so stuff like Bitcoin mining or
malware injection etc just isn't
possible
and you know this has been a journey
already for one I have
we're pretty excited about it and the
first results are very excellent so for
example LPS it's a Spanish publisher
they were seeing a 90% reduction at
latency and a 32 percent increase in
click-through rate and then logic ad
which is a Japanese demand site at
platform I think we're seeing 33%
reduction at latency and again a 30%
increase in click-through rate so again
we've been on this for about one and a
half years and it's a you know it's a
daunting project basically all aspect of
the entire advertising value chain which
is incredibly big you wouldn't imagine
have to be updated to work inside of
this new ecosystem and and one important
part of that is that someone has to
actually make these ad creatives right
and so I'm very excited to announce that
Google's tool for doing this which is
Google web designer will add support for
amp HTML rich media ads in March of this
year yeah everyone's super excited yay
Ed's talking a little bit switching
gears from amp HTML edges to how amp
monetization with ads on amp is going so
what we've been seeing over the last
year is that publisher daily at revenue
has increased by 3x and that is only
actually the part of the statistic that
we have access to as Google right so we
looked at double-click in essence but
what I think is really important is that
there's a large and vibrant ecosystem of
ad providers on amp pages so in fact
we've done some research and we found
that over 100 ad networks are actively
monetizing on amp pages so if you've
ever heard you know you have to run
Google ads on pages totally not true and
also NOC was actually happening in the
wild
another important way to look at it is
obviously what how much money am I
making per page it's a great study here
from India today they were actually
seeing a 23% increase in revenue per
page using fewer ads when comparing the
amp pages and on pages now this might
not be everyone's experience you really
have to optimize the experience to get
the monetization results that you want
going back to that 3x metric where does
it come from obviously there's some
elements that just the entire you know
corpus and traffic to em pay just as
drone but it's not all there is to it so
the amp team my team has been working
really hard in making things that are
good for my ization be available in amp
but along those user first principles so
for example one of the biggest things in
amp is that we don't want stuff to jump
around while it's loading right and so
multi size ads is like the absolute
opposite that you would ever want to do
however we say if it's below the fold
and it's happening before you know the
user sees it is totally fine so we've
now enabled this in a way that's good
for users single request architecture is
a way to kind of make certain regular
meetings where it cetera it's just there
now that you make more money
great the suit adds Auto refresh and
video ads and then finally a technology
we call RTC or real-time config and that
is actually something I want to dive a
little bit deeper in there
you might even put like a hell freezing
over the slide here because it's
actually a first-class way to do header
bidding and amp in a way that does not
impede user experience and in a way that
does not expose the side to additional
security holes so this is something we
really want to encourage you to try out
it's available today for double-click
for publishers together with AppNexus as
an app bidding back-end and then finally
you can use it for other purposes like
audience targeting and so forth I'm
actually not so much of an advertising
as expert but the actual aspects are
here tomorrow 11:00 a.m. talking about
how amp is helping the open web stay
sustainable cool that's this is all I
want to talk about on the outside for
the analytics bit of this I actually
have more of an PSA so I think many of
you who have done some empty vellum have
like found this to be true it's pretty
hard sometimes to track user journeys
when going from your amp pages to your
mountain pages and back and forth and
there was actually talk this year at M
conf last year by eBay who really nicely
expressed how they you know and then got
to make it work
but it's actually quite easy today there
is a fix for this at least improve
analytics so you can like take out your
phone and take a picture of this link if
you haven't actually install this fix
yet it's something you have to opt-in
your site and if you do it suddenly your
metrics become more correct so I really
encourage you to do this again this is a
Google another specific thing if you
happen to work for a different analytics
vendor you can please come talk to us
you can use the same technology and then
also later this year we're making the
same underlying API available to all of
you so you can for example hook it up to
you in your house analytics system
alright everyone it's the picture it's
most exciting slide well moving on from
from this topic what I want to spend a
little bit of time talking about the
wider an ecosystem and the various
facets around it the first part of it
are the platform so these are the
websites and apps and web apps etc the
drive traffic to your EIN pages I
obviously would like to see more of them
so it's like the LinkedIn's the bings
the fleet leads the flip boards the
mediums the Yahoo is the Pinterest and
so forth and there's Google on there so
there we really like to see this grow
year-over-year because basically with
every new logo you get more traffic
without doing anything so it's great
there's actually one logo missing here
that's on the next slide I'm
particularly excited about that one
because it's an app that I happen to use
quite a bit sometimes two to four hours
a day I think which is Twitter they
launched support for linking to amp
pages last year and this is actually the
first time that they are releasing a
statistics about it so what they were
seeing is a 10% reduction in page load
abandonment when comparing amp pages to
not in pages what does it mean for you
basically this metric has dramatic
impact on all downstream metrics so if
you for example I want to optimize time
on site or conversion rates obviously
those will not be great if someone never
actually managed to load your page but
abandons it right away
right the thing is very impressive
metric moving on from the platform's the
next important aspect of the
are the CMS's right I think we've been
seeing in a healthy CMS ecosystem
develop over the last years this is
particular to obviously in publishing
and I think the newest trend is that the
e-commerce CMS's shopping platforms etc
are moving into AM support so there's
it's great to see my Magento and big
commerce on board one particular topic I
wanted to spend some time on though is
WordPress they were one of the earliest
partners on the amp page I'm project in
fact one basically we first launched
there was one of the easiest way to get
em supported was to install the amp
plugin and being very early it had some
limitations which i think is to be
expected but there has been really like
really really nice momentum going months
or months of her proof ins of this
plug-in so there's no there's no support
for pages which is custom post types and
also kinds of sub standard embeds as
well as direct and integration and the
standard templating system and there's
months releases so this is getting
better all the time
in fact we have here today a video from
Matt Mullenweg was the creator of
WordPress and the CEO of automatic
talking about how amp and the WordPress
ecosystem are working together can we
roll the video by the way he's on
vacation at mowing so thankfully focus
has always been on the user that's why
we've been committed to providing
support for ant from the project's
inception we believe enabling everyone
to create content on the open web in a
fast and accessible way is key to both
users and our business recently we
doubled down on our commitment to what
amp is doing working with the folks on
the amp and xwp teams on enhancing our
capabilities or a ham plugin so that
sports rich and immersive amp
experiences in WordPress we're also
working with the amp project to support
Gutenberg WordPress's newest creation
and publishing experience so that
authors on WordPress can provide their
readers was fast a beautiful content
designed to fit their needs and build
natively on Gutenberg we imagine a
plausible future where potentially every
theme is effectively built on ant design
principles all work ultimately revolves
around the user and content creators
which is why we identify strongly with
the amp project commence mission well
unfortunately I'm not able to be
with you all today we're all excited
about WordPress's future and our ongoing
collaborative thank you very much thank
you very much yeah so he is actually on
like some tropical island and made this
video so really appreciate it yeah so
it's great to see that progress in that
front there's one other aspect of the
ecosystem I want to talk about which is
super-important which is you know the
feedback that community has been giving
about Amp and there's been one
particular topic that people are pretty
passionate about when a couple tweets
over the years but I'm people aren't
like the biggest fans of the amp URLs
the google.com slash amp and the thing
is that we actually totally agree I
think we talked about why it's there for
privacy preserving pre-rendering and
perspectives good performance and the
thing is that we've always said we
needed for technical reasons when those
technical reasons are removed we could
get rid of it and so we're super excited
that there's a new technology that came
out about a year ago as a new web
standard called web packaging which
happens to be absolutely the perfect fit
to enable the same kind of privacy
preserving pre-rendering that amp
provides in a way that preserves the
actual origin of the content and so with
that we are excited that we can get rid
of the URL prefix we announced this in
January this year that we're working on
this right
so the has been some significant
progress the chrome team has sent their
intent to implement which means that it
officially started the implementation
and my team has been starting to work on
actually serving this content so we'll
keep you posted on the progress but it's
gonna be a bit of a road in fact the
chrome and the amp team have been
working together on quite a few
initiatives basically along the lines of
saying you know amp got a few things
right why don't we make those available
to the wider web platform to learn more
about that check out the talk today at
3:15 where the the chrome team is
talking about how they work together
with us to make the web better
all right um the last aspect of the
ecosystems it touch on is the amp github
community and I thought that given that
it's like well anti-state amor it's
appropriate to put few hearts on the
side because we really have to thank all
of you who helped us build em you know I
have a you know my team working
full-time on amp which is not have come
as far without you know the tremendous
support post in terms of code filing
issues etc right it's just incredibly
important and so thank you very much I
wanted to give a bit of statistics about
how that's actually going so there's now
over 560 unique contributors across all
our open source projects and I've I've
you know I've been asked like how many
of them work for Google it's actually
22% which I actually think is incredibly
high so it's apparently over 100 Google
employees who've changed coding app I
don't know them all by name for sure so
that's kind of cool but yeah so
definitely 78% of consumers don't work
for Google
however obviously like my team is full
time so they you know what right the
majority of the code so what mine if
it's not the code this is something I
think we were like both proud of but we
also would like this to extend the
contribution from from non-google
contributors and we're doing a few
things to help with that one of them is
that we have a weekly weekly hangout so
if you have any idea of a change you
want to propose to em you can file that
in the github issue and say hey I would
like to talk to this and join us on the
Hangout we've actually recently changed
this in terms of timing so on a
week-by-week basis it changes the time
so that if you previously thought like I
really that would like to join it but
it's a 3m you can now possibly actually
join it because there will be one time
where it's actually in your time zone if
you're interested in contributing to amp
please like check out the talk tomorrow
at 4:30 p.m. that goes deep into what
you can do and how it's easy to get
started alright that was all I want to
talk about in terms of ecosystem and
almost everything in general but there
is actually one more thing I think we've
talked about how the ecosystem is
evolving and how it's involving on the
web but I would say there's like a you
know possibly a way to kind of push the
envelope if you want to put it that way
give you a bit of a history lesson
actually the original code name for this
project was portable content unit short
PCU and the idea was basically that you
could have a peeps publish a piece of
content and control how its styled
branded monetized but then allow the
platform's across the web and apps to
distribute it for you and I think it was
a great idea the implementation is fine
and it's working well I can search
engines like Google or in Twitter and so
forth but I think we've only kind of
scratched the surface because content is
not only distributed in websites or in
apps right there's at least one other
way to do it and in fact that one is
happening 270 billion times a day that
is the number of emails are sent today
and with that I'm super excited to
announce that amp is in fact coming to
email to learn more about what this
means please welcome in stage
Akash sany sany sorry who's the product
manager on Gmail thank you
thank you very much Malta my name is
Akash Sahni I'm a product manager on the
Gmail team at Google
so amp is coming to email sounds cool
what exactly does that mean
so with amp and email you can now
include amp components inside of your
email messages across all platforms
we're really really excited about the
possibilities here you'll be able to
send more interactive and engaging and
actionable emails than ever before your
messages can include many of the amp
components that you know and love like
carousels and accordions they can even
update using data from external services
with features like amp bind and amp list
so I'll give you a couple examples of
what you can actually do inside of amp
based emails that we're really excited
about but we're really excited to see
what you build as well so imagine that
you could complete tasks directly inside
of your your email so with amp for email
users can quickly take actions on things
like RSVP'ing to an event scheduling an
appointment or answering a questionnaire
right right directly from their from
their email emails can even be kept up
to date so that when you open a news
update like this one you can see the
latest articles weather and stock prices
right there in your inbox so as we've
heard today you know amp started as a
tool for publishers to build very fast
loading mobile web pages but it's
evolved a lot over the last several
years and I guess the last couple years
and it's now one of the best ways to
build all kinds of more general web
pages so we're really excited about the
flexibility and the power of amp and the
opportunity that it presents inside of
email so today we're publishing a
proposed spec for amp in email that you
can find on the amp projects github page
and we're also announcing a Developer
Preview inside of Gmail and we're
inviting signups starting today we're
planning to launch this to Gmail users
later this year so with the Developer
Preview you'll be able to start building
and testing your own emails inside of
Gmail and and send them out to users
later this year we have a lot more to
tell you about how this all works and
some really exciting demos to share so
please join me at 2 p.m. today for a
talk to go into more detail and learn
more thanks very much
that's cool do now is kind of wrap up we
learned today about am stories how AMP
is ready for e-commerce that you can
have success with ads and amp the growth
of the ecosystem and community and then
finally that amp is coming to email
please all join us in building the user
first web thank you very much
whether you have two exciting days ahead
of you thank you very much everybody for
watching on the live stream and don't
forget to subscribe
