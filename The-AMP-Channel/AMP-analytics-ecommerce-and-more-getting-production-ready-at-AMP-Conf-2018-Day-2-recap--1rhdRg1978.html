alive here in Amsterdam but avakov 2018
we've seen talk today from a wide
variety of people are using amp for a
whole bunch of different applications
let's see some highlights in the last
year so we've seen that sites everywhere
have seen great success with amp sites
across verticals and across the world
have been able to boost their revenue by
using amp this is just numbers based on
double-click Ad Exchange and Adsense and
we're seeing an increase of 318 percent
in terms of impressions and 3x increase
in ad revenue with amp we have to talk
about like what should be actually amp
and to do that the couple of challenges
that we needed to figure out about which
pages we should consider
but we're left with the question to amp
or not sample record has been growing
which makes Google SEO and especially
I'm very very important for us we wanted
to reap all the benefits that amp had to
offer but we wanted to ensure that our
tracking remains accurate and insightful
maybe you are one of our ecosystem
providers and you do add analytics or
you produce embeddable content you want
to make sure your products are amp
enabled well it's really easy to do that
too
I do love house pages and when M came up
I thought okay let's just try this where
you converse see where we are going you
start your journey and think okay where
where this should I start with EMP
thank you very much hopefully it's time
to maximum results that's a wrap from
here in Epcot 2018 right here in
Amsterdam if you miss any of the talks
you can still find those in the amp
playlist right here on the app YouTube
