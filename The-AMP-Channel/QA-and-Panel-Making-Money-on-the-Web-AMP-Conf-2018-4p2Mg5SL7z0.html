for the morning sessions we'll have
seven of our speakers from this morning
come onstage those are Vamsi Adam James
Heather Gayle Brian and Lisa if you
could please come up to the stage while
while they're coming up a couple of
notes again there are microphones in
both of the aisles we love in-person
questions so if you have any please line
up by the microphones also note that we
do not have room on stage for all of
this morning speakers so everyone's
talks were great we appreciated them if
we have questions for speakers that we
couldn't fit onstage we'll do our best
to get them answered and I think looks
like we have almost everybody we
probably have enough for us to get
started
and I'll have a seat I will first of all
I think thank all of the speakers this
morning for their talks and also their
great work you know we certainly
recognize that in order for amp to be a
success it needs to be good for
developers it needs to be good for
consumers but it also really critically
needs to be good for business and so
that's that's what we'll talk about for
a few more minutes all right so I'll
I'll begin with a question from from the
audience this was actually one of the
most up voted questions that we received
and it's not a code question it is
actually a question about influencing
key stakeholders to buy into amp whether
that be to simply support experimental
efforts around amp or to commit to
building entire websites or products
around dab so I'll give the specific
question but then I'll also ask anyone
on the panel who'd like to answer it in
a more general sense so the specific
question is as developers we have little
or no control over whether the ads we
sell use amp for ads how do we convince
our ad sales department about amp for
ads now again I feel like some of the
stats that we saw earlier 30 percent
increases and click-through 30 percent
increases in revenue we're all very
compelling but I'd like to hear a little
bit
or from anyone who's willing to talk
about again it doesn't necessarily have
to be about Amp for ads but any of these
efforts where you have to influence an
internal or external stakeholder to buy
it yeah the first thing I'd say is that
you're probably hearing from your ad
sales department already about
viewability and so viewability is really
important now to brands it's how they're
buying a lot of their campaigns and
that's how long or you know an ad is in
view for a user and one of the problems
that you can see on amp pages is that
amp pages load so quick and if they're
using just traditional ads those ads
will actually load and the person's
already scrolled past the ad and so you
actually see really low viewability so
for sales people when they're actually
going to sell to a brand they can
promote using amp HTML ads because it
will increase the view ability and so
Brad something brands really do care
about and the buyers really do care
about so I think it's a little bit of
like education on that side and that's
something we could put together like a
quick PDF that like kind of shows that
and something you could send to your
sales team to show that like if you do
this like your brands will see more view
ability which means they'll spend more
money which means that sales guy gets
you know more money in his pocket which
is the way to motivate sales people from
a publisher perspective it's a little
bit dangerous to turn away credits and
ultimately as a publisher we sometimes
just have to work with whatever were
supplied with specifically around direct
advertising so if the agency turns
around it says I've got this really
heavy asset then it's difficult for us
to say no I'm not going to run that but
ultimately with some of the
standardization of that we saw today
with in GWD which makes it easier for
the people like you building the
creatives to understand you know is this
an HTML ad and also a different stuff
ultimately if that's the sort of assets
as they're passing across to us then we
can definitely use them but I think
there is still a bit of a disconnect
between the expectation of the end
brands are and what they're trying to do
if that makes sense
I'll just add one thing revenue solves
all problems in this particular case you
sell three pretty incredible stats
around revenue but even it just makes
sense from just a logical standpoint
right you can only probably click on an
ad if the ad is
the viewport and is loaded in time and
the ads not fast you can't click on it
and as James mentioned you can't have
better view ability and that's what
we're trying to get at and I think it's
it's a better sort of from a user
experience standpoint but also from a it
has to be better from a revenue
standpoint in order to make this work
so I would urge you to kind of point to
this talk and kind of show the benefits
you get from revenue just by switching
over to amp HTML ads
right and having to be backward
compatible helps as well in terms of you
know it's better not to have to create
yet another additional format right
absolutely good I think we have we have
one or two audience questions it's a
small question about forms I would like
to ask to the Airbnb people about the
search formal they said that they use
the amp on the search page and I'm
curious because I when I've been trying
to use amp on forms I have found some
issues that were well explained by the
pages people in the last session and I
would like to know how if Airbnb has
found this validation issues and uux
issues with the material design
rendering eventually if you have a child
if you ever found these kind of issues
okay
oh yeah I guess this is the reset
question just regarding our forms and
whether or not we find of successful
kind of hard to say because it's been
pretty difficult to actually a be test
of different forms that we use so a lot
of its surviving the date picker so
right now I think if you go on any of
our amp pages we're using a slightly
suboptimal date picker that defaults the
iOS like forms that we submit and right
now we are working with Google in order
to create I get some more immersive date
picker in order to just provide a better
experience I think we have a slight
advantage in that they actually create
the date picker based on the Airbnb
react date picker so integration we did
a really quick and dirty implementation
and it didn't seem to be that difficult
to do
but in regards to whether or not it's
better or it's worse like we don't have
enough data to say sorry thank you
question I'm working for an advertiser
company and what I heard about em HTML
ads sounds very interesting but I have
some questions concerning the problems
were the concerns a customer from us
would have because they they want to
make sure everything they supposedly
which they paid for would have been seen
so they want to have their own tracking
system so is there a way to add a third
party tracking in HTML ads yeah I mean I
think in in either method so like you do
the way we do it or the regular HTML you
could definitely add additional
third-party tracking and you can do it
in a couple ways like you can do just
like a third-party tracking pixel that
would call back to them like a
traditional kind of pixel or you can do
like the mode analytics and things like
that for a lot of advertisers want to
use mode or something else to verify
view ability and things like that that's
all supported through amp analytics so
you can definitely do either way thank
you and another audience question yeah
this is the same thing about a Google
web designer so if we designed the ads
on Google web designer and it's aunt
Belle dated it was still me - it was
still need a special key for the ads to
be served yes you would still need they
would still need to be signed for
serving even if we go through Google
AdWords so we download it to the local
folder and then we upload them into
Google AdWords we still need to have a
special key how would I go through that
yeah so if you're just using Google
AdWords Google is a signer and Google
will just sign sign them before
delivering them so I'll just introspect
to see if it's an am HTML ad notice sign
up and deliver it the server-side
signing model that I described in my
talk is is what happens there all right
thank you
hi I have a question about your ability
so as a publisher we moved to selling
only the viewable ads and Adam maybe you
could share some data on how the ability
changes when we implement amp I don't
have exact Strax - with me right now but
if you're talking about just amp pages
viewability is through the roof
compared to non amp pages we also give
the ability sort of configuration
options to publishers where you can do
things like okay how quickly do I want
to lazy load a certain ad on an amp page
and you can basically start to tweak
those things depending on sort of your
needs and how much sort of obviously
advertisers advertising with you based
on the general view ability percentages
so you can it's basically configurable
it's much more so technically you're
talking about fast fetch right yes okay
thank you thank you
good so I will I'll turn to a couple
more questions that we got through the
question site there are a couple related
questions about building ecommerce
experiences so they'll read them both
and then feel free to address and
whatever order you like so the first
question is what is the investment
required in terms of time and resources
in building a fully functional amp
website from scratch which replicates a
full funnel ecommerce experience okay
and then the second one which I'll just
add on is really about maintenance and
so there questions about in terms of
comparing the maintenance and support of
an amp ecommerce experience to a nod or
prior ecommerce experience so again I'll
at least a start than anyone else can
join in yeah definitely I so I think
that it really ranges and I think that
you maybe got that impression today as
well where all the Express was able to
build the bulk of their site in
canonical amp in two months whereas
Airbnb they have a lot of existing
infrastructure that needed to adapt in
order to use amp and that's taken them
much longer right so it really depends
on sort of what tools you're currently
using what the the state of your site
currently is as to how long it would
take to
a revamped version I will say that the
amp team is is happy to work with you
through that process and to help
decrease frictions where we can and
really work with you through that and we
are trying to make it easier for all
sites and you know not just the all the
expresses of the world but really for
all sites to build ecommerce experiences
easily the second part of the question
was really about ongoing maintenance and
support you know so how what are the
comparisons are trade-offs of
maintaining an amp ecommerce experience
versus non amp or whatever prior
experience did before right so from the
performance standpoint I think that if
you are optimizing speed on your own you
are constantly going to have to make
sure that you're keeping the site
performance high right as you're adding
new features as you're changing your
pages this is something that's always
going to be on your plate right with amp
you don't have to worry about that
anymore as long as your pages validate I
think that Michael put this really well
it's binary right if they validate
they're going to be fast if they don't
validate then you probably need to fix
those errors but once you do then those
pages will be fast you don't need to
worry about maintaining the site
performance in terms of relying on the
amp library we are we obviously make it
a priority not to unintentionally break
anything as we are shipping new features
I think that this was one of the okay
ours that we had and it was shared
yesterday in the keynote and the the
what's next is something that we're
continuing to prioritize of course as
you see things changed let us know but
that's definitely a priority for us
good anyone else want to take that one
before I move on to the next so in terms
of how long it takes to get set up I
mean I think everybody's reaching its
one year anniversary for when we started
working on amp so the hard part wasn't
was the infrastructure was difficult as
you may have guessed from what Gil is
talking about but it will leave the the
the difficult part was one convincing
leadership that it's worth it into
actually dialing down your your
experimentation your logging because for
us getting all that getting all the amp
impressions and impressions into like
our core data infrastructure like we're
still working on it we don't have an
timeline just because
like to is there's there's so much work
that needs to be done to get like Ampata
into core data so that the rest of
leadership can see it so it's I think it
really depends on where you're working
and the existing infrastructure that you
have set up thank you
let's see any more audience questions
all right I'll go to another couple
questions from the site this will go to
probably Vamsi some questions about amp
stories and ads which may you know may
have been addressed earlier today but
the particular questions what ad formats
will be supported by amp stories
traditional ads won't cut it and there
needs to be a richer format for them as
well and then related question is there
a timeline for ad support in amp stories
and specifically DFP support so yes I
agree that regular ads just won't cut it
for AM stories so we are working on as
you saw in the DAC a few different
formats primarily to the ability to sort
of make it look very native so it
shouldn't be a sort of different
experience so you should be able to sort
of tap away right after you hit an ad
just like you would tap away if you
don't like the current organic story
page that you're looking at so that's
one format but there's some really cool
experiences that are possible where you
build the entire ad inside of a story
itself so it's a story within a story so
being able to kind of go into the story
and kind of tell especially for
publisher sponsored content is evolving
as an advertising format and they could
use stories to do that it's gonna be
phased I don't we don't have like exact
timelines but one thing I want to say is
want to ensure the whatever advertising
model we build is based on top off the
existing amp HTML infrastructure and
also we want not just double-click but
every single ad network to participate
in that just like how am at regular amp
ads have close to 100 ad networks
participating we'd like similar sort of
adoption in the stories kiss as well so
we are working with the double-click
team no specific timelines but it's it's
gonna well announce that soon to follow
up on that
yeah I know that there been a handful of
publishers who've worked on piloting and
developing stories have those publishers
also to your knowledge been working on
figuring out how they bring advertising
into those stories or is that kind of
next phase for them
yeah they initially started to
experiment but to be honest it's a
really really early format we don't know
how it's going to be consumed on the
mobile web so I think publishers have
been pretty patient and trying to just
focus on innovating and building a great
product and then sort of focusing on
monetization sort of quickly after but
yeah we've been having some early
conversations about it right now
good thank you let's see will will flip
back to e-commerce question the hybrid
amp component patterns shown during the
e-commerce talks are great do these
companies plan on sharing these and
future patterns for e-commerce so that
you can answer that on behalf of those
companies or more broadly in terms of
guidance and examples for e-commerce
sites to follow so I'm not entirely sure
what the hybrid components are referring
to if it is just you know the
combination of different components that
sites are using to achieve certain
features I think that we are we are
trying to spotlight more of the
implementations that sites have so we
recently launched amp spotlight which
shows some really cool implementations
that different sites have in different
verticals so you can check it out look
at their source code and and see an
example of how to implement a feature
and we're trying to do that more and
more especially in e-commerce because
building some of these experiences you
know if somebody else has figured it out
likely you can leverage that and we hope
to help you do that yeah and I think we
also got some good examples of the
thought process that goes into deciding
which pages to do in what order and how
to prioritize them so hopefully we can
well we'll have those presentations
obviously and share more about that
let's see is there so this one hasn't
this is another ad roadmap question is
there a roadmap when pre mid post rolls
will be available in amp videos because
we still have to work around to
commercial we still have to have
workarounds to commercialize our videos
it's launched the anti-v video component
that I briefly talked about essentially
allows you to serve pre post and mid
role video ads and come in ships with a
video player as well so it's really
straightforward to start to monetize
your video content with ads from for
example Google but other other places
too good good pre cached answer awesome
let's see a question for ads er how do
you track impressions and visibility
without JavaScript yes so so with
impressions you use the amp and I am
pixel right so you can you can pass down
any pixel that a advertiser wants to
load with an amp pixel and then the same
with amp analytics this is similar like
the in-person question if the advertiser
has a mote tag what we can do is we just
put that mote tag as a value that comes
back in the JSON and then in the
template we can have amp analytics and
you can load that mote tag into the amp
analytics and it works just like it
would normally so really anything that
you know buyer wants to go to track they
can do with that just to clarify we're
not saying no JavaScript we're just
saying no our Twitter JavaScript as long
as we know the JavaScript that's inside
the amp project and we know it because
we merged it we think it's pretty
performant
it's fine but what what we had generally
have a problem with is with arbitrary
JavaScript which can do whatever it
wants how how to do so how do we deal
with I think we could kind of address
this with third-party analytics scripts
and tag containers in amp how to make
marketing teams happy so I think I think
this is another question again if
answered we can indicate that about
these sort of third-party tracking both
analytics and ads so we do support a lot
of the third-party analytics tools that
are available so I think Adobe Analytics
is an example of that where they have an
amp integration with amp analytics that
you can use if you are using an
analytics platform that is not currently
supported by amp please file an issue
with us please let your analytics
form know that you are building ant
pages and you would like to use their
tools it's really up to them to sort of
build the amp integration of course we
are happy to help with that process but
you know putting pressure both on them
and on us can can help that that process
move along yeah you know I might
actually you know so I'm not add on to
that with another question for you guys
you know I you know I know I hear you
probably hear from time to time from ad
tech companies or other vendors in the
ecosystem who want to participate in amp
or or from publishers who wish their
third-party vendors were amp enabled do
you have any advice or guidance when you
how do you answer those questions when
they come to you yeah I mean I think
definitely letting us know so that we
can work with them helps I think that
but also letting them know right that
you're building amp pages and it's a
priority for you is really important and
I think a good example of that is that
you know with Magento the community was
really active so that Magento is a CMS
tool for e-commerce and then the
community was really active in saying
that you know amp pages are important to
us we're seeing that they're good for
users we're seeing that they're good for
revenue give us a way to build them
right and you can see that there were
some third-party plugins that were built
already members of the community we're
trying to figure out ways that they
could build it out and eventually the
Magento team you know became very aware
of these concerns and they've started to
really expand their amp support and work
with us to to build out a tool that
makes it easy for for their customers to
build amp pages so you think both
letting us know and both letting that
whatever third-party vendor that is let
them know that it's important to you or
both good steps and getting it done
especially if it's just I'm gonna talk
from an ads perspective if it's just
surfing regular ads on to amp pages 99%
of the cases things should just work and
we're trying to sort of remove this
confusion by documenting better but in
the amp HTML ads case yes we have a ton
of documentation online it's literally
somebody just needs to spend a little
bit of time going in there and checking
it out but as Lisa mentioned we're happy
to sort of coordinate that entire
process and making the process easy so
feedback welcome
good thank you I'll remind anyone anyone
microphones up there if anyone else has
any questions for the panel I will
here's one for me so as we talk you know
we talk often about achieving parity
between an amp experience and a nominal
non amp experience and in our efforts to
sort of either you know reproduce or
approximate capabilities that we have in
a non amp experience and amp I would ask
are there any cases where you maybe
perhaps have chosen not to reproduce in
amp something that existed in a you know
in a standard format or where you have
implemented something with amp and then
taken that experience or that
implementation back to an odd amp
environment yes so for us in direct
advertising so when we have a direct
relationship with an agency there can be
some difficulties with executing there
some of the formats that they provide us
with within an app environment equally
some of the technologies that we use
with an artist and our own web pages
such as our data management platform
don't work that great with an amp
however you know with the developments
that we've seen with gwd today we're
looking to try and improve that as well
we're also in open communications with
these technologies now with the changes
that we're seeing via RT C we know I had
there's more no more leg room for us to
essentially experiment with making more
calls so the problems that we're looking
to solve and like the next year but
those are the main differences with
mobile web and ANP and then with respect
to the from like a revenue perspective
the stuff that I was speaking about
today has actually helped a lot to help
us make parity with respect to the
revenue per page so if we look at now if
we look at a from a programmatic only
perspective so if we exclude direct and
we can also include affiliate in this
for the past two months we've actually
made had a higher revenue per page for
just programmatic
anam than we did which is pretty cool
but that doesn't include direct and
direct is a bit of an issue for us to
solve by the tools that we discussed
briefly mentioned one of the things that
is on the regular web and that doesn't
sort of we learned from what went wrong
at the regular web was header bidding
for example in the regular web with
header bidding there's a non-blocking
call before - to some third party before
the actual ad server gets called and we
learned that that's just not reasonable
right we want to make sure the ad
experience is great and also that the
user that the page itself is great from
a user experience standpoint so we
ensured that with when we built the RTC
framework that every single RTC call out
needs to come back within 500
milliseconds and if it doesn't it just
basically goes ahead and makes the ad
server call anyway so it's kind of
putting the pressure on the ecosystem
decided sort of raise the bar and start
to become better about how quickly they
start to respond to these RTC call outs
that's good does it anyone else good
let's see a question for Airbnb the
question is pretty succinct to the core
the audience question is was it worth it
I'll expand on that a little bit I think
you gave us a great sense of how you
have sort of kind of triangulated around
figuring out how and where to implement
amp you know what kind of what's your
what's your plan going forward is it
worth it it's a pretty good question
yeah I think in for me I I believe that
amp is worth it I mean the the biggest
or the memory that sent up the most
about amp was that I think the first
thing that we launched it we launched
amp to ten cities I think was like
Mountain View San Francisco New York I
remember going to like our p.m. meeting
and showing our VP of engineering hey
like here's amp here it is live I
remember like he clicked on it it loaded
instantly and I he like he freaked out
he literally spent the next hour walking
around the office showing anybody that
he saw hey check this out like look if I
could go air be me Berlin hit this
berlin page
instantly so on that and like you know
just being able to see somebody like hit
our page and insted I think like it was
a hundred percent worth it
to be able to like access our website
instantly so that and yeah it was
definitely worth like all the work that
we put in is more and I think it's worth
all the future work that we're going to
put in it's awesome it's awesome great
and and I think to your point and to the
earlier question about how do you
convince stakeholders I think that for
many of us myself included the best
thing you can do is show them the phone
and show them how fast it loads that is
more effective than you know 100
PowerPoint slides so that is a that is a
really good note to almost tie this up I
think I'm gonna probably ask one more
question unless there's anything from
the audience so I think that the pre-bid
stuff is gonna be huge
anyone who's been working with
publishers and advertisers understands
how much they wanted to have that in amp
are there any other like any other big
things that you know that you guys would
have in mind that you hear from
customers that we have planned that
you'd want to talk about that would help
us you know I think I think the goal is
right not just to get to parity but to
blow by parity well one of the issues
that we've had over the past couple of
months is that as was discussed earlier
in a question we're doing essentially
like an embed of our own player via the
app by frame method which means that
we're running essentially a bit of a
janky player that doesn't monetize as
well because we're not making a proper
call to the IME SDK and doesn't have
we're not getting into the weeds too
much essentially it doesn't feel as well
as using like a dedicated app element so
as soon as we are push the code to
enable pre-bid via RT c then we're going
to start focusing on other things like
building out the dedicated and by may
video element and also once we normalize
our code there is a lot of developments
both with in the amp ecosystems such as
RTC and what are what are the other five
things that you can now call books a
minute we only call one remote point now
we're going to be able to call five so
what are we gonna do with this four
other points but then also things like
there's actually a new framework for
pre-bid which also in gives some new
functionality so then we
start to play about with that as we are
within our web environments outside of
that there's several other points that
Vamsi mentioned such as the refreshing
of the ads and the fluid stuff
definitely all interesting probably
going to do some multi-format stuff so
that we've got the fluid stuff competing
with the existing demand as well but
we're kind of a little bit parked in a
minute because we want to normalize our
code with the pre bit of RTC and then we
can still look to do all this other
interesting stuff over the next few next
next six months or so and just finally
quickly I did mention in my slide the
changes that we've been working on with
the amp team for the changes in dynamic
CSS classes component that's also really
interesting to us as well because once
we can have like do specific configs and
once you know all the rappers get
onboard and build isolations for this it
means you can start to differentiate
your global setup to potentially make
you more money so for e-commerce
I think that we've mentioned the date
picker a few times now we're just really
excited about it for travel in general I
think that we have a lot of plans this
year to better support payments and
check out it's something that we're
emphasizing you know we want to be able
to give you all the tools you need to
successfully collect payments from your
customers and so I don't have anything
that I can publicly share right now but
it is something that we're prioritizing
and that we're excited about for the
future and in general I think that you
know there's a lot of things that are
happening in e-commerce that maybe we're
not even quite aware of so for example
the star rating the difficulty that that
exists in implementing that at the very
created level that Aliexpress did that
was something that was kind of new to us
you know we thought that the solution
that we had in place would work fairly
well but as Michael mention if you want
you know a thousand different degrees of
difference there it can be really
difficult and so that's something that
we've now prioritized on our product
roadmap is giving first-class support to
that so as you see things that you know
seem to be a little bit more difficult
than you would like to build let us know
through issues on github it's something
that we definitely take into account as
we're building our product roadmap
anything else
right and we are perfectly on time I
want to thank everybody on the panel
thank you for your great presentations
and for for everybody we are at lunch
hour so please say lunch is in the same
place as it was yesterday enjoy
yourselves and we'll see you back here
in an hour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
