amp keynote at Google I 2017 now if
you've gone all the way I think you've
now made it to the forced keynote is
that about right so while we can't
guarantee you this be the most exciting
one we can guarantee it's going to be
the fastest because we're the amp team
we are Han Elena and I am Malta thanks
for coming so what is M in a nutshell
it's an open source project for creating
superfast web pages and we've been
around for a while and just wanted to
give you a quick overview how things
started so amber's release as a
Developer Preview
in October 2015 and then in February
2016 for the first time it was released
consumers as the amp top story carousel
in Google search you might have seen
this before there's this like blue
carousel and you type it thinks low
absolute instantly you can swipe through
the stuff
so this is the this was the first time
and came to users later that year in the
summer of 2016 we announced the project
called amp at that we're going to talk
about later today then in September of
that year and became eligible for all
normal Google search results and things
progressed so 2017 we had the first ever
M comp if you've not been there you
should definitely come to the next one
it was really nice and today I'm excited
to announce that this top star is
carousel that used to be only available
in some countries is now available
worldwide in every single country with
Google search is serving web traffic
thank you now the things we want to talk
about today is amp across publishing and
platforms the topic I think we're most
excited about right now anthony commerce
since progressive web apps the kind of a
thing at i/o we kind of want to talk
about how they relate to amp
since we're an open source project we
will be open with the challenges that
the project is facing and how we're
addressing them and then finally we're
going to talk about amp ads let's just
tank take a little bit of time as to why
amp is even the same what we found is
that you know web pages sometimes load
slowly on 3G we're seeing an average 19
seconds on the other hand we know with
every second of load time conversion
rates job by 7%
similarly bad word usage is a problem
mobile now you know you might be on an
unlimited LTE plan but there's some
countries where a megabyte of data might
cost of the 5% of a person's monthly
wage on the other hand we see for
example ads and used like almost a
megabyte of data and we feel that just
cannot work as an economic model this
doesn't fit together and so this can be
summarized as the web not meeting user
expectations and that's really where M
comes in we want to get in line with
those user expectations so what is amp
doing to fix it a year ago I was on
stage here in announce this metric which
is really nice so what we're seeing is
that loaded from Google search ad pages
we're loading at the median and under
one second and that's a good number and
it was nice to see that this was
actually remained pretty consistent as
the corpus of M pages has been growing
tremendously but I'm very very excited
to announce that as of this week we're
launching an advancement that will make
all amp pages in trucks with entirely
large corpus get twice as fast
now the metric were optimizing the
metric optimize the
it's the first contentful pink so that's
the first time the browser draws
something that's actually interesting
for news article for example that would
be the text we've done other stuff to
optimize performance that's not even in
this 2x improvement many web pages user
you know the typical average your page
is 60% of the bytes for images and we've
managed to reduce byte usage across this
entire corpus of 50% so this is done
using compression but at a level where
it doesn't have visual impact and for
example for pngs
there's actually no visual difference
it's just metadata removed and so they
trust this
that's why corpus we're getting 50% less
bytes and so thinking back for you know
the data might be expensive I think this
is really really good for users
similarly you might have heard about a
thing called broadly so it's both a
Swiss bread and the name of a new
compression standard developers Google's
Uruk which is basically better than the
app the novel gzip standard that
probably all of you are hopefully using
and so we've activated this for the
Google amp cache for all documents or
we're seeing right now is a 10%
reduction in bytes for documents and we
think we can actually do a little bit
better over the next weeks or so but I
think it's a great first step cool so
this is what we were doing in terms
performance I know I want to ask Elaine
on stage to talk about amp traction
across content publishers thank you so
much Malta wow this is my very first i/o
and I am super excited to be here so
over the past year and a half I've had
the opportunity to work with a lot of
publishers and talk to them about their
experiences on amp and I've heard their
ups and their downs and talk to them
about both their successes and their
challenges in overall I've gotten the
message that amp is really working for
publishers so just for some context
since launch publishers have create
over two billion amp documents across
more than 900,000 domains up to 35
million amp documents are created across
more than 200 countries and in more than
100 languages every week every second
58 amp pages are released into the wild
that's significant and while we continue
to see a lot of new news publishers
adopting ant for creating and pages for
their websites we're really enthusiastic
about the traction among other areas
like e-commerce and travel in food and
other diverse categories of web sites
from around the world when we first are
when amp first launched publishers
wanted to know why they should devote
their resources to building and pages
for their web sites they understood that
amp was fast
that was really plain to see but they
wanted to know what they were going to
get out of it so I want to take a few
minutes to show a few examples of what a
few publishers have gotten out of amp
just a few successes first The Weather
Channel has seen a 4x increase in click
through rate on am particles into their
main site up from 21% to 90% since
launching at the beginning of the year
having instant access to information
like where to expect golf ball sized
hail like the hail seen in this
screenshot is really valuable to people
and the weather channel gets fat and
ants is clearly paying off for them Kara
offers a valuable resource for news and
entertainment information - more than
100 million people monthly across Spain
Latin America and the US and after
building ant pages for their web sites
they found people spending twice as much
time on their ant pages compared
to their regular mobile pages they also
saw a 33% increase on click-through
rates on ads that shoot and the
Singapore base we go comm is the largest
travel marketplace in the Middle East
and Asia Pacific helping people compare
travel cost from hundreds of global and
local partners and they created Ants
versions of landing pages that were
designed to support popular search
queries like cheap flights from
Singapore to Bangkok and what they found
was that conversion rates to partner
sites went up 95% and search the
conversion rates improved by 49 percent
which completely validated their effort
so we've been really impressed by the
success publishers have seen on amp and
we keep hearing more and more stories
like these and so far we talked about
the amazing growth of publishers and the
performance they have seen on amp
another critical component of amp is
that it is open to all platforms on the
Internet and already a lot of platforms
are supporting and we've seen adoption
from search engines to mobile apps and
there are a central part of the ant
community Bing Pinterest and LinkedIn
are all linking to amp pages and
pointing users to a great consistently
fast experience and recently a few new
platforms joined the ants fan language
we're really excited about Yahoo Japan
as well as China's largest search
engines so go and Baidu
are now all connecting to ant pages from
their search results bringing over a
billion people across Asia a faster web
experience
and in really exciting news amps has
gone social in China $0.10 Qzone as well
as Weibo the top two social networking
platforms in China are now bringing all
of the benefits of the amp experience to
their hundreds of millions of monthly
active users Qzone and Weibo together
with Baidu and Silvo will enable almost
all of the mobile Internet users in
China to experience the speed of amp and
now to talk about a social platform a
little closer to home we're thrilled to
share that in the coming weeks tumblr is
rolling out support for amp on more than
three three hundred and forty million of
their blog pages but those are all of
our announcements nothing is more
important to Twitter than getting users
to the content that they're looking to
reach quickly they were an early
supporter of the amp project launching
in their moments projects in 2016 and
we're thrilled to announce that Twitter
is rolling out support to the full feed
on mobile web and on their Android and
iOS native apps bringing the benefit all
of the benefits of amp to the world of
social discovery it's so encouraging to
see platforms from around the world
embracing amp like this because again
ants is all about a community coming
together and working together to improve
the mobile web for everyone and with
that I'll pass it to Ken Thank You Elena
hey everyone we're happy to announce
that amp is open for business
now when amp first started we targeted
news publishers but over the last year
we've seen a wide adoption of em across
a variety of different verticals from
recipes to help to dictionaries and as
we were looking at all these amp
documents we realized that while amp is
great for reading the news and is even
better for shopping on the internet
because amp is focused on speed and
performance and shoppers are won and
lost in the span of a second you see it
wasn't that long ago when I was a new
mom and I was really struggling to
figure out my new life and to put things
nicely I really didn't have it together
I spent the first few weeks in my house
in my pajamas did not know how to make
things work but I was lucky to be able
to make all my purchases online on my
mobile phone
everything from ordering diapers to
booking plane tickets to see family to
buying food online but the thing is it
had to be done very quickly because if
my baby woke up and started crying I put
my phone away right and then I'd
probably get back to the purchase but
maybe another day maybe another week and
more and more people are finding
themselves in situations like mine
making quick mobile making quick
purchases on their mobile phones whether
it's in between meetings or while
commuting on a train or maybe while
sitting here at Google i/o at the amp
keynote in fact boards reported that
this year half of all of ecommerce
revenue will come from
mobile and when we're doing things on
our mobile phones we have constant
interruptions right we have babies we
have colleagues we have a horrible
internet connection and we don't have
time to wait for things to low right and
that's why speed and performance is so
important
now Lee Express agrees in fact they
reported that when they reduce their
load time by 36% they were able to
increase their orders by ten and a half
percent and they were able to increase
their conversion rates by twenty seven
and a half percent people just want
their lives made easier and that's why
it's important for us to focus on speed
and performance so that we can help make
people's lives easier and this is where
amp comes in the last year amp was not
ready for e-commerce but things are now
changing and a few months ago we
introduced amp form where you can you
which you can use to search for items or
add items to a shopping cart and today
we invite you to try out amp bind the
key ingredients for e-commerce and amp
amp bind allows you to add custom
interactivity to your website so you can
do things like refine an image gallery
by color you can choose a green apple or
Red Delicious you can update your
products prices based on the size of the
product and you can tap on a button to
show more items like we do here and the
cool thing that's happening is that to
show these more items we're bringing
them via a server call without reloading
the page and you can use the same exact
mechanic to show search results or
filter or paginate or store to page what
this means is that it's now possible for
e-commerce sites to use amp
and to get to to get to parity with
their canonical pages and we have new
e-commerce features coming out every
single week from dynamic form validation
to payments and currently we're working
on autocomplete on getting it out the
door so if you want to see code samples
for e-commerce with amp go to amp by
example.com / ecommerce and to start
playing with am fine go to bitly slash
and bind now we have retailers like eBay
and Zalando and Alibaba and they're all
building superfast shopping experiences
for their users with em Aliexpress
reported that they saw a 4% up list in
conversion via M and zalando which is
one of the top fashion e-commerce
retailers in Europe they've been rolling
out amp for their product detail pages
and finally eBay eBay believed early on
that amp clearly aligns with their core
strategy and they were one of the first
e-commerce sites to bet on amp in a big
way last summer
they launched all of their product
listing pages with em and today we're
happy to announce that eBay is launching
all of their products pages worldwide on
amp and they'll go live this summer this
is going to enable users to search for a
product on Google and buy it on eBay in
mere milliseconds so if you want to
learn more about e-commerce and amp we
have a dedicated session to just this
topic and you're welcome to join us
Friday at 3:30 p.m. on stage 6 and now I
like to welcome Malta back to the stage
talk to you about progressive web apps
Thank You Han yeah let's talk about
pwace and apps so he who here has heard
about progressive web apps today already
yes
almost everyone so but let's still take
a quick look like what progressive web
web apps are to bringing a bunch of new
features to the web platform that used
to be a thing you only find on natives
their stuff like push notifications
offline support ability to add your web
app to the home stream just like a
native app and stuff like access to easy
payments there's more stuff but I think
those are kind of the most most
important ones and what they're bringing
is the long-term engagement that you
would otherwise only find out in native
apps together with the discoverability
of web apps so you know I work for
Google we built a search engine and it
kind of enables people to come to
websites that works really well and
other people have found that it's not as
easy to get someone to install an app
pwh bring those together and make a
really really good business case now
this is kind of where M comes in because
pwace rely on the technologies called
service workers and they're
transparently installed when you first
go to the PWA but there's the first time
the user experience might not be at
stock yet because you don't have the
service worker installed now last year
here at Google i/o Alex Russell who's
also kind of the inventor of pw8 in
general coined this term starts as data
that's what amp is doing so if you build
amp pages and then have those amp pages
install the service worker the F is
continuous awesome user experience for
the first contact with your brand a 3 or
M page and it loads in an instant and
then from there you go on and have the
awesome engagement features of pwace
that was last year we've consistently
improved this experience by the way kind
of an anagram awesome contribution from
the internet so what we've done is we've
we've built infrastructure that makes it
really easy to build your PWA based on
your amp pages and it turns out that
works really well again it's great for
users they get the fast and first load
time experience and then you're amazing
a PWA for subsequent with it but it's
also great for business because it turns
out that with this approach you can
invest in em today and then make that
count for your investment your PWA in
the future so basically our message is
good bad to go and in today because you
kind of want to have a PWA but it's a
longer-term bed but those are paying
into the same destination so this is
kind of how the user flow works you know
user discovers content so they might
search for it on Google or as referred
earlier today from Elena Twitter will
start linking to am content across their
apps right to discover content they
click a load superfast because an amp
page now that amp page installs your
serviceworker in the background all
silently and every next click is getting
the user into your PW experience there's
a few companies out there who've already
done this for example of thing which is
a German business social networks they
recently launched a PWM combo for the
job search so for example you might
search for a job on Google which we've
learned today is now more of a thinning
and you know we come to their landing
page that's an EM page of those in an
instant installs the serviceworker and
then any click that gets you more into
the funnel to actually get that job it's
driven by the PWA serviceworker and it's
superfast Rockton which is a Japanese
site that does all kinds of things
launched is for the recipe site and they
were seeing some great metrics with time
spent for users going through the amp
funnel went up by 50% and the CTR from
the landing page down into the other
recipes which is really I think this
thing they're driving we're number three
point six percent now I only scratched
the surface there's way more to this so
there's a talk tomorrow about Paul Bako
is going to detail on stage six it's
9:30 a.m. that talks about how PWA and
onboard
together next up as Elina again talking
about the challenges event thanks Martha
so as an open source initiative we feel
like it's really important to be
transparent in acknowledging that not
everything about Amp is perfect and when
the community shares feedback and gets
better and the community has shared a
lot of feedback we really appreciate it
and so we thought we would take some
time to share some of the feedback that
we've heard and how we are working to
address some of those challenges so one
bit of feedback we've heard is that all
aunt pages look the same and this can be
true to an extent we admit that we need
to make it easier for publishers to
build unique aunt pages that represent
their own brand identities we've also
heard feedback from publishers having a
hard time accurately measuring the
success of their aunt pages and to be
honest we messed up a little bit here
it's currently challenging to get
metrics right another category of
feedback we've heard is around amp URL
displayed in Google search and I'll talk
them a little bit more about this and
another thing that we've heard is that
aunt pages do not monetize well through
ads and it's true that there are a
number of restrictions on bag ad
behavior however is even with these
limitations we're surprised to get this
monetization feedback so now I'll go
through each of these points of feedback
and talk about how we're addressing them
so starting with the first one that all
amp pages look the same first of all
like all web pages and pages are styled
in CSS and are fully customizable and
anyone can build and contribute to the
library of custom and
opponents that allow for creative page
design and flexibility and that library
of components is constantly growing with
feedback from the community and one
there's one new component that gives
designers more flexibility is parallax
the parallax extension allows for an
elements on a page to move as if it is
nearer or farther relative to the
foreground on a page when the user
Scrolls producing a 3d like effect but
we realized that not everyone is a
designer or has designer resources and
we really needed to take that into
consideration and so this past spring we
announced a start and answer is a set of
templates that can get anyone started
quickly with amps documents and it
eliminates a lot of the heavy listings
in terms of the design work and we're
working on building out this set of
templates that people can choose from
and and modify to build their own unique
amp pages and if you want to learn more
about building beautiful interactive amp
pages be sure to check out the talk
that's entirely devoted to this topic on
Friday afternoon at 3:30 so another
point of feedback is that it's currently
challenging to get ant metrics right and
the first thing I want to say is that
amp is still relatively new and it
really pushes the boundaries in terms of
the kinds of user experiences that you
can create and in ensuring that content
is as fast as it possibly can be it
takes advantage of things like platform
caching and pre-rendering and some of
these things make it a little bit
challenging to measure amp
and in the last few months we've
launched a few features like link inform
substitutions to better assist
publishers in attributing page visits
back to amp and we've also published
documentation to illustrate techniques
that people can use when collecting
their own analytics directly and we're
also really committed to working with
vendor partners to ensure that they're
incorporating updates and building
features to support more reliable and
accurate an't metrics yesterday actually
Google Analytics announced the rollout
of an enhancement that unifies users
across amps and non amp pages served
from a website's domain and this is
really going to improve user analysis
across the two formats this change is
going to take effect over the upcoming
weeks and is actually the first and a
few planned changes that will enhance
ant's traffic understanding for google
analytics clients so another bit of
feedback is that not everyone likes ant
URLs displayed in Google search and more
specifically we've heard user and
publish your feedback that it isn't easy
to copy and paste links to articles on
amp and it's frustrating to not be able
to access the original article URL and
to that we'd say that we agree and
actually the ant projects adopted the
guidance that platforms that are linking
to ant content should share the original
article URL when this is technically
possible Google search has just rolled
out a button across mobile web mes your
header where users can tap the display
the publisher link and have on the link
itself to navigate to the canonical and
long press the copy/paste
and on native apps where we have more
control over sharing functionality we
always share the publisher URL and the
last thing I want to address is the
feedback that aunt pages do not monetize
well with that the Google Ad Exchange
actually ran some tests comparing
monetization for the same publisher
across their amp and non aunt pages and
what they found was that over ninety
percent of publishers experienced higher
click-through rates in over 70% of
publishers experienced higher
viewability on their aunt pages and what
we realized was that the publishers who
had been underperforming on their aunt
pages we're actually just putting fewer
ads on their aunt pages but when
comparing apples to apples in terms of
ad placement monetization results on amp
pages exceeds non aunt pages they do
better so that's a great segue to hen
who's going to talk all about and Pat
thank you
Thank You Elena so if you remember I was
just talking about being a new mom and
what I wanted to tell you is that I am
the perfect demographic for advertisers
advertisers love people like me because
I'm about to buy a bunch of baby things
I have no previous knowledge about the
things I'm about to buy and I have zero
brand loyalty I don't know who makes
what I'm going to learn all of that soon
advertisers love my demographic but
remember I'm also sleep-deprived so I'm
tired because I didn't get to sleep at
night and I'm hungry because I didn't
have time to eat and I have a crying
baby so do you think that when I open a
page I'm going to sit there and wait for
a slow ad to load no way nobody waits
for slow ads to load least of all me and
I'm the perfect demographic that they
want to advertise to if then ad wants to
be seen it better load quickly so ask
made pages lightning fast but ads are
slow and we wanted to fix this we wanted
to make sure that ads can load at the
same speed as our amp pages as a content
on the amp pages and when we look at ads
we realize that ads have the same
problem as regular web pages they're
slow they're disruptive they have
unwanted JavaScript with no performance
guarantees and they're potentially
unsafe and this is something we really
care about we want to make sure our
users have a safe online experience so
what we did was we apply the same
performance principles of amp to add and
we called it an tag am ads are ads that
are created in amp format and they're
fast because they have no third-party
JavaScript and all of the code is
guaranteed to be performance optimized
and they're light because they have
reusable components like app analytics
and amp pixels which collects all the
information one time and then they give
it to authorized vendors and what this
does by collecting information only one
time it relieves the burden on the
browser and they're safe because we sign
all of our amp ads to ensure that
they're valid so they should contain any
malvert izing so I'm going to show you
the difference between an amp ad and a
regular ad and what happened was triple
lists they ran a bunch of amp ads and
regular ads side-by-side and they ran
they ran them on amp pages and let's see
what the difference looks like so on the
right we have a regular ad it's taking
forever to load there is no way that I'm
going to wait for that ad to load not in
a million years but on the left side we
have an amp ad and it loads
instantaneously I'm definitely going to
have a chance to see that one and on top
of that triple live reported that amp
ads when compared to regular ads or
three times lighter six times faster and
they generate more revenue for
publishers
all right so amp ads are wonderful but
how do you build them well you can build
them yourself just like in amp page or
you can use various tools that are
available to you such as cell treads ad
creator tool let's take a look this is
an editor and the cool thing about this
is that you can create amp ads using
this editor without having any technical
knowledge I highly recommend you try it
out so there are a lot of early pioneers
that implement support for an ads and
they're a lot more in the process we
have publishers that are delivering amp
add to their web pages
we have you can sign your amp ads with
Google or with CloudFlare there are
various creative tools that you're
welcome to use to create an to ads and
there are more and more ad servers that
are beginning to support amp so we have
the entire ecosystem and overall our
vision is to make amp ads the de facto
standard for ads on the web all right so
if you want to learn more about amp ads
we have an entire session dedicated to
talking just about that tomorrow morning
at 8:30 on stage 5 and I know it's
really early but what's more important
than talking about ads at 8:30 in the
morning so hopefully we'll see you all
there and to wrap things up I like to
welcome back Malta again right I want to
talk about contributing to amp the amp
is an open source project I managed the
team at Google that works full-time on
this project but we you know we really
want to want it to be an open project
and we want to have your we would like
to have your contribution to it we as a
project relief on github and it has been
kind of been in a way a bit popular so
we just trust through 10,000 stars which
I don't really know what that means but
I'm really excited about it but way more
important over 400 of you has been
contributing with actual pull requests
with their own code to the amp project
and I think that kind of proves is it
truly distributed meaningful open-source
projects now we don't want to stand
still at this stage so we did a few
things or the last months to make the
project more transparent and to increase
the level of engagement for the
community to be a part of em one thing
we've done is we've launched these
weekly design reviews on hangouts so
here's a picture of my team but there's
people on the Hangout and allows
everyone to go to our github issue that
we create every week say I would like to
