product manager for M and you've been
talking about e-commerce and how M can
be used for e-commerce application
everywhere on mobile and desktop yeah
definitely so I think that with the
launch of an bind we really now believe
that amp is ready for all of the
verticals and e-commerce and in the last
year that's what we've really seen is
that many different companies across
verticals across the world have adopted
amp and really seen huge success with it
right because the the fundamental theory
is that if you put your content in front
of your users more quickly they're more
likely to engage with you and hopefully
buy something from you and I think we
have stats to prove that so 53% of users
will leave a site after three seconds of
loading an e-commerce 79 percent of
users won't come back to a site that was
poorly performing so if they had trouble
browsing through things if they had
trouble buying some things they might
buy that one time but then they won't
come back
I'm other points where you should maybe
use the app at a certain point in your
site and not use them somewhere else on
your site we believe that you can use
amp for the full conversion funnel for
your full site and we've really seen
that right so Aliexpress is one of the
biggest e-commerce sites in the world
and they've gone all-in on image so
they're building all of their site and
amp and they've seen more than 40%
decrease in page load times and they
seen over 4% increase in conversions and
so that amount of speed that you're
gonna get on every step of the flow is
huge
so I'm told I can now build my site with
amp for a desktop and for mobile yes and
we actually have on amp start com a
whole component system where you could
just take pieces that are interactive so
you could use the sidebar menu component
for that full functionality on both
mobile and desktop then we also have
full templates for e-commerce blogs we
have a restaurant template and even a
gallery template was like really cool
interactive experiences and you're
saying there's now a Digg picker module
of some sort yeah so the date picker is
really awesome because formerly you had
to essentially use different form
elements and combinations but this has
just like any other day picker you would
see in like a booking site for travel
say it has even visual design baked into
the default so that you don't have to
custom style if you don't want to but
you totally can and you were saying
there's a lightbox gallery now what is
that yeah that's a really cool feature
that we just launched where it enables
any image on the page just show up in
this lightbox fully immersive experience
again both on desktop and mobile and any
other device size and then users can
actually page through those images as
you would a gallery okay thanks a lot
ivy Thank You Man
thanks to components like ant bind and
ant list our amp pages have feature
parity with their canonical counterparts
they look and feel and function exactly
the same except for they're just much
much faster Daffy has been really useful
for you guys it sounds like yeah I mean
we consistently see improved
click-through rate from search we
consistently see improved performance
which yields lower bounce rates and
higher engagements and higher conversion
rates throughout the purchasing funnel
and we're now finally seeing desks our
mobile sites that rival the desktop site
in terms of conversion rates when our
progressive web app sites are incredibly
fast they use features like payment
requests and add to homescreen for
reengagement offline access through
serviceworker these web sites are
finally converting at a higher rate
they're easier to use they're faster to
use yeah equals downloads for longer
absolutely
and we knew we wanted to offer amp to
our users so we figured why not just go
all-in and it kind of eliminated
framework choice overload for us we knew
we wanted to amp so we just went full
steam ahead being with an amp really
helped us you know stay on the right
track you don't even we had these this
ecosystem and these you know
requirements we knew we had to like
follow to be am valid so this was a
really great you know track for us to be
on to make sure no matter what new thing
we added we weren't gonna be adding a
ton of CSS that's gonna make the size of
the page go super huge so there was
trick shion's of amp really kept you
guys honest and made you keep things
simple and rended feature creep exactly
yeah
and it was actually cool to contribute
to the amp open source like in the case
that we didn't have you know support for
something like I had to add in print
functionality something super simple
like that I was able to actually
contribute that get that merged in and
get it into production so that was
pretty cool too
so try it out is what we're saying yeah
we're saying try it out if you have any
feedback if there are features that you
want that we don't have if there are
bugs that you see let us know in github
we're more than happy to work with you
ecommerce is still I think in the early
stages for ants and so as an e-commerce
company if you start working with amp
now you really have this opportunity to
shape the direction of what we're
building and shape what comes next on
our roadmap and so we really encourage
all the sites to take advantage of that
that sounds great well thanks a lot Lisa
for being here with us of course thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
