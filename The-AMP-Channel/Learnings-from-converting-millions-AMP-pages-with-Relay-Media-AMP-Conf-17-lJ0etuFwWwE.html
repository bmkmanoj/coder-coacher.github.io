Relay media and we're a company that
converts existing sites to amp and when
Paul asked me to do this we talked about
what talked about and it was sort of 16
random things we learned converting
millions of amp pages and I think to
start with I want to talk a little bit
about why we convert existing sites part
of it is really the the basic
programming principle of don't repeat
yourself you build a site you build a
responsive site it works don't build
another one we said why don't we just
take the existing responsive layout
you've got and making them and that
should be enough really shouldn't it we
do that for a number of companies we
some of which you've heard of there's a
bunch of them here and we take those
listing site without a new template
without going through and having to get
the designers involved again and without
having to have a whole engineering
effort from a public standpoint you put
one tag on the page and we do the rest
we convert about a million distinct
articles a day to amp from existing and
the average article starts off with four
hundred and forty K of CSS on it and
took a lot more about that later we get
that down to 31 K takes is about 600
milliseconds to convert an article from
cold and so we're really doing it in
real time producing quality and page we
call them high fidelity amp pages we
think you shouldn't build an amp pace
that only works on mobile it should be
responsive if you'd load it on a desktop
it should work Flipboard is currently
serving a lot of amp pages to iPads so
if you built your amp page for an iPhone
only size it's not going to look as
great on an iPad
you really need to think about amp now I
say as a all resolutions format it still
really is about what we learnt along the
way what the gotchas are and I think the
first thing to say is the HTML ramp hTML
is kind of easy mostly
this is our lives there's open-source
platforms to do it there's a number of
decent node modules that'll do a lot of
the lifting for it so I'm not really
going to spend a lot of time talking
about the HTML I will talk about some of
the edge cases on it what I will spend
some time talking about is the hard part
which is the CSS and some of the real
excuse have how do you how do you get
that 440 K of CSS down to 31 K yeah
really it's a little daunting we've
actually seen sites with as much as 800
K of CSS scary this is what has people
bail and do a new template get a new
designer problem with that is the any
typical development shop you have a list
of 20 things to do and only the top two
are ever going to get done because
things get pushed in the list all the
time and amp is generally not one of the
top two for most people so what do you
do well first problem is CSS is kind of
like that storage unit that people's
in-laws have you know the one way you've
kind of open it and shove stuff in and
shut it really quick and hope nothing
broke nobody ever takes anything out of
CSS because you don't know what
templates using it now you've got
templates all over your site obscure
stuff you really don't know what's going
to break when you take something out of
your CSS and a quick survey how many
people actually know what everything in
their production CSS does I mean one
hand at the back two hands at the back
yeah I rest my case
and a part of this is we've all been
given this model of one big CSS file and
really it's a bad idea
it's sounding good we'll build this one
big CSS file everybody will cache it the
world all oh yeah everything load really
quickly once we've got that there it'll
be the same for every page it's rubbish
it's not a good idea there's sort of
reasons why it's not a good idea one is
that most people are one two three four
pages are dumb and those four pages are
typically the same template and so
they're really not using the vast
majority
your CSS on your site the other thing is
people don't take things out of it there
are sites we've seen and I won't name
them but that still have that the CSS
for their Olympics coverage and their
2016 election coverage in their in their
site and all the things than that
the other things you one big file
doesn't actually get cached it might on
the desktop where there's lots of space
when you put it on a phone it doesn't
get cached that much it gets flushed out
of cache some people you can put cash
Busters on there on there CSS and change
it every day so it really doesn't get
cached so it's just not a good way to do
CSS you should really be doing per page
CSS and this will go out how to do that
for amp so will you do if you filter all
the CSS and you don't include the rules
you use sounds easy enough really than
that and if you do it simplistically it
actually is relatively easy this and
some gotchas but it's really slow the
basically you get your amp page you get
your CSS file you run every selector
against your amp page and you see which
one's hit things and you include those
and if you can spend you know 300
milliseconds the page to do that then
great that we can't so we figured out
how to do that a little bit faster
actually a lot faster than that and the
first thing to know is that it it really
doesn't matter what matches the CSS rule
it just matters that something does or
more importantly that nothing does if
you want to throw the rule away right so
it doesn't care if it's a you know
whether there's five dot foods or $20 on
the page or where the dot foo is on the
page use carry is there a dot foo so the
first thing you're going to do here is
you go through and you find all the
things so the trick is walk the Dom once
you go through the Dom we're using we
happen to use cheerio and node on the
episode you through the DA once you
collect all look all the ideas you
collect all the classes you collect all
the element names and you store them
someplace you can find them first we
really like es6
sets they're a lot faster than using
objects as hashes just as an aside if
you're a Java Script type person and so
once you've done this you've got this
big list of little things that are used
on the page and the next thing you do is
you go through your CSS file and you
break up all of the selector chains into
their individual elements so you take
the dot foo and you look in your in your
big list of things and you go is go in
the left but it's not you just seem to
throw that away you don't even have to
look at the rest of the rule you go
through that and for each block of CSS
if you find you've thrown all of the
selectors away then you can throw the
block of CSS away we see I mean we've
got customers with 5,000 CSS rules and
maybe 400 of them are used on a page on
a busy page a lot of times its nearest
300 so we throw a lot of stuff away this
is definitely the faster words ten times
faster than trying to run every
selectively with a jQuery like query
against it huge performance win doing
that it's still too big you rename all
the things people get word you with
their classes and that's really nice
when you're actually trying to maintain
code and figure out what things do but
it's not nice when you need to get it
under 50k so we go through and we rename
all the classes we rename all the IDS
and there's an interesting gotcha in
this one because we did the classic
thing of you you you know you start off
with yeah a a a b a c a d and then you
find your page breaks and the reason
your page breaks is because somebody's
ad blocker saw the class that you degree
names as ad with an ad and and deleted
it so you don't start things with a the
other reason is you don't want to end up
with something that starts dot a MP
because then
the amp runtime will get petrol in the
objective as well so you have to be a
little careful about how you rename the
things and then you find that that some
developers done something clever and is
starting to use an attribute selector
with over the prefix on the class field
in order to try and match their icon
class and do something to all their
icons so you have to watch for those and
not rename them and it gets a little
looser pure edge cases in there but it
works so then what happens well you come
to important and I really want to know
who name is not important it's just it
always bugs me they important not
important done
so amp doesn't let you have bang
important in your CSS so how do you
convert this well if you start thinking
about how CSS works it's a precedence
hierarchy so you know you've got
elements classes IDs CSS actually on
their element level CSS and then
essentially bang important is another
column off beyond that so you don't we
get your classic widget if you sort of
pretend this is decimal per moment as a
precedent 10 well if you stick a couple
of IDs in front of it you can make that
precedence 210 pretending this
accessible and raised its precedents a
lot and so you can sort of fake dot
important and the nice thing about that
with two IDs is that you can put one of
them on the HTML and one of them on the
body so they're they're global for the
page so now you're going to do is fish
out all the important things put them in
a set of rules at the bottom prefixed by
the two IDs you put on the body and the
HTML and magically they have the
precedence and they behave like they
were being important even without having
a important so the am runtime is happy
it took a while to figure that one out
but it's a nice hack so nup CSS stuff
for a second edge cases iframes I like
thank friends people told them about
duck safe and anybody who's seen
Mythbusters know you can do an awful lot
of stuff with
- you can make boots with duct tape
arrow flames with duct tape we a frame a
lot of things and some of that is stuff
that originally started as a regular
a-frame there are lots of things that
get embedded on pages that are iframes
that can just be an empire frame because
they can be HTTP but they don't actually
admit they can be HTTP so you have to go
and see does this really work if you if
you turn it into an HTTP URL and we have
a whitelist we've maintained and there's
some examples here Storify and
surveygizmo and a bunch of other stuff
c-span's
embeds and so on we also had to convert
a log every iframe we find that we can't
convert it spits out a report and then I
go and have a look and see can we fix
this one later
so I framed so it's the first line of
attack for most things but then what do
you do for the stuff that's a JavaScript
embed and the answer is really - Emmet
you know in mechanical engineering world
a shim is a small piece that you put in
to make two parts fit together come from
mechanical engineering world back in the
day good example discuss comment so the
discussed comments plug-in the way it
normally works is a there's a lump of
JavaScript you put on the page it adds
an iframe element to the page the iframe
loads of comments it sends a message up
to it - it's apparent JavaScript that
says hey I want to be this long and it
gets resized and there's your comments
on the page what we did and discussed
have some sample code on their site to
do this and it's not quite robust enough
so we rewrote it is build a shim frame
and the shim frame has discussed
comments in it we pass into it the
parameters of which site and which page
and all the things that discuss needs to
build a write comment run their
JavaScript listen for their resize
messages and then send amp the amp
resize iframe message
to get amped aristos di friend so if you
want and just comment at the bottom of
the of the page typically so you know
they resize before the user ever gets
there so it works pretty well two things
to really watch that one is every iframe
you put in the page you should have a
placeholder element you know natalia
talked yesterday from Guardian about
breaking a page because somebody put an
iframe within 600 pixels at the top the
whole 600 pixel thing is silly it's
silly because you as a developer have no
way of knowing what side screen
somebody's looking at what orientation
is in what is 600 pixels from the top of
this page you know no it's 600 pixels on
an iPhone 5 or 600 pixels and iPad pro
are very different animals so you should
be putting a placeholder on every iframe
the putting on an amp page the good news
is the placeholders actually need to
have anything in it it can be an empty
div with the tags SS placeholder and
that keeps the runtime happy and it all
works so that's what we do the other
thing is you need the overflow element
because if user does scroll to the
comments really fast
it won't have resize sample I've got
petulant with you and not resized it and
so you have to have to push the button
to make this bigger thing the code for
this there's a link here and I'll put
the slides up on SlideShare and you can
go and play with the code feel free to
grab it and do things if you want to a
few other things we learn amp list it's
not just for lists so we're using amp
lists or all sorts of interesting things
this one is KOB it's one of the Hubbard
television broadcast stations it's the
weather wicket and you don't really want
to cache the weather it doesn't do well
in there
it doesn't age well in the cache shall
we say so we build the weather widget
with with an AM list and it's not a
particularly you know complicated piece
of code the only got should we do is
that we proxy there there are api to
http so that we can return the json ACPs
again to keep em happy on that but on
that it's a very simple use of amp list
and it works really well we do the same
thing this is
look we go to to slow down oh you ones
like this is from TMZ and this is their
comment count so the common count is its
dynamic on the arm
TMZ's pages and we do the same thing as
co2 it's not a list it's just a single
element that we rage axing in with with
amp list you can use it all sorts of
ways like this highly recommended so you
built this page it looks great
hanging make money out of this thing and
use the corny title we looked what is it
on the places where we actually deviate
from people's standard layout and one of
the reasons we did that is because the
what we found is a lot of people build a
responsive site they put the ads in the
right rails and then when the site folds
to mobile the ads fold underneath and
nobody sees them at the bottom of the
page they're below the article content
and and they're really not optimized and
if your ad sales team and your design
team are not really thinking about
mobile layouts versus desktop layouts
when they build a responsive you end up
with the ads not being seen so we built
an engine that dynamically insert ads
and we can do things like count
paragraphs or cam words and put put the
ads in the content stream we found that
300 by 250 year after paragraph 2 is
about the optimal place to put the first
ad and then we'll put an ad if we end
paragraphs and according to publisher
taste and that sort of typically every
three to four paragraphs and you have to
put something in that says okay what is
a paragraph because otherwise you find
they do a list and you have you know
three sentences you're three word
sentences and you have an ad between
every one that some work so you have to
appear to have a minimum word count on
your paragraphs to make that work
properly once you've done that you can
actually get to a pretty good ad yield
pretty good model one of the things we
found though is the users don't actually
scroll to the
the volume of the page and I'll talk
more about that in a minute about how we
measured it but it is really important
to have the ad in the content if you
want them seen the other thing I'd say
is don't just do vfp doe addicts that a
lot of people who came early in the amp
world started off by yeah we'll get the
sound simple amp template and we'll just
throw some some addicts ads on and see
what it does and then they complain they
didn't make any revenue and a lot of
people have talked about this over the
last day or so you really need to look
at all the ad products you're using on
your production site and say either amp
equivalent how can we maximize the
revenue we were very early on with
motivo and tedium streaming as a Teebs
in-stream video in that in the clip
there we just put kicks on some pages we
have people using alternate exchanges
you really got to look at all your ad
products and you've got to keep looking
at it it's something you put on a
calendar for every month flow what new
things are in amp this month for
advertising that the one there last
month that we should be looking at and
including in our pages this is really a
very rapidly evolving ecosystem video
pre-roll there's a reason that almost
nobody uses the amp video tag and that
reason is it doesn't support pre-roll
and pre-roll it's a really nice I CPM
high value thing whether you like it or
not particularly does user I don't like
it as a somebody who deals with making
money out of web pages I love it and so
we end up by framing everybody's video
player into to make it through the
pre-roll properly and I think it's one
of the critical things you have to you
have to look at and make sure that works
and then including direct sold inventory
you know particularly you know in the
local markets that we serve a lot of our
customers are our television station
networks
you know the direct sold inventory is a
much higher value inventory than the
programmatic and it's really important
to make sure that that's targeting the
amp pages because of them becomes a
higher and higher part of the overall
page traffic you really want to keep
that revenue up so experiments we love
amp experiment we use this for a whole
bunch of things we actually use it
splitting up ads so you know we'll do
things like 80% of the ads are one set
of ads and 20% the ads are another set
of ads and one example experiment to
manage that the cool experiments I want
to talk about that we did that had
interesting outcomes one there's this
tag data loading strategy prefer
viewability overviews how many people
have actually seen that in the amp ad
spec family so what that does is amp
when you when you look at page it
doesn't load the ad until it gets within
two and a half year part of where the
user is so the ads are lazy loaded and
if you set this flag it doesn't load the
ad until it's within one and a quarter
viewports of where the user is and the
idea is that your view ability on your
ads will jump you get a much higher view
ability if you don't load them until
they're really users about see them and
the theory there being that you'll
you'll make a higher CPM because the ad
is more viewable and that is actually
true you do make a higher CPM 2000
people we ran a large-scale test over 25
sites for a month or so doing this and I
would say if you're going to test with
ads you really need to run longer-term
tests one of the things we found is that
the the programmatic is change it can
take up to two weeks to figure out that
something changed to actually optimize
the yield curve on it what we found is
yes having more viewability on this
really does improve the CPM and it does
it quite significantly but the number of
you
drops such that the overall revenue is
still down about 10% so we went back to
the regular thing is not quite there I
think if the ad networks can start
really passing on that viewability
signal to the buy side a little better
than than that is right now that may
change because who wants to buy an app
that you can't see but right now that
isn't that isn't pass-through and then
adding part of the reason that isn't
pass-through is because there's an awful
lot of people buying ads that can't be
seen so yeah right now not there the
other one we tried was amp sticky ad
versus having the 320 by 50 top banner
and what we found with uh with that you
can like the top banner as a design
element it's kind of messy having an
adit it gets in the way of your branding
on your page so maybe we can get rid of
this and put the vision unit at the
bottom and make it work didn't work from
a revenue standpoint a lot of that was
because the initial implementation of
vision unit doesn't come up on the amp
page until you've scrolled quite a long
way there's a ticket opener man - sure
where that is in the in the process
where there is actually ticket open
where Google's going to change that so
that it comes up as soon as the page is
scrolled at all which will help but it
still didn't quite make the difference
the other one which I'm not going to
sort of name the guilty but we track how
far people scroll on the page analytics
has viewability triggers and so you can
put an amp analytics viewability trigger
on any amp element on the page to see if
it came into view so if you put one of
those on something at the bottom of the
article text you could tell where who
user got to the bottom of the article
text which is nice and then you can put
one further down it see if you've got
with all of the page there are elements
that are major roadblocks to people
reading and people have been conditioned
that when they see this element at the
bottom of the text they stop reading and
I'll leave it as an exercise for you to
figure out who those are and and what's
in them you can probably work it out
few other things we've learned this is
not strictly an amp thing but it is a
important thing to structure data people
really haven't paid enough attention to
their structured data piece of logos
here the top two are sites that we
handle and you know we've done the amp
logo we've made a nice job of it one of
the things that we noticed early on the
spec for the logo is 60 by 600 pixels if
you give that to a designer and don't
tell them the rest of the story you get
a bad outcome and the rest of the story
is that Google will render it 16 pixels
high by 160 wide so you actually have to
design it to work at 16 pixels high and
so if you look at the one at the bottom
there which is the Seattle
post-intelligencer I think I can barely
read it you know it's a much harder to
read element similar one don't just use
your masthead logo wsb-tv Atlanta is one
of our stations we work with and in
Italy that was their masthead logo is
the top one there you can see in it it
really isn't readable at the sides you
put it on a shows up in the carousel
redesigned it made it much easier to
read it's worth taking the time to make
a special logo for amp that reads of
that resolution it really gets your
branding much stronger in the carousel
will increase your carousel clicks and
since the talk is the good the bad and
the ugly we'll give you that one I
actually didn't know where this was
somebody told me it's in Atlanta
stations NBC station I think and it's
11th I haven't still have no idea whose
it is this is not how you do a logo few
other things we've learnt it is really
16 random things we learn about amp amp
in a hurricane what is he talking about
amp in a hurricane
well said we handle a lot of television
networks two of those hosts broadcasting
and Cox both have very strong presence
in Florida and our akane Matthew came
along and we saw some really interesting
effects we
am traffic and it really comes down to
this if you're sitting in the hurricane
shelter or you're trying to get out in
your car or the power's out and there's
a big news event you look at your phone
and you search and yeah Google says
there's no ranking signal for amp but if
you weren't HAMP you won't get in this
traffic because people were hitting the
things in the carousel at the top of the
page this is a graph that make my
co-founder barb did and the bottom blue
represents all sites we see typically
between fifteen to twenty percent of
mobile articles traffic it amp right now
that's all source it's not just Google
referrals and if articles not navigation
pages and home pages and things it's
actual article pages during the
hurricane for the Southeast United
States though the averages there goes
high as forty percent and there were
spikes into the sixty percent the sixty
percent of the mobile article traffic
was amp at that point and we saw similar
effect with the Oracle damn emergency in
California we have the fact B and and
one of the Sacramento television
stations are on our network and very
similar effect where you know if
something big happens phone is the place
people go first
Amba thing they see first and so it's
really important the yeren amp you're in
the carousel your structured data is
good but who goes good all those things
a few parting thoughts you don't do amp
and leave it is not something that you
just do we've seen people do that you
know keeping up with amp is very much a
full-time job he looked in my amp github
email folder and there are like 35,000
emails in there it's totally a moving
target this is a good thing it's
evolving very fast you've heard a lot
about this over the last day or so but
it does mean you have to keep up with it
and
somebody doing it full-time and we do
that for our customers if you can do it
in-house you have to have somebody doing
it please validate every page we do that
we validate you know we generate a
million pieces today we validate them it
takes I've got basically two machines -
two CPU cores dedicated to doing it it's
not a huge amount of work I mean note on
that today CloudFlare announced they've
got an API you can call to validate your
pages there's no excuse for having
invalidating pages you don't have to
validate them inline we we render a page
server and then queue it up to be
validated because if it didn't validate
it wasn't going to get seen anyway so
either way it doesn't really matter what
or do we do it in we just want to know
if it failed fails I see about 58
validation fails a day of those the vast
majority are the canonical page was
severely broken didn't render and so you
just go back in okay this is garbage in
garbage out don't worry about it the
rest are some journalists put something
on a pace which haven't seen before and
broke it in some creative way and then
we go in and we collect those up and
figure out how to fix them so that's
random things we've learnt converting
millions of M pages thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
