part of it was solving a technical
challenge right
making the mobile web more performant
but as users start to use mobile devices
more and more and consume more and more
of their content on mobile it starts to
become clear that there's also an
editorial challenge when publishing to
mobile platforms users do read long-form
articles on mobile but only for so long
Malta mentioned this in the keynote but
you know users only read long-form
articles on mobile for an average of one
to two minutes for a given article it's
not very long it can be very difficult
for these users to consume this content
on mobile the long-form format makes it
very difficult for users to find deeper
which sections they want to do a deeper
dive on but instead we want all stories
to be told in the best way possible for
that story and amp stories give
publishers another approach to consider
for your users these stories provide
bite-sized rich visual content that is
more easily consumable on mobile they
also allow you as a publisher to worry
less about getting the tech just right
and instead focus on telling the story
the way it's meant to be told with the
flexibility to make those stories truly
captivating and as again multi mentioned
like any app page these stories are just
web pages so they are available wherever
web pages are including your own
properties so today we're excited to
announce the developer preview of amp
stories an open format for visual
storytelling on mobile to demonstrate
here's a story by CNN using the format
as you can see it's very visual with
these full-bleed images and you can also
include video assets as well the short
form bite-sized text is more easily
consumable on mobile and at the end of
the story here you can see that there's
there are options for sharing and
linking out for the story to sort of get
that
I'll share now as we do with many new
experimental features in amp we have
collaborated with publishers to help
innovate in this space with the goal of
building a stories format for a rich
storytelling that we're presenting you
today the resulting amp stories format
allows you to create visually rich tap
through stories that are immersive
experiences that are specifically
designed for mobile and keeping users
engaged the format is well-suited for a
breadth of content from news to
lifestyle and yes Paul even sports and
allows the design flexibility to
establish your brand and best tell the
story
additionally the format is automatically
supported on larger screen devices as
well
this lets the users share the story as
they would any other webpage and allows
the recipient to open it on any device
so what makes up a story to walk you
through this we created a fake example
story for the five most expensive cities
in the world after the initial cover of
the story we walked through each of the
five most expensive cities one by one
giving details on why they make the cut
and you can see them all laid out here a
story is made up of one or more pages
each represented by the amp story page
tag and our story we have one cover page
with the title of the story followed by
a single page for each of the five most
expensive cities for the sake of our
example we chose to build a very
template of story but the framework
allows the design freedom to make each
page stand out at the end of the story
the system automatically appends the
templated UI that we call the bookend
that I mentioned allows you to share but
also allows you to replay the story and
have out links to other articles or
stories for the users onward journey
this is populated with default content
out-of-the-box but there are
configuration options to augment this
experience for a more robust
configuration now each page of the story
is made up of multiple layers stacked
back to front these layers are all
composited on top of one another to
create the desired visual design
so taking the example of our cover page
starting from the back again first we
have the background video then we have
on top of that we have a second layer
with the title of our story the byline
and the publication date on top of that
we chose to add a third layer with our
publishers logo and then lastly the
system always imposes super imposes what
we call the system system layer which
includes controls progress indicator -
so the user knows where they are and
other UI chrome to help orient the user
within the story now each layer contains
HTML or amp elements to create the
desired visual effects so in the case of
our background video layer surprise
surprise it has a single element which
is just a video so this just uses amp'd
video just like any other amp page would
but here we also have a template equals
fill attribute which is specific to
stories which indicates that this video
should indeed be full bleed then as
mentioned before we can add another
layer on top of that so this layer uses
template equals vertical which indicates
that the elements should be laid out
sequentially along the vertical axis and
we on this page on this layer we have
only three elements first a heading for
the title of our story and then a
paragraph for each of these byline and
the publication date and you can
continue to create layers and stack them
on top of each other for all of the
layers in your design
so let's take a look at the HTML markup
that makes this happen so amp story is
simply an extension to amp and so you
would start the way that you start with
any other amp extension first import the
amp story JavaScript then you add the
app story tag to your document thereby
making it a story now as I mentioned
before for each page in your story you
can have an amp story page tag
each page has an ID so that it can be
uniquely identified now let's take a
look at how you would create the cover
page of our story so remember a story
page is made up of multiple layers
stacked back to front and we saw these
examples earlier first we have a layer
containing a single amp video for the
background of our page then on top of
that we have a layer with the title the
byline and the publication date of our
story and lastly we opted to put a logo
in the bottom right corner and together
these make up the UI of our cover page
for each of the cities in this story
because remember this is the five most
expensive cities in the world we have a
page for each city and that those pages
are constructed the same way first a
layer for a video and then on top of
that a layer with some text but
additionally this page leverages some
built-in features of stories that we
find pretty exciting
so first animations animations make the
page more visually engaging we use the
animate in attribute to add a preset
animation to this number 5 here so that
it flies in from the bottom as soon as
the page is shown then for the details
of this city we use sequencing in
animations which will fade in the
details half a second after the number 5
flies in so you can sort of chain and
sequence these animations to create
really engaging visual effects this page
also has background audio to help create
an immersive experience this plays audio
in the background for the duration of
the time that the user is on this page
you can also set this up to play audio
in the background throughout the
duration of the entire story and lastly
we use a feature that in stories that we
call auto-advance which will
automatically advance the user through
the story without them having to
manually tap on every screen so here we
chain the advancement to the video
played
so that as soon as the video has
finished playing the user will
automatically be advanced to the next
page and we do this by specifying the ID
of the video in the auto advance after
attribute on the App Store page so this
of course is just the HTML markup we can
also write CSS to style our story and
this is actually the entirety of the CSS
that is needed to build this story it's
perhaps a bit smaller given the
templated nature of the story but it's
also smaller because much of the visual
layout is handled by amp itself so here
we just use the styles to set the text
color of the story adjust the fonts
tweak the alignment of our logo which
was in the bottom right corner and add a
gradient behind the text on the city
pages and last but not least the book
end as I mentioned earlier you can
customize the book end is completely
optional to customize it there is a
default but if you choose to customize
it you can specify a JSON payload that
looks something like this
it's broken into two main sections first
is sharing there's the share providers
object each of the sharing options is
comes from amp social share if you're
familiar with that so any any sharing
provider that is supported by amp social
share is also supported by the amp
storybook end by simply using the
provider type as a key and the provider
type usually matches the name of the the
platform so Facebook for Facebook
Twitter for Twitter and so forth and if
you want to enable the icon for that
particular service you can just add the
value true if you do need further
customization you can all of the
parameters that allow you to
parameterize sharing providers on amp
store sorry amp social share are also
supported by amp story here by just
specifying a sub object like we did for
Facebook here specifying a custom
application ID you can also change the
order of this and that is respected as
well to customize the order of your
sharing icons in the bookend
the second main section of the amp story
book and JSON is the related articles
and this is again how you can specify
sort of onward journeys for your users
you can specify articles as an array
here each of the articles itself is an
object with a title an image and a URL
to navigate to and then you can also
categorize these into sections so you
can see here that there's this section
called more to read that has an array of
articles and you can have as many such
sections as you would like so this is
all specified as a single JSON payload
that can be static or generated
dynamically and this allows the
configuration to be easily reused across
stories and also kept up to date if you
wanted to generate this dynamically for
related links trending links new links
or so forth and that sums up how to
build our simple example story but
obviously you don't want to just create
simple examples all day so next let's
take a look at how you want to tell the
stories that you want to tell and how to
make them actually come to life so to
share more details on that please help
me welcome a light trim from Vox media
hi everyone alright when you want to
know more about something right now how
do you do that if you're like me and a
billion of our other fellow humans you
would google it when I was a kid growing
up in the small Midwestern town in the
States I read every story gave my hands
on when I didn't have the right books or
resources to learn something new
I could still search for anything that I
wanted to learn more about by using
Google it's been the great equalizing
platform to access information no matter
where you live
amp was the first wave of prioritising
news stories and mobile search and amp
stories is the second with amp stories
readers can search for what they want to
learn more about
whether it's Mardi Gras which is today
in the US the Grammys or to catch up
with what's going on in the world and
reach trusted news sources right away in
a visual way instead of just text so
high as John said earlier I'm Eli Trung
I work at Vox media a media company that
strives to build the future of
journalism and entertainment there are
nine editorial networks that explore
topics that people care about I've been
working closely with Google for the past
several months to bring our audiences
amp stories and was also Vox media's
product lead for the amp project back in
2015 so what's so exciting about am
stories for a publisher like us firstly
search is an important way for any
reader to find our stories from amp our
readers are now used to finding us on
mobile search right away and we want to
be able to reach them through visual
stories on mobile search right away as
well this is a good opportunity to
experiment with visual storytelling
across platforms these stories are short
form and nowadays it's much easier to
catch up on what's going on with your
favorite sports teams live events and
things happening halfway across the
world by tapping through a short
visual story these stories can travel
across platforms honor sites on social
on other news feeds and platforms
eventually it's not limited to the
third-party platform where is produced
like similar stories which means that I
can reach more readers with less
editorial effort so today I'm excited to
announce the launches of two Vox media
networks on amp stories voxcom and SB
Nation the networks have different
missions SB Nation is a place for
passionate sports fans while Vox
explains the news and what matters in
the world as two of our biggest networks
on search they both have incredibly
talented visual storytelling teams who
have pushed the boundaries of visual
storytelling on Instagram snapchat and
interactive stories they also both exist
on chorus Vox media's proprietary tech
and data platform for growing digital
media brands for this launch we chose a
pair of newsrooms so they have a fellow
team to learn from a different editorial
approach an audience so what did these
stories actually look like you've gotten
a little preview before
but I want to show you these two
examples now from SP nation this is how
college football rankings actually work
because they can be confusing this is
adapted from a very popular SP nation
article that explained rankings in a
much more in-depth way but it also works
as a short explainer in this format from
voxcom is dark chocolate actually
healthy this was adapted from a hugely
popular video that the Vox video team
produced which helps explain how dark
chocolate came to be known as a health
food hmm so how do amp stories fit into
the way that we tell stories in general
at Vox media there are two examples here
as well our first is unsub SB Nation
1777 six is an ambitious multimedia
narrative that imagines what football
might look like fifteen thousand years
into the future that took off on
averages our audiences spent about
eleven minutes with a story which was
written by John Boyce four voxcom we
have an illustrated deep dive into how
living in poor neighborhoods impacts its
residences reported and built by Alvin
Chang as you can see from these examples
some of our visual stories are bespoke
hand-coded stories on platform or
created on other proprietary platforms
CMS's like instagram or snapchat from
stories like these that served as our
visual storytelling inspiration we had
to figure out how to transition from
building our comprehensive hand-coded
stories to creating a tool where could
we could more easily create and publish
short visual stories so the solutions is
we built an MVP story builder within our
CMS that's meant for designers and
developers to help build stories based
on editorial storyboards and we did it
within a few days it's highly
customizable per page and so we could
make sure the stories reflect the
intended design and automatically
publishes new stories to all the right
places since it's so lightweight we can
add on what we need as we go along
without much friction and we'll use
lessons from this story builder to
incorporate into our larger publishing
system and
chorus the credit here goes to Gregg
MacWilliam who is our lead engineer on
am stories he was also here at AMCOM
so there are a million ways to tell
stories through images and text we know
as publishers but in this format we need
to figure out what's most impactful and
relevant and tell it in a visually
striking way that informs our readers
since we're working collaboratively
across product in editorial teams to
produce stories in a new way we
established a new pitch to publish
process for all of our amp stories to
track how they perform and help us chart
future editorial plans for short form
visual stories so after several months
of thinking about and writing and
building amp stories particularly in the
context of what our readers would want
to see we have some lessons to share to
set you up for success firstly find the
right people to work on amp stories the
right people for us turned out to have a
mix of social video and visual skills we
also learned really quickly that a team
of people with those skills will push
each other to make better stories rather
than if just one person was in charge
figure out how they should work together
if these people have never worked
together before which was a case for a
lot of the publishers who were in the
beta phase you need help from people who
are process experts
you can't just wing it and have it
consistently work lastly set realistic
goals and expectations early on this is
a format that requires a lot of things
to figure out story adaptation
designating a dedicated team and new
editorial product and revenue strategies
setting goals across teams early on will
help set you up for success a big reason
for us to launch on amp stories is to
push ourselves to improve visual stories
across the board teacher teams about
producing dailies stories outside of
just video and text and reach a much
larger audience by doing that it's a
really exciting time to be here when we
can very search and story torrent search
and storytelling in a way that my kid
self would have been over the moon to
read and know that these stories are
available to anyone including kids and
small towns anywhere who want to learn
more about the world thanks very much
- John thanks alight so Vox Media was
just one of many collaborators that
helped us innovate in this space to
bring you the four story format that you
see here today and we'd like to
definitely thank all of the folks that
helped make this happen across the many
organizations that were involved so
what's next for stories in EM we want to
drive monetization by supporting ads and
improving support for affiliate linking
stories are currently focused on English
but we hope to expand that support more
broadly as well we would like to bring
richer features and more interactive
storytelling devices to aid you in
telling your stories the way that you
want them to be told and we'd like for
these stories to be seamlessly
embeddable wherever they show up with
the right metadata beautiful previews
and stellar performance so for more
about what's coming next for stories and
for amp more generally check out Malta
and Rudi's what's next in amp talk at
the end of the day today if you're
interested in getting started started
with stories check out amp project org
slash stories on that site you'll find
more detailed documentation for what I
went over today a guided tutorial on
building a story from start to finish
best practices on building your stories
and how to keep them beautiful and
performant and examples for you to build
from and to play around with like other
experimental features in amp you can
start playing with this today but to
actually publish these stories you'll
need to sign up for the amp story origin
trial and details on that can also be
found in the amp story documentation
google search has also been working to
integrate this feature into the Google
search results page existing visual
stories can be found by querying the
publishers name using one of these
queries seen here to see a carousel of
their stories that they've created this
feature will be rolling out over the
next few days but if you want to try it
out today here
right now for demo purposes you can use
the gqo slash amp stories link that you
see here thank you so much for your time
if you all have more details or sorry
for you to get more details or if you
have questions for us feel free to stop
by the publishing and monetization booth
