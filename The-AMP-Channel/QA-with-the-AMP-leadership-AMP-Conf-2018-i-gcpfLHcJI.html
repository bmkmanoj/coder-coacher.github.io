yesterday that I thought would be better
answered by this panel it's kind of a
hard question and the question is this
was asked twice actually in different
ways the road map mentions gdpr
inspired enhancements what can we expect
from the amp project to make sure am
website is able to fully comply with
gdpr and then i think related to this I
don't know if it's completely related
but how does the amp client idea fix
play with the European privacy law do we
have to include an active permission
request again so yeah this is a great
question so gdpr is coming up toward the
end of May amp already supports some of
the behaviors that I think are going to
be relevant here you can for example
display an infuser notification and you
can do things like block add calls on
that you can block analytics on that so
these are some of the behaviors that
might be relevant but I think what's
interesting about gdpr is there might be
additional behaviors that people are
interested in and there's also I think
additional requirements that will come
into play the idea of sort of managing
consent state in a more active way so I
think what some of the things we're
thinking about adding is basically kind
of making consent a first-class notion
in amp because right now the main way
that you sort of can control these
things is through a dismissable
notification and just knowing what that
state is so I think kind of bringing
consent state is is more basically a bit
that you can read and set sort of later
on in a page life cycle I think those
are the kinds of things that are come
into play
so yeah and then relating to client ID I
think the other thing to say about all
of this is you know we can't give legal
advice and so it's interesting about
gdpr is it's kind of on everybody to you
know figure out how they're going to
interpret the regulation and decide how
they're going to move forward with it so
if you think there are you know specific
behaviors that you need to see from amp
please get in touch with us through
github and let us know you know we're
looking at the the regulation and trying
to plan forward as well as anybody but
it's really helpful to hear people's
concrete feedback around how they're
planning to address gdpr and so we can
really distill it down and
to the functional requirements you have
with respect to client ID API again
that's an area where we can't sort of
offer the legal advice but what I can
say is you know Krista the really
helpful presentation about it earlier
today and so for more details on it you
should go check out the Google Analytics
documentation and there are policies
associated with using that API that you
should take note of and those may be
relevant for you and implementing it
actually while mentioning the client ID
API there was another one that was
specific about how to find more for more
information if you're not using Google
Analytics using a different analytics
provider yes so there's two kind of
tracks of the roadmap looking forward so
one track is around opening up to other
analytics vendors so this is an API and
we are committed to working with other
vendors to be able to make use of it
just as Google Analytics is making use
of it so for those vendors please get in
touch with us and for folks who are
relying on those vendors please make
sure your vendors are aware because
there's also work on their side to make
sure that they're going to do the
reconciliation properly the other track
is around opening up access it's an API
that's useful for analytics it's also an
API that can be really useful for you
know other kinds of things where you
want to know user state and so you know
it's called an API and so we are looking
to expose it as an API that people can
just directly use and interact with
thank you Rudy
so the next question I found kind of
cool it's kind of an odd one but it's
both easy to answer and shows the
benefits of them so I want to do it
anyway which is why can progressive Web
Apps be more modular like amp
and load two J's modules you want and
use JSON or something to control the
wave behaves
yeah I think people like put PWM in the
same sentence but there are actually
concepts on very different layers right
so amp is a the JavaScript library that
you can like you know put a script check
on your page and it has documentation
and you can you can just use it where
PWA is a you know refers to an abstract
concept of you know behaviors and ideas
that you can implement in many many ways
and so there's just not you know it's
the absolute other side of the spectrum
of being opinionated and respectively
there's not such a like well-lit path of
how to do it but you can you know
certainly find for example the there's
the pre-act starter kit which you know
gets you with a command line invocation
something that's like a PWA and and I
think there's a for various other
libraries there's similar things so
basically that's kind of how you can
have to compare it you can't compare em
to PBA you have to compare and to you
know building pwace with library X right
here's one for Dave will amp be served
one day and Google search results for
desktop probably not and the reason I
say probably not is it's entirely up to
the people in this room so amp our epics
can be responsive pages in fact if
you've ever gone to the amp project.org
website this is one of my very favorite
websites you should all visit it all the
time it's also the same code that runs
on desktop and and on your on your phone
and it's NAT page so it's completely
responsive and in that way it is served
from from google search it's not treated
like an INT page on the desktop because
it's kind of rare most pages that people
are offering for amp are really designed
around the phone and some extent that's
not surprising that's what the M is for
in accelerated mobile pages so the
people aren't designing responsive web
pages in general
so for search if we were to send users
to that aunt page that hit funny looking
pages on a desktop so if there ever were
large numbers of responsive pages that
were out there built on amp them then
it's the kind of thing that we could
consider it's it's also not that I don't
think it's as impactful on desktop
desktop which doesn't have all of the
performance challenges that mobile had
which is why you know it's called
accelerated mobile pages in the first
place is really aimed at the phone
because it's uniquely difficult
environment to get right thank you yeah
I think if I I want to add one thing
though which is and for email right like
Gmail actually has support for desktop
and turn and I guess the reason to what
you just spoke is actually that it's a
it's an entirely new part of the
ecosystem that doesn't suffer from the
legacy of just mobile and pages every
other absolutely note encourage folks to
build responsive pages for that very
reason inside both both actually for amp
in general but also for amp in email I I
think if you've built something for a
mobile device it's a very challenged
environment with bad connectivity and
constrained memory and slow processor
and then you run it on a super nice
computer it performance is amazing so I
like desktop amp pages personally and
you know feel free and use them on the
desktop yourself the way I do it I
always open Chrome tap when I when I
like find some news go into mobile
emulation and and read pages there it
works really well yeah I kind of I I
have to say I had this idea for demo
that has like a call Youm based
experience you know to benefit from the
small narrow view point and you just
brought some page page anyway I can't
tell if people are standing because they
want to ask questions or because they're
just standing ok perfect then we will
move on to some more questions I have
here most of of that users content is
behind a paywall will em story support
paywalls
via amp access yeah I can take that one
um so yeah we so if you look at am
stories today
there's no monetization support one of
the things that we're looking at doing
very soon is allowing for publisher sold
ads to be placed and you know we think
monetization is really important across
the board and so some publishers are
really keen on subscription models and
to have a subscription model you need to
have pay walls and things like that
supported AM supports this today on sort
of regular temp pages and it's something
that we are intending to get working for
amp stories as well I think there's some
really interesting user experience
questions and and this is kind of like
one of the big benefits of the Developer
Preview is we can kind of engage with
all the various parties who are
interested in this facet and figure out
what a good implementation would look
like you know just offhand like there's
so many different ways when you
translate the stories model over from
kind of the way you see regular payable
is working like do you put the notice on
the cover page do you put it three pages
in and give a preview like you know is
how does the UI present itself to kind
of inform the user about a meter that's
counting down or or that they don't have
any further access so I think there's a
lot of really interesting questions and
the good news is we have a framework
already in place amp access that'll help
us get there pretty easily and so that's
something we're gonna look to add pretty
soon I think okay next up are there any
of Google's own projects I guess other
projects and then some of them yesterday
that are going to be rewritten in amp I
will support
and I guess this is not like a question
like how how to add it to a platform
similar to Gmail but it's more about
sites I think yes so I would say it's
like to that point a lot of Google's
products are more apps so they're
perhaps not a great fit for amp you know
with am what about blogger
yeah what about blogger I love well I'll
keep saying one thing a minute so yeah a
lot of them aren't aren't apps and so
you know amp just probably wouldn't be
an appropriate thing there are some
interesting content experiences so we
have amp stories out there and something
a lot of people may not have noticed
particularly here but there's um there's
a feature in search that allows you to
see like posts from some people so
there's Fashion Week going on right now
and actually the experience that you can
see in that it is currently being driven
off of amp stories which i think is
really awesome so it's just one example
I think stories in particular is an area
where you know there's nothing kind of
set right now but you know looking
forward I think there's a lot of cool
applications for you know content that
various Google teams put out on the web
to be kind of exposed to that format so
I think that would be in a really
exciting direction and and there are
some places where we do some kinds of
content generation bloggers being one of
them but we recently you may have read
in the news that we're running a pilot
of a project doing local tool to help
doing super hyper local news publishing
that that produces amp so in general you
know as Google's building new things
that are that are producing web content
we do look to to use amp because we
believe it's a really great format and
like the fashion week tool and that we
used in searches of our example bloggers
a little more complicated blogger is
older than dirt and I love blogger in
fact it's one of my projects and the
blogger team loves amp they're all that
said we're all on the same team but it's
really hard for a platform that's as big
and as old as bloggers to make a change
overnight
to kind of amp everybody's pages some of
you have built amps yourselves and have
your own CMS's and you can kind of know
that it can be complicated it to do just
one site and something that you you
control trying to do that to the
billions and of pages that are that are
out there in blogger that's you know 20
years old it's it's challenging
so the blogger team is definitely
interested and we've been looking at
different ways that we can use amp from
within blogger because they see the
benefits and for their users they'd
really love to to offer that but it's
just a little bit of a challenge okay I
have a few more stories questions
actually no before that one part of that
answer too because I just got myself
reminded about one Google specific
property that is amp enabled it's the
keyword block yes our our blog isn't him
so okay maybe not the most exciting one
but I just want to point it out so next
up another M stores question how will em
stories with videos and sound effect
loads be and what methods will be used
to prevent manage annoying or play
videos and salads so yeah I think one of
the things that were really focused on
with amp stories is how we can make sure
it's really performant it's it's kind of
something that's clear after the fact
but when we sort of started on the
project we you know being a very media
intensive format we quickly discovered
that there's actually a lot of things
that you can really do to optimize of
optimization out of out of the
implementation and so that's something
we've been working really hard at and
we're gonna continue to push on and I
think the other thing that's highly
relevant here is the caching piece of
the amp ecosystem like the fact that you
can caching and the pre-rendering pieces
the fact that you can bring both of
these into play just have this you know
much more impactful effects in terms of
how you can optimize the delivery of the
content being able to sort of know okay
this video is going to be playing when
the user might tap on the story and sort
of being able to get the frames of the
video ready to go and being able to take
advantage of a cache that just is you
know optimizing
and physically moving things closer to
the user I think those are going to be
really important pieces that come into
play with the story's project to answer
the second part of the question which
was regarding autoplay video and sound
so the I browsers have recently aligned
actually about a year ago a year and a
half ago on mobile and then nowadays
also on desktop that they don't allow
autoplay sound both in terms of video
and opponents of just pure audio and so
that basically that policy is valid for
am stories and so you know at least in
and when you consume it in a web browser
you can't you can expect it won't just
you know play sound in front of your
face and I think the experience is also
muted by default right because that's
just really the only thing you could do
I could imagine that if you put em
stories into a native app or a web app
or the you know just the platform idea
is that you know just like when you tap
on a YouTube video you can I want the
sound to play but you can you get about
envision similar experiences but like on
the web the right thing to do is to not
you know play play song without you know
explicit user consent great question for
Vamsi I think so with amp for email
actually notices about authentication so
but it's also about email so how is
authentication handled with email
whatever amp emails forwarded so right
now I think identity is not something
that like the amp for email spec or even
the Gmail team I've talked to our cash
about this have thought about but it's
something that we come in the future but
specifically about forwarding the email
that's something that supported today
which is since the mime type of amp HTML
email is optional
whenever you forward it the email client
that doesn't support it simply just rips
out the email but the I'm part of it and
just ends up rendering the HTML or the
text part of it depending on what it
wants to render so this actually works
in Yahoo today so if you ended up
forwarding a dynamic email to Yahoo
Yahoo would just end up showing you
HTML part less okay where do is next one
weather where do this CSS size
limitations come from and is it
arbitrary or could increase one day I
think this is a very common question I
get that question a lot or is it a
technical reason so we we did just make
it up but it's I mean we did look at a
bunch of pages and how much this si
needed especially if they were created
from scratch and so I think the value
that we picked is is one where you can
easily you know to effectively all
styling you might want there's a bit of
a caveat here with like the desktop
media queries that some people strip and
maybe I can talk about that later but
that if you do not you know engage in
CSS hygiene over time you will
eventually crush against this limit and
so the limit really just has the you
know the the goal of making everyone you
know perform hygiene which is you know
generally a good thing and and
specifically you see it as it tends to
grow I call it the Christmas special
2017 problem or this is like you know
you edit and it's it sticks around
forever and with amp you can't do that
so that's where this comes on I I do
hear a feedback about it we have a long
time ago proposed but there hasn't been
enough momentum to actually do it both
in terms of requesting on our site
actually implemented to to make a more
complex version of this where you where
the limit wouldn't be in how much it s
you would have but the limit would be in
terms of requiring a minimum of actually
used CSS on the page so this would be a
rule like you can you know there's you
have a much higher limit but that's only
okay if your page actually reference
these Styles right which is the more
direct way of saying this stuff you have
here is actually what you need and not
some like all promotional thing that you
you've just
kept flying around I did see the the
reddit top talk I think no the Airbnb
talked this morning and they said like
one of the things they did to minimize
the CSS was just you know essentially
say hey use media query and because this
is going to be shown on permanent mobile
devices we can like kill other ones that
don't apply to these resolutions and
obviously that makes really sad and it
would be a good argument to relax the
limits especially when it comes to
mutually exclusive media queries thank
you now next there's a story's question
again oh here we go yeah let's do the
life flash I have a very quick question
for you guys so early in 2017 there was
talk about a search live coverage
carousel and I was wondering if there
are any plans to expand the search live
carousel beta or even what is the
current state of that project thank you
he said search live carousel yeah there
was a search live coverage carousel I
think it was just called live coverage
beta for a while and now it's called the
search live coverage carousel beta yeah
it's we don't have any plans to expand
and not everyone have anything to add
about that it's a it's a little feature
that we launched we wanted to experiment
with it which is kind of why it was in
beta to see how it was performing and
how users like getting out publishers
liked it it's still pretty early for us
we haven't actually used it a whole lot
we've tried it coverage in a couple
different spots but just don't really
have anything to say about it
okay now the amp story 1 and this is
actually might be question for you as
well because I'm not even sure if the
rest of the amp team can can answer this
question because it's related to the
Google surface so when does the story
carousel show up is it the same behavior
like news when a topic is relevant or
does it only show up when searching for
publisher name yes so things in search
if we're gonna be showing new types of
content in search we generally have a
pretty high bar to cross a high
threshold across you have to have a lot
of publisher diversity we have to have a
lot of content out there to really make
it show up in search because we don't
really want to show just one thing on
the page and unless it's you know just a
normal link if we're gonna build a
special search feature for wienie really
do need a big reasonable corporate size
purpose for it stories just sort of
launched this week so we don't have that
much we put something in to search kind
of like we did originally with the amp
Developer Preview so that people could
see it so they could actually test it
with their site and see how it would
look and so that people could pass it
around hey check this out so we did a
navigational query so for the partners
and people that have been building amp
to this stamp to this point stories we
call it now yeah you have stories at
this point you can do this by navigating
to like CNN and you'll see it in there
long term
again it depends on the corpus and how
it is used if there's lots of people
publishing stories that are on topic and
we think it would actually be really
interesting and useful to our users to
put inside a carousel like the top
stories carousel or even you know a
special treatment storage will
absolutely do it it's really too early
to say great thank you ok next I like
this question a lot because it's not
about Google first of all most that's a
pretty quotes about another platform
that has surfaced amp documents recently
and about Twitter
so it seems Twitter returns am not from
the cache but directly from the origin
server do you know the reasons
so I think there is a list of reasons
one of the things that we actually
support now what didn't when they
launched was something very simple which
is that on the when originally amp was
created we only had the carousel
experience and so it when there was an
Impala de Janeiro we kinda had a show
error message because there was no real
other way out that's not the right
experience when you have a single URL
intent like you have on Twitter and so
but they were like observing these error
messages and said that it was not good
for our users nowadays is different it
just then redirect to the source instead
of like putting user our message in user
space another reason is that especially
on under in you know on mobile web and
in the and the native apps they would
get the if you don't have a more
sophisticated integration they would
have gotten what you actually do see
today from from LinkedIn that direct em
cashier Alta used and I think we and
they agree that that's not the best
experience and so I think that's kind of
the spectrum along which they made this
decision I could I mean you know
obviously we're not Twitter and we can
stick for them but but like with the
launch of we're packaging I could
imagine that they would really value or
evaluate this decision thank you now
this is about canonical Ampat about UI
development in the world outside of
javascript or you know before i guess we
have what you're not yesterday artiste
yesterday matter and this is about
accessibility actually so are they
accessibility concerns about building
your navigation menu for instance where
something like the checkbox hack when
you're trying to avoid javascript yeah
unfortunately I'm not an accessibility
expert I imagine if you're doing
workarounds for things that there's an
elevated risk of doing something in an
alternate way
I'm not familiar with the checkbox hack
in particular for hi I can answer this
so I not sure why you would use the
checkbox hack it was definitely probably
low at the very very earliest days of
amp but now that there's M site bar is
really not needed with M sidebar you get
the Aria attributes that are required
automatically edit I think you know amps
accessibility might not always be
perfect but it's something that we take
a very high priority priority and and
and and especially try to ensure that
things are good by default so by by
using semantic component where you say
this is not you know a button that has a
click enter that you know in reality
opens this other field but you say it's
a side bar you know the I have semantics
and so you can automatically express the
right Aria roles and so you know I think
that my hunch is although I have no data
on this that on average the
accessibility and M page is you know
higher compared to the general web
because just many things just are good
by default so I'm actually gonna
challenge a part of this answer because
I have a menu on my website that uses to
check box hack and it's a menu that
looks so different that I couldn't use
the site before but I think that's
probably heads case however I also want
to mention there's this amp select and
there's a mine that can drive many of
those things as well yeah and like
nothing's stopping you from you know
adding the appropriate Aria roles yeah
etcetera right so it's like um I think
there's great value and not having to do
that but you know it's it's always an
option
yeah dynamic make question so how is
dynamic Mayer going to interact with
spam filters and there's a there's an
interesting part of this question which
is in brackets and dynamic spam or nose
so is there a way for us to know when we
are reading a Namek male sorry it's
important to distinguish between
for email spec versus what Gmail is
gonna do on the server side specifically
on the m4 email spec it's a reduced
subset of the original amp a spec so
it's for example you can't have an pixel
or amp analytics so things which are
mostly sort of analytics related are not
possible so but that that by nature is
more constrained and is more sort of
secure
so let's talking about the server-side
stuff which is you know Gmail has got
the best sort of spam filtering systems
it's essentially one upping and making
the spam pipeline much much better but
also one of the important thing is all
of the requests that are going to be
made out of a dynamic document are going
to be gone to a proxy and therefore at
which point spam can again start to
filter and check to make sure you know
the authors are not doing anything
cranky and if so just mark it as spam
well I think your second part of the
question was around how do you know if a
user actually opened a dynamic mail I I
think this is just a misnomer in general
emails do send waters called like a 1x1
pixel with images and that's how general
regular emails even know when you open
an email but I don't think there's
anything in the amp email spec
specifically that makes it worse or
better so it's no different than a
regular email from that sense okay thank
you vampy so dirty app let's talk about
it let's talk about dirty amp for a
second and dirty amp of course is the
code name for an amp page that is not
valid so that's that's how at least some
other some of us have been calling it so
is there a set of recommendations or
advice for invalid at podium or of amp
cache amp uses is it documented
somewhere
it's not documented somewhere this is
something that we've seen people do they
say I'm already doing the ham but
they're just a couple things on my page
that I'd like to add an addition and I
just want to build on top of the end
there's some risk associated with that
because and makes a lot of assumptions
about how your document is built it
controls what loads based on what's in
the viewport and if you know JavaScript
or something like that adds something
your page it could displace stuff and
then suddenly amp thinks you're looking
at something but you're actually looking
at something else it doesn't load it's
bad for the user but so far we've sort
of we've talked about ways to sort of
make it easier for people to understand
what's gonna break in the library but
haven't documented anything right now
the best approach the approach that I
tend to recommend to people and if you
have if other folks have recommendations
they should add this as well is really
just use PWA for these types of such
situations and like shadow dom and that
way if there are features that you want
to add to your document it's in a
managed way that works with the ant
runtime well it doesn't mess with any of
the fundamental assumptions that ant
makes and it's a nice pathway to do that
yeah that's exactly right Peter the PTM
optional integration is basically the
official way to do this I I would say
that you know I'm not a fan of the 30
and a name it's nothing dirty about it
it's I where it can be really useful is
as a migration path right so they if you
would like to pork your entire website
to add but there's this one feature
which you know might not be available
yet and you file a feature request but
you know it's not it might be a couple
months until it's implemented then you
can you know use this to get yourself
into almost the desired end State and
then eventually complete migration once
once once once you can I think it's a
superb allocated as
okay thank you
now there's a question of again yes yeah
this is a follow-up I think I'm not
really asked that was my question I'm
not really asking about going outside of
the ant rules but serving pages off of a
up cache and Twitter is an example of
that and a gentleman I talked to said
that if the pages are served off of amp
cached it'll actually return errors to
you and there's other issues and there'd
be some tricks to just make that a
little better and I think that's what
the question is about so I mean I'm not
sure I understood everything about that
question but like I mean you should note
that definitely need to expect that
people go to your em pages on your own
server right like that's it's really
live and you know the it's a it's their
natural habitat so let's say I think one
one interesting point for serving and
pages yourself is that we released
yesterday the EM toolbox optimizer which
gives you a you know the same
optimization that the M cache does on
the content level for your documents
when you serve them itself and that
definitely speeds up load experience
it's something I would I would
definitely recommend if you get a lot of
M traffic on your on your own origin
it's you know because we were just
talking about 30 M effectively these
optimizations they so they make your
document invalid technically the way if
you want to and see it that way so
there's these there is essentially HTML
transpiler so the input is HTML and the
output is HTML and the way we think
about Amp is same effectively you
describe of you know document and the
output is a more efficient
representation and so this is actually
an application of what you would call
ready amp or you depending on the client
capabilities give them either the
optimized version or the non optimized
version
thank you so on to box question - and
this is like just a quick follow-up on
to box will I be able to achieve the
same speed results then on the Google
app cache with m2 box it's the same
speak to name speed results compared to
the Google app cache so there let's say
you become a customer of the Google
cloud CDN product or are your host and
app actually even more correct will be
you host an app engine and so you
actually use the exact same serving
system that that we use and you can get
pretty close I think there's one big
thing that you don't get and cannot by
definition get is when when coming from
a platform that supports pre-rendering
it's not possible to do that without
using the caches because of the way that
the cache serving ensures the privacy of
the users I think we haven't talked
about this at all like we've referenced
it at this conference but then talked
about it so explain it really quick
basically what the the privacy guarantee
that we try to achieve is that when you
search for something and you do not
click the document then the author of
the pre when the document should not
know that you for example made that
search right and so the cache obviously
helped with this but because because the
publisher doesn't do the serving
themselves that vector where you would
get the request and you would see in
your access lock that this cookie you
know was looking for you know any
particular topic is just not present
right so so and that's why the
pre-rendering is exclusive to time cache
and here's the question about components
about form specifically why is input
type password not supported and is it
coming is it is a smoke foot
so I think right now I think right now
login is supported through amp access so
that's usually the path we encourage
there is an open issue around making
input type password available so if it
is important to you and if you're not
able to achieve what you need with amp
access then feel free to comment on that
issue let us know your specific use case
it is possible there is just some
privacy implications of doing it thank
you Lisa we have another audience
question here yeah continuing on the
dirty amp I looked at amp as a great
component set that you could use also if
you have your first landing page and
then come into your site you can reuse
those same components great example is
the the start and end date selector I
don't want to rebuild everything in my
progressive web app or my website if I
use it on a landing page but as I
understood I should mix it with my own
say react rendering or other stuff so
what's the use of those more advanced
ecommerce components if you have to stay
on your end page a good question yeah so
I can explain why it's dangerous to do
that and and then and but not that no
nothing's stopping you all right so and
you can choose that you are willing to
make this trade-off and so the the risk
that is there is that am for example has
one particular optimization where it
assumes it knows when the Dom is
changing and and so if if the lazy
loading relies on knowing where stuff is
in the DOM and so let's say and a
resource is configured like amputee for
example to only render when it actually
becomes part of the you know the
viewport and and you use that amp
YouTube component on your product detail
page and your product detail page on top
has a feature where you can expand the
product description and so the page
becomes much longer now if you not use
it mixing amp with some other technology
and no longer knows that you this
expansion happened
and now when you scroll to the amp
YouTube component it might not realize
that it's actually now on screen because
it it's in a very different place and so
that that's kind of the risk and and you
know big again you can you can choose to
take that risk but that's kind of where
it's not compatible and the I think what
one of the theme of this conference was
that ideally there's a good pass for you
to just having everything you need in
amp and I'm not needing to do this mix
we're not there yet and we shouldn't go
there there yet I think but for example
the lazy loading I understand that's
something you should take care of but
the components are web components or the
amp components I understood and the use
of web components is that you can reuse
them in every situation that they are
self-contained so what is amp doing
besides lazy loading what other kind of
stuff is I'm doing that will prevent
using web components in other contexts
because I understand the lazy loading
but other situations I I suppose it if
that's not again like if you think that
you can live without the or you can live
in the context of potentially lazy
loading then maybe it works i from top
of my hat that's the major reason why
there's risk yeah they're just about
components and they they will absolutely
work perfectly fine in most environments
of course your message in the beginning
of the conference was like we need to
build all web sites using amp also for
desk Oh message there is not all web
sites right like that's but also your
desktop web site like you should go oh
amp but then you also want to move from
from from search results you go from the
amp cache and then directly into your
real web sites and then do
personalization or other kind of stuff
so then you would like to enhance on top
of what you have in your amp expiry
otherwise she always stays stay on that
one page that you get in and all your
whole site is a single page and that's
for e-commerce it's unacceptable and
that's not actually so if I can say
something here that's not actually what
we proposed so there's some confusion
here what we want you to do is to build
full amp pages not full amp sites so the
idea here is that you look at your
overall site investigate how many pages
you have there are some entry points
into your site and then there are areas
where it might not make sense like it
could not make sense for your checkout
flow because it's really complicated
could not make sense for a members-only
area or for some other advanced flows
that are not entry point into your site
so the the ideas that you could simplify
your life by building those entry point
pages completely amp but it doesn't mean
that you have to build your whole site
map of course but then if you build an
entry page with for example to start and
end date control and then you get
somewhere else in your site where you
also need a start and end date so you
want to reuse those same components sure
one thing that that Eric mentioned
earlier is that the the infrastructure
that is made available for the mpw
integration based on shadow Dom is can
be used for exactly this purpose right
so it is actually the meant to be a way
to safely integrate an MDOT comment into
a more arbitrary JavaScript environment
by isolating the M document into its own
shadow DOM and and so you basically use
that to explicitly state where what
parts are part of the of the
undocumented what parts are not and and
this integration actually also gives you
an API to tell M please throw away all
assumptions you made about where things
are on the page because I told him you
know put them somewhere else and so
again like this puts the responsibility
on you but I mean if you're then you
know now it's just a bug that you can
fix if something isn't working right but
so so that's definitely the solution for
for this particular case
Thanks okay we're we're pretty much out
of time okay
Madison you want to say something to
this particular one question or do you
have another question
oh I have two questions that's all right
I think we'll be quick
I'll be quick so the first one is the M
cache does some pretty cool image
optimization we're serving web P when
it's supported and I'm curious with the
amp toolkit or toolbox figure what it's
called is it gonna replace images and is
there any service that Google provides
that can do a similar image optimization
when we're surveying prerendered amp
pages from our own domain and second
question is there any intention to serve
and pages for navigational queries
what's the last question is there any
intention to serve amp pages for
navigational queries we've noticed that
if someone puts in a search term with
high intent that includes the brand of
the site that they're looking for the
amp pages won't be shown like if there
for example they put in Walmart and
Walmart has amps and won't show the amp
page Alex from the search team is
nodding his head yeah there's an answer
the second question is yes our intent
and is overall to show amps whenever
they're available and they're a valid
page there's a it's mostly true in
search there's a couple spots where it's
not not entirely true just because we
haven't gotten to it code is you know
complicated but that's about it
I don't think I don't actually recall
the first question when we use the amp
toolkit is the free image see the end
yes free but is there any tools that we
can use to get similar optimizations
that the Google cache provides we would
have to ask the question if it's
actually an Android if it's on their
roadmap for the for the to optimizer
toolkit to include image optimization I
think we don't necessarily have an
intention to provide this as a software
as a service solution although I again
think that there's probably some Google
API that that might actually do it for
you but you have to pay for it but you
know image optimization is definitely
something where there's a whole range of
tools and they're all like great and the
main problem isn't they're non-existent
it's just that people would not always
use them you know and there's some
challenge with like web PE serving not
being very easy and stuff like that but
I I don't necessarily think there's a
really easy way to make that simpler I
would just add that some of the image
optimizations we do are because you all
aren't doing them so you can also just
since this is on your own origin if you
want to add you know source set and you
want to add better compression you can
just do that already today and then our
image oppositions but not to do anything
it's really common that people like take
a photo with a DSLR and I put that on a
mobile web page and it actually not only
it's obviously really bad for bandwidth
usage but if you go into the multi
megabyte images the mobile devices
actually take a long time to decode them
and even though that sometimes not on
the main thread because it just makes
your device so busy it can untold lead
rank the page this is something we've
like seen a lot actually so my question
is about the whole monetization around
MB so as a publisher and also I've
talked to a lot of publishers the reason
they are not on a MP
is probably due to the difference in
revenue which a traditional web page
makes versus the ANP version as
significant and if you have seen it
personally on some properties I work on
and I think this is a probably a big
kind of a showstopper and or a
deal-breaker for many people in terms of
switching to a MP so what I'm sure I did
I do see you your the amp HTML ads and
the other initiatives you are taking but
what if you want to like kind of
increase your option of MP I think it's
a big I'm sure you aware of it and what
I would like to hear your thoughts as to
how are you planning to solve this
problem yeah yeah I completely agree
with you if you set this thing about
eight or nine months ago but actually
we've added a ton of features exactly
taking this feedback from publishers and
trying to and you're right about six to
eight months ago publishers even if they
put in a ton of effort couldn't have
achieved parity or exceeding parity but
right now we know of very almost no
features bad publishers you know any
willing publisher wanting to put in the
effort aren't able to sort of monetize
at the same level or better during my
talk I give a few examples around India
today for example they're saying plus
20% revenue per page when compared to
non on pages with fewer ads and that's
just one example but again the tooling
is available and as long as they take
take the tooling and implement the
tooling the opportunities available to
do today we may be in 2016 we were part
of the private beta and initial pilot so
I think it's probably gotten into it too
early and maybe things have changed now
but still I think a lot of publishers
need some convincing to move I think
it's time to engage so we're way over
time so I certainly have to wrap up the
audience portion and the audience
questions I want to give you all a final
chance if you'd like to say something
you haven't said yet
please do so now or don't say anything
but I thought no I mean you'll all be
back next year thank you all for coming
amp would not exist without all the
other people in the community who have
actually contributed to amp both
contributed code contributed ideas and
and just been involved in the beginning
and and steering the direction it should
go so think this is this conference
really is about you and and thank you
all very much for coming to have come
from for supporting amp and keep the
feedback and keep the ideas coming keeps
us keeps us all making the web great
thanks
