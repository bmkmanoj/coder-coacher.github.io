jet-lagged everyone so yeah it's really
great to see you all and this is the
last session of the day before we get to
that party so really excited thanks for
sticking it out so this is the second
year straight that we're doing this talk
to end day one and we got good feedback
on it last year so we thought we'd
continue it and really there's just a
few goals we have here you heard a lot
in the keynote this morning it's a lot
to take in at one time and then
throughout the day you heard more and
more details about the various things
that we talked about so we just want to
kind of bring those back up to the top
level and contextualize everything
together with our roadmap and also
tomorrow is going to be really fantastic
so we want to call out the things that
you can look forward to tomorrow as we
kind of like bring all the components of
the roadmap tomorrow and you know I used
the term roadmap it's it's really quite
important I think that you know we all
have a really good sense of what the
major initiatives around the project are
and so you know you're gonna kind of get
that take from Malta and me which is
kind of you know Google kind of take on
it but you know at the end of the day
what we're really looking to do here is
kind of help align everybody and sort of
make sure that we're all pointed at the
same North Star maybe also they kind of
called it a keynote but it's not gonna
be published you know we're just gonna
kind of bring this and also if you see
the end of the presentation I really
want to take a shot of what go right now
because you really shouldn't do this all
right so a point I made last year and
I'm gonna make it again
what happens next what this project
really depends on all of you and so it's
really great that you came out here to
support the project and that you
continue to sort of file github issues
engage with us on slack tweeted us with
feedback or participate in you know
conversations on Twitter and things like
that and all the great and person
interactions that we get at this
conference all of these things help
contribute to moving amp forward and
they're incredibly essential it helps
shape the project and it shapes it in
various ways with all your different
varying perspectives and we really
really appreciate that and the project's
better
because we're able to engage so openly
with each other on it now as most of
sudden the keynote amps vision is a
strong user first open web forever I
think if we have a really relentless
focus on putting user experience first I
think if we can keep all the things that
we love about the web going forward in
definitely building the best experiences
isn't something that ought to be
possible only inside closed environments
it ought to be possible out on the open
web and so our mission is to provide a
user first format for content on the web
and if you boil it down this is what the
project is here to do we want to give
every publisher merchants and advertiser
access to high performance technology
and make it easy to create the fastest
pages on the web that feel great for the
user and monetize and convert well by
being able to focus on their core
strengths content providers should be
best equipped to control their destiny
on the web the content you create once
should work well and load blazingly fast
everywhere including in platforms in
which many users will discover it helps
get it out there and we believe it's key
and really the only workable set up to
operate in an open manner with active
public engagement and contributions from
anyone in order to foster healthy
ecosystems it's going to work for
everyone so as I said mult and I are on
a team at Google that devotes 100% of
its time to amp and just like other
teams at Google
each year we write down okay ours which
stands for objectives and key results
and so last year we started this
tradition of sharing these and so we're
gonna follow that exact same pattern in
the talk this year so basically this is
how well-constructed ochio's look you
start by knowing what kinds of things
you want to see what things you want to
change you call this your objectives and
then you figure out a measurable way to
indicate that you've met that goal and
you call this your key results and then
finally you figure out the tons of
individual projects and tasks and
launches all of your activities that
help move the needle toward achieving
your goal and so what's new this year is
because we did it last year we're gonna
take a look back and we're gonna tell
you how we think we did on all the
things so when you see green at things
we think it means we think we did great
yellow is okay and red means we want to
do better alright so one of our first
key results was around users prefer amp
content over classic web and app content
based when we control for for speed and
so we ran some human rated evals using
standard Google search kind of caliber
methodology and what we found is that
even controlling for speed there was a
clear preference gap where amp was
outpacing non amp content which were
really excited to see and at the end of
the day like amongst everything like
this is kind of squarely where focus
oughta be and so we're really glad with
that result we also wanted to you know
getting down to the metrics of
performance we wanted to you know
decrease the time for first content full
pane and so we made a lot of really
strong improvements here through things
like server-side rendering which we
talked about and blogged about
throughout the year the challenge was
that we were unable to scale it kind of
to the full extent we needed so we ended
up kind of in a mixed state where we
have really exciting paths ahead of us
once we're able to solve that scaling
problem the exact metric is currently
being applied to 60% of documents and we
want to get this up to 80 to about 90%
right and then finally you know
ecommerce was something that we really
started to go big on last year amp bind
was a big centerpiece that we thought
would unlock a lot of opportunity there
as the year went on sort of we started
to really get you know the gears turning
and getting a lot of feedback around
e-commerce but it still wasn't quite at
the level that we wanted to see and so
we graded it read just because we think
we want to see this really great user
first web and we want to see that in
e-commerce we just haven't seen it kind
of expand out as much as we're really
excited to see it go this year
now moving ahead another objective we've
had was around display advertising on
the web and so we wanted to do this
really awesome stuff around measuring
battery consumption and frame rate and
making sure that was better or
equivalent than the same amp page when
you loaded it with non amp HTML ads and
so we got to the point of measuring it
and we had some really promising data
but the sort of sample size of our
measurement was too small for us to
really feel great about creating the
screen so we gave it kind of a
yellow reading I guess when I said that
this wouldn't be a polished presentation
I meant myself and not Prudie
yeah moving on the that we had a goal to
catch all performance regressions before
we released them we did not achieve this
so there were definitely a few although
I think in a way you could even score
this green because if you look at the
real user measurements they're stable to
improving obviously because we had that
server-side rendering initiative but
basically we weren't able to completely
catch all these in regression testing
then we every year have this OPR where
the the core framework leads Justin D
Miami feel good about the core framework
so so I think you about it I feel pretty
ok about it so the the way I think about
it is like in general like if you see
like the vast increase in use cases of
over the last year and how that changes
what you want to do with this piece of
software that was originally designed to
like render news articles you have to
make changes right and and so it's
important to you know independent of all
these like you know product driven
improvements that you want to make that
you just keep improving the framework
and then finally work on amp is
productive I would never score this
dream I'm never satisfied with like bill
times and stuff but I think is actually
it's alright next one we wanted to have
90% of developers feel that amp is the
best documented JavaScript library we
unfortunately didn't really get around
to measuring this so we have it went one
sample so we've had pretty good results
so we felt it's worth scouring yellow
similar to the performance regressions
so we had the very like I mean an
extreme goal of like not unintentionally
shipping a breaking change in 2017 we
definitely have ship breaking changes
and then we had to roll all back our
production belt etc we've been like this
is a very ambitious goal I think we've
been last year we've been investing in
infrastructure so we can like know
what's a breaking change by essentially
visually dipping pages with
old and new releases and in the last
year we've been able to roll this out
for kind of a fixed set of your outs
just as we speak basically we're making
a change where every release would go
through a large number of pages and
they're basically dipped and then see we
have like a very good idea what changes
between your releases we had a goal to
get 10 noon non-google regular country
views on github the actual result is 8 I
think is pretty cool but not quite what
we wanted 10 so we we go with yellow and
finally we had the goal of em come 2017
being a smashing success was anyone
there
I think it was really cool I think like
III liked it so we gave herself and you
know non humble green well so that was
our scoring I yeah but let's go for what
we actually want to do in 2018 besides
having em confidence again our first
goal is our first objective is to enable
publishers to build the best app like
content consumption experience on the
web and I want to kind of dive into that
app like aspect so what we mean and I
think it's important to see the
evolution so we if you remember just
from the scoring we had the goal last
year to ensure that M page is at least
one control for speeds match the
equivalent of web experience by the same
publisher right and that's kind of more
of a baseline goal right you know we
wanted to ensure objectively that we're
actually building something that isn't
worse so now we complete turns around
because we're pretty confident about
that is actually better but we're going
to raise the level so that's kind of the
commoditizing excellent idea right that
we take whatever is you know and we
picked apply because people usually
associate quality with apps I'm not sure
that's a great idea but basically we say
whatever is the highest class experience
for content consumption and we won't
like all the unpaid jizz to be better
right that's our kind of a data's goal
so probably not going to be ready to
dream but maybe
good yellow so how do we do it we want
it to be possible to do more things more
easy with PAMP and in particular what
that means is that we going from like
the standard like baseline control and
that absolute must-haves more in the
vertical stack so example would be
something like you know that videos can
like automatically minify like you might
be used from the YouTube app so that
works on web pages as well here's a very
ironic slide by the way it's supposed to
show anything in scroll but the slide is
broken and it doesn't scroll which I
thought it was too funny to fix so yeah
I mean I think it's one of the most
requested features and so there's
definitely gonna be internet scroll
support an amp both in in terms of what
you want like an e-commerce store we can
load more products as you scroll down
and in in terms of what I think it's
pretty popular on the publishing space
where you can like load more articles as
you scroll down the page so those are
both features that come to amp and so
our key result here is commoditize app
quality experience and publishing and
once again we're going to use human
evolve to objectify this metric since
we're going to do along this way like
I'm stories which is obviously seen we
have a key result for that which is
established and stories as a new content
format for meaningful and useful visual
storytelling with health adoption and
visibility across the mobile web also in
this space we've seen this slide we're
working on making amp a better framework
for building your website we've have a
great story between and PDA that has
been mentioned before and so pretty
straightforward key result of amp being
considered a library for building
first-class web pages right which that's
not what it's considered right now when
that sets our goal all right dr. Rudi
thanks okay second objective area is
around ecommerce enable e-commerce
developers to build the most
frictionless purchase flows on the web
all right
so we believe the whole end-to-end flow
buying things on the web should be made
as excellent as possible
goes from the beginning of the process
where you're seeking something out or
serendipitously discovering something
you'd want to buy through to the middle
when you shop and compare and research
and then ultimately purchase and then
finally you know shopping just doesn't
end with buying something giving in your
credit card you actually either receive
the thing and there's customer service
back-end do things and so we think this
whole end-to-end flow should be
excellent this is kind of how we
conceptualize about e-commerce and we
believe amp can play a really positive
transformative role particularly in this
middle section where you're kind of
buying things and shopping on the site
and so we just want to bring that
excellence you know to more places the
last year we debuted amp bind here at
amp conference and since its launch
we've seen it unlock a ton of
capabilities if you saw those Gmail
demos earlier today you saw it like bind
being used all over the place so it's
clearly very expressive and very useful
tool and it's helping developers to
accomplish things that could have never
dreamed of building an amp and or
wouldn't have been able to be done
quickly so you know if you haven't
looked at amp in a while and especially
is the sort of the complexity for
project increases and there's more
interactivity this is definitely gonna
be a really key thing that you're gonna
want to check out and so now that solid
supports available and there's going to
be much more on the way soon in the form
of date picker support and things like
that a lot of 2018 is going to be about
scaling ecommerce as much as we can and
to do that you know we need your
feedback we need you building stuff we
need you telling us you know what you
need where there can be enhancements and
things like that and so ultimately this
drives that a couple key things that we
want to track the first is around kind
of adoption we would like many of the
top ecommerce sites who have adopted amp
as part of their purchase experience and
we'd also like the that adoption to
translate into meaningful results
through through higher conversion rates
that various folks are achieving with
launching their amp experiences and I
should also know we have a ton of really
great talks tomorrow morning around
e-commerce so please come and check
those out so our third objective area is
around maintaining the web is a vibrant
marketplace for publishers and
advertisers as we said in the keynote
something needs to fund content and so
this has always been at the heart of amp
and we've always believed in a lot of
flexibility and how people go about
doing this
and so we've closed the gap a lot with
ads revenue parity comparing the revenue
made on amp pages to non amp
implementations and one key theme that
we've noted is that investment into your
ads set up an amp really does translate
into success with ads and amp as
publishers have gone about optimizing
their setups this has been correlated
with seeing stronger results but it
doesn't just stop there you know we've
heard feedback around functional gaps
and so you also heard in the keynote a
lot of areas that we've improved you
know the things that you can do with ads
and amp which were true limitations
things where you kind of would hit a
ceiling even if you were heavily
optimized and you needed to kind of have
that feature support to unlock you to
kind of continue on the journey toward
increasing your ads performance and so
we've been rolling features like that
out to make these better and in 2018 our
goal is to help publishers make more
revenue through amp while also doing
what's at the core of amp which is
delivering a really awesome user
experience and so just in text our key
result is that amp monetization is
healthy the median revenue for amp is
going to be the nanny app pages across
all ad networks and one area that we're
super excited about for doing this as
amp HTML ads because you know even if we
fixed all the existing ad setups the
state of ads on the web itself is pretty
broken and we think amp can play a
really transformative role in helping to
solve some of this as multiset earlier
we really think it comes down to being
an architectural issue and so we'd like
to do is really you know drive forward
this UX first ad format we'd love the
industry to accept amp HTML ads as a
de-facto way of creating display ads and
so what this little requires to do
throughout the year is enable amp HTML
ads as you know as the primary ad format
in developer tools and to convince large
ad servers to be able to deliver these
ads and so we're gonna work with you
know these various ad tech organizations
and ad industry bodies like the IAB
toward establishing this as a neutral
open source ad standard across the
entire web and so you know basically it
boils down to in terms of key result
that we're looking to drive is really
increase the proportion of ads served
amp pages that are amp HTML format ads
and so finally last year you know amp
support was rolled out in Adwords
and it's been really exciting to see
this kind of new canvas and advertiser
adoption around this feature several
folks are seeing amp delivering improved
results for their paid traffic and so
basically we want to see amp continue to
provide that value in the ecosystem
through higher conversion rates and
ultimately with higher conversion rates
should hopefully be probably come
further investment from folks and so
we're super excited about kind of
delivering that full you know chain of
value throughout the year all right back
to Malta all right yeah so I said that's
the final point here we really want to
refine em strategy along along two lines
which I think we've talked a little bit
about in the keynote but just when I
give it more context here so one is that
we want to make and in this being a
single from other web content users
right so that that refers to
for example the Google Chrome stamp you
know URLs which make them distinguish oh
so we want all of that to go away
you know they on the other hand we want
to double down and M submit ability I'm
going to talk about that later and our
objective is very simple be a great
citizen of the open web with the primary
part being the you know invention of
privacy preserving pre-rendering
on in a way that works on publisher
domains right so that's that was the
primary technical gap that we were
trying to fill and we're filling right
now
so with that but the key result just
being very simply amp documents appear
on the publish here else when feasible
starting in chrome this year I should
actually talk about that starting in
chrome a little bit so um it relies on
web packaging which is a new web
standard browser step to implement it
and obviously we have the benefit of
being able to talk to our friends on the
chrome team and you know together with
them plan to implement this but we don't
have any influence on other browser
engines one interesting thing that my
team has been starting to do for over a
year now we actually are working
together with a company called agalya to
fix bugs in WebKit that we wouldn't want
fixed which i think is great like I find
this very empowering as a web developer
to be able to like not only being like
annoyed by browsers but like actually
fix them and so there's been something
we can do
for a while and we would at least you
know make available the option to WebKit
that we would actually do the
implementation of this feature but that
obviously does not mean in any way
whatsoever that Apple would take that
change and it also you know there are
some concerns around the standards so
you know you never know how this works
out but I think it's something we were
definitely going to drive not that
aspect of this is that we want to
continue to grow as a multi vendors open
source project I think there's been some
some good progress and this but there we
actually have a bunch of ideas that
we're not going to go all the way in how
we can make this much better the key
result being that three organizations
would have not actively contribute to em
begin to like actually do that this year
alright and then I want to talk about
the second aspect so the second part of
the strategy the first is like make camp
basically go away as something that's
perceivable but then on the other hand
we want to kind of double down and amps
and bid ability where it makes sense but
the cute slide about that but you know
the idea is basically to delight users
with new forms of experience that take a
batch of unique capabilities so we're
we're just and provide value that you
know would not otherwise be possible and
I think the first kind of use case that
we've seen today is Gmail right so this
is this is a direct implementation of
that strategy so I think it was a
relatively simple conversion of the
thing that was amped and using it for
email right
you just couldn't have done this with
you know any old web document right like
the the if you've ever written an HTML
email
they're like heavily sanitized heavily
like lowest common denominator because
there's all these clients right so it
was I think a really nice implication of
of of and key result being Mountain and
for email integrations this year wait
for it there's more stuff that we're
going to do unfortunately it was not
authorized to make this slide be fully
visible I'm sorry about that
um gonna keep some secrets right gotta
show something at IO there's one other
thing though just just as we're talking
about Gmail and you know it's really
exciting to bring that sort of thing to
other email providers there's probably
lots of ideas that other companies
besides Google have for around how they
can do really awesome things with amps
so we really encourage those folks to
reach out through the open source
project it's really engaged to help get
that stuff launched yeah it's actually
it's a very good point right like we
obviously like we're like working for
Google and we like it and we have our
friends and other product teams but like
there's absolutely nothing stopping
anyone using it right and I think I
showed that platform slide earlier
there's good adoption and you know
people can can implement their ideas
alright so now that part counsel I
wanted to take a shot of vodka so we
have yet another one more thing which I
think we were talking about Gmail this
morning so let me contextualize this a
little bit so amp is not dogmatic about
its implementation right so in the we do
care about it is that the amp content
clears a relatively high user experience
bar right and I think also been handset
this earlier like I said well it passed
so you know amp is just a letter to
cross that bar right but you could bring
your own letter and so here's something
we're going to try and I kind of promise
you that it's going to work but we want
to allow all of you to write JavaScript
in your M documents
so how will this possibly work so all
the Chavez given in a webworker
which primarily means that just cannot
block the main threat and that basically
maintains one primary rule that we want
to maintain is that you know whatever
you do you know you cannot stop a page
from scrolling from animating and so
forth and so at that boundary between
the worker that runs your code and the
main threat we're going to enforce these
what we call user experience invariants
for one limitation that is going to be
is similar to amp bind you don't
actually get to do stuff to your page on
page load time right which means that
you have to do server-side rendering the
only thing that happens is what at least
in the virtual DOM space is called
hydration it's going to be framework
agnostic as in you know knock yourself
out
choose your own adventure but it is and
I think that it's important to say it's
optimized for virtual Dom I'm not sure
you will be able to run angular on this
but you will be able to run react you
might be able to run like glimmer VM etc
so like libraries that kind of do have
this layer that kind of allows us to do
this abstraction and a web worker
we're building prototype based on
pre-act who's familiar with react here
right so if you know if you're not
familiar it's a library that's just some
degree compatible with react it's
primary feature being that has only
three kilobytes of JavaScript which i
think is really really nice so because
you know you start with something small
so everything that's when it's big it's
your fault it's not like the libraries
fault right and and one interesting
aspect is if you like if you're part of
the Java community I think you've seen
the trend in general that getting stuff
the main threat is something that people
want to do but no one has really been
successful doing this as scale so
another reason why we might totally fail
with this right so we kind of expect
that as we go along this journey will
open source a lot of code that is
generally useful not only for em as I've
mentioned it comes with a lot of caveats
right they may not work we started about
six weeks ago working on it it's by the
way it's like open source right no one
has noticed yet for people all canyou
can start going ticking now and it's
definitely going to you know take until
the second half of this year please
please please do not like make your
thing you want to build like depend on
this shipping because it might not ship
I'm going to like stand here next year
and say like I'm sorry we couldn't pull
it off but you know since it's being
open-source evolved like it's better to
talk about I think early on it's super
excited though right I think it's gonna
be amazing
yeah that was all I wanted to say about
this right no we do you want to do this
sure so yeah we're up in time but thanks
so much to everybody for listening and
hopefully this will give you a better
idea for what you know we're as a team
the part of the broader camp community
the team that's working at Google is
gonna focus on throughout 2018 we're
really excited about all you know all of
these broad areas you know I think you
saw a lot of the details through come
through in the talks today there's a lot
of really exciting content tomorrow as
well that's gonna lay a lot more of this
out and so yeah we're really excited
about that thanks for kind of listening
here and yeah one more thing um not yet
another one more thing no there's
something we did the last year I think
it's a you know we have to party coming
up it's gonna be apparently like a quiet
party so you can actually talk I think
for many of you it'll be excited I like
very interesting to talk to people on
the amp team so you so that you actually
know who you should talk to could
everyone on my team please come up here
and unlike sister teams and like brother
teams
if you recall this from last year
there's now a few more people
I guess this is why we have begins the
stage the fear
finally opportunity to take a group
picture I didn't have a phone I can't
take a pitch I can't take a selfie the
world's largest selfie stick to do it
