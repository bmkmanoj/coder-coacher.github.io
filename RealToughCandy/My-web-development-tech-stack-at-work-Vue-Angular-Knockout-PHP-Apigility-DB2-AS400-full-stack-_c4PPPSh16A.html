you guys today but that's gonna happen
let's go
real tough candy from really tough you
guys today
hello no subscribers thank you patreon
supporters and shout out to everyone
else thanks for tuning in today's video
I'm super excited to share with you guys
the actual text stack at my full stack 9
to 5 job it's kind of a Mindfreak
because we are using a lot of tech that
I have never even dabbled in I got a lot
to show you guys today so we're gonna
get right into it I'm gonna rewind a
little bit though I'm gonna start from
the back end and work my way to the
front with these frameworks alright so
let's start at the heart of the business
right here the IBM as/400 a lot of you
probably haven't heard of this I never
heard of this server until I got this
job this is old school this server is 30
years old
a s400 but back in the day it was a
beast and for this company that I'm
working at they've been housing data on
this as/400 since the 80s so there's 30
years of data on here the company I work
for started off as a data company and
essentially it still is a data company
but the boss realizes that you know it's
time to time to cross over to the web
here and make some services and make
some sites and applications that
complement some of our clients there are
a lot of things that we can do but there
are a lot of things we can't do with
this as the heart of the operation
because unlike when you're building
projects you start from scratch this
constricts what we do and you're going
to see some examples of that in just a
moment for example this is an IBM server
and it uses a specific database called
the db2 I never heard what a db2 is I've
used my sequel PHP myadmin
my sequel workbench yeah goodbye the IBM
db2 totally foreign to me I'm still
learning it everything is different at
this job and it's exciting but it can
also be very overwhelming
we do use sequel statements on this but
there are a lot of restrictions on that
on to the next for developing api's we
use app agility I've done some
restaurants this past week and also some
RP
see use got my hands dirty with that our
pcs our remote procedural calls and are
way beyond what I'm talking about today
in this video but this is what we do use
for API generation and we test them in
postman next on the line
PHP most of the projects are in PHP 5
the senior developer has set aside a
modernization day so that's cool we're
trying to get as much as we can to PHP 7
everything I'm showing you here today
comes back to the fact that this a s400
is the base and so PHP talks to db2
talks to the server let's keep going
down the line here finally the front and
our projects are all over the place we
have a project in angular 1 which is
much different than angular 2 and that's
why my senior developer has decided to
not continue with angularjs just because
the upgrade kind of burned him he the
projects we do are massive and upgrading
from 1.0 or whatever 2.0 would just be
monumental and not cost-effective before
angular react on all these other
frameworks came along these front-end
frameworks there was something called
knockout some of you may remember this I
was just working on a knockout project
the other day and I'm just like what is
going on it's frustrating and
fascinating and I've rarely had that
kind of combination of emotions before
whether in a job setting or otherwise so
just hacking my way through this code to
work on a client request and then
finally we also have projects in view
not entire projects but little
components here and there one of our job
applications for client is written in
View Oaks very good my senior developer
did an excellent job on that I wasn't a
part of that project but we were just
talking the other day
Friday's are our modernization days and
we were just brainstorming and thinking
of ok how can we incorporate view as
much as possible and is view going to be
future proof you know is view going to
do what angular is done and go from 1.0
to 2.0 and really burning a lot of
developers and their companies that they
work for is view
going to have some kind of monumental
scandal like Facebook has you know react
has been fully open sourced so I don't
think there's gonna be an impact on that
but I mean who really knows the future
of these kinds of frameworks so it's a
crazy time at the company I work for
we're going through a lot of changes but
one of the frustrating parts is that
even though we do want to modernize more
with view we were looking at something
that's called Silius it's an e-commerce
framework for PHP built on symphony for
your PHP guys probably familiar with
what I'm talking about but it's it's
difficult because we have all these
ideas most of my senior developers ideas
but it all comes down to whether the
client wants changes or not I mean some
of these websites are looking a little
dated they're a little slow and we want
to modernize them but it all comes down
to whether that client gives us the
thumbs up so again it's a crazy time at
my job a very exciting huge learning
curve and if you guys have any questions
about what I just showed you I would
love to answer them and if you have any
questions in general about what I do at
my job or any questions about the
transition from self-taught developer to
and 9:00 to 5:00 let me know in the
comments I do have another great
question someone left the other day I
hope to get to that video soon really
good question thanks for watching guys
again like comment subscribe you know
the drill next time we'll go outside
hopefully all this Blizzard mess will be
gone
ABC always be coding or at least
thinking about it and we'll talk to you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
