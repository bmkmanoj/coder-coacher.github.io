the saddle with you today working on
free code camps basic JavaScript section
today we're accessing nested arrays tell
you what if it's one thing I really
enjoy in this early journey of doing
JavaScript it's messing around with
arrays and just continuing to build on
what I know on arrays because for me
it's the one thing that's easy so it's
kind of a confidence booster to go back
and be like oh I can solve this without
screwing up sweet it's the one thing so
far where it's getting non cerebral and
that's one of my goals so that's pretty
awesome so whether or not you're at the
whether or not you're at that point or
not or you're working up to it doesn't
matter because we're gonna go through
the problem all the same let's see what
they're talking about today with
accessing nested arrays and we're gonna
be doing that in just a minute here so
they explained that objects can contain
both nested objects and nested arrays
similar to accessing nested objects
array bracket notation can be chained to
access nested arrays and then as always
they give us this very helpful pseudo
code which we will be referring to in
just a minute doing this problem
and down here they give us the
instructions to retrieve the second tree
from the variable my plants using object
dot and array bracket notation okay so
let's get started we're gonna get rid it
says change this line and they only want
us to change code below this line so
very helpful free code camp already
setting us up for success so where do we
start well if you're confused at this
point just go to the pseudo code and one
of these lines you can just keep
referring to pretty much the same format
for we're gonna be plugging in down here
so they started out with our pets which
is the variable up here so we'll simply
start by declaring my plants are not
declaring about typing my plants and
then so you see you can kind of use
their answer to gauge what they're
trying to do here so after all this is
said and done they came up with fluffy
so let's deconstruct how they did that
they started with our pets and then they
went to 0 which as you know in an array
is the first so this is the first of
that animal type cat ok so then they go
to names we're in the name section now
that's just digging one level deeper and
they gave it one so if you count Mouser
is the first one but in an array it's
zero so the way we count it is zero
one okay and then that's where that one
came from and the answer would be fluffy
let's look at this one just in case you
need to have a little more illustration
here spot
so our pets is the one in the array so
there's zero and then one
so we're here in this section here and
now we're at nîmes and zero so in an
array again the first of anything in an
array is counted as zero so that's zero
and a spot how can we apply that to this
well we've already set up this variable
down here so now we're just going to add
the appropriate we're gonna add regular
brackets and add the appropriate array
number so as you see the type of here is
floggers that would be array zero and
then down here it's gonna be one and
then we're going to do dot notation for
that
and then we are going to ways my mind
just floating off like a butterfly I
know what to do this I promise my plants
want okay so we're down here now and
they want us to get the second tree okay
so they want they want this little thing
here to print pine when it's all said
and done so again we're gonna be
counting this as an array you see these
array brackets here this whole thing is
in a rate so like I said before as we
count arrays the first one of an array
is 0 so this is 0 and this is 1 and
since they want the second tree this
pine tree it's gonna be 1 but not before
we add type
let's just see how that works run nope
it did not okay let's see what I'm doing
wrong my plants zero one dot type oops
this should be list perfect
alright guys that's pretty much it I
really can't add anything more to that
if you're good at something this early
on in the game keep doing it it builds
your confidence this probably was not a
good example for me because I screwed
this part up but I see what I did wrong
hope you enjoyed this video thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
