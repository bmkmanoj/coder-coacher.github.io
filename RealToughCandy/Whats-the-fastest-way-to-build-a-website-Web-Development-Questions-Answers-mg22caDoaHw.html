through this residential neighborhood
this early in the morning is that I want
to use my outside voice
one of my
prolific commenters and honestly one of
my favorite subscribers who I'm playing
favorites this guy is always asking
great questions and when someone asks a
question odds are other people do have
that question Chiquito Chiquito wants to
know what's the fastest way to build a
website can you build a framework
knowing HTML CSS and JavaScript and what
was the third question how many
different kinds of websites are there oh
these are all great questions let's
start with the first one what's the
quickest way to build a website
WordPress no one wants to hear that
answer WordPress has been around for a
long time and over the years it's really
gotten finesse to the point where with
one click literally one click and
filling out the name of your database
you can have a full web application or a
website whatever you want to call it
within an hour mmm that might take you a
few hours but within the day will say
within the day you could have a website
up and running it's pretty incredible
there are other platforms for example
right now I'm using something called
October CMS it's based on PHP but it's
not nearly as user friendly or I guess I
should say consumer friendly it's not
newbie friendly WordPress makes it dead
simple a lot of WordPress developers
don't even know how to code you don't
have to you should probably have some
good research skills because you're like
looking for plug-ins that suit your
needs but you could get through life
doing WordPress web development without
touching a lick of code some purists may
disagree that that's web development but
I think it still counts you still have
to have certain a certain skill set can
someone build a framework using HTML CSS
and JavaScript
abso-freakin'-lutely look at something
like bootstrap which makes the grid and
layouts for CSS so much easier there's
also something called skeleton which is
a really I want to say simplistic but
it's a lot less heavy handed than
bootstrap it is promising that
developers can create new products in
that
where you don't have to know 500
languages or do all this tomfoolery to
make something like a framework your
last question how many different kinds
of websites are there if you google this
which I did because I want it to be as
accurate as possible you're gonna get a
lot of different answers so I'm just
gonna answer this personally if anyone
else has a better definition please let
me know I like to look at it first of
all between static websites and like
full-stack website it's okay like
websites that have a database websites
that have a back-end language that
communicate with that database to get
information there are things like static
site generators that don't use databases
those are good for blogs like tech blogs
because they use markdown files not
really like newbie friendly static web
sites are also good for stuff like
landing pages my portfolio is a static
web site it doesn't have a database I
just love it I love static site
generators there's other types of static
sites but the static site generators or
SSDs are a pretty cool thing and then we
have the full stack stuff that does
involve some sort of database going back
to WordPress for example any content
management system which WordPress is CMS
ecommerce stuff Magento Drupal Joomla
one quick and dirty way that I use to
tell if a site has a database or not is
if there's a login page any kind of
authentication or authorization tells me
that this program or this site or this
app is looking for credentials in a
database so that's what I use just when
I'm like quickly trying to see what kind
of site it is so like for example social
media you're always logging in with
social media social media sites almost
always if not always have a database so
