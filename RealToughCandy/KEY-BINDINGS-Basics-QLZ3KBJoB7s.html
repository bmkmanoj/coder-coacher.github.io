compaq in business with you today how
you doing
today's topic is key bindings and it's
the one category in life where the term
Alt right and alt left for that matter
don't necessarily have to be politicized
so that is great news
the purpose of today's video is to show
you guys some key binding techniques
define what they are so you can save
yourself a lot of time when you're
working on projects and other items in
your code editor of choice now let's go
back here because of line text on
official documentation is saying that
key bindings let you map sequences of
key presses to commands that's a long
way of saying that key bindings are
shortcuts you're probably already using
key bindings in your day-to-day tasks on
the computer but you just do it out of
habit you're not really thinking oh
here's I'm going to do a key binding now
so in an easy example of that I'm
opening up atom here my code editor
using today let's just say I want to
copy and paste something so normally you
would just maybe start like this if
you're doing the long way hit cut go
down here hit enter going on here hit
paste that is an example of not using a
shortcut for a key binding so what you
could do is simply double click this
TEDx go down here boom boom that saves a
lot of time and again it's probably
something everyone watch it most people
watching this video do I'm going to go
into a few specific key bindings in atom
however whatever text editor you're
using probably has a shortcut page for
key bindings still learning atom it's
not very intuitive I'm noticing but I do
use at them pretty regularly so that's
going to be under preferences and it's
going to turn into a settings page and
I'm right on key bindings here so you
know if it hits install you just go up
to here to kit key bindings and as we
can see these keystrokes equate to
commands and it also lists the source of
these commands for example these are
core keystrokes so this is just vanilla
atom if you will this comes with the
basic at
editor so c1 alt command left bracket
now that's a pretty good one because
that is going to fold our current row
and I think see how this is helpful just
to clean it up for a bit so we'll go to
style can you see that so here I am and
I'm going to hit was it was an alt
command left bracket old command left
bracket and this is gonna this is going
to close this whole head here actually
will close the style first so command
alt left bracket and it closed these
file contents same thing with the head
we'll close that up command o left
bracket close the entire head and to
open that I can do command alt right
bracket let's see blinky alternatively I
could just click on it and open it up
now one that I use every day that's also
a universal mostly Universal key binding
or shortcut is command + am on a Mac and
this is going to increase to bring it to
the default size I would do command 0
and then to make it smaller I would do
command minus sign and I'm going back to
default so as you guys can see it can
start very basically with just the
command plus you can do gosh what else
there's one that brings it to the last
character of each word I think it's all
arrow alright that's what it is so
alright as you can see let me bump this
up so you guys can see so we're going to
go to the end of each word here honestly
there are probably a few different
applications for this but I have not
used this one yet I can kind of see
where it might be useful so we're just
going to go alt right and as you can see
it goes to the end of every word or if
it's a character to the end of that
character like a dash or whatever boom
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom cool
now you can also use key bindings in the
terminal only in the terminal they are
called aliases so I'm not going to go
through that just because it's kind of a
whole different video by itself but for
example I have Metasploit loaded on my
computer somewhere I don't know where
the heck it is I forgot where it is in
the path and I don't have time to I do
have time I don't want to invest that
time so this is where the alias aka
keybinding aka shortcut comes in handy
so let's say I want to navigate to
Metasploit and I have no idea where it
is I created a key binding called meta
so when I type in meta it brings me
right to the directory see watch this
hit LS and this is where I am right now
here's my working directory brought me
right to the Metasploit framework if
you're interested in creating aliases
for your terminal it comes in very handy
especially when you're getting really
long path things and you just want to
hit like I don't know two keys to make
something happen include the directions
for that it involves tweaking your bash
RC profile or bash profile on give you
some documentation for that so these are
things at the end of the day guys most
of these I don't know and honestly I
don't think a lot of web developers go
home at night saying oh god I've got to
go home and study my key bindings like
the ones you use every day you're going
to memorize but certain things you know
for certain projects may come in very
handy and that is where key bindings are
going to save you hours potentially of
frustration and strife so alright alt
left wherever you are enjoy the key
bindings including some documentation
for you guys to get started on your
editors of choice for sublime atom and
the Mac terminal hopefully it will help
you out thanks for watching this video I
hope it was helpful and lots of more
cool things coming up on this channel
I'm going to be unavailing soon
including something I call candy
overflow oh yeah so prepare for the
sugar rush because it's coming soon it's
going to be a great feature on this
channel also some interviews with full
stack web developers and people getting
it done
for extra motivation so we'll see you in
the next video guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
