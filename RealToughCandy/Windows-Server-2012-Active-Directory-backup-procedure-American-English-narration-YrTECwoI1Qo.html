candy for real tough candy calm back in
the saddle with you today this is the
first of a three-part video in a
business continuity plan a series now in
this video we're gonna be installing
Windows Server backup and we're also
going to do a little bonus segment of
configuring Windows Server backup to
make a daily backup of Active Directory
so I am on a virtual server right now
this is the Windows Server 2012 here and
we're gonna get right into it so we're
gonna start by installing Windows Server
backup so the number one thing I have to
do for my configuration here is get to
the remote desktop so I'm going to go
ahead and click on the remote desktop
and then the one I want to go to is
Target Windows Oh 1 RDP and this is all
part of my own personal business
continuity plan your continuity plan may
vary you know your motivation for
proceeding with this phase may vary you
know I might not be part of a BCP a
business continuity plan so there are
various applications various motivations
for you know using these steps here so
we're gonna go ahead and minimize at
that actually we're gonna go ahead and X
on that and then we're gonna go down to
the server manager icon which is this
little like suitcase thing and the
server down here go ahead and click that
gonna let it fire up and then once this
pops up we are gonna go ahead and
navigate to manage add roles and
features from the server manager menu so
we're gonna go right up here I'll let
this warm up a little bit more I want to
jam too much so we hit the manage button
up here we're gonna go ahead and hit add
roles and features alright and then it's
gonna pop up here and we're gonna this
is the add roles and features wizard and
we're just gonna go ahead I can you
breathe through this if you'd like I
don't need to just tells you to make
sure some of these tasks have been
completed the admin account is
strong password network settings like
the static IP address are configured and
the most current security updates from
Windows Update are installed so these
should already be taken care of if
they're not go ahead and do those and
then come back to this wizard here so
all those are taken care of on my end so
we're gonna go ahead and click Next and
now this is gonna be again this is
according to my own business continuity
plan your needs may vary you might need
to do a remote remote desktop services
installation but I need to do a
role-based or feature-based installation
which is configuring a single server by
adding roles role services and features
so we're gonna go ahead that was
selected by default go ahead and click
Next
all right so I want to consult my
documentation here because I can't quite
remember what I had needed for my own
configuration so I need to select select
a server from the server pool alright
that's default great and now we're gonna
click Next and now we have the option
here to select one or more roles to
install on the selected server so I need
a few other ones here I actually need to
add Windows Server essentials experience
so we're gonna go ahead and navigate
down here they'll click that alright and
then it's gonna pop up another little
box here add features I required for
Windows Server essentials experience you
can uninstall Windows Server essential
experience unless the following role
services or features are also installed
ok so it already is clicking here
include management tools of applicable
set for us suite we're gonna go ahead
and add features to accept the
additional features and close this
pop-up box to add all those so we are
good to go so we're gonna go hits next
and now we get to select our features so
we get to select one or more features to
install on the selected server we
already have the BranchCache here the
group policy management
I can't even select it's grayed out here
but we're gonna go I need to add client
for NFS let me do in some NFS
work later on in this series so the
client for NFS enables my computer to
access access files on the UNIX based
and FS servers and when client for NFS
is installed I can configure a computer
to connect to UNIX and FS shares that
allow anonymous access so that's what I
need for my personal plan here so we're
gonna go ahead and click Next
bada-bing Windows Server essentials
provides a powerful and flexible
solution beautiful it's not asking us to
buy anything so that's good it also
supports the applications I need to run
my business and helps me quickly connect
to additional cloud based applications
and services to extend the functionality
of my server note Windows Server
essentials is only supported for single
domain environments ok sounds good to me
why not and they keep going here this is
just some documentation to read about
the web server roles so it's a little
introduction about what's going on I
don't if you need to look over this go
ahead and pause the video I already have
an understanding of what this is you
know you know I'll just read the bullet
points here it's just so we're clear on
what this actually is web server role
the using Windows system resource
manager aka WMS RM can help ensure
equitable servicing of web server
traffic especially where there are
multiple roles in this computer and also
the default installation for the web
server role includes the installation of
role services that enable you to serve
static content make minor customizations
monitor and log server activity and
configure static content compression
sounds like my type of web server role
ok next we'd understand and now we're
gonna select the role services to
install for the web server now let me
check my let me check my documentation I
don't need to add anything else we
already had the common HTTP HTTP feature
selected I don't need HTTP redirection
or web dev publishing I don't need a
request monitor so I do have these
things selected already by default and
we're just gonna go with the default I
don't need an FTP server a lot of you
guys watching this might
an ftp server on that as a roll service
to install for the web server it's
entirely up to your personal continuity
plan or whatever documentation you have
so we're gonna go ahead and click Next
and let's see here
our luck our our last option here is
confirmed and we're gonna click install
this might take up to a half hour guys
so once you hit install you know I'm
just gonna go over this quick dotnet
BranchCache client for NFS that was the
big one that I added most the rest of
these are defaults web server management
tools everything is looking good in
groovy and matching up with what I need
to have on my stuff my servers okay so
we're gonna go ahead and click install
everything looks good we are confirming
there's that Windows Server essentials
experience looks beautiful let's go
ahead and install and it is starting the
installation so what I'm going to do
guys I'm gonna power this down for a few
minutes and pop back on once this
progress bar has gotten to this point
all right guys we're back and this took
about 6 minutes didn't take a half hour
so that was pretty sweet we're running a
pretty light all things considered
actually didn't have too many add-ons
here so we are all good to go
it says configuration required
installation sucks seeded so we're gonna
head go ahead and hit close but now we
see this big yellow caution symbol up
here and I'm thinking oh what did I
screw up am I gonna have a job by the
time this is over let's find out so this
is good to go but what happened was
there needs to be some post deployment
configuration for the Windows Server
essentials option that I selected when I
was setting this up so something needs
to be configured so we're gonna go ahead
and hit configure Windows Server
essentials now we're just gonna go
through the box here and the nice thing
about this entire process
you know from point A all the way to
point Z where you finish is that it
guides you through you know there's no
come
in her face there's no plugging and
unplugging there's no resetting the
entire system it's very linear and it
keeps us on track for what we have to do
so now we're going to go ahead and
configure it says the server has been
set up to a domain controller
click configure to set up Windows Server
essentials on the domain controller the
computer name cannot be changed after
the configuration has been done that's
pretty important to remember good thing
to know okay so go ahead and click
configure and now that is all the
information that I need to provide the
server is being prepared for use and may
restart more than once they again warned
us this may take up to 30 minutes
they also say do not perform any other
operations that can change the server
configuration or turn it off so you know
I don't condone smoking but it's a good
time for a virtual smoke break right
here if this is going pretty slow and
now my Windows server has been installed
on my remote domain controller
easy as pie guys as long as you follow
the instructions and follow your written
documentation you will be good to you I
suppose written documentation is kind of
redundant but let's move on so that is
good to go we're good to go
awesome configuration completed so now
we're gonna go over to part 2 of this
which is configuring Active Directory
we're going to be using Windows Server
backup to make a daily backup of Active
Directory which is part of the Windows
system state on a domain controller so
Active Directory what that is is that it
contains the users groups distro list
and also organizational units used in
the domain so now we're gonna go ahead
and get the heck out of here we're still
on our remote desktop here we can tell
because we have this IP address up here
and we're gonna go ahead and go to the
file we're gonna go to the server
manager menu I'm gonna start right over
I know I could have just stayed there
but just for illustration purposes so
we're gonna go over to tools wait for
this to fire up and then we're simply
going to select Windows serve
back up which is down all the way down
here go ahead and click so this is up
and we're gonna go ahead and navigate to
local backup just click that once and
it's reading the data so we're just
gonna hold steady here and see what this
machine has to say about status of our
local backup to see if there's any
backups scheduled or what the deal is
and we see here there is an Amber
caution symbol in the center pane right
here and I saying that no backup has
been configured so we're gonna go ahead
and launch the backup schedule wizard
which is right over here we're gonna go
ahead and click that and then it says
you can use this wizard to configure
backups to run on a regular schedule to
create backup schedule you need to
decide what to backup when and how often
to back up and where so you know the
basics what when and where I already
know again because of my documentation
you know I go ahead and click Next
and I want to do a custom installation
here or configuration rather so we're
gonna go ahead and click Next
and what I want to do as far as
customizing is adding items what I want
to do is click the system state checkbox
and hit OK and then on the specified
backup time actually we're gonna hit
next first and then we're gonna have the
backup time so I want to back up 6 hours
from the current time so we have this
drop down and let's see what's my local
time here my local time is 425 p.m. so I
want to do it tonight at 10:25 we'll go
10:30 10:30 p.m. next as far as
specified destination we're gonna go
with the default backup to a hard disk
that is dedicated for backups that's the
recommended option that's what we're
gonna take and for the select
destination disk we're going to show all
available disks just to see what we're
working with here we're gonna go ahead
and click this 10 gig drive at check box
use that
okay next when you finish the wizard the
selected dish will be reformed added and
all the existing volumes and data on the
disk will be deleted okay so when you
select your backup make sure that disk
is good to be formatted and get all your
stuff on there backed up if there is any
information you need to keep so we're
gonna go ahead and click yes okay and
this is confirmed so we're gonna go
ahead and click finish formatting the
disk all right and now it's successfully
created the backup schedule my first
backup is scheduled tonight at 10:30
p.m. when everyone I know is in bed or
at home or otherwise not at works this
is a great time to backup so we're gonna
make sure the bist we're using to store
scheduled backups are attached to the
computer and are available indeed they
are so that is that boom boom and boom
and we're back on our home Windows
Server 2012 here guys so let's just go
over all we did today the first part we
installed a Windows Server backup on a
Roma remote domain controller and then
in part two we use Windows Server backup
to make a daily backup of Active
Directory again Active Directory
contains all the goodies the users the
groups the distribution lists and
organizational units used in the domain
so in the next video as part of this
business continuity plan series we're
going to be configuring websites to use
a common NFS share ooh
NFS by the way is used to make remote
folders appear as part of the local
filesystem
on Linux and even Windows systems good
stuff guys we'll see in the next vid
