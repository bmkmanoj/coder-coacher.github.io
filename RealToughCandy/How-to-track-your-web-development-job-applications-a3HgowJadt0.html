real tough candy from your cough Canada
back online with you today today I'm
gonna be showing you in efficient and
effective oh did I mention the simple
job application tool that is gonna boost
your confidence and help you get
organized so if you're like me after
about the twelfth application of the day
all the listings start looking the same
and I might be applying for the same job
I wouldn't know unless I referenced this
sheet and say ooh WordPress ville I
think I might have applied to him
let me check oh yeah on November 9th I
applied and I kind of liked the company
I gave it a 3 out of 4 rating that helps
me there and it also helps me boost my
confidence because when I'm organized I
feel like I have a better grasp on
things and I know where to go to
cross-reference things and follow up in
all kinds of good stuff
and organization just makes me feel good
so it helps me in two different ways so
I want to share with you most of these
things are pretty self-explanatory
the rejected portion down here are jobs
that companies that really don't care
about me and don't want to get to know
me puts a little sad face on me
somewhere but you can't let it hold you
back this is just so I know to avoid
this company didn't hear back from them
they're not interested don't bother with
them there's so many others I need to
focus on these guys so I color coded
this likeability scale so I can easily
find the purple the purple are the ones
that I'm just like I want to work for
these people these people would benefit
from what I have to offer
mocha madness gave them before I got to
the phone hello stage of the application
progress process so there's different
stages I these are all arbitrary so I
have an applied stage which is just you
know submitting your resume the phone
hello when they get back to you
phone technical interview the on-site
interview and then a job offer so I'm
about halfway through to going yes with
mocha madness to getting that on-site
job interview and the eventual job offer
what I'm gonna do is follow up with an
email later today and see if we can't
work out a phone Tech interview or at
least
plant that idea in the company's mind so
I'm gonna add a little column here maybe
like a to-do and that's gonna be a
follow up the email please please
this likability scale is also helpful on
the other side of things because media
blimp as you see I gave a one rating
maybe it was something about their
culture about their policy about their
workflow that I just didn't like or
maybe just the the job didn't sound
appealing because I found better ones
afterward I'm still gonna leave it on
here though because like I said a lot of
these listings are repeat listings and I
can't keep track of what's what you can
add any sort of column here to help your
application workflow go a little
smoother I don't know what else maybe
like a follow-up or maybe notes will say
the point I remember the the mocha man
is the point of contact here point of
contact I just have a first name Chuck
so when I do follow up with this email
I'm gonna be addressing it to Chuck
because he was the guy that I talked you
very helpful tool very simple tool very
efficient tool to help you on your job
search I hope this video is helpful as
