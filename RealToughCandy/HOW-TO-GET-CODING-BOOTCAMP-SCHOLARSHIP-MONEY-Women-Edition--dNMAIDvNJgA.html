the saddle with you today today this
post for milady is we're going to go
over some resources for you ladies out
there those who are vaginally enabled
excuse the crudeness but that's what it
boils down to if you have lady parts
you're eligible for some pretty sweet
financial incentives if you want to
learn code whether you agree with it or
not I personally have very strong
feelings about this check it out at my
blog real tough canycom you can read
everything about how I feel about this
but regardless doesn't matter because
the bottom line is this money is
available for women so the first thing I
would recommend for any female to do
who's interested in you know developing
their skills getting that basic skill
set down or just a dancing their skills
wherever you are on your coding journey
go to women who code calm this resource
is incredible I think they're based out
of San Francisco it doesn't matter
because they have chapters all over the
world and what women who code do is more
than just one thing yes Nicole but they
also they do meet up they do tech
conferences they do scholarship
opportunities that you blogs and just
give you different opportunities to
participate in the various things that
relate to women and coding so why am i
exactly directing your attention here
for this video because I'll show you
what because where do we sign up for the
newsletter so I highly encourage you if
you're a female were gone doesn't matter
who you are to explore this there's lots
of good resources for people in general
but let's find out where their
newsletter is because earrings here here
we subscribe to the code review you want
to subscribe to the code review they're
not going to sell your information less
than I wear their privacy policy at
least so simply fill out this info and
each week you are going to get an HTML
or plain text your preference email and
in
now you're going to get something that
look Christmassy if the code review and
everything on your every link is an
opportunity let's go right into the loop
shall we scholarships women who code and
flatter in school have pained up to
offer one full scholarship and 20
partial scholarships to their online web
developer program applied by 3 12 17 so
you still have us some time to apply for
that one they also amount to galvanize
in Adobe Digital Academy have partnered
to provide two scholarships to the San
Francisco Bay galvanized web development
immersive so this one is a women who
code exclusive ok this flattered in
school I think it's like eighteen
thousand dollars where's the application
for that here it is the women who called
who hooked up with flat iron gold and
maximum tuition is for 12 months or nine
thousand dollars that's fifty percent
off is nine thousand dollars so yeah the
holes called the full tuition for
flyering school is eighteen thousand
dollars so explore what you want to do
is you want to do java do you want to do
from end stuff what's your feel like
what what are you trying to do because
i'm telling you every week i have been
subscribed to this code review for
probably more a year and a half there
are scholarships announced every week
and the school is often different i've
applied to you hack reactor iron yard
those are just a few that come up a few
more and i've been invited to
participate in their coding challenge
you know the little league logic
problems and solve this javascript
before they actually accept you into the
program so it's not a gimmick problem
with me is that I'm not sure I'm not
experienced basic JavaScript early I'm
still trying to get the basics down and
for a lot of these schools unfortunately
I know it's kind of lame but they're
looking for people who have the basics
down pat and you know I don't have that
right now I still have to google some of
the answers on free kochi on basic java
script section so that's that the other
thing i want to say about women who code
is that they do need up so check your
city
and I highly encourage women to check
those out because I've been with you and
it's not this thing where it's not a
coffee klatch like it can be but the
ones I've gone to I came with specific
goals like I had Java problems not
JavaScript but Java language problems I
need help with and there were two people
right away you were like you don't want
I can help you it was awesome and it was
non-judgmental arena free food and drink
it was pretty freakin sweet so then we
have events lesbian to check in San
Francisco etc you want to speak on and
eyes I'm telling you sign up for this
newsletter to code review at women who
code you won't regret it if you weren't
female and like I said even guys because
some of this stuff yeah it's for female
audience but a lot of it these jobs I
mean they're not going to hire just war
means there's employment opportunities
for guys and girls females so let me
explain one thing in particular though
if you do apply for these scholarships
through man who code keep in mind you're
going to have to fill out the basic
application so this is the start of the
Flatiron school application okay you
need to apply to get into the school the
coding camp then most likely if you're
going if it's a hook up with women who
code they're going to have you set up
fill out this google doc which is first
name last name twitter email and then
how is the mission code and package your
career and why is it important to you i
still this out multiple times it takes
what five minutes be honest don't be a
jerk you know they just want to know I
don't know for their promotional
materials if you win something you know
stick your name in there and your
Twitter and how when your code is intact
your career why it's important to you
and you have the option of using just
your first name last initial or
anonymous so they do they seemingly
respect your privacy which is nice so
that's that the third thing and then
we're just gonna move on to some other
where my hair some other opportunities
that aren't related to a little code but
this also applies to you know others
getting other other scholarships Esau
women who code scholarships is that let
me go to some pages appropriate let's go
over here because flattered in school I
believe is in New York City's let me
just get cities let's just check this
out clutter and school calm just to see
so I can illustrate my point I look at
it announcing our women take tech
scholarship and partnership with
Birchbox so these opportunities ladies
are flowing out of the ears of these
code camp it's incredible so where the
heck are these guys wait okay they're
based in Manhattan this is bad news let
me tell you what because even though
you're a female and every door is open
for you for accelerating your career in
coding for 12 to 16 weeks you can have
to find housing and food and
transportation to get yourself to
Broadway second floor in New York City
you know how expensive it is to live in
New York City do you feel like commuting
two hours to save a few hundred dollars
and rent each month or whatever your
living arrangement is for New Jersey
that is a big thing they do not none of
these code camps that are based in San
Francisco or New York City 02 most
expensive cities in the United States
will talk about because although their
scholarships scholarships are generous
the housing situation is going to kick
your ass and I don't know about you but
I met a fan of reaching out to five
people I don't know to share a slum slum
housing situation or whatever legis- one
housing situation but the point being
living with five strangers for three or
four months and kind of over it maybe
you're different hey that's a personal
decision but just keep in mind you're
going to be having to think about where
you're going to stay for those three
months four months sometimes up is six
months in the most expensive city in the
United States
trust me it's frickin expensive you're
going to need probably 15 grand I'm not
kidding ask somebody who lived in new
york city or san francisco how much they
they pay for rent or even you know
sharing a room so again keep it in mind
and account too that these silver lining
is that a lot of these caps to web
remote immersions meaning you can do it
in the comfort of your own plan those
are the ones I've been applying for
reasons because when I first started out
I was like spamming all right awesome
San Francisco New York City I'm hit I'm
cool I'm in the know and then you do
researching like oh wait you mean you
don't have a personal mansion for me to
live in by myself with my cat for four
months oh I think I better recompute so
the ones i'm applying for or all Ramona
versus and you're at home on your
computer 12 hours a day doing the same
thing just not paying rent in the most
expensive expensive city in the world
moving on so that was all of these were
related to religion code again I just
blows the competition out of the water
if there is even any competition sign up
for the code review get your bubble
mizuko calm the other thing you can do
is simply google scholar hush tips for
women in coding you don't even spell it
right a lot of things Papa 588 thousands
result it's incredible and then they
extend stem scholarships maybe you don't
want to do coding if you like cyber
security or something which is something
well that's another topic for a
different game coding boot camp
scholarships for women over at sinful
khou.com is something that I pulled out
what up now let's pull this up actually
okay let's go this one khou.com more
free money code up is dedicated to
narrowing the gender gap in tech for
each immersive program we offer two
scholarships exclusively to women it's
time to level the playing field let me
guess you guys are in San Francisco and
I can't afford to live there for three
months oh I was wrong San San Antonio
okay rewind snarky
and restart so caught up since San
Antonio but you want to know what I was
in the Air Force and I don't have very
good memories of San Antonio I don't
like San Antonio sorry San Antonio it's
just not my city basic training bootcamp
is intentional for the Air Force for
those wondering let's learn more okay
they offer women to scholarship for full
stack program at club okay i read that
wrong we offer two women scholarships
her full stack program at five thousand
dollars boss the full program tuition
but i'm looking for something full do i
don't want this happiest i want a full
ride because you know what the
competition is so fierce people are so
desperate for vaginas they are going to
give you my fellow ladies my fellow
ladies with ladies in free full rides
actuation the son of these might be that
you just have to identify as a woman I'm
interested as anyone I would love to see
someone who's watching this video
socially engineered their way into a
free scholarship and not identified and
have toy cars and not identify well you
know what I mean like just be a bear
unidentified as a chick and see if you
get in the use of school this would be
really cool social experiment okay I'm
losing focus and I'm starting to troll
by himself let's move on so the other
thing I want to point out here is the
iron yard I was reading the irony rights
law they're actually looked at the main
site here i came across because i was
interested in doing java javascript java
back and training before I saw the
employment status of JavaScript because
employers are desperately desperate for
JavaScript and job market is better than
Java and JavaScript if seems a little
more exciting so it's a 12-week scope
cold school so only three months give or
take free crash courses corporate
training blah blah so if you I was just
like I said I was pitching so see where
they're located and will scream after
the attack they're all over the US 0
what about isa so couple of laura de ok
so i was reading a blog and it says the
iron yard offers free tuition for women
and minorities in minnesnowta and maybe
it's just my greedy brain but when i
said when i see free tuition without you
know the qualifier of partial offers
partial free tuition for women or
minorities but applause so they're
launching a 40 million tech opportunity
fund for some free tuition and then so
this is the tech opportunity fun so like
tell ya Tek opportunity fund lets us all
salad students with financial need are
encouraged to apply to receive a full
tuition to attend a full-time immersive
cook ok so it is full tuition but the
problem with the iron yard was that i
applied I got all the way to the Google
Hangouts splashface file / video
conferencing platform of choice
interview they went great you know I
talked with the Java bleed Java
instructor and the admissions rest for
about 45 minutes it was a nice
conversation it seems a big what i was
saying a guy who really knows but yeah
when good and then I didn't hear from
them for like a week and I followed up
and you know that's because we have so
much because guys and girls females have
so much selection in the coding camp if
someone doesn't get back to me within a
week I'm already just like you know I'm
moving on there's just so much
competition people that are doing it
better but I said you know what I like
these guys we had a good chat I'm gonna
hit him up and so I hit up the
admissions rep and she was like I'm
sorry to say but we are ending our java
program in this location in effect we're
ending the whole school in this location
I was like oh okie dokie was it
something I said but she was saying that
they're going to be doing corporate
training at that location but she did
apologize and she said if there is a
location that I liked that they would
offer me tuition half off which was
pretty sweet but again it's the the cost
of living well they obviously have more
places they don't even have a campus in
New York or San Francisco
but you know packing up and moving to a
state for three months in the age of the
Internet in the age of facetime hangouts
and well formerly skype I don't know
anybody who'd escaped you say some
people like still am not judging I'm
just saying there's no there is a reason
to do it at this location but just not
something I'm interested in so let's
review women who code get your butt on
it and sign up googling scholarships for
women always a good idea or in search
minority group here what about what
about this hey check that out okay yeah
the Milo scholarship right the white
man's guide to getting a minority
scholarship a social engineering and
social experimentation is so fun these
constructs people these long hugs no
money unless you have vagina the iron
yard okay yeah okay so tech opportunity
funds i think i pretty much covered it
people thanks for watching this video
and i hope it was helpful if anything
look googling is important and reading
the fine print and following up is
important but women who code and getting
hooked up with these women is even more
important thanks for watching it will
see in the next video i might be doing a
video similar video to this instead of
women military veterans what do you
think guys let me know in the comments
below what you thought like thumbs down
i don't know we'll see you in the next
video thanks for watching
