the saddle with you today
today this postformal ad is we're gonna
go over some resources for you ladies
out there those who are vaginally
enabled excuse the crudeness but that's
what it boils down to if you have lady
parts you're eligible for some pretty
sweet financial incentives if you want
to learn code whether you agree with it
or not I personally have very strong
feelings about this check it out
at my blog real tough candy calm you can
read everything about how I feel about
this
but regardless doesn't matter because
the bottom line is this money is
available for women so the first thing I
would recommend for any female to do
who's interested in you know developing
their skills getting that basic skill
set down or just advancing their skills
where ever you are on your coding
journey go to women who code calm this
resource is incredible I think they're
based out of San Francisco doesn't
matter because they have chapters all
over the world and what women who code
do is more than just one thing yes the
code but they also they do meetups they
do tech conferences they do scholarship
opportunities that you blogs and just
give you different opportunities to
participate in various things that
relate to women and coding so why am i
exactly directing your attention here
for this video because I'll show you why
because where do we sign up for the
newsletter so I highly encourage you if
you're a female or a guy doesn't matter
who you are to explore this there's lots
of good resources for people in general
but let's find out where their
newsletter is because earrings here here
we subscribe to the code review you want
to subscribe to the code review they're
not going to sell your information last
time I read their privacy policy at
least so simply fill out this info and
each week you are gonna get an HTML or
plain text your preference
email and in this email you're gonna get
something that looks like this it's the
code review and everything on your every
link is an opportunity let's go write
down a scholarship shall we
scholarships women who code and Flatiron
school have teamed up to offer one at
full scholarship and 20 partial
scholarships to their online web
developer program apply by 3 1217 so you
still have some time to apply for that
one they also announced to galvanize an
Adobe Digital Academy have partnered to
provide two scholarships to the San
francisco-based
galvanize web development immersive so
this one is a women who code exclusive
ok this flattered in school I think it's
like eighteen thousand dollars where's
the application for that here it is the
women who code who hooked up with
Flatirons goal and maximum tuition is
for 12 months or nine thousand dollars
that's 50% off is nine thousand dollars
so yeah the full Scott the full tuition
for Flatiron school is eighteen thousand
dollars so explore what you want to do
do you want to do job I do you want to
do front-end stuff what's your feel like
what what are you trying to do because
I'm telling you every week I have been
subscribed to this code review for
probably about a year and a half there
are scholarships announced every week
and the school is often different I have
applied to hack reactor iron yard those
are just a few that come up a few more
and I've been invited to participate in
their coding challenge you know the
little league logic problems and solve
this JavaScript before they actually
accept you into the program so it's not
a gimmick problem with me is that I'm
not experiment inexperienced
baby sick javascript her like I'm still
trying to get the basics down and for a
lot of these schools unfortunately I
know it's kind of lame but they're
looking for people who have the basics
down pat and you know I don't have that
right now I still have to Google some of
the answers on free code camps basic
JavaScript section
so that's that the other thing I want to
say about women who code is that they do
Meetup so check your cities and I highly
encourage women to check those out
because I've been to a few and it's not
this thing where it it's not a coffee
klatch like it can be but the ones I've
gone to I came with specific goals like
I had Java problems not JavaScript but
Java language problems I needed help
with and there were two people right
away who were like you don't want I can
help you it was awesome and it was a
non-judgmental arena free food and drink
it was pretty freakin sweet so then we
have events lesbians who tech in San
Francisco etc you want to speak on and
on guys I'm telling you sign up for this
newsletter this code review at women who
code you won't regret it if you weren't
female and like I said even guys because
some of this stuff yeah it's for female
audience but a lot of it these jobs I
mean they're not gonna hire just mean
there's employment opportunities for
guys and girls females so let me explain
one thing in particular though if you do
apply for these scholarships through men
who code keep in mind you're gonna have
to fill out the basic application so
this is the start of the Flatiron school
application okay you need to apply to
get into the school the coding camp then
most likely you're gonna if it's a hook
up with women who code they're gonna
have you fill out this Google Doc which
is first-name lastname Twitter or email
and then how those women who code
impacted your career and why is it
important to you I fill this out
multiple times it takes but five minutes
be honest don't be a jerk you know they
just want to know I don't know for their
promotional materials if you win
something you know stick your name in
there and your Twitter and how women the
code has impacted your career and why
it's important to you and you have the
option of using just your first thing
last initial or anonymous so they do
they seemingly respect your privacy
which is nice so that's that the third
thing and then we're just gonna move on
to some other wear my hair some other
opportunities that
related to a new code but this also
applies to you know other thing other
other scholarships besides women who
code scholarships is that let me go to
some page it's appropriate um let's go
over here because flattering school I
believe is in New York City just New
York City let's just check this out
Flatiron school comm just to see so I
can illustrate my point I look at this
announcing our woman take tech
scholarship and partnership with
Birchbox that there these opportunities
ladies are flowing out of the ears of
these code camps it's incredible so
where the heck are these guys please ok
they're based in Manhattan this is bad
news let me tell you why because even
though you're a female and every door is
open for you for accelerating your
career in coding for 12 to 16 weeks
you're gonna have to find housing and
food and transportation to get yourself
to Broadway second floor in New York
City do you know how expensive it is to
live in New York City do you feel like
commuting to hours to save a few hundred
dollars in rent each month or whatever
your living arrangement is for New
Jersey that is a big thing they do not
none of these code camps that are based
in San Francisco or in New York City the
two most expensive cities in the United
States will talk about because although
their scholarship scholarships are
generous the housing situation is going
to kick your ass and I don't know about
you but I'm not a fan of reaching out to
five people I don't know to share a slum
slum housing situation or whatever maybe
it's not a slum housing situation but
the point being living with five
strangers for three or four months I'm
kind of over it maybe you're different
hey that's a personal decision but just
keep in mind you're gonna make having to
think about where you're gonna stay for
those three months four months sometimes
up to six months in the most expensive
city in the
States trust me it's freaking expensive
you're gonna need probably 15 grand
I'm not kidding ask somebody who's lived
in New York City or San Francisco how
much they they pay for rent or even you
know sharing a room so again keep it in
mind and account for that the silver
lining is that a lot of these cabs do
web remote immersive
meaning you can do it in the comfort of
your own home those are the ones I've
been applying for recently because when
I first started out I was like alright
awesome San Francisco New York City I'm
hip I'm cool I'm in the know and then
you do researching like oh wait you mean
you don't have a personal mansion for me
to live and by myself with my cat for
four months oh I think I better
recompute so the ones I'm applying for
are all remote aversives and you're at
home on your computer 12 hours a day
doing the same thing just not paying
rent in the most expensive expensive
city in the world moving on so that was
all of these were related to women who
code again it just blows the competition
out of the water if there is even any
competition sign up for the code review
get your BA I want me to code calm the
other thing you can do is simply Google
Scholar hush sips so for women in coding
you don't even have to spell it right a
lot of things pop up five hundred
eighty-eight thousand results it's it's
incredible and then they extend to STEM
scholarships maybe you don't want to do
coding maybe you like cybersecurity or
something which is something well that's
another topic for a different day coding
boot camp scholarships for women over
think full coat up calm is something
that I pull that one up know let's pull
this up actually code up calm more free
money code up is dedicated to narrowing
the gender gap in tech for each
immersive program we offer two
scholarships exclusively to women it's
time to level the playing field let me
guess you guys are in San Francisco and
I can't afford to live there for three
months oh I was wrong
San San Antonio okay rewind snarky
comment and restart
Ciccone ups in San Antonio but you want
to know what I was in the Air Force and
I don't have very good memories of San
Antonio I don't like San Antonio sorry
San Antonio it's just not my city basic
training boot camp is in San Antonio for
the Air Force for those wondering learn
more okay they offer within two
scholarships per full stack program at
 okay I read that wrong we offer two
women scholarships per full stack
program at five thousand dollars off the
full program tuition but I'm looking for
something full dude I don't want this
half disc I want a full ride because you
know what the competition is so fierce
people are so desperate for vaginas
they are gonna give you my fellow ladies
my fellow ladies with late events free
full ride tuition some of these might be
that you just have to identify as a
woman I'm interested has anyone I would
love to see someone who's watching this
video
socially engineered their way into a
free scholarship and not identified and
have boy parts and not identify well you
know what I mean like just be a bear and
identify as a chick and see if you get
in these schools this would be really
cool social experiment okay I'm losing
focus and I'm starting to troll bio
himself let's move on so the other thing
I want to point out here's the iron yard
I was reading the iron yards blog
they're actually let's visit the main
site here I came across because I was
interested in doing java not javascript
a java back and training before I saw
the employment status of JavaScript
because employers are desperately
desperate for JavaScript and job our
head is better than Java and JavaScript
just seems a little more exciting so
it's a 12-week scope cold school so
three months give or take
free crash courses corporate training
blah blah blah so if you I was just like
I said I was let's just go see where
they're located and
they're all over the US they're all west
out east themselves couple in Florida so
I was reading this blog and it says the
iron yard offers free tuition for women
and minorities in Minnesota and maybe
it's just my greedy brain but when I
said when I see free tuition without you
know the qualifier of partial offers
partial free tuition for women or
minorities blah blah blah so they're
launching a 40 million tech opportunity
fund for some free tuition and then so
they said this tech Opportunity Fund so
I was like hell yeah Tech Opportunity
Fund let's see what it's all about
students with financial need are
encouraged to apply to receive a full
tuition to attend a full time immersive
quote okay so it is full tuition but the
problem with the iron yard was that I
applied I got all the way to the Google
hangout / FaceTime / video conferencing
platform of choice interview they went
great you know I talked with the Java
lead Java instructor and the admissions
rep for about 45 minutes
it was a nice conversation they seemed
to dig what I was saying act who really
knows but yeah I went good and then I
didn't hear from them for like a week
and I followed up and you know because
we have so much because guys and girls
females have so much selection in these
coding camps
if someone doesn't get back to me within
a week I'm already just like you know
what I'm moving on there's just so much
competition people that are doing it
better but I said you know what I like
these guys we had a good chat I'm gonna
hit him up and so I hit up the
admissions rep and she was like I'm
sorry to say but we are ending our Java
program in this location in effect we're
ending the whole school in this location
I was like okay dokie wasn't something I
said but she was saying that they're
gonna be doing corporate training at
that location but she did apologize and
she said if there is a location that I
liked that they would offer me tuition
half off which was pretty sweet but
again it's the the cost of living well
they obviously have more places they
don't even have a campus in New York or
San Francisco but you know
get up and moving to a state for three
months in the age of the Internet in the
age of FaceTime a hangouts and well
formerly Skype I don't know anybody
who's a Skype these days some people
like still I'm not judging I'm just
saying there's no there is a reason to
do it at a physical location but it's
just not something I'm interested in so
let's review women who code get your
butt on it and sign up googling
scholarships for women always a good
idea or insert minority group here what
about what about this
hey check that out okay yeah the Milo
scholarship right the white man's guide
to getting a minority scholarship uh
social engineering and social
experimentation is so fun these these
constructs people these constructs no
money unless you have vagina the iron
yard okay yeah okay so tech opportunity
fund I think I pretty much covered it
people thanks for watching this video
and I hope it was helpful if anything
look googling is important and reading
the fine print and following up is
important
but women who code and getting hooked up
with these women is even more important
thanks for watching it we'll see in the
next video I might be doing a video a
similar video to this instead of women
military veterans what do you think guys
let me know in the comments below what
you thought like thumbs down I don't
know we'll see you in the next video
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
