programmers fashion line featuring the
flagship item clip-ons that don't fit
only available from realist Afghani my
senior developer had LASIK eye surgery
and he found those clip-ons and his desk
and he's like do you want these real
tough candy here on a drizzly sorta
graer day I'm not complaining how are
you guys doing I got a great story for
you guys so we're working with this
client who's having some database
problems right it's a cemetery so
there's a lot of records of dead people
it's kind of interesting right so
they're their database and the way they
get this information online because
they're trying to incorporate some
search functions for people to find
their relatives or loved ones in the
cemetery like they type in their name
they can find the plot number and so on
so we're checking out their codebase
checking out their website they have a
really old website and we're thinking of
ways to incorporate this database revamp
with maybe a new website right so my
senior developer and I were
brainstorming about possible platforms
for their website I said I think like
WordPress is a really good candidate for
these people because it would be good to
give them control over the blog over
uploading photos uploading news stories
stuff like that icing our developer
doesn't have any experience with
WordPress so I said let's give it a shot
if I started this high resolution
prototype of this WordPress site in
conjunction with prototyping a site
based on October CMS October CMS is PHP
based and it's a lot more abstract than
WordPress
good luck having clients being able to
figure out how it works because the
backend is all just basically an admin
section with code not really end user
friendly I'm showing him all this
functionality on WordPress and he's like
so how do you add a new like navbar item
or how do you add this or how do you add
that much one-click baby that's all it
takes and that's the
way web-development should be there are
a lot of people who think more code is
good code less code is good code now
WordPress is probably about the best
example of this because they have a lot
of files if you've ever uploaded a
WordPress site there's like 4,000 files
that go wherever you're uploading it
it's insane
my point is we don't need to spend
months and months prototyping developing
coding a CMS for people to use for any
users to use we have a CMS word breath
gets a lot of scoffs but it is such an
incredible tool and I think the best
part about WordPress is that it can be a
one-click thing like as I've mentioned
in different videos you don't have to
code anything you can get through life
as a wordpress developer just being
smart with research just knowing how to
search for plugins just having a good
eye for graphic design and layout
there's a plugin for darn near
everything however there is a cost to
that because the more plugins you have
the slower your site is so you have to
be careful and that's where that brain
power comes in because there are ways
around it you just have to take some
time to think about it so I was doing
more prototyping yesterday on the
WordPress site just for a few hours to
give the client a real-life idea of what
their site could potentially look like
and I'm excited the boss is writing a
proposed proposal right now and I feel
good because I'm adding value to this
company and I'm still in learning mode
you know I'm still in training mode so
by the time my first round of
prototyping was over we had already come
up with like 10 distinct and very
beneficial advantages of the WordPress
site compared to their current site and
it's just the perfect solution so I'm
very happy that is a personal when it
worked for me
and I started out in WordPress so like
designing this stuff and getting the
stuff implemented and copying over some
of the con some of the text and copy is
pretty smooth knock on wood watch me get
to work and everything exploded thanks
everybody for watching don't be afraid
of WordPress it's not infected it's a
great platform no matter what level you
are and how advanced you are or beginner
you are in web development I'm not going
anywhere I hope you're not I have an
announcement about my udemy course
coming up you guys have seen that ad on
my video on the end for like months now
I've just recently changed it oh yeah
there's a lot to talk about with that
thanks for watching we'll see you the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
