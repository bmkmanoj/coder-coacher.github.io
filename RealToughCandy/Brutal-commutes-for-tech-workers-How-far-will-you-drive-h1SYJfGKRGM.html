the cellar with you guys today
oh I've got to get this muffler fixed
this warburg gets old thanks for joining
me on this mobile editions res of Kenny
channel today's topic is the exact thing
I'm doing right now and that is
commuting going somewhere to get paid on
my wheels long-distance and hopefully
it's not something I'll be doing more of
in the future but I haven't discounted
because of fuel like in these major tech
cities people do a lot of commuting and
with that comes a mental toll an
emotional toll and also a monetary toll
but my attitude towards commuting have
really changed in the past I would say
even couple months as I realize cost
versus the benefits for one there's
where you can start with this let me let
me start with when I started community
how 16 years old I got on a scholarship
from high school to go to college Deakin
junior senior year so instead of high
school instead of my junior and senior
year in high school I got to go to
college and got my associates when I was
18 and the condition was you just got to
get your butt to school in my school
that college was an hour 15 minutes away
so I was drive there drive back the same
way they are the same way back and being
younger being 16 yeah it was boring but
there wasn't like all my back so sore
you got older your back it's a little
store your shoulders might hurt a little
bit I found that a ob noodle really
helps with that just decide not yoga
noodles are in the bomb and you can't
read but that's how I deal with the
physical aspect of commuting and driving
long distance trips nowadays as far as
emotional comment' emotional road rage
is definitely an emotional game you know
and when you're stuck in traffic like it
start
for three hours guys I used to live in
Houston Texas we'll be sitting in
traffic with a hundred degree heat
surrounded you that blacktop oh my gosh
I almost passed out one day getting in
traffic I was 17 like shaking white hit
me man yeah and I have some interesting
taste back into dating but I almost
passed out and I was seeing a patch mile
patch for about two and a half hours
back on common occurrence people to live
texting or any other very large city
where public transportation is not on
the priority list or Big Ideas priority
list and there's just a lot of people so
that leaves people with pretty much the
option of community whether it's 45
minutes an hour and a half or three
hours I don't know what's the limit of
community I don't I don't know I don't
know how people's living are I don't
people who do it for two hours there
work 8 to 10 hour and then two hours
back oh my gosh superior but if it's
good money and even when you factor that
in and you're going home to a place that
cost less has less crime has more
opportunities for your family has more
amenities it might just be worth it I
hate saying that because it's Sully
appreciate being stuck in gridlock for
two hours
there's got to be a better way guys I
know there's a better way I'll be a
short while ago I would have said
absolutely not I'm not commuting half
hour 45 minutes our items here guinea
fishes I'm not really getting paid $4 an
hour I'm getting paid like 24 but in the
end if I'm paying half of what I would
in a major city is then I'm just saving
money and also too it's not complete
drudgery driving yeah stuck in traffic
people go cycle people call road rage
flick their stuff but there are other
things you can do it at vehicle you can
talk the person
with you can make videos as long as
you're focused on the road
you listen to audio both listen to music
think about your hopes and dreams like
you can meditate there's been seven
times I've commuted or gone on long road
trips and just like wow I'm bored you
can just kind of focus on the road be in
the molders I just collect yourself I
know it sounds kind of new agey but
that's really healthy just pull me down
especially like going to a job interview
we're going to a stressful job
environment a half hour that 45 minutes
like okay got my coffee I got my con
mucha I'm going to chill out I'm gonna
mow down on the dollar I may be too old
to leave and then I'm going to go into
word to rocket I don't know if you guys
heard about that chief fat cat 580 weeks
ago he's in San Francisco and he says he
makes six figures the tech industry he
hardly knows basic living
but monthly I mean the economics of
energetic blow my mind and if you can
cut your cost of living AB by computing
an hour and a half is that work that you
and a lot of people have made that
personal choice to drive an hour in math
and you're basically good money and you
can buy something just an hour and a
half that two hours oh god forbid what
if you can find something to do for
those two hours
scheming creative it might just be worth
it so I say that as I continue to drive
I made a few Tube video and I'm
commuting so there is something to save
for it
you can't redeem yourself on the commute
guys thanks for watching I hope this
video is helpful got you thinking about
whether you want to commute your next
job or not and I hear from some of you
guys and use bigger cities working in
San Francisco Bay Area or New York what
are your guys is commutes like Austin
gosh what's up cities north north
carolina's it's really heating up check
right now in to Raleigh Seattle is a lot
of other tech cities around there coming
up into the into the forefront here my
goal is to telecommute home office get
get a gear done you know just all right
