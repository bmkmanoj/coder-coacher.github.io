you today on the real self and each
other
the bad news is your websites are
probably running slow the good news is
that can be changed and one of the best
tools for learning where you need to
change your websites in order for it to
run faster is Pingdom now this is a
website called tools kingdom comm and
it's very straightforward you simply
type in the URL you want to test select
your testing location and in a few
seconds it will process your website and
let you know areas that might detention
area is you're doing great with areas
that are just met let's go ahead and
test real tough candy calm and see what
we're working with it was a 1.78 second
load time page size 693 kilobytes not
too bad I've seen really whoppers of
websites this isn't so bad
I'm getting a C though it's faster than
74% of tested sites these are the items
I've failed these are the items doing
okay on and then these are the items I
have aced but as you can see a very
quick visual way to see what your site
needs work on now let's try something
like google.com just for comparison
actually hold on let's go through the
rest of these so content size by content
type most of the stuff that's slowing my
page down is based on scripts not
pictures so those are only about one
fifth of what's taken up the time when
people go to my site file requests this
is also very useful so you can get a
visual representation of what's taken so
long as you can see a lot of this stuff
is from Google which is why those news
sites that are just like filled with ads
take so freaking long to load and often
crash browsers because they're just so
massive so let's go ahead and try Google
just for kicks just to see how they
reach google.com has a bigger page size
in the real tough kanakamma home page
that's really funny you think oh it's
not much going on here but there
actually seems to be quite a bit it gets
a solid b83 load time eight hands is two
milliseconds faster than 91% of tested
sites
and they have some fails to combine
external javascript minimize redirects
minimize DNS lookups they get a lot of
a's though let's see what else
71% of their time is due to scripts and
14% due to other maybe the google doodle
you can really use this site to your
advantage and i recommend using this
simple tool for all of your web sites in
your portfolio for clients and focusing
on these areas that really need your
attention because milliseconds matter in
websites as far as your users sticking
around just getting to your website and
getting google to notice that you have
speedy pages so use this tool to your
advantage you can test it from different
locations as well to see if there is
maybe some discrepancies with that
obviously if you're testing from some
place around the world rather than a
place that's ten miles away from you
it's gonna be a little slower but just
look at the discrepancies and see if
anything really stands out and focus on
those you're gonna get a faster webpage
you're gonna get more traffic and more
quality visitors to your website thanks
