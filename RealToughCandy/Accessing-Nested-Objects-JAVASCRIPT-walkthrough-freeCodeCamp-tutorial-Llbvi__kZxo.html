your area today we're working on free
code hams basic JavaScript accessing
nested objects this one was really fun
for me I'm actually back doing it
succeeding the question once again like
I've passed it four times without having
to get external help so that's awesome
just doing a little caffeine buzz today
doing this walkthrough oh mmm you are
too something to be said for coffee and
code I'm telling you accessing nested
objects let's see what we're working
with today the sub properties of objects
can be accessed by chaining together the
dot or bracket notation here is a nested
object and then they give you the pseudo
code for the nested object and they get
right to the instructions access the my
storage object and assign the contents
of the glovebox property to the glove
box contents variable use bracket
notation for properties with a space in
their name okay so pretty compact
directions here they want us to do a few
things they want us to access and assign
and use bracket notation so three things
at least we're gonna be doing okay so
here's what I did to kind of mentally
map what I had to do they want us to
assign the contents of the glove box
property up here okay so we're just
gonna like follow this until we see the
glove box and since it's human readable
we'll relatively glove box what do we
find inside a glove box maps so
basically we want this to give us maps
down here we want glove box contents to
spit out MEMS okay and using dots and a
bracket we can do this so it's pretty
straightforward I'm gonna type out I'm
gonna get rid of these quotations here
and we're gonna start at the very basic
and then work our way inside the glove
box so kind of the way I visualized it
was just like
Tillie golly I'm so bad at explaining
these things but just I just envision
going inside a glove box and then each
level well you'll see it when I type it
out a little less talking a little more
coding so we're gonna start out with my
storage because that's what we want to
access that's what our instructions are
access to my storage object and now
we're gonna start assigning so first we
have to assign the car because you got
to tell this thing where where are we
we're at the car right we're at the car
but even more specifically we're inside
the car so we're gonna add another dot
and tell the computer we're inside the
car now that's what I'm trying to tell
you guys is how I visualize telling the
computer where we are physically in the
car or outside of the car but we're
actually inside the car right now as we
see by our little dot
so my storage we're going to the car
we're going inside the car and now where
we're going we're going to the glovebox
so normally because I'm not very
advanced using JavaScript I would have
just done a dot and done like probably
something like this but as they
explicitly tell us in the instructions
use bracket notation for properties with
a space in their name so instead of this
dots these set of this dot we're gonna
be using brackets and then put it in a
string glove box
in the bracket and now because all of
this all roads that lead to maps this
should now spit out maps let's see what
happens so to test this you see the
glove box contents equals maps right
here so that's a pass we've fulfilled
both of these requirements let's put in
is there anything else in here let's put
a passenger seat so inside a passenger
seat and again we're still gonna use
bracket notation because these are it's
a how do they say it property it's a
property as a space in its name so it's
gonna be the passenger's seat and so
right here we should see passenger seat
is going to be equal to comes I know it
sounds like my car
glove box contents oops so why is the
glove box contents now I wonder I wonder
okay does anyone know why that's
happening why does that not return
passenger seat right here oh no I still
don't know okay so that's maybe a
challenge for someone else who's a
little more advanced I don't know why
this isn't printing passenger seat
crumbs what if we did let's try this one
let's try outside trunk and let's try it
too let's try to get it to print Jack
down here so outside maybe we can do so
it's just one word we can try dot
notation again trunk so hopefully this
will print Jack yep it did but it's
still printed glove box contents instead
of trunk Oh duh because this is the
variable so we could name it pretty much
anything I'm getting it this is actually
why I do these tutorials I can actually
understand what I'm doing just kidding
kind of
so we'll write variable um I don't know
trunk contents what okay now I know I'm
doing something wrong well guys I made
it so we could pass the challenge here
let me do a few undo so we can actually
pass this challenge there you go
I never promised magic but I could get
you through this challenge alright guys
thanks for watching we'll see the next
video looking forward to your comments
and thanks for my new subscribers get
more every day so thank you for that see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
