actually do again I couldn't be happier
to announce that my first guest for this
new series I'm doing is Chris from code
Chris comm he's an everyday guy I really
like his style
it's no-nonsense and he seems like a
really hard-working guy and I asked
Chris dude what do you actually do at
your job because there are thousands of
training materials telling you to learn
this learn that heck I'm one of those
channels you know you really should be a
learning react you know but what does he
actually do all day at his job is he
checking emails is he listening to
bosses tell him what to do is he
self-directed now this isn't going to be
the same situation for all deaf jobs but
it's going to give you a better idea of
what working developers do so join Chris
