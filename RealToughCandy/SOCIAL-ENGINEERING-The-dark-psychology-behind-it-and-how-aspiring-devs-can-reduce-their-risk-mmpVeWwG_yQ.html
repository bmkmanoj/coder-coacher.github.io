there is this big billboard that read
off in real time the traffic fatalities
in that state for the year and I drove
past it I said oh my gosh I could be
part of that number if this car decides
to veer off the road somehow or I lose
focus or someone hits me you know the
possibilities we're starting to become
endless house fantasizing about this
awful way of dying on the road but I
kept driving and I made it to my
destination and since then I have driven
thousands of times why because that
driving event think of it as a pie not
that kind of pie not bad kind of pie to
give it as the pie and there's a little
section in that pie a vulnerability now
every time you get in the car there's a
risk there's a vulnerability but then
you put on your seatbelt risk is lowered
and they decide not to drive drunk
risk is lowered you drive a car that has
high safety ratings risk is lowered and
the risk continues to lower but there's
always going to be that small segment
that very perhaps miniscule chance of
something going wrong
would you rather drive with this much
vulnerability this much vulnerability
would you rather go on the internet with
this much vulnerability or this much
ulnar ability now why did I keep driving
because I made choices to decrease my
risk and as my risk was going down my
trust in the system that entire event my
trust in that event my trust in my
vehicle and myself and other drivers to
give me to that destination went up and
I made a personal choice to do that
those three things are the essence of
social engineering trust risk and
personal choice social engineering and
how to reduce your risk today on the
real tough candy Channel
there's so much to talk about with this
topic and it's truly fascinating because
it's a study of the dark side of
humanity social engineering at the end
of the day and in its simplest form is
simply a person manipulating somebody
social engineers build your trust so
that you have the perception that you're
engaging in a low-risk activity and
you're making a personal choice to
engage with this person and as you're
engaging you're building trust and as
that Trust goes up the risk the
perception of that risk goes down what
reasons have I given you as a viewer to
trust me now I can think of a few but if
you're just tuning in you don't have any
reason to trust me and there are ways to
build that trust as a social engineer
you can talk clearly and concisely you
can talk thora tative lee you can build
your presence as someone who is an
authoritative figure without being
overbearing you can be a good listener
there is a whole toolkit of social
engineering techniques that can be used
against you in illegal ways so as to get
information that can further be used
against you it's not a pleasant feeling
we already have things to worry about
when we log on I want to go back to that
piyah graphic not that one when you get
on the internet it's the same thing you
are at default high risk for
exploitation but then you decide to use
passwords in your little window of
vulnerability here closes a little bit
you maybe use a VPN Boop
you decide to stop using windows sorry
windows sorry windows people when you
guys get the idea now this a window of
vulnerability here this little chunk
this is an attack vector this is the
space that social engineers use to
manipulate you and to get into your life
why would you get on the internet when
your window is like this you're just one
big low-hanging fruit but no you use
passwords you hopefully don't click on
links from people you don't know in an
email boop boop boop but still no one's
airtight no one's completely safe so
some of my subscriber
have been asking what are some exact
examples of being socially engineered
and how can we identify that okay going
back to the trust risk and personal
choice all of these three things I
discuss in a particular website for a
junior development job board this place
is a freaking nightmare but I do
understand that people can't live in a
cave and they need to get their names
out there I understand that but it's
still risky as long as you understand
that that's the biggest thing because
every time you make these decisions
you're making a personal choice I can't
tell you exactly that information to put
out there that's your own choice how
risky are you feeling but I will tell
you something you are opening up your
vector of vulnerability when you put
your name date of birth physical address
actual email and actual phone number on
a resume that's open to the world there
are people out there who don't care
about you and I'll say it over and over
again they don't care about you at all
it's bad enough getting spammed it's bad
enough getting your information stolen
but when someone sends you an email or
phone calls you and builds your trust
and then they steal your information
it's not a good feeling the good news is
if you're using a site like LinkedIn or
some other resume site where anybody can
sign up and look at your personal info
there's a low likelihood of you being
socially engineered there is a pretty
good likelihood of you getting spammed
and your information abused in some way
but as far as social engineering goes oh
there's a low chance of that so relax
that said it's still a possibility so
let me illustrate an example I thought
of the other day in this junior
development job board I said it my other
video but it's worth repeating
now these junior developers have their
resume and all their personal
information just group in a repository
for the world to see what is preventing
me is a clear concise communicator as
someone who acts like they know what
they're talking about if someone is who
appears as a high trust individual guys
you're watching this video this far you
trust me you trust me to a certain point
do you see what I mean what I'm saying
if I emailed them and posed as a
recruiter or call them even calling us
better because my voice is soothing and
people trust my voice it's a built-in
feature it's a feature not a bug and I
said I was from a recruiting agency or
tech agency and we're building rapport I
asked about your dog and cat and you
know I tell you about my life I have a
cat I have a great family and so to get
the process started I would need to
confirm your first ammas name today on
you know and for Security's sake I'd
need you to repeat your social security
number I know I know it's so it's such a
pain but it's for it's it's a policy we
do have and it is encrypted so no big
deal there also if you're interested we
do have a direct deposit system going on
so we can get that set up today you know
no pressure but it does make the hiring
process and getting you set up a little
bit easier you guys okay you're seeing
how this can can snowball into something
very disastrous if I heard that on the
phone be like okay sure
you know because you want a job and when
someone builds your trust you're feeling
like the risk of that conversation is
going down and you're making a personal
decision to continue to engage in this
how do you detect if someone's a social
engineer the good ones are really hard
if not impossible to detect that's the
answer because they're really talented
sociopaths who will stop at nothing to
get your information and then we're
going down in the tier ok a large
percentage of the social engineering
attacks are based on fishing so you know
that Google Docs thing that happened I
don't know like two or three weeks ago
people are getting emails from they're
supposed to contact list people you
trust but their identities have been
stolen and a malicious link to a Google
Docs a fake Google Docs document had
been embedded in the email and people
were clicking on it and chaos and
confusion and pure frustration and
disaster ensued the good news is that a
lot of these social engineers really
don't know what they're doing so we'll
start with those if you get an email
from somebody you don't recognize with
with the link do not click it do not
click it do not click it the scandals
and politics are just one
a cloud right now but there was during
the election there was some scandal with
a social engineering scheme where
somebody in Washington DC click the link
and that's how all these leaks happened
or something don't quote me this isn't
real news it's fake news this is a fake
real cough candy fake News Channel
but that happened from a social
engineering technique of fishing fishing
with the pH like the jam band they send
a link you click it you get screwed over
that is perhaps the number one thing you
can do to keep yourself safe from social
engineering is that when you see an
email with that link and you don't
recognize it when you see email from a
friend and a Google Doc you look I
wasn't expecting be a little more
skeptical you don't have to be skeptical
of your friend be skeptical of the
process because somewhere along the line
some vulnerability was exposed many
people have told me over the years that
they have nothing to hide and if
somebody really wanted to find out
everything about you on the Internet
they would not debating that I take a
risk every time I publish a youtube
video but you know what I make a
personal choice I understand the risk do
I trust Google not particularly but
relatively yes relatively and I make a
personal choice to upload these videos
guys you think I'm doing these videos
just for fun I'm putting this in my soft
skills section of my tech portfolio I'm
taking a risk I don't use LinkedIn I
understand some people do and they use
their first name they use their last
name they use their phone number but
anybody can sign up for LinkedIn and
copy and paste that and use that not
only for social engineering but for
spamming purposes and databases and
whatnot another thing I will add about
social engineering is that if you're
talking with someone you're emailing
someone would say a tech recruiter and
it doesn't sound right or this person
has really bad English skills as far as
capitalization punctuation spelling and
so forth I swear to god guys half of
these Nigerians would be millionaires if
they would just learn to capitalize the
end of Nairobi like their English really
sucks so that's a dead giveaway okay
lowering the trust you know word by word
and not really making a good case for
themselves as far as specific techniques
to reduce your vulnerability for social
engineering attack in the tech world
when you're trying to find a job I use a
dedicated email and a dead
kated google voice phone number if you
haven't checked out Google Voice again
do I trust Google in particular yeah but
relatively yes I do
check out the Google Voice system you
can have call forwarding and you can
have a dedicated number that goes to
your real phone so that you know if
something does happen or something
suspicious happens you can pinpoint who
is trying to contact you why you're
getting these weird emails perhaps and
you know it's compartmentalized it
doesn't leak over into the other parts
of your life like I said the best social
engineers they're few and far between
you probably won't ever have to interact
with one unless there's one in your
family we just call them like really
manipulative people we don't talk to
them in our family
so if you have one of those people in
your family you already know what a
social engineer is and how capable they
are of getting things that they want
they're dangerous people and sometimes
you can recognize them the really good
ones you can't
fortunately like I said the bulk of
social engineers they're not good at
capitalizing and punctuation and all
that stuff their English usually is
pretty bad if you're talking to them on
the phone not trying a stereotype but
that's just the way it is with social
engineering that said I could call you
up and talk in a perfectly good American
English accent and do the same thing
number three consider getting a
dedicated email and a dedicated Google
Voice and tweaking your resume I don't
put references on my resume they're
available on request I don't trust
people with that information it's not
there to my references as far as former
supervisors I also say available upon
request guys its 2017 the concept of a
resume is more and more cake as a days
go by if you really want to know about
me
check out my upcoming portfolio it says
95 percent of what you need to know
about me in order to employ me the other
stuff should be strictly for tax
purposes you don't need to know my real
name you can just call me real tough
candy again guys it comes down to trust
risk and personal choice as long as
you're aware that people want to take
advantage of you in certain situations
your you cannot just turn you should
have just turned off the video one
minute or two minutes in because that's
what it comes down to your personal
choice after you understand there's a
risk in every online activity there is a
high risk factor when you put your first
name last name address
number and grab personal email it's a
high risk can you still do it of course
you can you can make the personal choice
but you want to close that attack vector
close that window of vulnerability you
can take small steps to avoid social
engineering guys I hope this video was
helpful for me personally I am probably
going to ditch the resume altogether not
just because of social engineering and
just general information abuse there
archaic and there's more creative ways
to do it
that's just me I understand billions of
people do use resumes and that's totally
fine just understand there is a risk
there is a possibility of someone
emailing you saying they're from XYZ
company Google that company research
that company if that company looks
illegitimate it is always do your
research that was the other one that's
the bonus that's that's the bonus tip
you're getting emails and calls from
these tech companies and they say I'm
from exercise a startup Google that
mothertrucker if they're not in Google
or you're redirected like 25 times to a
website and Azerbaijan it's not
legitimate there's a small chance than
it is but it trust me it's not it's not
wait trust me trust me do you trust me
YouTube do you trust me do you trust me
give me your social security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
