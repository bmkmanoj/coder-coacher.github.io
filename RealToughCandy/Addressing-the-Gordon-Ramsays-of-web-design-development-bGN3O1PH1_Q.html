looks just had of drafts tongue cut out
and deep fat frying people really like
them half the customs are drunk real
self candy for real tough Kenny calm
back in the critical seat with you today
how is it going guys today we're gonna
be talking about criticism and
constructive criticism in web
development kind of bumping on real
tough candy calm this week I recently
published a blog post about my react
experience working on my first react
website and also where I found 50 cent
chocolate I mean it's the little things
in life react 50 cent chocolate I don't
know
but check that out if you're interested
react is kind of what I'm working on
these days in addition to a bunch of
miscellaneous stuff so take a look at
this guy this is chef Gordon Ramsay some
of you may know him or have heard of
them he's very curmudgeon me he hates
everybody and everything's garbage a
very polarizing figure and he gets paid
to just be brutal now we may have met a
person like Chef Ramsay in the tech
world even if you're just beginning some
people can be very critical of your code
and of what you're creating and so I
wanted to talk about when that might be
okay because I actually do think there
are situations where it's okay to Chef
Ramsay out and really just just just
smash into someone's creation but almost
exclusively in a learning environment
this kind of behavior is not over so a
couple days ago I did a video taking a
look at some of the design decisions
behind newspaper websites and I don't
know where in the time stamp it is
there's I checked out the New York Times
and their site is not responsive in
other words when you squeeze the browser
in different places the content does not
shrink or expand to fit the width or
height of that browser it's a big
problem because it's a huge
accessibility issue
and I did kind of Gordon rhymes I did I
mean I did offer some constructive
insight to some of these newspaper sites
but I did a little bit of Gordon Ramsay
in other words saying this is absolute
trash what the hell were you developers
thinking and to go into pure critique
mode without offering a solution I think
is appropriate in tech when that
developer knows better if that developer
is cutting corners or it just doesn't
care or is being veg revengeful
absolutely dude what the hell were you
thinking there are exceptions if you're
having if that person maybe is having a
bad time at home or some personal
problems but if they're just being lazy
or vengeful or some other selfish
behavior by all means I think the Gordon
Ramsay treatment is warranted and should
be actually maybe practiced a little
more to curb some of this behavior
because at a certain point in your
career you do know better and cutting
corners to be lazy doesn't warrant
constructive criticism constructive
criticism is a very powerful tool for
people who are trying to improve
themselves and especially for beginning
coders the time is when I think it's
absolutely not okay to be a Gordon
Ramsay type in tech is with beginning
learners and journey developers who are
still trying to improve their skills
constructive criticism is when you point
out the good with the bad and you offer
a solution or suggestions for improving
your product or service or whatever
you're trying to do in this case of your
code let me give an example of criticism
versus constructive criticism in a web
development environment say you're
coding a website from scratch and you
have a CSS page with you decided to use
a color palette of like pastels and
somehow there is like a cherry red
button
your page and that just doesn't fit the
color palette so a criticism less and
then then you asked your boss or fellow
dev or you know someone online that you
know for their feedback to to take a
look at it
so criticism so the senior developer is
looking over it whatever and they say I
don't like this red this right has got
to go what are you thinking that's
criticism now the degree of brutality
will vary but criticism mostly is just
throwing something out there and saying
I don't like it so constructive
criticism example would be if someone
else like this another senior developer
looked over and said here's what I like
about this pastel color palette is that
it matches your content let's say it's a
blog for a 1950s Miami or so you guys
know the the pastel Miami color palette
from back in the day it matches that
content that's themed and it really
reinforces it and draws the viewer or
the user in to the blog and you could go
on to address the red the the garish red
color you could say something like
however this red color really doesn't
add to the color palette so what I might
suggest to make it a more immersive
experience is to remove that red and
maybe try a seafoam green or a nice
turquoise or coral pink might work real
nice there but you know experiment with
it and give me give it a shot and let me
know what you think I think and you know
it's a lot more your the point of
constructive criticism is to improve
that person's product and it's less
selfish and more selfless because with
pure criticism you're being selfish
you're just being a dick excuse my
language but you're just being a
dickhead again it's some circumstances I
think that might be warranted when
developers are being lazy and know
better but with beginners though that
kind of selfish behavior that that
criticism is not helping that developer
and but it might even just turn them off
altogether to code the other great thing
about constructive criticism is that it
builds trust and it builds respect when
you're communicating I can't tell you
how many times someone's criticized me
as a beginning learner
well it's happened it has to happen
boatloads of time but
happened enough and my respect for that
person went down and it was just a
negative experience a negative
connotation from there on out there have
been times where I have been lazy and
deserve to be yelled at or criticized
and I took responsibility for that but
I'm much more likely to have a higher
opinion of somebody and respect somebody
if they can tell me where I may be
stumbling or need improvement and it can
offer some alternatives or suggestions
on how to do things better personally I
love constructive criticism and even you
know if you're a senior dev there are
probably a lot of things still you don't
know how to do and I think anyone
whether you're just starting out or
advanced can really benefit from
constructive criticism and it's nothing
to be scared of I know it can be really
intimidating at first because it might
feel like that person is just destroying
your work but you'll find as you keep
growing in your craft that that's really
not the intention it's intended to make
you a better person
in your career field whatever it is
you're trying to do I found this website
that helps people accept constructive
criticism and how to process it a little
better you know not taking it personal
and such I'll link this in the
description box it's a pretty short read
you know good bullet points and good
explanations on those bullet points here
but just helps you as a learner improve
your your reception I guess of
constructive criticism then don't ever
think that someone's who's criticizing
you where you don't think it's warranted
that you should stick around or oh maybe
I should just listen to them abuse my
work because they know a lot there are a
lot of people who know a lot of stuff in
this career field you've been doing it
for decades who really want to help
people they can be hard to find but
don't ever think that you have to stick
around with somebody who's being a jerk
because they're not worth your time all
right guys thanks for watching as always
come join me on my dinner chatroom if
you want to talk more about tech always
some cool stuff go in there it's been
bumping a lot of a lot of activities
going on on the chatroom and my website
so hope to see you there and we'll see
you next video see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
