the zone hey I want to take a break from
what I usually do which is coding videos
in beverage reviews this is just that
random video I had to throw in there
because this thing is freakin sweet I'm
still learning how to program it I got
to give you the disclosure that was not
my beat I discovered that beat just by
messing around and loading up some
patches and sequences the previous owner
I don't know who the dude is did now
this thing is the yamaha qy 700 some of
y'all might remember back in the 90s mid
90s late 90s even early 2000s people had
the qy 70s that was like the portable
version of this this is kind of like the
granddaddy you wouldn't know it by
looking at it because it has some
freaking road where it's awesome
look at those gold permanent marker
accents missing some buttons missing the
jogwheel but it's still functional
floppy drive on the side there I don't
have any floppy disks probably need to
invest in some of those pitch wheel here
let's see if we can do something fun
with those probably not but I wanted to
go through because some of these Pat I
don't know if these songs and patches
and whatnot are from the 90s 2000s who
really knows but just wanted to see what
was on here my got this on eBay for
about 80 bucks due to it all I think
it's awesome but the condition the
cosmetics pretty ugly but these patches
man it came from the west coast too so
there's some what maybe there's some
West Coast funk in here somewhere I
don't know I don't know anything about
the previous owner
see what else is on here do a few more
see what's on catch track fix nothing
seven eight nope let's go all the way up
we got four more nothing 11 13 14 - I
think that's it
and you secret tracks those upset 19
maybe nope nothin done this 12 let's go
back to 12
man the zoo is all over the place again
I don't know what year these slides were
made I got to find the manual to see if
you can can research when they were
created but hey it's a beater classic
for 70 bucks plus shipping you can't go
wrong Yamaha qy 700 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
