from real tough candy calm back in the
saddle with you today we did it over 350
subscribers not too bad for a 300
subscriber giveaway I just want to say
again and I know it might get repetitive
for you guys hearing it but I want you
to know that I do appreciate you guys
watching participating making comments
thumbs up the videos telling people
about the videos that you like and the
channel started off as the anti tech
channel I was doing a local television I
guess oriented news show on a little
community and then it kind of devolved
flashing evolve devolved into
miscellaneous videos and then silly
spoof for just ridiculous videos and
then finally into what you're seeing
today which is text videos this channel
will always be about tech videos from
here on out the focus will be tech now
it might not always be code and it might
not always be a you know learning
resources but it will it will always
come back to text somehow even the vlogs
where I share a little bit about my life
you know some of my side hustles those
also involve text and I always want to
keep that as the focus and there's so
many more ideas I have and cool topics I
think you guys might like anyways I'm
actually here for the confetti so what
do not the water not not the water patch
no no I need a little stuff that falls
from them without further ado let's get
to this contest I am heating up all by
up got the Hat got the entries and we're
going to be writing names down as we go
through them now the contest was a
little interactive thing too you know
gin up some participation voice
now the contest was a issued made ninth
and the challenge was to list the
resource that have helped you learn
something that you're passionate about
doesn't have to be code but it can be
code yeah so I wanted to go through real
quick and share some of these resources
because some of these I haven't heard of
and so we're really cool so we had a
late entry late last night the 11th hour
from Noah Robert Dean
he said roblox has helped him become a
good speller and that's why he's doing
what it's telling and that is awesome
dude I'm so glad to hear that
that is awesome to you that roblox is
actually you know keeping your minds
keeping the cause of your mind going so
Noah Robert Dean dysentry next we have
Onix Delta who said Stack Overflow is
the best for assistance I use it while
wearing tights on and Stack Overflow
that deserves its own video I have many
thoughts on Stack Overflow that's not
this videos about Onix Delta you get a
name in the old hat Josh Garcia says
team tree house they have great quality
videos just finished with HTML and CSS
and moving forward to JavaScript I have
actually heard a few people who have
went on to get coded careers or went on
to the coding jobs rather at various
Institute's because of team tree nuts
which is freaking awesome
so Josh Garcia thank you for that your
your name put in MIDI old hat next we
have Luke stay Whoville gay love the
handle my friend do not change
Kevin add us from Australia he says he
doesn't particularly mine winning the
book but issuing a resource on Python
learn Python the hard way board he found
it useful for learning how to write in
Python and how it works which he adds is
a fantastic thing to know it will help
you when learning a
good point so Luke say Google Gekas
entry Luke's a Google gave the miz' a
certain code Academy solo learn ad free
code camp
me to my friend now I'm learning from
you to me hey me too
got a few courses on sale keep it up you
got an interesting channel young lady
alright thank you
Nyssa I will agree
um code Academy FCC that's where I
started to and then I just kind of you
know wandered to other places that were
more worth my time but those places do
have their place as well and I know I've
helped many people jouvert all start off
pronouncing that wrong I have used free
code camp to get my feet wet but since
then I have used recommendations on
their forum to find other resources I
love this because that's exactly what I
did to chew all wrong intrigued and then
Matt love the icon code Academy to try
to learn JavaScript you know code
Academy is the one where I've been to a
few times and I've done like one or two
problems that I'm like that maybe I'll
come back to it so I don't have
experience with it interesting to hear
if if you've been dabbling in that code
Academy since the two weeks have gone by
since you entered this and what your
progress has been and if it's been
helpful or if you've moved on to some
other pastures Matt gets his entry and
now we go to Ella guichen duolingo is a
nice way to start learning a foreign
language what I'm almost sure you know
this resource actually did you know that
resource so thank you for sharing that
my server Croatian is a little rusty and
you don't duolingo comm I haven't I got
to be honest I haven't checked it out
yet but after this video it is on my
list just to see what languages they
offer and you know what the layout is
like so ela that's how I pronounce your
name you get entry Robert Navarro says
that he just got the Kindle version of
this book which is what I'm giving away
in the contest it's a smarter way to
learn JavaScript by
mark Myers guys I've said it in two or
three probably five videos that this
video is my this video that's maybe this
book has been my backbone for learning
JavaScript and it turns out that Robert
has a purchased it and he is I'm
teaching others web development which is
freaking cool
he also references Lynda Pluralsight
code school hollow self mature code
Academy toots plus Safari Books Online
Robert Roberto rather sorry concerned
consumes content like some consume
coffee birds and feather stick together
okay so Roberto you get an entry and
then finally we have Isaac who says this
site is super weird but it's been really
helpful for learning concepts rather
than syntax this site is so awesome play
code monkey calm he also says it's an
one orthodox an unorthodox way to learn
programming concepts because he's a
graphic designer and it's really fun I
will play the game but um I've spent
more than a hot minute planning this and
it's really cool what am i doing Oh am i
challenged for that's right yeah yeah
and they give you like the jungle and
the cute little oh there goes the fish
and it's fun it's so like you like
Robert not Robert sorry um
Isaac was saying it's so unorthodox not
something you'd expect to learn a
programming language where the concepts
and yeah it's for kids but not
necessarily I like that stuff too I just
picked up a coating board game haven't
played it yet
