episode of basic JavaScript over a free
code camp using objects for lookups is
what we're gonna be working on today not
gonna lie I had to Google food this
solution because I really got lost
around this portion of coding and also
too I got a little too confident because
like six of the eight are already giving
me a pass so I'm like how are gonna be
well honestly I don't really think they
do a really good job of explaining what
you have to do for this challenge so
let's go through how far I got what I
did wrong did wrong and then hopefully
you can avoid the problems I did so they
explained how objects can be used and
thought of like a key value storage sort
of like a dictionary you can use an
object to look up values rather than a
switch or an if-else chain they say this
is the most useful when you know that
your input data is limited to a certain
range and as we see our range is this so
they want us to give us they want us to
give the object object look up a whirl
they give us the pseudo code here so
let's go right to the instructions
convert the switch statement into a
lookup table called lookup use it to
look up Val and assign the Associated
string to the result variable okay so
oops start right here so they say only
change the code below this line only
change the code above this line so this
is the only portion that we're even
gonna concern ourselves with and for
reference just put that down there and
so honestly this pseudocode did help a
little but down here is where I started
screwing up so we'll just take it a line
at a time the first thing we need to do
is define the table so they want us to
call it lookup so we're gonna do
and of course equal sign and then we're
gonna open it up with our curly braces
brackets and now notice the convention
here is 1 : z 2 : Y etc well these are
numbers so that's why they're not in
parentheses however as we see in the
cases down here these are strings so
that doesn't really correspond to a
number right so we're gonna have to use
when referring to the pseudocode we have
to use these so we're just gonna start
it off like this alpha I'll show you
this first line and then it's to show
you what I'm doing um so this is just
basically the same convention as this
first line right here this one : z only
now it's alpha : Adams so far so good
let's go to the next one we're just
gonna go down our cases here we're gonna
go next to Bravo we're gonna put that in
quotes since that's also stream and
Bravo corresponds to Boston next keep
going oops
notice that this to me Charlie Chicago
Delta Delta is her comma and again just
going down just referencing the
pseudocode if you get lost here you can
just refer to your previous one but in
case you have continuous brain farts
like I do just go over here and make
sure it's matching with the convention
so then Delta we got two more to go
listen you know what let's get rid of
this I don't need to see this and we're
not putting breaks or any of the switch
stuff in this look up easy easy
and then the last one is fox trot which
is Frank and then down here notice for
the last one they didn't put a comma so
I'm pretty sure that's gonna play a part
in it so that would be that which one is
this is this part of this I think it is
so we'll do like that alright sweet and
so we've kind of finished that up that
looks good right so this is now what we
have to focus on there's one final part
we have to do get rid of this tighten it
up we're not getting any errors let's
see what just for kicks let's see what
happens if we give it a run okay that's
not good they did pass me because I did
not use case switcher if so we're kind
of on the right track but what are we
missing
well we need to do something with
results we need to define results
result is gonna be equal to the look up
okay and then in brackets we're gonna
put now alright and do not forget your
semicolon let's give it a whirl and see
what happens we only have one out of one
two three four or five six seven eight
one out of eight not so bad that worse
you've got the touch and as you see it's
matched charlie with Chicago and as you
see up here that's a match so let's put
something else through here and see if
that works
try Foxtrot and as you know probably you
should be looking for Frank here boom
let's go through all of them just for
kicks echo should be easy
ah haha Delta did we do doesn't Denver
yep Charlie we did Bravo is gonna be
Boston and then finally alpha should
match Adams let's see what happens when
he put something else in here um dodo
just for kicks
still past me didn't say I couldn't but
nothing is returning here because it
cannot find dodo in any of these guys so
that's the solution here let me go over
to where I found the solution just in
case you want to read more about it
there's a lot of people who do not get
it please myself included until I was
coding it and seeing it there's still
some confusions people were asking why
you can't use do you mind if I take a
sec to try and find these quests could
somebody here it is a few people asked
this question could somebody perhaps
explain where this does not work with
dot notation only with bracket notation
and then someone down here answer
because why see I don't want to give you
bum information well I'll put the link
here this is the github page for free
code camp I don't know if it's the
official no it's not it's some guy named
Jess - geo but there are a lot of people
in the same boat who are like this why
can't you use dot notation why can't I
find it I don't even know oh here we go
you can't use a dot because the property
Val doesn't exist in the look-up object
is that true where's the lookup object
here we go right you don't see Val so
here's your Val you can't do I think
they're stuck trying to say why can't we
do this the documentation because this
Val is nowhere in here it's not in a
property or a value let's try and run it
yep nope so now and then it will pass us
all it will pass us all what Oh fresh
take on the doctor
yep all right
so a link to this page you can
commiserate with fellow code campers
like myself but this is how you code it
to pass it guys are almost done with
this basic JavaScript section I hope
this video was helpful give you some new
insights if you like it why not give me
a summer comment you know the drill
thanks for watching we'll see in the
next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
