display something like this
is that an HTML page what this says HTML
why does this say PHP what's going on
this is perhaps one of the most
perplexing vexing problems that jr. and
beginning developers have is getting
their dev environment set up when I was
first starting out I spent hours trying
to get a simple Apache server running so
I could display this kind of code in my
browser now today I'm not gonna go too
far into the weeds but I am going to
show you how you can get stuff like this
to display in your browser now the
reason you can't just rip open a code
editor and start typing PHP and display
it in your browser is because javascript
is the only language the only
programming language that browsers
natively understand the language like
PHP you need a server to serve it to
display on the browser I have a feeling
there's a lot of you out there who are
in the same boat but a lot of people are
scared or maybe intimidated to ask
questions like this because it seems
obvious and maybe you feel sheepish I
know on Stack Overflow when people ask
questions like this they get absolutely
annihilated the Stack Overflow can be
very negative but that's not the point
of this video I'm gonna show you how
this works now the first thing you may
be noticing that looks a little weird is
that I named this a PHP file but the
doctype has been declared HTML oh that's
already looking a little weird and then
sprinkled throughout the body is stuff
like this like ooh I don't think I've
ever seen this an HTML document and how
did you just like sprinkle in more HTML
here and then throw in some PHP what I'm
doing here is embedding snippets of PHP
along with some HTML inside the PHP to
display in my browser PHP is a back-end
language that powers everything from
WordPress to Open Cart and pretty much
every e-commerce app that you've ever
seen you can also use PHP for stuff like
signing forms authenticating users stuff
like that
really really useful the other thing
that can confuse newbies too is that if
you're developing on a Mac Mac's
ship with an Apache server built in it
can be kind of hard to find but it's
under a library and then you scroll down
to web server and then documents and
then you can launch it from here
it's fraught with errors by the time you
figure out how this works as a newb
you're gonna be throwing your head
against the wall ask me how this huge
welt that's permanently on the left side
of my head got there this can be really
frustrating your best bet is to download
either MAMP there's also something
called shampoo I don't know how to spell
O's xam peepee it's up to you which one
you want to download but I prefer MAMP
the interface is just a little cleaner
I'm not going to show you how to
download this because it's simply a
matter of clicking a button and putting
out on on your machine and I'm not going
to insult you with that so download that
to your machine and once you have it
ready I'm gonna walk you through how to
do this we're gonna go over to
preferences and the first thing we're
gonna do is check this this is just like
some default stuff your ports port 8 is
a great little port we're gonna stick
with that PHP fine web server we're
gonna stick with Apache now this is the
part that's really important you have to
specify your document route so if your
PHP file was in downloads for example
you'd have to navigate to downloads and
from there you would just click it and
drop it in however that is not where our
document route is our document route
isn't documents under the folder PHP
practice this is the file I just was
showing you a few minutes ago so we're
gonna go ahead where'd you go to take
the folder not the file take the folder
drop it in right there and then it
automatically updated we're gonna hit OK
and I think everything's looking good
with that let's just double check we
have everything
Pachi server our port 8 PHP is looking
good I'm not using my sequel let's just
look at it anyway
ok great ok took about 20 seconds but
you can see the servers are online
because you have a little green online
button on both of those so now you might
be thinking ok can I just like click on
this thing and open it with like Chrome
tell me you're kidding now I know most
of you are watching the video to this
point have seen something like this and
have gotten very frustrated this has
happened to me so many times like my
server is on why isn't this rendering is
just us this is so frustrating okay so
this is what you have to do we have to
do something a little different we have
to preface this with localhost all right
this is imperative and for bonus points
if you remember what never could put it
in there eight eight eight eight that
was the number we specified we're gonna
go ahead hit enter and see what happens
oh we're getting somewhere let's see if
it works look at that served this PHP
file has been served to your browser how
awesome is that if you screw it up like
40 times I have screwed it up like 50
times so don't worry this is one of
those things that was just like wow it
shouldn't have been this complicated why
have I spent like two weeks doing this
but once you figure it out and use
something like ma'am your life's gonna
be better you don't have to be a stud
and like navigate to the web server
that's built in to your Mac or whatever
ma'am but works awesomely and so does
shamp that is how you get PHP files to
display in your browser if you have any
questions visit my real tough kandi get
our chat room lots of Smarties there
leave me a comment a lot of smart people
who watch these videos as well they'll
be happy to answer your questions I
don't want you to be embarrassed
this shouldn't be embarrassing but
unfortunately the tone of places like
Stack Overflow make you feel stupid
because you're asking important
questions that you know people with like
IQs of 500 think are ridiculous
questions but they're really not um so I
hope this was helpful like comment
subscribe tell a friend keep this
channel moving forward I thank you for
watching and we'll see the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
