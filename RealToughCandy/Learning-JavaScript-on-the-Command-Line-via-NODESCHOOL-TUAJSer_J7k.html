candy back in the saddle with you today
I want to share with you a really cool
resource that can give you a different
perspective on learning JavaScript now
this is a free resource so far so good
I really like the perspective they are
coming from and just a kind of a
different way of thinking I'll show you
what I mean in just a second let me give
you a little introduction and some
background on what this is all about
this is node school the website is node
school dot i/o and node school offers
workshops around the world in person for
people to learn node j/s now I'm not at
the point where I can learn nodejs but I
am at the point where I'm ready to
expand my skills learning basic
JavaScript want to get those basic skill
sets there are multiple you know set in
place so I can you know evolve to learn
nodejs so unfortunately I don't have
even if I did have the capacity to
understand and master nodejs right now
there isn't one available in my local
area but maybe there is one for you if
that's something you guys might be
interested in the nice thing about this
though is that even though I can't
attend one of these workshops I can
access their teaching material and their
curriculum so this is all based on
github their material and it's bait
their modules are based on core like
core information and then electives so
that's kind of cool modeling themselves
after sort of a brick and mortar
institution giving it that academic feel
I like that so this is the stuff you
need to learn and this is stuff that
probably might be helpful here there
for example bug clinic that sounds
pretty cool learn the new tech tools and
techniques to improve your debugging
skills that sounds freaking awesome but
for me and for a lot of others we're
gonna just be will want or rewind I
cannot speak
we want to be focusing exclusively on
JavaScript so just by going over here
you can see learn the basics of
JavaScript no previous programming
experience required heck yes sign me up
where do I log in well guys it's a
little and I want to see
counterintuitive but it's not quite
obvious to click on this yellow box here
but if you click on this it's gonna
bring you over to their github page and
it has the problems the solutions a
little library of course the readme
always a great place to start
and so this is where you would start if
you want to go through all this but
we're gonna go through that in this
video so if you want to just cut off
this video that is a great resource and
a great start but if you want to
continue to follow along we're gonna be
doing some pretty cool stuff in terminal
in about 15 seconds just let me set it
up for you tell you what I'm gonna be
doing so this is pretty cool because the
basics of JavaScript can be learned on
the Internet you know using a browser
and you know sublime and all that stuff
or maybe like it in browser editing
experience but with Java scripting
you're doing nearly everything you have
the you have the option of doing nearly
everything if not everything in the
terminal and guys as you know even as I
know as an intermediate beginner
learning the terminal learning the
command line whatever you want to call
it it's critical it is a critical skill
so you're kind of knocking out two birds
one stone you know what I'm saying so
this is why this is gonna be really
helpful so let's start off we want to
install NPM which is a package manager
for nodejs true we're not learning
nodejs
but NPM is going to come in handy
because eventually if you continue on
with these things all of these will need
to be installed using nor NPM somebody
used homebrew it's basically me using a
package manager to install a package
manager so we're gonna go brew install
NPM
and this is already installed on my
machine I just wanted to illustrate this
for you as you can see already installed
probably should make this bigger for you
guys so if you don't have a homebrew and
you're on a Mac I highly recommend it
it's made my life a lot easier
so that's installed perfect so now we
need to actually install this Java
scripting so I can get this bigger so
we're going to just go ahead and follow
this command and before I hit Enter or
even hit anything this is a perfect
example of learning the terminal in real
time without even having to do an
exercise like I'll show you what I mean
so we'll go ahead I want NPM to install
this Java scripting program on terminal
Java never freaking spell this Java
scripting alright everything looks good
looks groovy let's go and you will wait
for that to do its thing
oMG oMFG ttyl because I have about 30
freaking errors here now when this first
happened I was like oh my gosh this
always happens I try something new and
it always fails I'm going to bed you
know I didn't let that get the best of
me I pressed on and I figured out why
this was giving me all these errors
which is a perfect example of why this
is so brilliant doing it this way is
because you get to learn the terminal so
in order to bypass those errors I'm
gonna go as a super user so basically
I'm the admin or root right now in
terminal so instead of just Joe Schmo
real tough candy installing Java
scripting I'm gonna be going in as
pseudo so it's gonna be M I'm just gonna
copy and paste this can never spell Java
scripting what's going on here and paste
a room boom type in the old password and
it is going
it is going ample installed this was
already installed too but I just wanted
to illustrate you know how that can be
helpful in getting more familiar with
the command line okay you're saying real
tough candy can you just please stop
talking
can we start getting to it a little less
JibJab I'm glad you guys said something
because we're gonna make this even
bigger
we are gonna type in we're ready to roll
we're ready to start learning javascript
in the command line
let's go javascript I might make a
freaking alias with just like the letter
Q to print Java scripting okay let's go
ahead and over that boom in this guy's
is where we start to begin our lessons
do we want to start at the introduction
those are always so boring you know in a
tutorial let's go to functions huh why
not okay so basically these are little
modules whoa so this is exercise 17 of
19 and they define a function is a block
of code that takes input processes that
input and then produces output
possibly the most succinct right on
point blank definition of function ever
so they give you example of a simple
function and how they call it I just
love I love the efficiency of their
descriptions
I like being in terminal it makes me
feel cool that's always a good thing
right who cares you have talent as long
as you feel good about it
crap just kidding and then if you need
help you can view the readme so you can
even access this is gonna let's just
type in open HTTP this is an example
again of using commands to learn things
like you're not talking type set Vincent
Vincent slash Java correcting now as
soon as I can
enter this is gonna open a new window
not in terminal but in my internet
explorer Internet Explorer huh
Safari why did I say Internet Explorer
oh my god the bug has been planted
there's been a there's been some kind of
bug that flew in my ear and it's telling
me evil messages YouTube help so anyway
so this brings up the JavaScript github
page again we are back here that was
pretty cool
so if you need help there you go let's
go back to terminal let's open up a new
terminal let's go back you know what I
want to do
you can even guys here's something else
I found out you can even edit you can
edit javascript in terminal using nano
so we're gonna do Nano and then I think
I had something called new ext no it was
new dot txt okay I did not I love what
the newb has little eyes so let me try
and illustrate this again so we'll do
okay here's what we're gonna do nano
who's new daddy it's teeth we'll just I
don't know will do it's just some some
crude JavaScript again guys this is
everything I'm doing right now is in the
terminal and it's getting my eyes and my
hands and just overall getting me
oriented with inside of this terminal
it's a different world I'm telling you
it is if you haven't messed with
terminal I'm telling you why not start
today that sounded like a really sleazy
car salesman pitch but I'm serious just
you should just give it a whirl you just
don't break anything really badly okay
so you know I actually forgot how to
save this so I'm gonna go okay so it's
ctrl 0 is how you save a nano file so
we're gonna go ctrl 0 it's gonna write
as new Betty to you
wrote one line and exit is going to be
control X control X perfect and now open
some nano non oh gosh and then there we
go my text editor the Nano is open again
for me to do whatever I want that is
pretty cool and then we're going to go
control X to exit will go back to Java
scripting and we can go to our next
lesson we really didn't see the lesson
in here for functions do we have an
assignment let's see if we have an
assignment here okay they do have an
assignment for us I'm not going to go
through it but I will just show you guys
the caliber of what they are trying to
teach us so they want us to create a
file named functions Jes define a
function named eats that takes an
argument named food inside the function
returned the food argument like this
returns food plus tastes really good
guys I hope this was helpful I hope you
enjoyed this little preview again I've
been kind of promo NIT on my other
recent videos but I'm almost to that 100
subscriber mark I'm gonna be giving away
a prize or two as soon as I hit those
100 subscribers so stay tuned for that
thanks for watching and we'll see in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
