tough candy calm back in the saddle with
you today wanted to pop on and do a
quick video here on the differences
between port triggering and port
forwarding and we are going to take it
straight from the mouths of babes from
documentation here over at net here now
I am NOT on a Netgear router but the
principles are the same so I'm not going
to be throwing out my opinion on this
this is the actual technical differences
between these two things and why you may
want to use port triggering as opposed
to port forwarding so let me explain my
situation to kind of illustrate how I
got to this point so I wanted to do some
Remote Desktop work last night and I was
going to set up on my port three three
eight nine which is remote desktop so I
will just click that here so you know
put in the server IP address put on the
translation start forward start pulling
all that it's just three three eight
nine enabled it boom but then I was
looking around I said well port
triggering what what am I doing wrong
here so there are some differences and
as you can see here there's this
interface here that looks eerily similar
to port forwarding but at the end of the
day I think of port triggering as port
forwarding plus it's more dynamic and
it's more secure and I'm explain to you
why using the documentation provided by
net here the number one port triggering
can be used by any computer on your
network now granted it can only be used
on computer at a time but it's not like
port forwarding because as you see port
forwarding is configured for one machine
number two port triggering does not
require that you know the computer's IP
address in advance the IP address is
captured automatically and we will go
and see here under port triggering
adding rules there is nothing about any
IP address there so that saves us some
time whereas port forwarding requires
that you specify the computer's IP
address during configuration and the IP
address
can never change again refer you back to
this server IP address here we're not
messing with that in port triggering and
finally number three port triggering
which requires specific outbound traffic
to open the inbound port that's where
we're getting that triggering word from
I'm not triggered yet I'm getting
triggered by trigger and out the
triggered ports are closed after a
period of no activity now guys this is a
huge one for security I'm going to go
over that in a second whereas port
forwarding is always active and does not
need to be triggered okay this is why
port forwarding is an issue because my
port three three eight nine it's wide
open baby and if someone or something is
scanning the internet yes those tools
are out there or is you know doing one
of an infinite number of things to try
and perform some recon on the computer
they're going to find out this amount
that my remote desktop connection
protocol is open this port for remote
desktop connection is open so that's a
security issue because even if you are
able to mask at the port number three
zero eight nine let's say you know a
machine scanning your network or
scanning the internet finds support five
million six hundred seventy-two I know
that's not possible but I'm just trying
to exaggerate to illustrate it's still
going to be open no matter what you
nickname this thing for the rest of the
world to see it's still going to be open
all the time and one of the rules in
cyber security one of the basics is that
if you're not using a port you need to
close it do not give the bad guys any
opportunity to exploit your machine your
server anything so that is why port
triggering comes into effect looks a
little too activated port triggering
comes into effect because it's triggered
it only opens up when you are going
through your designated port so in my
case we're going to call this real tough
RTC because I want the remote desktop
protocol
and we're going to sync with a sort of
stick with ADSL 2 3 9 the end port now
the start point and port there's just
one port for RDP but other services have
arranged your ports so that's where you
do that or going to stick open start
port is going to be the same for this as
well and these are in being able to TCP
connections and don't forget to enable
that again your router most likely is
not this model but it's going to be
something similar to that so real tough
RDP that rule has been applied in this
firewall now we're not quite done
because we have to go back to port
forwarding now you cannot compete port
forwarding Purple Reign cannot compete
with port triggering it has to be one or
the other if you're using the same port
number now I could put port I don't know
insert number here and that could be
fine I could use that before for port
forwarding keep that always open for one
specific machine and then continue to
port trigger however because my port
here this remote desktop is the same as
the port forwarding protocol I have to
get rid of one I'm going to get rid of
port forwarding because I don't want
that connection open at all times I'm
going to delete actually you know what
I'm just going to edit I'm going to
disable it I'm going to keep it around
for later but let's turn that little
lightbulb off so it is inactive it's not
competing with anything and now port
triggering is in effect guys I hope this
was helpful again port triggering is
port forwarding plus a little more
dynamic and more than one machine can
can access this port let me let me go
through the three differences again tor
triggering can be used by any computer
for trigger does not require that you
know the computer's IP address and port
triggering requires specific outbound
traffic to open the inbound port if any
device on my network creates an outgoing
connection of via port three three eight
nine
all those incoming connections via port
three three eight nine are going to go
to that specific client because in other
words this computer that I'm using to
rock RDP alright guys I hope this video
was helpful don't overanalyze
it if you need any help I'm going to
link this handy-dandy sheet here again
probably not your router here the net
dear probably not your router you're
either with the principles are the same
hope you enjoyed this video and we'll
see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
