in service please Gus with the user
experience like that it's no wonder this
project was aborted real tough can be
for real tough danny calm back online
with you today like a lot of you i have
a backlog of projects that just weren't
up to snuff and your ideas just don't
sound as good as they did the first time
you thought of them this is one such
example i wanted to create a landing
page for bands and musicians who are
gonna do an upcoming live stream while
challenging myself to revive the
long-forgotten HTML image map now each
one of these numbers corresponds with a
song or something rude for example if i
hit the number 6 oh yeah it's that 80s
vibe and then you hang up the call there
you go
it was just a challenge to see if i
could actually do something cool with an
image map and assigning songs to those
and different things like just fun
little gimmicky things to keep the user
interested this is all to say I came
across this project and I said oh this
little countdown thing I think I might
use this I think I might have some use
for this jQuery thing that starts and
stops a background video ooh how did I
do this now a lot of times with these
earlier projects your Stack Overflow and
your way to greatness instead of
actually understanding what you're doing
with the code so I ripped open this
project today and I was like oh I'm
finally starting to see what I actually
stack overflowed and what I copied and
pasted otherwise into this document I
think I'm gonna steal this for some
later projects now that I know what this
actually means so this is kind of down
to may 30th right but if the event is
past let's just do this real quick I'll
change it to 2017 refresh and fade in
ooh
I missed the livestream darn it so as
you can see this is the output block
here where the code spits itself out to
print on the screen here it grabs the ID
of demo which is
index somewhere around here demo demo
where are we right here so this little
paragraph is spitting out the JavaScript
code and maybe some jQuery okay i didn't
read all of the code the point being of
this video don't throw away your old
projects there's probably some cool
stuff and a lot of them that you can
just snip out and use on future projects
so this video tag i forgot how much
could really customize this playing
inline auto play muted on a loop so
that's another thing that i'm gonna
probably be stealing too is that video
tag i haven't used that in ages and
honestly I forgot it even existed thanks
for watching be sure to check out my
newly revamped website real tough candy
calm the dev mojo newsletter is back
rave reviews it's filled with protein
back issues are on my website as well
it's a good time signing off thanks for
watching we'll see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
