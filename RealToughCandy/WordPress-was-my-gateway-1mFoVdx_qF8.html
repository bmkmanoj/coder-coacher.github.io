what's Afghanistan real tough candy not
coming back online with you today I want
to talk about my gateway drug the thing
that got me into web development the
thing that opened that big abstract door
so I could go in and see a thousand more
slightly smaller doors to open WordPress
is a great platform for so many reasons
it fuels 25 percent or so of the web
people are always needing websites this
is a great platform it's cheap pretty
straightforward to learn you never have
to touch a line of code if you don't
want and you can still be in the tech
industry and in the web development
industry because you are developing the
web just on a more abstract hands-off
way now when I first started on a
WordPress I didn't know the difference
between wordpress.com wordpress.org I
didn't even know you could download
WordPress to work on your own machine my
first exposure to WordPress was using
wordpress.com wordpress.com is
essentially just the web hosting portion
of WordPress and they make it sound like
it's like so much better than other
hosting companies it's really not you
can't even use JavaScript you can't
download plugins without upgrading your
plan etc etc so anyways I started out
with wordpress.com and then I realized a
few months down the road that you could
actually download WordPress to your own
machine so that was great because I can
play around with WordPress and also
figure out how to set it up like oh you
mean I can't just open up WordPress
using a browser I have to it has to come
from a server what does that even mean
what's shamp
what's WAMP what's MAMP and getting all
that stuff organized going into
phpMyAdmin and messing around with
databases all kinds of components that
are at your disposal when you're in the
WordPress ecosystem now there are some
major blocks in development that are
never addressed the WordPress unless
you're developing plugins unless you're
developing themes like I said you might
never have to touch a line of code that
goes for HTML and CSS to not just
JavaScript PHP if you're good with
googling things if you're good
knowing your plugins you can make
WordPress so that you can just click
buttons and that makes people money and
that's cool but you can also dig deeper
inside the code in the PHP files and
mess around the plugins and see what's
going on there and really see what's
going on and for me that was that big
abstract door once I got in and figured
out that oh there's code underneath here
like all these letters and all these
characters this is doing something that
was huge WordPress for me is not
something I work on or investigate or
develop in my spare time I use WordPress
for clients it's you can deploy a
beautiful-looking website in less than
24 hours that's SEO ready and with a few
plugins I mean it can really shine
WordPress has come a long way I think
it's reached its peak I think WordPress
as a CMS is more of a web 1.0 technology
i think it's hit its peak but that
doesn't mean you can't still learn from
it use it as a tool to advance yourself
and use it to develop the web but when i
fire it up man for the first time i said
ooh this is cool i want to I want to
learn more about this so thank you
WordPress for allowing me to expand past
the plug-in and ecosystem or to learn
about things like JavaScript and full
stack web development you've been good
to me I'd like to hear about your
gateway drugs and web development I have
a few more gateway drugs it's not just
WordPress this was like the one of the
biggest ones probably the biggest one
this little interface right here is kind
of home to me it's familiar it's mostly
functional and you know it feels natural
feels good so let me know what your
guys's gateway drugs are and I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
