from a perspective of I wanna first rank
locally in my local area she's you know
we we're developers and we'd like to get
clients you know in the area online food
but you know so I would say create a
website it can be WordPress Weebly it
doesn't matter so create the work
website start writing your posts make a
system I mean if you want to do once a
week that's cool
twice two three times a week that's cool
but just be consistent with the post
quality post
so the longer the better right I mean
short is cool but Google likes long and
I just say Google because that's of
course the main search engine but the
other two important ones that people
still use as well or Bing and Yahoo we
were taught in my little mastermind
group that you know we're taking all
three into accounts or ranking Google
being the important one of course so the
quality posts are just speaking about a
topic if you're writing about how to use
JavaScript you just write as though
you're talking to someone you don't want
to use too many keywords being like you
you're putting web developer in Houston
all throughout the post you don't want
to do that you just just make it flow
after you create the website you've
generated or think thought about some
keywords to use in your post your
writing your post consistently which you
also want to do is which I would suggest
anyone doing even if you're willing to
be only online is create a Google Places
you've ever the local places basically
citations with citations are it's it's a
way for the local your local people in
your area to find you say you're
googling I don't know Pizza Hut in
Austin you know the first things that
pop up that's what that is
so you want to be found with that all
they want is your name or your business
name whatever your phone number and your
address now I'm pretty funky I'm pretty
hesitant about giving my address out so
I just bought appeal not appeal box one
of those ups boxes sure they have
physical addresses there was another
trick auerbach mastermind group showed
us is that because there's like a lot of
weirdos out there or is that like what
is that all what's the purpose yeah so
basically to get a UPS box it's just
your privacy but I mean it just depends
some people don't care for my business
and for my husband's business he just
you know created a business out here and
he was
- we just used our house address then
when you check that little box in Google
to not display your actual address they
they they're not supposed to show your
actual address just your city Houston
Texas or Austin or whatever so the next
step after that connect with other
developers or whoever you know you're
trying to get whatever your goal is just
just network write polls and whenever
you you you you start connecting with
the developers maybe they'll have your
you as a guest post or you know a guest
speaker or whatever on their site or
their YouTube channel or whatever you
know they can link stuff to you and
that's your backlinks right there get on
facebook
Facebook was I mean it was very useful
even in my little projects in a patio
and building the local businesses so
Facebook and not Twitter so much
Twitter's you know it's fun so it's fun
but it's not really effective in that
area you know people are on your
Facebook page and they're commenting and
you know you're interacting with your
followers or just in general then you
know Google sees that as well and they
begin to rank your Facebook page as well
have experience with that as well as
your YouTube you can use YouTube as well
that those are things to start and the
more you keep doing those things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
