candy from real tough candy come back in
the saddle with you today we are
exploring the Yahoo user interface
library the Yui library not to be
confused with the Japanese
singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist
and actress from Fukuoka let's go ahead
and see what we are working with with
this thing now this guy's I'm telling
you we're sifting through the ashes let
me give you a brief history of this Yui
library this is Yui library calm Yui
library calm now this is no longer being
actively maintained yahoo gave an
announcement that's not even dated I
mean it could be five years old it could
be who knows how many I'm sure it's oh
here it is 2014 okay so they stopped
caring about this they abandon ship and
gave up their mission to Mars and you
know crash and burn in a dumpster fire
in 2014 so they claim to have a thriving
community I don't know if that's true or
not but we're gonna try and see if we
can sift through this huge composite ori
composite ori that's a new word and I'm
keeping it repository before can we just
start over we're gonna sift through here
and see if we can find anything useful
now a lot of this stuff because it's I
want to say so old I mean the library
here is like 12 years old it started in
2005 a lot of it looks dated a lot of it
doesn't have functionality so you got to
pick and choose what you want to work
with now let me give you some backstory
you and came about in 2005 right when
jQuery was introduced or rather maybe
Unleashed to the world and I don't need
to tell you who came out on top and who
is absolutely killing it even in 2017 so
long story short Yahoo Lost jQuery one
and this is the result of a losing
library let's get started
so they tell you you can copy and paste
this is how you get started pretty
straightforward and then start using Yui
suite but we're not gonna go through all
of this creating the UI effects we can
read that documentation later I'm more
concerned about finding a project I can
actually use that isn't whack looking
because again a lot of these widgets and
whatnot are they're very dated looking
so let's go there's one in particular
that was I already I already folded up
here so this is under X I'm going to
navigate to there if I can't find it I
will just click on that window there
where did in the heck where did the heck
did I find it very intuitive
well-documented API um tutorials perhaps
examples here we go okay so we're gonna
so here are the Yui examples we have the
core categories here global objects
nodes events CSS developer tools let's
just see it's great widgets there's some
widgets there's more graphics complex
drawing violin so you guys you see how
kind of underwhelming this is this may
still have some relevancy I'm not sure
where we might find that relevancy
though here's our widgets here is it
it's a dial that's the one I was looking
for here a basic dial
sprite animation guys I have sifted
through these widgets and this is the
coolest one I've been able to find and
it's still updated so this spin it
around you can use a dial widget to
animate an image of sprite now that's
pretty freakin cool you can also use the
arrow keys and here my manic tapping of
the left arrow key there and that's
created from this image sprite now this
is basically a composite I think there
is one to however many images in one
file
and then it separates them so you can
spin them around and around on a dial
and here's the Komen this is kind of the
cool part because even though yeah
anything ten years has a tendency to
look very naive in my opinion it's
between it's in that area where it's not
quite vintage and it's not quite new
anymore it's just it's tired these
designs these interfaces these widgets
they're tired they're bulky they don't
account for the rapid growth of Internet
and web development which I guess are
probably the same thing so but anyways
why am i showing you this video just for
history sake because it's kind of fun to
look through you know if even though you
might not ever you probably will never
use the Yui library but it's also cool
to look at how this was created no you
don't necessarily have to use this on
anything why would you find some cool
application for it do you think hard
enough but we have our div here and
these are actually - dibs right here so
the duck element has the sprite as the
background image and then the demo div
has the dial which over set was totally
unnecessary which we will see in the
code here so here's our duck t'v just
this guy demo div this guy I don't need
to go through all of it so here's our
Java Script we have the script type
JavaScript all that fun stuff complete
example source I might play around with
this guy's anyways this is sifting
through the ashes and ashes they eyes
kind of it's very interesting practical
probably not there are so many other
tools to better do all of these jobs you
know but maybe you know somebody who
needs some work on their Yahoo page or
something I don't know guys thanks for
watching I hope this was a fun video for
you I know for me I
of uncovering this old stuff that
everyone's forgotten about and also the
thriving community be really fun to know
if that's true or not thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
