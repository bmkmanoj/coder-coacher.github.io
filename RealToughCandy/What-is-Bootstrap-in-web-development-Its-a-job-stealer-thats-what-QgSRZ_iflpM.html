that you have you know we could do like
a sidebar right here this is the actual
the actual literal translation of what
the website will look like much of the
work of Crime Control has to happen at
the local level let me add that right
now there's the chaos a little warm
people we can you know we can tweak that
how's that looking for you dude I'm
sorry ma'am I'm sorry Hillary we're just
gonna have mutual would strap hey
everybody how's it goin real tough can
be the real Jeff Jamie calm back in the
saddle with you today
shout out first and foremost to some of
my new subscribers set W and Jason G
thank you guys for showing up yesterday
and saying hi it was nice meeting you
guys and good good good have you along
also apologies to Isaac who's triggered
by yesterday's video I apologize for
that gave you a nice lol so thanks for
tuning in today's topic is bootstrap I'm
a little late to the game you know I'm
really late to the game the point of
this video is twofold number one I want
to hear what you guys have to think
about this thing because I'm getting
mixed feelings and I'm feeling a little
dirty about it I want to know I want to
see if I can put this into perspective
number two this bollocks Travis thing is
really freaking cool and I don't want to
see I created something in five minutes
but I did a little tweaking here and
there to make a bootstrap based web app
in like five minutes I feel a little
guilty about that and as someone who
cares about graphic design and you know
I'm not a UI UX boss but I take pride in
the aesthetics of a web page it looks
really freaking good but I didn't do
much as anything let me show you what I
mean step one google bootstrap template
ba-boom oh here's a good one
step two tweak a few things to put on a
hero image now this big old picture
that's cranked down in contrast and
brightness like all the way to the left
this dark image is known as the hero
image it takes up the width of you
type of your screen etc etc okay great I
added a few things oh look it's a single
page website I don't really know if this
qualifies as an app it doesn't do much
but yeah sweet
this looks great don't go to Donald dong
what else do you have free download it
real tough for you come contact me email
me oops
watch this watch this watch it up look
at that
you want to see something else look at
the fluidity of some of this stuff but
the nuances of this template are like
they're at a 9 if not a solid 10 it's
solid check this out check this out just
wait just wait
look at this fade in look at this fade
in of these Fon awesomes ready Oh break
wait for it right wait watch watch look
look
isn't that beautiful isn't that fluid do
you know how long that would take me to
actually invent in my mind I couldn't do
something like this
I couldn't even invent it I couldn't
even do like a wireframe I wouldn't even
occur to me you'd have candy you didn't
design this it's not yours you shown it
all you did was add an image my inner
voice is 150 year old Bob Avenger type I
can't explain it
I think bootstrap is like the hip hop
sample of web development like that
James Brown funky drummer beat has been
stolen I mean sampled by hundreds of
hip-hop people over the years and every
time it's used it sounds good
that's just the thing I needed to stop
feeling bad about this thing this isn't
copyright this is open for me to take
why not why not throw in a few different
icons from the font awesome library in
fact let's make it my own even more
let's go in here let's see if they have
a car okay let's go oh my god someone's
yelling at me oh look at that pig you
have a car okay great I don't feel so
bad you guys ready for this how long
would this take me or anybody in my
position where they are the learning
journey to create something this
responsive now watch here we go now this
is simulating a iPad we're getting close
to iPad territory have to move the
photos down yet for us oh my God look at
that you see that watch this watch this
watch this oh oh oh yeah yeah
totally responsive and look at this now
are an iPad territory now these photos
are eventually going to be smartphone
territory this might even be iPads here
so I'm not sure one of those big monster
we call those big monsters smartphones
look at that and all I did all I had to
do is download the freaking the package
incredible throw a few photos in I mean
who wouldn't want to show this to a
client I don't know guys
what do you think do you use bootstrap
and if so to what extent and do you ever
feel guilty about it should I just get
over it I'm really I'm so conflicted
right now also the other feature to note
just in this template just in this
template look watch watch watch I see
this banner up here okay watch how it
transforms look at that look at okay
wait your goes white you're go guys it's
super fluid it looks good I couldn't do
it
I prompts to bootstrap no wonder they
teach us in bootcamp I'm not safe for
work alert this guy this developer took
this exact same bootstrap design and
said hey look if every bootstrap website
ever and a very cynical interpretation
of this bootstrap design but even you
admit it looks good not gonna lie I feel
like the other night when I watched a
half-hour tutorial on the nuances
covering the differences between flexbox
inline block and inline block I feel
like the kind of waste of my time
because the dude did a half-hour
tutorial of something that I just
freakin downloaded like I don't know at
what point are you not a developer and
at what point are you not even a
designer this is this is am I just
assembling things I'm too neurotic
another cup of coffee I'm signing off
guys thanks for watching looking forward
to your feedback and if you're
interested in this template or any
others that hundreds if not millions of
other people are using I'll put the link
in the description box for you to play
around this thanks for watching guys
we'll see you in the next video
