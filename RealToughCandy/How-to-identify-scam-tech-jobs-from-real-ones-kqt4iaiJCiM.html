couple of months ago some chick and
tried to scam me after I applied to a
job at code Academy this is the message
I got you need to DM me and code caddy
me uh code elegy I'm sorry who are you
so what I did was get on the line with
coke Adam II I said I got this message
can you please confirm this is legit got
a message from quick Adam II there are
not affiliated with us thank you now I
have no idea how this person discovered
that I applied to Kody Adam II I think I
probably applied through indeed if
anyone has any insight as to how these
scammers actually operate today's video
is on whether a tech job is a scam or
legit now there's a few techniques you
can use to make sure you're not getting
scammed it's a horrible feeling if the
job listing is really really
probably a scam if they don't list the
requirements are the type of person
they're looking for just like oh yeah we
need somebody to work for us stay away
from it it might not necessarily be a
scam but you're gonna end up in not a
very good place these little stars are
especially helpful if you're using
indeed because these are reviews from
people who have worked there so that's a
good starting point the other thing you
can do with companies that I recommend
you do with every job you're researching
is googling them most of the companies
you're going to be seeing on indeed
you've never heard of and be sure to go
to that second page because a lot of the
times the first page is littered with
like chill reviews and different things
that aren't really honest for example
cyber coders recruiting I would say for
junior developers at least stay away
from them they're pretty skinny
they're pretty scam now the first page
let's go to cyber cutter review the
first page looks pretty good right like
four out of five four out of five not
bad remember the Glassdoor this this
rating is based on working at cyber
coders so what I'm saying is recruiters
and other people who work
cyber coders have reviewed them as a
service not people who have been
recruited by them you know what I'm
saying so if you go down here a little
more you can see what people are
actually saying after using their
services these guys are a joke
poor poor service racial discrimination
okay but that's one review but let's
just keep going and seeing what we got
I'm not convinced most of the jobs they
post exist this is my exact experience
and guys and gals there are so many jobs
outside of cyber coders anyway you don't
need to be using a recruiter to find a
job most cases I'm not saying don't use
them but cyber coders and I can only add
my personal experience is that cyber
coders is a scam the jobs that they
posted just don't they simply do not
exist they posted a lot of jobs near my
location that I can verifiably tell you
do not exist because I talked to the one
development company in my area who said
we have no idea what you're talking
about I always go to that second page on
Google and research from various
different sources don't just rely on web
set one website like glass store with
like yeah it was a good experience or
you know this job sucks a lot of people
who review these employers are pretty
disgruntled because they're not very
good workers or they have a bone to pick
with their supervisor or whatever hey a
lot of us have been there just like
dying to give a one-star review to a
place because we're mad so look at the
good reviews and look at the bad reviews
and use your critical thinking skills to
assess this company before you even get
involved in what they're doing one other
thing you want to do is stick to the job
boards that are reputable now indeed is
pretty reputable there are some things I
don't like about it but for the most
part it's been pretty solid and the
other thing I do is apply directly to
the companies on their websites when
possible sometimes they don't let you
and you're forced to go through indeed
but I like to just cut out the middleman
and it makes it a little more personable
gives less information to indeed which
is probably a good thing you know if the
job board looks janky or they want like
a lot of personal information forget it
like there's so many other better job
boards out there Monster's another okay
one I don't want to say it's stellar
because there are just like state job
postings from you know the
aforementioned
coating whatever they're called cyber
coders I don't know about zip recruiters
actually just google them really quick
yeah this isn't looking so good this
isn't looking so good but I'd have to do
a little more homework just to see if
it's something I'd be worth risk it be
worth risking but I've had great results
just by passing recruiters that's just
my personal preference of opting out of
recruiters I hope this video was helpful
the number one thing you can do to tell
a scam job from a real one
is to Google that company and if you're
still a little uneasy there's a lot of
jobs out there you don't have to like
you know overthink it there's hundreds
of thousands of open tech jobs right now
I think last number I looked at was 1.4
million open tech jobs by 2020 yeah it's
looking pretty good for you so don't
worry about getting locked in to a job
that looks too good to be true
hope this video is helpful thanks for
watching a like comment subscribe tell a
friend keep this channel on its upward
trajectory I thank you for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
