tough candy back in your area today we
are doing a little quiz e quiz 15
question straightforward quiz about VPN
and firewall security whether you're an
aspiring cyber security person or a
programmer coder any type of IT person
should probably grasp the basics of
firewalls and some a VPN action for good
measure now that further ado let's get
to it we're going to go through these
one by one I'll read them off and here
are your options and i'll read those
give you a few seconds to consider the
right choice and move on let's do it
question number one when testing
firewall security which type of tool
stresses a system to discover if it will
react improperly fail or reveal unknown
vulnerabilities is that a show point B
fuzzing see packet analyzer or d OS
finger printer again when testing
firewall security which type of tool
stresses a system to discover if it will
react and properly fail or reveal
unknown vulnerabilities show point
buzzing packet analyzer request changer
printer if you said buzzing you are in
the right my friend ding ding ding ding
each one of these is worse seven points
if you're into that sort of thing let's
go down to question 2 what is the name
of the process that sends a wide variety
of packets toward an internal target in
hopes of discovering a packet
configuration that succeeds in passing
the restrictions of a firewalls rule set
would you say a packet analysis be fire
stocking see fire walking or D buzzing
again what is the name of the process
that sends a wide variety of packets
toward an internal target in hopes of
discovering a pack configuration that
succeeds and passing the restrictions of
firewalls rule set is that packet adil
and that packet analysis tie your
stocking player walking or fuzzing the
correct answer is
fire walking question number three what
should you consider when selecting a
firewall for your organization a whether
retail or open source be number of
patches released see both a and B D
neither a nor B again what should you
consider when selecting a firewall for
your organization whether a retailer
open source number of passes released
both of those or neither of those well
this was a pretty straightforward
question hopefully you answered see
whether it costs money or doesn't cost
money and what the security is with
patches question for which of the
following is the easiest and safest way
to detect software coding errors in a
firewall good question would it be a
comb through and test every line of code
for god sakes please don't answer a B
check the version of passion history
allow a fee allow a hacker to discover
the vulnerability and monitor your
firewall activity to stop the hacker or
die's conduct pilot test again which of
these is the easiest and safest way
thank you keywords easiest and safest
way to detect software coding errors in
a firewall comb through a test army line
of code check the version of patching
history allow a hacker to do this thing
or conduct a pilot test the correct
answer in both in terms of both ease and
safety is the conduct a pilot test
question 5 what type of firewall is most
effective against firewalking oops I'm
at a given you a preview let's make it
peaked what type of firewall is most
effective against firewalking
fragmentation and internal code planning
is that a static packet filtering be
application proxy see stateful
inspection or D content children again
what type of firewall is most effective
against firewalking fragmentation and
internal code planting is it static
packet filtering application proxy state
full inspection or content filtering my
friend if you said see stateful
inspection you are correct question
number six which of the following is not
true when using a VPN appliance a remote
users should separate accounts to
connect the VPN be remote users should
have the private IP address assigned to
the VPN appliance to connect to it see
the appliance must have access to the
internet or D the VPN server must have
access to the internal network again
which of the following is not true when
using a VPN appliance and guys for if
you're beginner with this kind of thing
my favorite technique for this is
identifying the things that are true and
then seeing the one that's just like
standing out like ok all these are true
except black so you can do it either way
something might stick out right away or
you can do which of the following is not
sure when using VPN appliance remote
users should separate accounts should
use separate accounts rather to connect
to the VPN remote users should use their
private the private IP address assigned
to the VPN clients to connect to it the
appliance must have access to the
internet or the VPN server must have
access to the internal network the
answer which of these is not true is be
this is false remote users should use
the private IP address sighs the VPN
appliance to connect to it question 7
what is the best description of a VPN
pretty straightforward can you handle it
a and ftp server be a bastion host see a
data encrypted gateway through a
firewall or de a file and print server
what is the best description of a VPN an
ftp server a bastion host a data
encrypted gateway through a firewall or
a file and print server well this is a
pretty succinct definition of a VPN and
i think i'll probably steal this a data
encrypted gateway through a firewall
well question 8 which of the following
is not my deal use of VPN technology a
internal network users be telecommuters
see branch offices or D traveling
employees again which of the following
is not an ideal use of VPN technology
internal network ning users
telecommuters branch offices or
traveling
employees the answer of course is a
google question 9 more than half we done
what is the primary benefit of
configuring an individual access account
for each VPN user rather than creating a
single account for all VPN users a you
can disable an employee's individual
account if you no longer need VPN access
be doing so makes it up easier see well
bandwidth is automatically allocated to
several accounts rather than to a single
account or D multiple accounts are
easier to track is a single account
again what is the main the primary
benefit of configuring an individual
access account for each VPN user rather
than creating a single account for all
VPN users you can disable it employs
individual account of she no longer
needs VPN access doing so mix it up
easier more bandwidth is automatically
allocated several accounts rather than
the single account or multiple accounts
are easier to track them a single
account the correct answer my friend is
a you can disable an employee's
individual account if she no longer
needs you can access question number our
time you are implementing a VPN server
your internal network IP address rate in
192 dot 1680 got one 2 192 at 168 dot 0
dot 254 which of the following should
not be used on a network at the other
end of the VPN tunnel which one should
not be used would it be a 192 dot 1680 x
19 2 dot 1680 x 17 to 16 dot y dot Z or
D is it 10 X Y Z um I'm not going to
repeat this question I am probably going
to stumble over at three times so you
can read over it and check out the
answers and if you said a 192 dot 1680 x
give yourself seven-point question 11
which of the following ensures the
consistency accuracy and validity of
data or information is a confidentiality
be integrity
see availability or D non-repudiation
again which of the following ensures the
consistency accuracy and validity of
data or information confidentiality
integrity ability or non-repudiation the
answer to that pretty straightforward be
which of the following ensures that
information networks and systems are
secure from unauthorized access
preventing the data for being read by an
unauthorized user confidentiality
integrity availability or
non-repudiation again which of the
following ensures that information
networks and systems are secure for
offline access preventing data from
being read by an authorized user to
confidentiality integrity availability
for good old-fashioned non-repudiation
the answer to that is a confidentiality
questions how you guys doing out there
you get any wrong or getting wait a
minute okay we somehow questions 1
through 15 got downgraded to six points
in seven points so thoroughly these
aren't as important as the first couple
questions questions 13 which of the
following ensures that users and systems
can access information required
confidentiality integrity of that
ability or non-repudiation again which
of these ensures that users and systems
can access information when required
it's going to be see availability number
14 you want to reduce the occurrence of
employees posting confidence or company
and fall on social media sites like
Facebook we're sharing the information
via personal email accounts like Gmail
or Yahoo which of the following
firewalls is the best choice a
application be database see virtual
indeed data protection again your
employees are doing silly things on
social media and blowing up your
company's private info and also sharing
information through their private email
accounts like Yahoo and Gmail are you
serious don't worry you're going to pick
a good firewall alright but you tell me
is it going to be an application be
database
ritual or D data protection for your
best choice in firewalls it's going to
be the data protection and finally which
protection technology detects an attack
alerts operators and then takes action
to prevent a breach from a current is it
idea IPS VPN or DLP again which
protection technology detects an attack
alerts operators and then takes action
to prevent a breach from occurring IDF
ipf VPN or DLP he said be I TS we've
down there's Ariel blink intrusion
prevention system ids on the other hand
is intrusion detection systems so that p
and IPS using context clues fan big fan
context clues prevent intrusion
prevention systems alright guys tally up
your points let me know how you did be
interested to see if you guys took this
in the first place and how you did
thanks for watching again it seems basic
but this actually is all this stuff is i
kind of want to say beginning
intermediate to advanced beginner this
definitely isn't for beginners beginners
but even if you are a beginner beginner
it's good to just get familiar and get
your eyes on some of the terminology and
different ways of phrasing things and so
on alright guys thanks for watching
we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
