candy back in the saddle with you today
we are using wireshark and netwitness
investigator to analyze wireless traffic
lula sounded sexy already we're moving
on to do some flavor security stuff
after a few coding tutorials really
excited I love cyber security in the i.t
realm it's my favorite topic so we're
over actually a tool layer and this is a
virtual lab we are running what is it
windows I don't do windows server 2008
and this is part of a virtual lab for a
course I'm taking on cyber security and
network security so unfortunately if you
want this actual setup you're probably
going to have to enroll in accredited
universities program for IT or cyber
security or something this the setup is
not free however Wireshark which is what
we're going to be exploring in just a
few moments is open source and free of
charge to download um however met
witness investigator I believe you have
to cough up the dill so whatever your
situation is you'll at least be able to
use one of the two technologies free of
charge so today might be a little
extended lesson because we're actually
going to go through step by step using
the steps that tool wire has given us so
I'm not going to be cutting any corners
or adding any shortcuts or anything but
actually just starting out with the
basics of how to look at Wireshark and
the contents of what Wireshark is
captured using information previously
captured I know it sounds like oh like a
lot of mumbo jumbo at the moment but
once we start running it will hopefully
make a little more sense and this
Wireshark I've been playing with for
quite a few months and it never ceases
to just do it spit elating being out in
public and capturing traffic and seeing
what's going on and what's being
broadcast etc so a little less talk a
little more cyber security so this lab
like I said have step by step and
options and we are going to follow them
darn near to the tea without skipping
let's get to the meat part one analyzing
wireless traffic with wireshark so step
one is to double-click the Wireshark
icon so do you want to follow along and
be awesome I do want to say that this is
version one point 10.0 and I believe let
me open up my Wireshark because it
doesn't look like this the operation is
the same but to the interface or the
presentation is a little bit different
oh let's see what version gets to point
on to point i'll put 2.0 2.5 is what i'm
working with on my own machine but for
this one it's one point and by the
concept and what is going to be doing is
darn near identical you just might have
to look in different places for these
things okay so we have Wireshark open
and this is the home screen here the
main screen and they point out there are
several shortcuts to make your job
easier with four categories of shortcuts
ET capture here file online and capture
health pretty self-explanatory so step
two we're going to click open to display
a list of files that are on the desktop
and what do you know pops up we're going
to double-click the demo capture p kappa
p kappa ng interesting these little blue
boxes they they share are some pretty
cool tidbits because it kind of gives
you some insider information maybe not
technically relevant stuff you wouldn't
use in everyday conversation with people
in IT but it gives you a little bit of
an edge for example p kappa ng i don't
know what that's good for what they tell
you pack should capture next generation
pretty sweet so they want to so
double-click demo capture pcap peanut
energy which is right here and as you
see wireshark capture file there to go
you're going to open they also notes
that many people believe that it's
necessary to enable the wireless toolbar
and review wireless toolbar
okay they believe that's necessary to
enable any time they are looking at
wireless traffic but if you were to
enable the wireless toolbar at this
point the option remaining grayed out
because the toolbar is only used when
capturing live traffic okay that's all I
need to know about that so we're going
to hide this because we're not going to
be actually capturing anymore I don't
think in this tutorial yep in this lab
we're using a free capture file I'm not
capturing live track step 4 drag the top
border of the frame detail pane up to
expand it until only the summaries of
frames 1 2 and 3 are shown okay there's
very morning singing to you Susan and
just to make sure that's going to be
sweet yep oh don't want to lift this up
to you it is just I know click the plus
sign at the beginning of the frame one
line in the frame detail painting to
expand field
notice the number of fields related to
time this part of the display will be
the same for wired or wireless traffic
however the encapsulation height
protected information indicator field
unique to our most traffic confirmed
substances of Michaelis Hackett okay can
you run that by me again click the plus
we're at the beginning of the frame one
line in the frame detail pane check
notice a number of fields related to
time ah time Delta from previous
captured previous display okay I'm
noticing this part of the display will
be the same for wired or wireless
however being capsulation type where is
that ah encapsulation site per packet
information however header perfect
confirms this is a wireless get perfect
number six click the minus sign is
beginning a frame one to collapse the
field okay so basically that was just a
tutorial on how to expand these things
to investigate more on the frame frame
one they also note that double clicking
headings from the frame detail pane will
also expand or collapse the detail below
alright so it's all looking too happy ok
what they're saying with that is that
double clicking it on the blooper is the
same as pressing rest time ok now we're
going to click the plus sign at the
beginning of the PPI version 0 line in
the frame detail pane to expand the
fields and display the per packet
information encapsulation rich is
conveniently yes ok version 0 header
length is 84 gives you ok ok what you
smell election here notice following
information alignment is set to 0 us or
not align which means the next bite
after the field contains the next field
number jet else's header length is a be
four octaves refers to link in the PPI
header only and does not include any
other headers and present new frame a
data link type of 105 indicates that
data is transferred over a 02 mm 11n
wireless network so you can see how this
could be helpful in situation so let's
find the 105 there's the dlg which
data link type indicating that data is
transferred over an 802 11 n perfect and
step turn click the plus sign at the 80
to the 11 common line doing and we are
seeing oh he does is 802 11 more
information that this is just from one
that frame this is what's fascinating
about capturing these packets is that
all of this information is just one
frame it's insane it's amazing so click
the plus sign of the beginning of 802 11
and macbook stage why line to expand
those field and weird let me minimize us
is getting a little out of control you
to extend that then you see that
information was all in solution use a
scroll ball as necessary to review all
the newly extend field notice of the
data reveals a large amount of data I
won't be able to that 11 Oh IDs
including signal strength noise ratios
and other information about the antenna
about the actual antenna how
cool is that so by enabling this packet
capture this product this wire shark has
captured and tenant signal and noise
ratios okay so we go now except thurs
change if desired puts the minus sign I
think I will and again this part of the
tutorial is just to get you familiar
with what where everything is not
everything that where the main things
are and just getting you comfortable
getting into the guts of Wireshark so if
you made your Wireshark up and ready by
all means and you're sick of me babbling
you probably want to wait like it to
like I don't know step 20 or something
she's pretty rotted see what happens we
need to press a clicks on the plus on a
domain name system is what is that do
you really know can we go on
okay they want us to make a screen crap
sack rapture about it put the plus sign
at the beginning of the I Triple E 80 to
the 11 quality of service status flags
line Wow where the heck is this see this
is plus I don't usually mess with in the
group of fields Wireshark displays
information or the transmitters and
receivers of the data which allow the
network administrator to determine which
mac addresses match each transmitter and
receiver ok so the transmitter address
is agam tech te and i'm a mac address or
part of it anyway and then which which
is this ok that's not what are they
telling us here determine which chef mac
addresses match each transmitter and
receiver ok so there's no transmitter
address and associates this must be the
max that matches it well it seems you
screams help they notice too that
Wireshark displays transmitter and
receiver addresses in both full
hexadecimal and a shorthand so here's
the show cut ok that make sense so
here's the short hand there's the short
handles MAC address and then there's the
full monty they notice who they note
that it's possible they're not likely
for sophisticated criminals who soup
border send false information to wire
sorry click the plus sign in front of
this frame check sequence line to expand
with additional feel bring Chuck
speaking where the heck is that here we
go frame check sequence
click the forefront of the quality
service control line one study the
fields and their values it is within the
scope this lab to understand the fields
exist beyond and so pitch one to explain
what each field means in the interaction
in the field so what they're saying is
realize for beginners which is what this
lab is realize that these things exist
realize they exist the quality of
service control the frame check sequence
what can you expand the iee 802 11
quality service at us realize that you
can click on these things but you don't
if you're a beginner you don't need to
know exactly what's that have everything
we need right now a little overwhelming
so now they want us to put the minus
sign in front of okay we're going to
collapse this to see just sitting on
control there are little literally
hundreds of fields of data available
depending upon the wireless
communications protocols that are
present and those that are captured in a
thousand different ways to interpret it
okay that's thoroughly overwhelming the
fields that have been examined thus far
are unique to wireless networking there
are some important aspects to know about
capturing your wireless data with
wireshark Wireshark is regularly
installed with a packet capture library
called wind keycaps maybe you've heard
of it if you let me just make a timeout
here and close the book for a minute to
talk to you guys about half of five
their channel with Shannon Morse and
Giron kitchen holy crap those guys are
so awesome they know their stuff they're
always experimenting perhaps you've
heard of the land turtle or the USB
rubber ducky half five products oh my
gosh they're always doing just insane
stuff with wireshark and you know other
pen testing tools check out their
channel it's hak5 I'm not getting paid
to plug their channel but it's how
awesome making a lot of advanced stuff
none of the stuff that they show I can
actually do but it's super fun to watch
and their production values are pretty
awesome too shoutout to hack five you
guys rock now back to my book
instruction here
so actually capture add-on for air pcap
article in fellow player sure they allow
you to capture more routes information
than without so for example this air p
camp I've never used it i don't have the
add-on I don't think anyway maybe i do i
don't know if i do i've never used it
but i believe have five has references
era p tap I'm just inventing things on
their mind to worship them even more
except my teen click the plus sign in
front of the logical link control line
to extend the LLC fields and familiarize
yourself to sit down at a favorable
where's that LLC here we go and for
those of you George Williams IP and
networking you know the LLC is part of
the OSI model so some of this stuff is
like okay logical link control LLC yeah
okay makes sense almost fall in the
slammer as are my viewers just kidding
guys I know this is dry but I'm telling
you you don't have to do this verbatim
for what I'm doing right now but as far
as getting familiar it's so it can be so
boring doing this I find it kind of fun
maybe it's just me what I'm telling you
if you're interested in getting into an
intermediate level with the Wireshark
with any objective you have doing the
fan of stuff is necessary I'm telling
you you gotta you gotta know what's
inside your at least in a bag sense know
what exists so you know you're not
spending an hour a year down the line
being like oh my god what's logical link
layer and how is that important their
logical link control rather ok so we're
clicking plus signs we're gonna i know i
did i said it wasn't going to skip steps
but if we're just you know what we're
not going snitch that's where are we
okay click the plus sign in front of the
internet protocol version for ipv4 line
to expand the header in familiar so I
familiar too familiar size everyone
start familiarizing right knee damage
where's ipv4 there's some much stuff
here here it is I already clicked it
ipv4 which we are speedily running out
of sorta article the other day on with
it Krebs on security also a great
worse if you hadn't check that out for
cyber security he was a journalist for
some magazine or newspaper can remember
what and now he writes exclusively on
cybersecurity issues crabs k re BS on
security internet protocol version four
okay so we're just getting familiar
version for what do you know header
length 20 site what okay part of a tool
differentiated services through all this
stuff means something that's scary and
fascinating protocol UDP because some of
this stuff for beginner to intermediate
looking a little familiar source and
destination IP addresses 192 that 166
out ones on one okay look in familiar
looking familiar now he wants cause it's
all fine okay so we did that header
checksum what's Gong rings you're so
good that little puffy can check on the
UDP sweet source port 1031 okay and I
wish the hak5 team was just like sitting
next to me x hey you guys or give you a
bass guitar to come hang out with me
you'll have to talk about any of this
just go have a beer check some domain
name system do they want me to click on
the stuff because I totally am once I
stopped once I started I just can't stop
we just keeps going and going I'm
definitely in the dark web this is the
deep dark web okay who is getting good
query for political pollitos on i.t man
what's that about icoo phone turns to
myself I've ites never a good thing
Italy's no way dude I send out rest rare
record of them to Italy none of them
ever make it to the destination telling
you it's bad news me see some like this
you just watch just watch you click the
plus sign in front of the UDP protocol
I'm yes I'm going to the game
click the line of sign instead of the
UDP line to collapse the UDP field put
the plus sign in front of domain name
system query lines who expanded field
which i believe i already use it ok yep
we put all of these oh here's something
the ultimate payload regardless of
whether the packet is sent to the error
on a wire is a domain name system query
in this case the dns information you can
see requested forward pollito itu-r ago
any DNS requests regardless of whether
the packet is sent wirelessly or via
wire includes same fields in a wire
shark tracker capture but the wireless
portion of the frame information
requires special consideration in the
forensic investigation crap ok that's
what that translates to suppose that a
forensic investigator needed to monitor
all web traffic when sin of coffee shop
to determine which websites were
accessed for the subject of an
investigation this is real world sucks
guys have like some hardcore real world
than the fact then the fact the web for
it was conducted wirelessly is really
unimportant to the investigation except
perhaps the investigation was aided by
getting easy access to unencrypted
airborne packets wow it sounds like it
sounds like a disease an investigator
may choose to set a filter on the
resulting capture files that shows only
DNS requests in this way the
investigator can determine which
websites the subjects wish to visit and
then is able to visit those websites
himself later to determine the nature of
the website which is all this stuff okay
it just keeps going on and on this is
this scenario i will be going back to on
my own time already like why like I said
the beginning of the video is
titillating I'm telling you number 29
click the plus sign in front of the
political politoed that I teams and let
yourself familiar sighs you're familiar
sizing with the data use a scroll bar to
review all the data okay type a class I
on clock in there is a name typing a
class in
and they want to send make this thing
shot i don't think i'll be doing that
today okay so now we're moving on to
frame to this guy's just one frame run
wireshark for a few seconds and you have
the possibility of having a few thousand
of these freaking frames so what are we
doing frame to is water was conveying a
frame to rain cream cheese weasels to
meet you okay it looks so intimidating
movie I'm totally wrong okay what's just
military student if you want to expand
the fields here bringing details she
sounds a good details no I'll come to
these details put the plus sign is
beginning of the 80 2011 acknowledgments
and says notice of the receiver address
referring to last one in a serial is the
same as a transmitter address in frame
the swine well oh just kidding that's
nothing to be totally learned about I
don't stink click train three to display
the related data in the frame detail
panel alright that's cool step 34 dude I
promise realm of fun if necessary with a
plus sign in front of the main name
system response line to expand its fears
okay this is something I actually don't
know what they're talking about so
here's your frame details it's necessary
click the plus sign in front of the dns
why you're right being here enough fun
anywhere you see there it is there too
because it's necessary pull an
unnecessary and extend field check so
we're going to get this answer sing
click the puff fun I've heard of the
answers mon Dieu Stansfield
and then to details we go oh please
answer answers ok this is going to be
the big reveal I think because there's
39 steps for this lab here's the big
reveal oh that was sweet ok ok ok yeah
all right now put the plus sign a part
of each line in the answer section to
expand the field guys this is the climax
this is the climb and these field
detailed response the DNS queries
Dashiell many fields into the IP address
for prolific case what the heck is at
pollito pollito IEP which is where is it
where is it 130 at 192 at 73 dot one and
the other DNS information such as dns
time to live or the time before the dns
cache for this entry must be refreshed
of 23 hours 59 minutes 25 seconds and
the city two GL 2359 25 ok they wants to
say that we're not going to save it now
going through all that what we have four
times what the heck are we after time I
have no idea if we're going to be
blowing on I know it's dry stale
crackers and I'm telling you guys this
once you get over this and you see I
need some training on this too i've done
this lab and I mess with wireshark but I
usually don't do it I do it on a very
self I don't know what the word is
deviant level I'm just curious to see
what's going all out with different
routers and you know what the broadcast
is and all that silly and what's the 411
look what that's all I really want to
know I'm trying to ruin anybody's days
so our files is out now okay that part's
over we are going to quick sweater shirt
well then I'm going to quit now in this
part of the lab you will use netwitness
investigator to analyze you soon packet
capture files reviewed in part 1 because
Wireshark is available for free it is
often used for packet capture for some
initial analysis so basically what
they're saying is netwitness
investigator costs money but it also has
greater capabilities and is used by
people whose tool wire well how you
believe people who are senior and
skilled and actually know what they're
doing well thank you for calling you in
yet just kidding often investigators or
even clients with little training
capture need information information
with wireshark while a more in-depth
security focus analysis is later than
the net witness what they're saying is
true the basics you can use wireshark or
even like people who aren't necessarily
trained in IT forensics cyber forensics
whatever when i call it stretch my legs
golly i'm just like an old person like
what's falling asleep twice during this
tutorial that's professionals
double-click the net witness
investigator icons on the desktop should
open the application window and this is
what netwitness looks like the icon is
pretty it looks like two bowling pins so
now I can't really say for sure this is
version 9.5 point five point six I'll be
darned if I know what the current
version is possibly looks nothing like
this possibly looks just like this can't
say for sure that we are going to be
using investigator 9 function okay the
welcome screen and that witness
investigator displays a list of FA cues
and links to a YouTube channel yeah
right I gotta stillage it was seized mmm
yeah call this
you're a demonstrator as it was nice to
say okay enough doing diddly on the good
stuff or no one that wouldn't
investigate a menu select collection new
local collection and again according to
tool wire this net witness would be
something you would use either as a
special somebody who has a lot of skills
and it is an over Wireshark or sure
outlook lawyer a short and want to do
some more investigative stuff with it
some more in-depth detailed specialized
NSS so unfortunately I am not familiar
with this interface or this might be a
little clunky you thought Wireshark was
bad wait till we get to this one okay
we're going to do select collection
nukes local collections okay open what
are you looking for working for demo
capture and this demo capture is a
collection that was premium for us for
this lab no we're going to click ok so
they say creating a new local collection
is a shirt like creating a new file
folder with met with this Oh netwitness
investigators providing a place to put
the package from the demo capture file
this collection will appear in the left
pane okay garden suites the collection
pain of netwitness investigator now we
are double click query aiming for all of
they never replied ok and now because
it's ready we're gonna do collections
important packet okay I to Odin me now
you're importing the capture what man
don't mess with me doing what the heck
don't even go there what's going on
reinforces two months okay and have an
open chance what am i doing wrong don't
let them go faster
so we're going to start at this over
let's start afresh when I do demo
capture she opens okay ready okay I cook
another one okay now let's try it
collection in both packets boy dude
seriously why is this jamming me am I
going to feel looser and power down this
video well what a little wrong this is
not supposed to happen like this
double-click the demo capture in the
collection can select it and change his
status to rent oh okay when we start
again can you start over like a date
gone bad like I have food on my face I
just farted in the booth on a first date
and I sold a drink on you can we please
start over I'm 0 for 3 collection okay
import packet this I'm condo this is
good to know these things because i'm
probably going to be doing this sometime
in the near future doing training okay
collection in for practice open dialog
box with the desktop this is the desktop
on the virtual machine and we're going
to be looking for demos capture file so
we'll put the devil capture file I
created in step there oh my god I didn't
save it okay it's always okay guys we're
gonna we're going to flip the script
here is there a way to open this water
truck back up so we need a way to focus
you're going to go why was that not
showing up would they want me to save it
as we're just going to save this as a
sink okay we're gonna save it flushes
save as
we're following step 37 we're going to
go desktop TCP dump with xtina like
wireshark solo again any order single
focus see if it work Domo temperature
and it's going to save Thanks now we're
going to open up a little investigators
now my collection already made that's
good it's ready now we're going to
import a fat import packets the file
would I just theoretically see you just
according to use this one with a new
Demma cultured that can chat and energy
guys there's a way to save it liar chart
or preferred format for netwitness true
try it let's try it come on why not sick
person to come on don't don't don't
don't do this to don't see you soon
we're going to open this and we're going
to try and save it as a file if that's
friendly towards netwitness can I see
that option here no want me to save as a
TCP dump okay so when you save this so
important to netwitness we're going to
name it real soft candy is a dodo
extinct go go go go no we've been
looking out of here try this on you so
if I a lot about this stuff if you keep
failing really personally don't ever go
to anything that's related to computer
don't be afraid to look like an idiot
either if you're afraid if you're afraid
to be viciously trolled won't go into IT
and certainly don't do videos demo
collection ready we're going to import
see already I'm already doing it without
thinking this is a good thing and look
this automatic recognize it because I
stick it did it has a TCP dog tcp them
it's getting kind of not really click
Save ok so now guys are finally back
into this so now what so important okay
it's important what I just saved in
wireshark and we're going to do some
intense analysis as soon as this server
this virtual machine is doing the same
in supporting a nine percent pretty
funny carolee tillage okay it's ready
and now we're going to double click it
push step 7 oh so now okay I ask you is
doing up it ran this netwitness just ran
a report
on the packet capture i was looking at
in wireshark so this is awesome this is
awesome because look email addresses and
it has three of them it captured in
wireshark is just right is this is this
correct the package we must capture file
is it now as the net witness and all of
the reports generated by netwitness
displayed in the right pane you scroll
bar is necessary to view the complete
list the first thing you may notice is
that net witness reports is that while
you will not find any of the low-level
wireless information such as command and
control you'll find the kind of
sophisticated analysis that requires
some work to accomplish with and where
sharks is awesome mated like netwitness
Forgan since the layer to mac addresses
which in this case our Ethernet and
layer 3 IP addresses are available in
both lawyers for Kinect witness but you
will not from the transmitter and
receiver addresses and net with me what
you will find evening that witnesses
information with a geographic location
the transmitter and receiver which when
plotted on Google first can aid in the
investigation okay guys I just want to
try out the video i know this video is
going on but going through this in this
fashion is a prime example of the
importance of doing it just like this
because in my brain right now sing i'm
starting to create ok I've done this lab
before I'm doing it again and it's
clicking how powerful Wireshark in
conjunction with netwitness investigator
even on a basic level can be because
what I just did was important
information and this meant witness made
it automated so that I can slot on
Google Earth the locations of the
transmitter and each Cesar that's
freakin awesome now I'm going to stop
drooling and see exactly how to do that
you should also notice that we're both
tools provide the same information such
as a day and that's requested to feels
different how information is subscribe
perfect ok so what I meant by how to do
that is that I need to know where to
find it where they were talking about
like where's the lair to mac address
so we can plot some stuff do they tell
us your available multi-layer to mac
address which in this case our Ethernet
ok so we're focusing for Ethernet
something funny oh yes you actually you
can ok ethernet protocol bulb oh my god
and I don't know who developed this net
witness and I don't know how much it is
I'm curious should I google it be in
another video whoops how did that happen
how do I have a pass ok Google back
there's a lot of stuff to look at world
email addresses so what I'm gathering is
that you see now addresses suit come on
des is something this week will be full
user accounts without service place our
psyche destination I have seen user
accounts ok user account funds in order
this little church John sample and
Bobby's make anything about Bobby's
which is soon as the report wow this is
wild okay in a service type report could
see announced to drill down you further
information about the DNS requests okay
so where was that they're trying to get
me do where's the service page report
gonna stop
I love it we're going to open up them
election again you know and try and find
service report now you looking for men
find on here very good support this is
not rely tutorial it's more of like less
explores real tough candies the arch of
two and a half hour video for little
nuggets like going to a grateful dead
show you know you spent four hours there
three is three hours and 45 minutes you
never remember what actually happened
because you remind on true but there's
like 15 minutes weren't all clips and
your life's beautiful kind of like a
mini version of a grateful dead concert
right now for me anyway I don't already
feel that where the hell is a service
type report here it is some time just
going to ask the computer where
something is click it dns to drill down
again click this and by drilling down
the one that follows a dms label
wonderful is have been saving boom i'm
getting all sourcing off in here one
that follow the dns i will indicate that
there is only one VMS request in this
packet capture file the next steps to
investigate the CMS request and compare
the results against the Wireshark
findings want to do a screen capture
this is just for like the lab actual
song deliverables either from the
deliverable so much any feeling them but
this is pretty much the end of the line
for comparing these 15 that's wonderful
DC and unflavored office frustrating so
frustrating is just because these tools
are so in depth nothing really shouting
l as a beginner so
very important for these things there is
this one I'm not gonna take up anywhere
guys this time you guys get gist of
exploring these things the importance of
it oh crap yr wireshark and that would
net witness investigator I can speak i'm
so excited used in conjunction I can
really see how powerful and these things
are and the places they were a seer
unfortunately I can't add anything more
I'm still learning like you all but I
hope this video was helpful if you don't
have access to net witness or maybe
you're interested in you know how
network that witness a wire sharp
interactive and the capabilities of net
witness and just going through the steps
you know these steps unfortunately I
said unless you're enrolled in college
accredited university it sets for us a
legitimate institution of learning yours
there's plenty to none other ways and
accessing this is that tutorial but you
know me yes you really make you go
through it and not skip because if you
skip things you don't hit them thinks
back here if you skip things you're
going to get the goings going back and
forth and back and forth when looking to
move and very mom enough that way guys
thanks for watching we will see you in
the next video hope this video was
enlightening rock on and this next
Grateful Dead song for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
