tough candy calm back in the saddle with
you today we are over at Flatiron school
calm this is a coding bootcamp
based out east in New York City to be
exact and I was just browsing and I saw
they had this bootcamp prep available
full free if it's free it's me I don't
know about you guys but you guys know if
you've been watching this channel I like
to explore different resources and find
those resources that really stick out
whether it's getting a great value great
curriculum ideally both of those plus
some support from an authority figure
people who have been doing it for a
while who are eager to help beginners
and eager learners so whether you're a
beginner beginner intermediate beginner
advanced beginner or even crossed over
to that intermediate stage this might be
able to help you so like I said I just
discovered this I haven't really signed
up so I'm gonna go and sign up and then
I'll come back and restart this video we
can explore what it's all about so let's
just check this out and I'll stop the
vid $3000 struck through it is free for
the first 500 students the program runs
at our community based online campus
learned on Co 60 to 75 hours instructors
available to guide you along the way no
scheduled learning your own pace and no
prereqs or prior experience required
guys this is hitting all of the sweet
spots okay every bullet point here is
something like ooh I did that I dig that
especially instructors because a lot of
these places are I don't like to call
them the blind leading the blind even
though you know you're co-learners
probably know a lot of course they there
are many people out there who are
learning with you who do know more than
you and can help you but to really have
an authority figure to say no this is
actually how it is this is how it's done
in the industry and this is the best
practice that's is a cut above
so these bullet points are mostly all
all of them are cut above especially
pleased that free from three grand we'll
see about that
so I'm going to go ahead and fire this
up and we'll see what we're working with
alright guys I'm back all I had to do
was throw in my email
and I am good to go no gimmicks I'm kind
of a little skeptical but this is pretty
cool so they ask you what best describes
your programming background I learned
the basics somewhere else I haven't
built my own small app yet working on
that object-oriented programming
professional developer what kind of boot
camp program are you interested in you
know if you can give you a suite online
remote program for free I'd be
interested in that but I can't add
comments so we'll stick with online
let's get started
little karma points programming is
awesome so we have some information here
just trying to get us familiar with the
interface I'm done finished reading next
lesson let's get to the meat of what we
are working with to see how they
actually so this is still the intro we
want to get you the meat to see how they
actually test us and see how we can get
some feedback from people and just
explore the base my browser is not
supported why don't these coding
bootcamp support Safari I'm verklempt I
can't even speak like this is the second
out of two pulls it
none of them support Safari know that
like the the ones that are most popular
these boot camps the last one what was
it a hack reactor I can't remember it
was a quote-unquote prestigious boot
camp was like we don't support Safari
please use Chrome oh my god well we're
just gonna have to push through until
something breaks so they're talking
about the command-line interface and the
graphical user interface okay so so good
stuff for beginner beginners and again
guys a lot of this stuff may seem
obvious but when you're first starting
out this stuff is gold everyone started
from scratch whether they were two years
old or 20 or 50 or 60 or even older
everyone learns this if they're in the
business one way or the other it's great
that it's free and it's great that it's
presented here so that's what I will say
about that I just I'm trying to get to
some food okay so they're like you gonna
create you don't finish this but I want
to see where is like the outline here
download oh they want us okay okay so
the objectives in that Latin they have
labs okay that's cool
run the labs tests with the learn CLI
command okay okay okay okay
so let's say let's say you want to ask a
question Oh
learn that Co does not like me that's
fine I don't know if I like it shows our
little mutual here but let's say I
wanted to ask the question what's this
complete all of the lesson complete all
at the Lassen's complete all the lessons
and welcome to learn to unlock one
community on slack I heard it was slack
I haven't used it as a little
intimidated okay so here's ask a
question of the community but one of
their bullet points was that you could
ask teachers not fellow koehlers again
Mico learners probably know a lot I know
there are people working on these things
who do know a lot but I want it from the
mouths of babes you know I'm saying
straight from the authority figure who
knows best practice who do I want to get
flamed oh dude no no no no no I mustn't
I mustn't I must take a few more minutes
to do this
well my browser isn't supported guys I'm
not submitting oh my god how do I get
rid of this I have absolutely negative
ten karma right now no doubt about it so
let's see if we can find some curriculum
I'm having catastrophic Jam due to my
browser but switching over to Chrome I
mean that's a big commitment that's like
asking someone that's like taking
someone's hand in marriage like I'm not
ready for that are you let's see okay
okay here we go so here is welcome to
learn this is this module eight steps
they they say it's gonna take 32 minutes
I say yeah right probably an hour to an
hour and a half for me I mean I could
guys don't get me wrong I could blow
through this in 16 minutes if I had to
but to actually comprehend and have this
stuff stick and review it not gonna take
32 minutes so they want you to download
and install the IDE sign in and submit
your pull request okay so they're
training you to learn github and get
let's go to the next lesson here or is
it okay yeah they're like we're not
gonna let you see the goodies until you
do the basics fair enough okay guys so
that is the basic intro again this is a
free course I can't really give a grade
right now because it's just like you
know getting something for free and
saying it's awesome just because it's
free hey if it's free you're still
investing your time in it and this might
end up being a waste of time I'm not
sure yet
so I'm gonna explore this it might be a
good resource I like to use I have my
backbone for JavaScript but as far as
diversifying my resources something I
like doing I hope this video was helpful
again just giving you a preview of the
Flatiron Schools three little prep sixty
five ish hours or so and we just showed
the welcome and getting started part of
that and it's free so sign up first five
hundred people get themselves a free
education alright guys we'll see you the
next video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
