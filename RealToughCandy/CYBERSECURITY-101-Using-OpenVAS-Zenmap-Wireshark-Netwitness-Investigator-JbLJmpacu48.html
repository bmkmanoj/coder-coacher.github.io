candy back in the saddle today with you
we are doing a reconnaissance and
probing mission using common tools by
common tools we're talking about open
source stuff that is available free of
charge to put on your personal machine
it might be a long lab today we are
working with some really cool
technologies all killer no filler at
least maybe a little bit of filler here
and there for taste but mostly protein
in this lab I'm gonna be sticking
largely to the script just because these
tool wire labs are pretty to the point
they're pretty accurate short but yet
important that's the winning combination
so without further ado let's go through
what we're working with today is for far
as tools and software girl we're gonna
be working with FileZilla net witness
investigator which we worked with on the
last cyber security 101 video open boss
which is a vulnerability the
vulnerability scanner some putty action
some tftpd 64 stuff we're gonna be using
Wireshark and Zen map so let's talk
about what we want to learn today after
doing this lab with you guys we're gonna
be able to explore the common network
scanning and analysis tool so on your
own you hopefully will be able to you
know if not know exactly how to use them
at least know how to explore them
because exploration in these products is
actually it's a learning process so
we're gonna be able to perform network
recon and probe on the machines in the
virtual security cloud lab which you
know applies to your machine as well not
just the virtual security cloud lab
we're gonna be able to use Zen map to
perform an intense scan on an entire sub
Network in this case it's 1:7 2.30 0.0 /
24 we're gonna be able to create a fish
eye bubble chart to explain the
relationships between devices on a
network this is really cool and finally
explain how attackers use common network
scanning and analysis tools to
compromise networks such
well what your shark goes nmap and so on
so let me read you this introduction
because like I said tool wire is real
good at this and I couldn't have said it
better myself to be good at their job
hackers and cyber criminals do not need
to understand everything about how a
network how networks work or how they
are vulnerable to attack
all they really need to know is one
vulnerability or how to use one
automated tool that attacks that
vulnerability and you got as I'm reading
this keep in mind you need to have a
hacker mindset so think like a bad guy
trust me it's fun defenders on the other
hand need to have a comprehensive
knowledge of networks and networking
protocols so what they're saying in this
section is that if you're a bad guy you
don't need to know as much as the good
guy defenders also need to understand
how to identify and test for
vulnerabilities and computer systems
routers switches firewalls and other
network devices they need to find and
close as many vulnerabilities as
possible as soon as possible
hackers traditionally follow a five-step
approach to seek out and compromise
targeted hosts at this point I highly
recommend typing what I'm saying because
this is important they use this
five-step approach includes
reconnaissance scanning vulnerability
analysis also known as enumeration
exploitation which is the actual attack
and finally the post attack activities
including remediation of the
vulnerabilities the first step
reconnaissance begins with identifying
the target and learning as much as
possible about the target during the
reconnaissance phase hackers scan and
network to identify IP host open ports
and services enabled on servers and
workstations so again I kind of
summarize this when we define our
learning objectives but let's just go
through it again in this lab we're going
to explore the common tools available in
the virtual lab environment which is
this you will use Wireshark to capture
and analyze network traffic suite use
open Foss to scan the network review a
sample collection of data using net
Witness investigator which I found out
yesterday guys lately
tonight that this is free where their
term not mine it's free download for
personal use connect to remote Windows
machine and Explorer to file transfer
applications FileZilla and tftpd 64 you
will use putty to connect to a Linux
machine and run several Cisco commands
to display statistics for the network
interfaces
finally you will use Zen map to perform
a scan of the network and create the
network topology chart and there are
four parts to this lab exploration using
putty using Zen map and if it's on if
assigned by your instructor explore the
virtual environment on your own whoo
let's get to it guys the world's second
largest maybe third intro but I'm
telling you all this stuff so basic and
so important to know so again what are
we doing today
performing reconnaissance and probing
using common tools thinking like a
hacker destroying the system what's not
to like so they do note that I should be
following these procedures as written
number one we're gonna double-click the
common lab tasks I think this is just
how to use the Windows Server virtual
machine and so on yeah this is just the
academic portion that I don't need to
concern myself with and for those just
tuning in and didn't see my last video
this these tool wire labs I'm taking an
online course on network security and
this is the lab portion so unfortunately
you'll probably have to enroll in a
college or credit university an IT
program in order to access these labs
and even then it's not guaranteed I know
a few schools that do implement these
labs hit me up private message or in the
comment box and I'll let you know how a
private message preferred so let's go to
Part 1 explore the tools using the
virtual lab environment so we're gonna
start it off we're gonna kick off
Wireshark and again as I explained in
the last video on this virtual machine
Wireshark is version 1 point 10
on here I think the current version is
2.0 let's go to my local machine here
let's see what we are working with I
think it's 2.0 2.5 2.0 2.5 is what I'm
working with on my local machine and
then on the virtual we have version one
point ten point five so pretty outdated
but the interaction and what you're
gonna be doing is nearly the same the
graphics are a little different the
layout it's smidgen different but the
operation is nearly identical if not
totally identical okay we're gonna
maximize this while you're Shrek window
here and feel free to follow along if
you have Wireshark no matter what the
version all of these like I said are
here somewhere
the rules and instructions so we're
gonna maximize this packet sniffer also
known as a protocol analyzer tool and
now we have some shortcuts here we have
the capture capture help files an online
and we're gonna be focusing I think on
capturing students in the inner capture
option so they want me to go there okay
we're gonna edit this and we're gonna
capture in promiscuous mode that means
ok cool that tells us what this is
usually a network adapter will only
capture the traffic sent to its own
network address if you want to capture
all traffic that the network adapter can
see mark this option how can I want to
see all the traffic that's where the fun
stuff is so make sure that promiscuous
mode is checked let me just show you on
my local machine what that looks like
because this does look different like I
said the functionality is the same but
you're gonna select your capture what
you want to capture and then you're
gonna go up here to probably can't see
it but you're gonna go to capture and
then options excuse me and then just see
that promiscuous let's say it's disabled
this is what got me it was kind of
confusing
so it's like oh how do i how do i change
it you just double click it and then the
arrow comes up so we're and just unable
and then you would start it but since
this is my local machine we're gonna
close it and go back here capture
packets in promiscuous mode check and as
I say down here promiscuous mode allows
Wireshark to capture packets again guest
into in
host on the same subnet or VLAN very
important very important Wireshark
would only capture packets to and from
the virtual workstation ie what I'm
using right now if promiscuous mode was
unchecked so if you want the good stuff
click promised get promiscuous it's the
only time you will hear that said in a
positive way click OK to close the Edit
interface settings window we're gonna
okay that everything looks hunky-dory
now we are going to start the capture
process and I noticed in this one point
10.5 or maybe it's because I'm on a
virtual machine is that there is no live
capturing whereas on my local machine
with the updated version of Wireshark
ICI live capturing which is pretty sweet
you know you capture a thousand frames
in a few seconds it's whoo it's a
cascade of wonder so we're gonna click
OK we click start and now we're gonna
generate some more traffic cool because
right now you see I'm not doing much and
I think it's just me on this connection
I'm not really sure how to wire who do
these labs have set this up haven't
investigated that so we're gonna
generate some more traffic through the
server the virtual server here and now
we're gonna go run we are gonna run
command to open up what do they call it
in window is not terminal what is this
little box called the windows version of
terminal whatever it is and we're open
up command prompted uh so we're gonna
ping our IP just 1 7 2.30 dot 0 10 and I
think there's a glitch on this because
normally it would start capturing but
watch it watch it go away after like 4
pings ok or not
oh sweet ok so the reason this wasn't
showing any traffic was because nothing
was actually going on now since I pinned
it these pings
as you see here show up and darn near
real-time so
what is the command for pinging on a
Windows machine what do they do oh it's
just ok let's ping it again 1 7 2.30 0.1
oh now I'm gonna hit enter here and you
will see as soon as I hit enter there's
gonna be some frames popping up some
packets and this is actually recording
this ping in real time how cool is that
ok and we did that twice I didn't say to
do it twice but I just wanted to
illustrate some now on the command
prompt we are going to type exits hit
enter and it should go away boom cool so
as they explained in the lab here
Wireshark has captured the ping traffic
as packets using the ICMP protocol which
you can see right here in the protocol
category which ICMP stands for Internet
control message protocol because what
were we doing just now sending messages
number 11 make a screenshot we'll just
do it this is I think just for the
academic portion but hey why not we're
gonna close the Wireshark window and
we're gonna quit without saving man
never a good idea I always save my
packet my my sessions on there just to
go over it when I'm bored and be like oh
try and try and find patterns and you
know stuff like that but they don't want
us to save this time so now we're gonna
double-click the net witness
investigator which it looks like bowling
pins here the two little white bowling
pins so as a lab explains net witnessed
investigator allows analysts to view and
analyze packets collected by
applications such as Wireshark what
Wireshark offers a deep dive into
individual packets net witness offers a
high-level view that can be stored and
compared to newer packet captures to
help identify any new threats or
problems you can see how useful these
two tools are together so we're gonna
maximize the net Witness investigator 9
no idea what the current version is on
net witness
investigator would be interesting to
find out though so now we're going to
double click this demo collection to see
how net Witness investigator collects
and presents traffic types and security
events sounds pretty straightforward
right so it's now thinking and it has
identified three items that might be
possible might be a possible threat to
the network in the alert one two three
so this lab the tool wire has kind of
fabricated these actual threats because
you know malware sucks
real real malware anyway it's a sample
vulnerability we have so this program
has identified at three of these and it
specified the source and destination IP
and even recognized the user account
that's pretty freaking cool Bobby and
John sample and saw over here probably
gonna have a word with their boss if
their in-house so we see this what I
want so if we click this just out of
curiosity what's john sample up to he's
being a bad baby
can we actually click on that no we
click on that
no well I'm sure the answer awaits us
further on so now they want us to close
it they're just illustrating here what
this has identified as threats in the
network and the alert is just getting us
familiar
we didn't import anything from Wireshark
I don't think we did anyway
what's this collection exit well what
the heck windows server why do you hate
me so Windows Server 2012 r2 is what
we're working with in case you haven't
noticed so now they just wanted to get
us familiar with the net witness
investigator and show us the
vulnerabilities that net witness has
witnessed so now we're gonna go ahead
and close that we're gonna move on to
the open boss so open vollis which i
don't have a lot of experience with so
this should be fun and I don't know why
this is selecting like seven different
applications so we're gonna double click
on the open boss
wait for it
the server is initializing lab notes
that open Voss performs remote scans and
audit audits of UNIX windows and network
infrastructures and can perform a
network discovery of devices os's
application databases and services
running on those devices it will take
five minutes before open Voss is ready
to use
that's Andy so then theoretically in
another four and a half minutes if we
are prompted with the security security
certificate warning we're gonna click
continue
not recommended okay so this is an
example of when it's gonna take some
actual critical thinking rather than
just following a checklist if you want
to continue or not because normally when
it says not recommended and you see a
big red X usually means stop do not
proceed you're gonna be screwed if you
click on this however in the right
circumstance you're gonna have to trust
your gut / not trust your gut and click
continue to this website even though
it's not recommended and then
theoretically again once the server's
initialize we're just gonna log in using
the default open boss admin password etc
let's take a look let's take a little
preview at the end map Zen map or Zen
map which is the GUI for nmap I don't
know why I keep selecting like five apps
this is quite bothersome troubling okay
so this is we're gonna where we're going
to be doing eventually in a few minutes
here our fisheye bubble and let me tell
you that is fun it's gonna be over here
Sarat there it it for sure nothing is
produced quite yet because we don't have
any scans or anything no real
information to plug in there but this is
the thing I'm gonna tell you something I
don't have a lot of experience with any
of these tools
but one thing that's really helping me
to even get the confidence to do this
type of video is the fact that I mess
around with them sure I don't understand
85 90 percent of stuff that goes on in
here
I really don't but as they noticed if
you're a bad guy you don't have to
however I'm not a bad guy so I need to
learn that additional 85 90 percent of
what's going on in here because if
you're working in any sort of IT
security capacity whether it's for the
federal government whether it's for any
kind of government private institution a
school university doesn't matter you're
gonna need to know or at least start off
if you're you know a junior you're gonna
have to know about all of this stuff in
some basic capacity and eventually
you're gonna have to know about all of
it in an advanced capacity if you plan
on staying for more than a few years
when you become more eligible for the
senior positions so what is my point
these things are open source let's go
back don't forget what step are we on
we're on step 19 so in this intro it
tells you you're using filezilla you're
using that witness investigator open
Voss putty tftpd 64 Wireshark ins n map
get familiar with them that's what I'll
tell you what doing programming to in
JavaScript just going over and over and
over even though I don't understand it
just get the terms down try to
understand where things are if you're
using sublime which is a text editor
beautiful text editor I might add if
you're interested in programming you
will be inspired by a sublime the text
is all kinds of different colors
depending on what you know you're coding
it's it's beautiful and it makes you
want to create and once you get familiar
with it it's like okay this isn't so
scary once you get familiar with stuff
is what I'm saying when you get familiar
with it
it's less intimidating and it's
inspiring because it makes you want to
do things it makes you want to create
things and discover things and make
things better
the
I can say you guys that was my fuel we
were waiting at this point I highly
recommend you grab a caffeinated
beverage of your choice
mmm Selina you can't see her but she's
here come here come here you want to
code code alert cyber security all right
Selina meet the Internet
Selina is the resident tech cat here
Selina get off get off the computer
Selina Selina get off the thing nope
okay well okay
Selina your magic you made it work there
is a problem with this website security
certificate every other thing I was
telling you about use you have to flip
the script here get off of the script
and use critical thinking skills because
we're trying to login to this open open
boss thing but they're telling us don't
do it I know it's a choice we all must
make in our lives but you must Nick this
fun and we are on Green bone security
assistant which is the home screen for
logging in to open the boss where are we
step 19 right so we're gonna be using
some default stuff I don't know if this
is default looks like it to me open boss
admin if this isn't default this is
actually someone's username and password
holy what are you doing in cyber
security login um no not for this site
don't start oh hello we're gonna
maximize the green Bowl and security
assistant window such okay in the IP
address or hostname box at the right of
the window type 1 7 2 2 32 0.10 that's
what we have been working with that is
ass virtual machine
170 2.3 0.2 0.1 Oh
we're gonna start the scan ok before we
do let's just take a moment
to practice what I've been preaching
about getting familiar with the home
screens the functionality even if you
don't know what the heck it is so that
start a new task wizard helped has
returned download probably export XML
okay always helpful and then this little
girl here holding some kind of magic
wand some Harry Potter stuff near new
user
welcome to expose powerful app and to
have a quick start for doing things the
first time I am here to assist you with
some hints and shortcuts I will appear
automatically at areas where you've
created no or only a few objects and
disappear when you have more than three
you can call me with this icon at any
time man I don't have to pay for it what
world am i living in for more detailed
information on functionality try the
integrated help system available as a
context-sensitive link as icon question
mark sweet so let's start the scan
Selena Selena is getting activated okay
did we start the scanner what okay so
we're doing the immediate scan of our IP
address the status is requested it seems
to be doing its thing so now it says we
can click the refresh button in the
filter toolbar filled your toolbar I
believe this is this it's refreshing
every 30 seconds when the scan is
finished the table below the filter tool
will show a done button next to the name
of the scan immediate scan okay 1% well
guys I don't have enough material to
fill this portion for the next 99% of
the scan in other words I might have to
pause this video and come back once the
scan is done so until that finished
report populates the table continued to
periodically check the refresh button
the scan will take about 4 minutes to
complete ok so now we have a no auto
refresh man come on I want every 30
seconds and you can choose every 10
seconds every 60 seconds
so we'll do every 30 seconds perfect and
then when this is done they want us to
click the immediate scan MIP r.i.p here
what they want us to click this and
we're gonna get a summary I'm actually I
did this slab the first time a few
months back actually over the summer and
I've forgotten what's inside this
wonderful little report here and as you
see up here see this is something you
just the uncondition yourself I don't
know if that makes sense condition
yourself not to be concerned with this
certificate error I'd be interested in
seeing why this does this in the first
place green bow and security assistance
seems to be a trusted site trusted
application so I don't know what that's
about is there anything we can do in the
meanwhile this is refreshing let's go
down here and see so when this is done
we're gonna be what are we gonna be
doing getting way too far ahead of
myself so we're gonna be doing the scan
when the scan is done we're gonna check
it out and then we're gonna open the
Remote Desktop folder oh we got some
Remote Desktop action coming out that's
pretty cool and then we're gonna doing
some defaults which is they're not gonna
tell you here but I'm telling you if you
work if you work for any organization
that has this as a username and this as
a password please do something about it
your life is going to be hell it might
happen today it might happen next year
but there are people and BOTS botnets
and continuously on the lookout for
stuff like this heck there are
co-workers continuously on the lookout
for stuff like that well it's not
refreshing so what is the status on this
am i getting jammed is this machine
jamming me is there anything we can do
so I'm curious what is the final endgame
with this scan of the 172 dot
0:10 again which is I'm gonna minimize
this which is this virtual Windows
server so weird it open Moscow please
don't tell me that I've screwed this up
perfect okay so maybe first of all the
Internet Explorer come on to a wire
that's not cool
Google or Firefox come on it's the only
way to go so I'm trying to figure out
okay first of all we need to get our
status here what is our status it says
refresh these are a different way to
refresh it see the refresh button in the
filter toolbar oh oh wow it's at 98%
okay guys you won't have to stop the
video this is pretty cool thanks for
sticking along with this you have any
questions any horror stories I want to
hear some horror stories about default
logins because I do little computer work
here and there by no means anything
advanced but you know most people don't
know the basics and that's how you can
make some good side money especially
because people are desperate when they
can't log on to the internet or somebody
or something has taken control of their
machine I have a lot of not so funny
stories of people not really knowing how
things work on the router especially the
router not knowing the importance of a
solid password or not knowing the
importance of you know changing default
oh my gosh I might even make a video of
like top 10 of stories that people of
people just I don't know it's too bad I
don't think they want to be ignorant
it's just that they weren't shown a
better way the biggest thing for me
though that I've discovered in people's
accounts being compromised it's not
social engineering at least where I live
and people who I work with and the
organization's I work with but people
afraid to customize
their credentials in other words not
bothering to change the defaults which
are easily found by googling or easily
found by just guessing brute-force
brute-force guessing so we're at 98%
this is a good thing
should i bum rush the immediate scan we
were doing so well
98% not just stopped okay so when the
scan is finished the table below the
filter tool will show a done button next
the name of the scan okay so probably
underneath the status it's still running
I want to explore some of these things
second Foam management this is the one
thing the green bone security assistant
open boss I don't know if this well it's
open boss so it's open source so it must
be free of charge with the green bone
security assistant does anyone know
about this is this like the parent
company or they partner with open boss
or what's a deal so we're still running
at 98 it's that darn 2% scan management
overrides no it's new tasks tasks asset
management we have host second phone
management every TC the ECP ease all
definitions okay so a pretty robust
front page here with lots of options
settings and performance admin panel
Help section configuration can do
filters schedules report formats slaves
agents
lots of stuff to explore this report
better have some good stuff in it that's
all I'm saying
let's refresh okay ooh I think we're
getting somewhere
medium threat okay I think it's done I
think it's done guys let's just doesn't
say down under here done yep so in order
this really doesn't tell us much it's a
blue bar big whopping deal but if you
hover over it it says done so today is
at 28th that's good I'm going to be a
messed with and the threat is medium
let's see what's going on
yes okay so I clicked it the scan
configuration was full and fast we did a
target for immediate scan of my IP
address address it is done so where do I
look at it this report summary appears
at the bottom of the window notice that
host open box stores the date and time
of the report so here are my actions
compare details okay I'm pretty sure we
want to see the details so if you click
on it we'll see the details it's not
only telling us much okay so where are
threats
let's okay start up here so to expand
this okay so our medium threats here are
security issues reported for our IP
address for the server we have three
medium threats and the way I access this
it's not gonna show up right away but
the way I did that was hit the
magnifying glass you can't see it on
this page or this panel but the previous
one you could okay so let's see what we
have the first one is that the DCE
service is running on the remote hose
can be enumerated by connecting on port
1 the 135 and doing the appropriate
queries an attacker may use this fact to
gain more knowledge about the remote
host and then they give you a solution
to filter incoming traffic to this port
okay so I'm illustrating the point here
again that you know I don't know what
the heck DCE
services actually are but I know they're
running on port 135 and I need to filter
incoming traffic to this port because
hackers can use that this poor to gain
more knowledge about the remote remote
host I don't want them in that part next
threat DCE
running on remote host can be enumerated
and attacker okay
so then they have more ports here that
we need to do something about look at
all these port
there are quite a few and the solution
is to filter incoming traffic to these
ports and then finally my guess is that
okay I thought it's gonna be the same
thing but it's not the the issue now
here is TCP timestamps and the impact of
timestamps is that uptime of remote
hosts can sometimes be computed okay and
special IP packets are forged and sent
with a little delay in between the
target IP two responses their search for
a timestamp you found the timestamps are
reported so basically hackers can get
their paws on your TCP timestamps and
here is the solution obviously disable
the timestamps and here are some support
through Microsoft ask a boss if you
don't know how to do this so that was
pretty cool yeah we waited four or five
minutes but imagine me imagine having to
do this manually I wouldn't know where
to start one thing I've learned doing
cybersecurity exercises and labs and one
thing I've learned doing coding whether
it's JavaScript html5 even Python even
Java you don't do everything from
scratch okay there's a reason there's
the built-in alert method in JavaScript
you just type alert with parenthesis and
put in your string you're not creating
everything from scratch there's
frameworks there's people have who have
built on this technology don't be afraid
trust me no one's a stud in this
industry so don't try and be a stud
don't be a hero rely on this stuff
that's trustworthy and that has you know
it's been built upon not all of its
trustworthy you know what I'm saying
though so we're all done looking at this
so we're gonna close this power it down
boom let's go on to our remote desktop
right now is a good time to ingest some
caffeine yeah buddy we're gonna open up
the RDP folder remote desktop remote
desktops are fun oh are they ever fun so
we're gonna double click the target
window oh one file which is this one
target Windows as compared to Linux
dot remote desktop and now we're gonna
login to the remote desktop once it
prompts us so this is pretty cool I'm on
a virtual server right now a virtual
machine and about to login to remote
desktop I do not want to automatically
connect to my television that's a bad
idea okay it's still thinking FileZilla
I think we probably minimize about did
it log me in okie dokie I was not
prompted to use these sign ins using a
password and then okay we know we're on
a remote because we have our machine up
here IP address of the remote machine
FileZilla server application is open on
the server and it's you FileZilla is
used to transfer files using the FTP
using FTP File Transfer Protocol to and
from the virtual workstation so in other
words I'm on my remote desktop and
FileZilla is gonna help me take the
files on my remote desktop and put them
on my virtual workstation so what do
they want me to do
there really wasn't anything to do here
we're gonna close the remote Windows
connection why why do I want me to do
that okay doink they said that's what it
says right alright see ya bye so we
found our remote desktop easy peasy
lemon squeezy and now we're gonna open
up tftpd 64 for some ftp action sweet
okay so tftpd 64 which is ten times
harder to say than FileZilla it's the
same thing almost of FileZilla it's
another file transfer application and
this one allows files to be shared
without the overhead ftp so this
application establishes one desktop as a
TFTP server
which is the senator and the other as a
client which is the receiver so now we
are on the server interface here and
we're gonna select one seven 2.39 0.2
which was the address if you remember
from the virtual workstation desktop so
what was it 1 7 2.30 we're gonna we used
to go just navigate down here 170 2.30
done 0.2 boom and that matches the
machine ok and now the reason we're
gonna select this is because we want to
establish this machine as the server in
a file transfer all right we don't have
to do anything because we've selected
our interface we're good to go
we are good to go and now we're gonna go
into part two alright everyone take a
deep breath congratulations you just
walk through Wireshark net witness open
boss tftpd 64 another caffeine break hmm
so joyous are we having fun damn right
you're having fun just kidding it's not
really kidding
double-click on the RDP folder on the V
station if you workstation okay let me
preface this connecting to a Linux
machine now again this video is for
basics basic beginners there's different
levels of beginners but this is for
basic beginners maybe even intermediate
beginners because well I admit all these
programs with one video can be a little
overwhelming
consider it a little buffet of network
applications and analyzers the virtual
ok so let's talk a little bit about in
Linux some tools are only available on
Linux machines
unlike Windows most Linux interactions
take place from the command line rather
than an application the virtual
environment offers two ways to connect
to the Linux terminal a remote desktop
connection and putty in the next steps
you will explore both options okay so
we're gonna double click on the remote
desktop folder and we're gonna open this
folder we're gonna
click we're gonna go to Linux now we're
gonna go to the remote desktop in Linux
problem connecting ok not cool not cool
well maybe not so again really excuse my
French but really shitty login
credentials here username student
password student but this is the
training environment I guess they want
you to break things ok
and now the Linux remote desktop opens
and our IP here for this machine is 170
2.30 does 0.11 notice how different this
Linux desktop looks from Windows I've
dabbled in Ubuntu and you know I'm not
quite there yet I definitely appreciate
it don't get me wrong but it's a totally
different beast it's incredible an
incredible platform incredible OS and
quite handy but I'm not quite there yet
so we double click on that and then now
ok we typed our credentials great
perfect click applications so we're
gonna go right up here and now we're
gonna go to accessories and we're gonna
go to terminal which is the same thing
in a Mac that command-line interface and
we open this command shell and many
linux commands requires super user
access sometimes you'll see like in
tutorial is like the sudo that's why the
super user is super user is su and the
DOE is due so su do sudo su do I say
studio sudo don't know whatever floats
your boat
Mini Linux commands require super user
ok so we're gonna do super user because
that's what it requires password is tor
tipo are your results may vary so we are
logged in as root ok people
let me just timeout and tell you I know
this video is going on but I'm telling
you this is protein and you need to be
familiar with this stuff even I as an
advanced beginner I'm telling you once
you see this root
the world is your oyster the world is
your pearl as well because this route is
gonna get you places so we're logged in
as root we're logged in it's a Linux
Debian machine with super user access
what more could you want
the command prompt has changed route at
target Linux oh one home student perfect
we're gonna type is to see a list of the
directories in this home folder okay LS
my bad why are we typing is I was like
is if I make a sense LS LS for list boom
desktop downloads pictures on and on and
on awesome so you can see these
directories cool beans we're not gonna
do anything with any things I'm not
gonna do anything so we're just gonna
press type in exit go ahead enter we've
exited a super user access so now we're
gonna get we're gonna get on out of this
terminal show and be on our way so that
was a very fast and dirty introduction
to Linux let's get out of that remote so
we're gonna terminate the Remote Desktop
for Linux sounds good to me
and we're back to our virtual
workstation home base perfect so we're
gonna close the RDP folder remote
desktop and now we're going to go to
putty putty uses ssssh and I think FTP
but they don't say it here so for surely
use SSH which is secure shell protocol
to securely access to remote computer
once connected putty displays a terminal
show in which Linux commands can be
executed cool so we're still dealing
with the Linux commands which is awesome
again those are what are used in
terminal on Mac - and that's my computer
so those are fun so we're the hex putty
putty putty Exe and we're gonna be
looking for the host I hostname which is
the IP address for lands which one which
just so happens to be 172
don't 16.8 dot five okay and then they
want us to click the SSA Shrey do button
if applicable it's not and then we're
gonna click open to start the connection
we're gonna start a SSH connection okay
the server's host key is not cached in
the registry I have no guarantee that
the server is the computer you think it
is so there's the rs2 key fingerprint
this is beyond the scope of this lab so
we're gonna just trust the host put our
blind faith in what this lab tells us
we're gonna do it we're gonna do it
we're not gonna abort do not abort so
we're gonna login as cisco again
these look like default cisco is
password boom we're on lance which one
okay so now we're on lance which one and
so in the next steps we're going to use
the cisco internet operating system
cisco i of inter network operating
system my bad Cisco IOS show command to
obtain network documentation information
from the interface you've connected to
you which as you see is Lance which one
Cisco IOS is a package of routing
switching and network commands
integrated with a cisco specific OS of
which the show command is a key function
entering a show command at the command
prompt in the terminal console return
network information specific to the
command you entered there are hundreds
of show commands in the Cisco IOS
availability is based on the privilege
level of the user so if you're like the
super user so if you get it all baby
the relevant show commands for this lab
include the following show interface
which gives you the physical and logical
config configuration information about
each interface and whether or not the
interface is up or down you can see how
helpful that is this command tells you
what interfaces are enabled and active
show IP and then they go through show IP
ARP show IP route show VLAN show switch
VLAN okay so we're going to be doing a
few of those and honestly if you want to
know more about
goes products should probably go to a
boot camp
Cisco gosh what are their certifications
CCNA CCNP is it
I know CCNA for sure security cisco has
a lot of certifications and it's their
their own area of study in my opinion so
we're gonna type show interface so it's
gonna show us our in come back here you
okay
go back to the putty show interface and
this is again a Cisco IOS command so
what is all this gobbledygook inquiring
minds want to know
well this command is displaying a
logical IP address and subnet mask
information address information it tells
you what the IP subnet number IP host
address and subnet mask address
information is for all enabled ports wow
that's some very important I can see how
important information will make rephrase
I can see how important this could be to
the right individual
okay so again was that right that's not
right show interface that is right show
IP interface okay can I rewind here
because this I was reading the show IP
interface I'm like okay where are the
numbers for the subnet mask so that's
not true please rewind renege let's
start over
can we start over show err face is
displaying the physical and logical
configuration information about each
interface okay that makes total sense
now because I did see something about
Ethernet yep hardware is Ethernet SVI
address is this Internet address will be
negotiated Ewing using DHCP and so on
and so forth and whether it's up or down
okay so it's giving you information
about your interfaces is what it boils
down to all in text in putty pretty
awesome
so now that we saw that what else do
they want us to look for
let's do okay so we did the show
interphase and we're going to repeat
step 15 for each of the show commands so
let's just do it I'm not gonna go
through like line by line but let's do
show IP interface and again this is a
Cisco IOS system command iOS command
show IP interface this well that right
whoo okay
so the interface name is up or down IP
address all of these guys are down WTF
so let's do show VLAN which shows you
the virtual LAN name and virtual LAN
status okay very cool very cool
and now let's do let's plug in show IP
art which is going to show you the IP
address Mac Lael Mac layer hardware
address and interface names okay so
there's two of them cool
ok so that was cool we had an ssh
connection via putty to find all of this
information with our interfaces with our
IP our stuff VLAN stuff or IP addresses
and mac layer hardware address yeah lots
of good stuff ok let's get out here
good bye so part 3 final part of this
lab today we're gonna be doing Zen map
this is my favorite because it's a GUI
so you could too have normally I like
working from the command line just
because there's just not the distraction
of images and like pressing buttons and
it's just so much more efficient and I
feel like a total badass even though I'm
probably screwing something up or
breaking something or destroying
something important hey it's not mine
what do I care just kidding I do care in
the next step so you will use Zen Maps
perform a targeted IP sub-network
intense skin so this is going to ID what
hosts are available on this network what
services those hosts are offering what
OS is operating and what type of packet
filters are firewalls are in use
okay so right away you already see how
powerful this send map is and again this
is a graphical user interface edition of
nmap and map is you can run it on the
command end map natively runs on the
command line so the Zen map is just more
of a visual representation than that
easy to remember easy enough so we're on
the GUI and then we have two drop-down
menus up here target and profile so we
want to do I think they said intense
scan right they did say intense scan
somewhere or I'm just fantasizing so the
target field allows us to specifiers
like the network's or sub nights you
want to connect to and so we want to
select one seven two two three dot 0 dot
0 dash 24/24 which is the subnet address
for this lab perfect from the profile
drop-down menu select pink scan ok we're
just gonna ping it so you have all these
options intent scan plus CDP a little
TCP ports quick scan ooh slow
comprehensive scan and what that takes a
few hours so we're gonna click scan so
we're just gonna fire it off scan all
right it's starting cool the command box
displays the syntax tree and map command
these commands can also be typed
manually the result of the scan will
start filling the end map output tab
this scan returns basic information
about the hosts availability and MAC
address you will need this data to
complete the deliverables for this lab
ok we're not going to do the
deliverables well we can look over them
but I'm not gonna be like you know
compiling them to submit to anybody look
and map finished how perfect the scan is
completed when the final line of the
output reads and map done so you see
down here it's scanned and pinged it in
ten point zero five seconds the ping
scan complete so now that we're gonna
expand the profile drop-down menu to see
the complete list of scans that end map
can perform which we totally did and
then we're gonna do
and scan and we're gonna click scan okay
so basically it pinged these IP
addresses and the hosts hosts are up you
know nothing too fascinating there but
now we're gonna do the intense scan and
I hope this doesn't take hours because
we're so close to being done with this I
know you guys are like how much longer
is you're gonna talk but let me tell you
the bottom line before it's actually the
bottom line into this video do yourself
a favor and download some of these tools
don't be a dirtbag and do anything
illegal
but you know as I like to say penetrate
yourself you feel better about your life
get a dummy computer and you know do
these activities mess around with it do
some scans try to crack into a computer
that you put in some other room can try
to connect with it using different
methods using a remote desktop using
putty maybe put put I don't know a boon
to on one of them and just have fun with
it that's what I notice a lot about
these tutorials on YouTube I'm not
please
most of my education has come from
YouTube tutorials but so many people
just I notice they take you really
really seriously and that's okay
but sometimes I just want to lighten up
and you know have fun doing it if you're
not having fun what are you really doing
you're gonna die of like so many ulcers
bleeding into your brain I've heard of
that happening before just kidding that
sounds like a horrible way to die
so this intense scan is going to take
three to five minutes to complete all
the test scripts the scan is completed
just like we did in our ping scan when
the final line of the output reads end
map done so basically I know I've talked
about it in a few different instances
but the Zen map is ultimately using end
map the basics or maybe not all the
basics probably all event map and
outputting it to something that's more
readable in novice friendly or maybe
just someone who likes this
things in a different way so the end map
has done 256 IP address were scanned in
112 seconds 5701 packets sent and 51
5,000 192 received
okie-dokie so now we're gonna scan in
the choose a scan to save dialog box
okay so we're gonna save this we're
gonna save the scan let's just go
through this just so we know how to save
it we're gonna do okay so it wants us to
select the minus t4 minus a minus V and
all of these little letters and stuff
means something but unfortunately I am
not that advanced to tell you what those
could actually mean
so this is where documentation comes in
quite handily so this is the command
line okay so this is the kit we're
saving this which is the command line
for the intense scan from the drop-down
menu and Col save whew
they want us to save it as XML - okay so
we're gonna go like that it's not
pasting a little bit real tough candy
boxing okay OOP so here are the results
of our scan look at all these TCP
unknown that's a lot of packets okay so
look at all these ports okay we lots of
stuff going on so the the traceroute
okay come on down okay so our basic
details here and here are the ports
we've got all of our TCP ports and the
services that they run
so here's SSH towel Nats and guys if you
are not subscribed to hack 5 YouTube on
their YouTube channel oh my gosh Darren
kitchen and snobs Shannon Morse
they are the dynamic duo they're always
hacking some stuff with s
sh internet that USB rubber ducky no and
the land turtle turtle can't even talk
I'm so excited
but you guys see here Oh gopher that's
the Linux it that's still a thing
70 TCP okay cool yep
look at all of these ports kind of fun
to look at Oracle has its own port PPTP
don't know what that is but anyways you
can get lost in this kind of stuff and
it's just like I've been saying it
throughout this video it's good because
to go through this it's good because to
go through this that makes a lot of
sense it's good to go through this just
to get familiar with it be like okay
yeah I recognize that even if you don't
know what it means you don't they know
everything right away I think for me I
get overwhelmed and just like throw the
towel in on the regular because it's so
overwhelming like you just have to learn
to segment it and don't pressure
yourself to learn everything right away
that's not how it is maybe if you work
at a restaurant or something like you
need to get it down pretty quickly but
this is you know talk to someone who's
been doing it for 10 years there are
things they don't know there are a lot
of things they don't know it probably
won't tell you that
seriously I'm telling you they're
probably googling stuff a lot just ask
them to be honest it's a 50/50 shot
anyways let's focus can we focus so they
want us to say the XML and then we're
gonna review now we're going to click
the ports and host tab to review the
data ok and then we're looking at the
information described in the following
table
make a note of the results you're gonna
use a static to complete the
deliverables ok
they want us to repeat step 9 I'm not
gonna ok so let's go to the fun thing
which is a fisheye bubble chart of the
IP host this is the fun one whoo seeing
that okay in the left pane click one
seven 2.02
okay double-click it's not gonna change
and map output okay so this data is
gonna change yep okay so that changes
once we change IP addresses blink cool
so that's the fisheye and they want us
to topology left so this tab displays a
bubble chart of all the IP hosts
discovered during the scan so that's why
it's not changing when we're clicking
this because this is just a collection
of the IP hosts that were collected
during the scan and the bubble chart
shows the relative size and connection
type of the discovered host so there's a
red one ooh cool
so there black is a local host you've
got some yellows so do they tell us what
the actual color code is what what's the
color code okay I'm getting lost here a
bubble chart is a type of graph use this
to show relationships on an X Y access
so the fisheye lens is a tool which can
be used to change the shape and
orientation of the graph so when I'm
clicking these I'm just changing the
shape of it and the orientation the
numbers aren't changing just the
position and a fish eye chart combines
the two features of the shape and
orientation you see we are fishing out
to the max so the controls button ok
cool they want me to click the controls
button there we go there's those and
then we're gonna drag the zoom drag the
zoom drag the zoom and adjust the size
until you're satisfied ok cool so we're
gonna go like this we're gonna make it
real big I'm not satisfied I'm blind as
a bat
oops oh it's not real time slow it down
buddy holy crap dude seriously ok
although that's pretty cool ok stop stop
oMG okay is that the size it is let's
just get it somewhat somewhat
satisfactory that should do that should
do so then we're gonna use the ring gap
sliders to adjust the orientation and
until they're not overlapping so we're
just gonna do it a little more so
they're not overlapping okay that looks
awesome and the ring gap what's that
okay okay okay okay cool awesome so you
can see the benefit of using Zen map
because nmap being it on the command
line or terminal whatever you want to
call it does not show you this kind of
graphic it gives you a nice
representation a graphic representation
for your eyes to absorb so then there's
an option to save this graphic and you
can save it what do you want to call it
poodle pie so then we're gonna save no
file name extension oopsies what do they
want us to save it as a PDF
can we just type PDF perfect
now we're gonna close that Mac window
we're all done here we're not gonna save
it we don't have to save anything see
the log file for deeds and now okay
we're gonna close anyway file transfer
button on the virtual workstation okay
and this is just for transferring to my
local computer so I can theoretically
submit to my instructor guys gals we
made it you made it through all of these
steps but can we please review what we
did here challenge questions not today
here's what we did we explore the tools
used in the virtual lab environment what
do we do Wireshark
you know what those steps are wait too
long we explored Wireshark we explored a
FileZilla that witness investigator open
Voss putty TFT
P D 64 and they wanted only Zen map okay
we created a fisheye bubble chart
because we rocked it we explained how
attack attackers use common network
scanning and analysis tools to
compromise networks okay guys so let me
just wrap this up this video is gone on
wrap it up by saying hackers only need
to know how to do one thing in all of
these tools whereas people working in a
legitimate operation need to be familiar
with all of them eventually what I'm
saying is it's easy to be the bad guy
it's hard to be the good guy so no
matter where you fall on that spectrum I
hope you found this video helpful these
are the actual tools used by hackers and
good guys alike white hat black hat gray
hat grumpy cat they all use them thanks
guys for watching I hope you found this
lab helpful and we'll see you the next
