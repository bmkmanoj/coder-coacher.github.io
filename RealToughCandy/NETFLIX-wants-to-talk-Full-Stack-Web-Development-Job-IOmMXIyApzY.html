get this email from an engineering
manager at Netflix Mike you sure he sent
us an email
and even some candy combat it
development job just given you guys a
little update well a very interesting
update as far as timing goes so I got
that email last week I don't like really
this just maybe is just either the wrong
email or a recruiter spam or something
so I was like well why not just write
her back and see what it's all about so
we're talking and she said she's on this
team for a certain component used in
Netflix I said okay cool she wanted to
know if I want to talk with her and so
we're gonna talk this Thursday I have in
no position to change jobs right now I
just heard a job that I really enjoy and
um I kind of had a little scruple you
know what I mean like should I be
talking to this person here's the thing
when Netflix calls you answer the phone
another two interested in making the
connection and seeing more about what
they do it's not an interview no coding
challenge is given we're just gonna have
a conversation as far as me personally
I'm not going anywhere with this job of
mine I love it it's kicking my butt I
thought I knew you know a little bit of
back end a little bit of PHP a little
bit of sequel enough to get me through
some WordPress tweaks but once you're in
a production environment oh my god I
feel so dumb and it's tough because I
was coding something so simple today in
front of my senior developer and I just
had this huge brain fart and I felt like
a fricking idiot like he had to guide me
through how to write a simple if-else
statement in PHP and I'm like I know how
to do this why am I freaking out it's so
much different when you're in a
production environment the code looks
different the way you type looks
different it feels different
everything's just so different PHP to me
is a learn about language like I can do
it that said it's not my first language
and it's methods it's magic methods its
built-in functions and the purpose of
PHP is quite different well it used to
be quite different than the purpose of
JavaScript which as men
you know is now used everywhere
including the server so I'm just like
kind of frustrated with myself I know
this is probably normal but I'm like
teetering on like the feeling of oh my
god I'm gonna get fired but you know I
can do this
and my senior developer Jason if you're
watching this you freaking rock it's so
patient hey just like I said in the
beginning of this video I was doing
things like not even a first day or
would screw up like I was just like a
total wreck and is it discouraging yes
am I gonna give up no I am committed to
learning this part of web development
today it was clear what my real skills
are and most of those skills currently
reside in the front end especially when
it comes to integrating design with the
front end but my goal this week is to a
not get fired B understand the process
and I think once I understand the
process things are gonna get a lot
easier once I start making those
connections all 500 of them for a simple
task that things are going to start
falling into place so that's the status
update from real tough candy I hope you
guys are doing well always be coding I
coded oh I didn't code very much today a
lot of being at work at a coding job
isn't coding it's looking at it and
thinking but I did work for a full eight
today that's what I do like about this
job is you know there's not a lot of
Facebook checking Twitter updating
you're working so that's pretty cool I
like that a lot
hope you guys are doing well thanks for
watching as usual if you like this video
why not smash that thumbs up button huh
give you candy some love comment
subscribe hit that Bell notification all
that good stuff I'm going into the woods
and might find a body see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
