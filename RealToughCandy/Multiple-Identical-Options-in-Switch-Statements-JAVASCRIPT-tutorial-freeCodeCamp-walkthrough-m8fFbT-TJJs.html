working on free code camp basic
JavaScript working just down the line
getting the problems out of the way so
we can move on to bigger and more
awesome things but don't get me wrong
this this little section with switches I
really enjoy i love the efficiency of it
especially someone who tried to learn
programming and I kind of gave up after
the if else if not to say that that was
a real bummer but that's just read
personally kind of let it fizzle so
picking up after that and going here to
the switches is kind of cool it oh
there's a better way to do this sweet so
let's take a look today and what they
want us to do with this challenge which
is multiple identical options in switch
statements so basically they want us to
do multiple cases for arranging so for
one where ranges one through three I've
answered be low score six mid seven and
nine high and again they give us the
pseudocode here in case you need some
reference and then let me just go
through this little paragraph usually I
don't but we'll do it today if the break
statement is emitted from the switch
statements case the following case
statements are executed until a break is
encountered if you have multiple inputs
with the same output you can represent
them in a switch statement like this so
let me give us a pseudo code which is
very helpful cases for one two and three
we'll all produce the same result so
then they say our instructions are to
write a switch statement and answer for
the following ranges and you will need
to have a case statement for each number
in the range okay so we're going to set
up this problem again like all the other
ones it's mostly set up for us already
and they're pretty explicit with what
need to change so we're going to be
working here is our little work area
right here and just like the previous
switch challenges I think there was to
maybe just one previous I have the
memory of a goldfish but we're going to
set up the switch as we always do and
then if you need any references over the
pseudo code right here so switch
in the city code spell and also appear
it's about so we're going to do and here
is where we set up on curly braces and
if you see my other videos you know I
like to get myself a lot of room to play
here just some breathing room on the
editor there I'm going to clean that up
afterwards so let's start it up we got
the switch with valve recipes and now
we're going to start working on our
cases so it says cases one through three
they want to be low so we simply start
this case one case Q
and now comes just like the previous
problem when we did when we set switch
statements when we broke the switch
statement to set answer we're going to
go to put this answer if you need is
equal to we see once or three is low
mine's your upper case LOL their answer
low and then we're going to add a great
state it's not giving us any errors is
this still trying to learn proper
placement of all these things I don't
know if this is correct or not but for
now just focus on how we're going
through this problem so cases where
we're just going to be moving on right
now d cases for case for rather case for
and then as you see it's 46 so we have
to make space for x5 and just to be
clear I know this might seem obvious to
some people but for others not to lunch
it's four through six so they are saying
you know you need to add five in this
little section here of mint and same
thing with the number 2 1 through 3 they
also need you to add to which we did up
here case too so we need one more here
to please 6
and then for the answer we're going to
just match it with string ok so I'll
break in and then finally we're down to
our last one seven through nine so we'll
be pleased 7-piece just something
satisfying about writing these cases I
really enjoy it engage your factor
answer equals of everyone pretty much
understands that hopefully at this point
just keep going down the line
systematically and seven through nine is
going to be the street hi can we call in
and also a break its protection it they
don't say we can so why not right so
then this is just one of my quirks clean
this up because instead of like to get
myself a lot of room to work should be
good okay so looking over this and now
this is going to test for one so
theoretically if this program was coded
correctly we're going to see low print
it off right here in this little black
rectangle so let's give it a whirl and
see what happens with to run tests Wow
yeah you did it so now that was fun
right but I'm not quite satisfied I want
to run through a few more of these cases
so let's plug in 4 and you all know what
that should spit out right mid here in
the box
mid person and just for completions sake
let's grow in let's throw in a lucky
seven there so as you see the seven
should pick out the string hi reason
here and boom you didn't hope this was
helpful pretty straightforward but can
be daunting because there's so many
lines of code thanks for watching gonna
be doing more of these videos and I'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
