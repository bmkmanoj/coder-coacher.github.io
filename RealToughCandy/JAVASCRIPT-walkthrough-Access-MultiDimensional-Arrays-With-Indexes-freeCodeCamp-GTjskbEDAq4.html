candy back in the saddle with you today
we are working on free code camp basic
java script section accessing
multi-dimensional arrays with indexes
this is probably my ninth time trying to
do this video for some reason arrays are
just a very hard concept for me to grasp
I know they're not difficult they're
relatively easy once you figure out what
you're doing much like most of life it's
just something about it that throws me
off so i'm going to show you my method
of figuring this out and walk you
through the mistakes I made hopefully
this will be the video that makes it on
YouTube what do you say let's get to it
so free code camp explains over here
that a multi multi dimensional array is
an array of arrays here's our array and
then here are our arrays going keep
going when you use brackets to access
your reign the first set of brackets
refers to the entries in the outermost
ie first level array and each additional
pair of brackets refers to the next
level of entries in the side I say that
clearly and concisely because I've read
that 20 times and still working on
understanding it but once would work on
the examples and the instructions it's
going to become a little more clear
let's go down here using bracket
notation select an element from my array
select one of these guys such that my
data think is equal to eight fortunately
this isn't rocket science and we see
that there is an eight right here so the
challenge is to use these two numbers
tweak them in order for this to be eight
how do we do that you know I don't know
what I was struggling because all these
brackets just scramble my brain here's
what i did i know this is unconventional
what I'm trying to learn here and I'm
also trying to figure this out
eventually I want this to be totally non
cerebral but the time being this will
have to do now as you see lines four
through seven each one is its own array
and puts us
here so it's just a little easier to
read let's go through some of these
examples now they give us this variable
R or array arr and as you can see the
match up with these numbers so they give
the example of three now what the heck
how does that equal 10 11 12 13 14 well
I started up here so this line starts at
zero then we go one two three as you see
it equals 10 11 12 13 and 14 and nothing
more specified to go to this example 3
and 0 well we already know three is this
line right but as you see there's
another array inside this array of an
array so 10 11 and 12 is going to be 0
it's going to be 0 1 2 3 line 7 is three
matches and then we want to find 0 which
is 10 11 12 okay you with me we can do
this I know we can I'm trying I'm trying
now 301 we're going to go right back we
know 17 is three because again 0 1 2 3
so this entire line is three and then
zero so we're going to hone in a
disarray and then we're going to hone in
on one inside of this so we started all
over again here's 0 which is 10 and
here's one which is 11 and what do you
know equals 11 so once you hatch that
out I encourage you to really do that
because actually only staying well one
of like seven things I do take it back
it was a big component in the
understanding what the heck was going on
with this problem so now that we've gone
through that they want us to go back to
the original problem here select an
element for my array such that my data
is equal to eight well this should be
pretty easy right because we already
know line 4 is 0 this starts it off 01
20 here's the eight what do we
to 2012 all right so we know the first
stop first destination two so what
inside here is 801 plug that in see what
happenes some i call it on here
everything else looks good not getting
any errors press the big green party on
Wayne hope this video was helpful again
part of the blind leading the blind
series I kind of joke about but you know
like I said go through this problem take
your time it it's not worth it being
just a code monkey I have learned a lot
in the past two hours just by studying
arrays and want to get to that point
where it's not just code monkeying where
you actually understand what's going on
alright guys thanks for watching we'll
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
