candy from real tough candy com wanted
to pop on today and go full p owed
students mode because these freaking
text books are expensive they are price
gouging American students in particular
and I'm not just talking about
University students but I am including
you in this video anybody who wants to
advance their knowledge of any topic is
probably eventually going to purchase
some sort of reference manual book
publication whatever you want to call it
now recently I've been really getting
mean to computer science as you know
from watching my channel my last hundred
videos or so are exclusively tech
related so I said what better way to
offer my view in public some more
interesting tech material than by
researching it and telling you guys
about it well it's going to buy this
really good book recommended by someone
this person who recommended it said buy
anything by Tannenbaum the guy knows his
stuff I said all right of course head
over to where else amazon and type in
Tannenbaum and this book gets really
good four out of five so fairly good
reviews called modern operating systems
fourth edition published I believe in
2014 point being was published recently
and supposed to be good so I'm checking
it out and I see a hundred and eighty
six dollars and ninety-five sent
freaking price tag and I'm staying dude
are you frickin serious I really think
about to just have a 12 out of 10 blood
pressure moment right now that's right
this one goes to 11 this one goes to 12
oh so I remember an o are numbered in
old trick not quite battle because we
can still use it this is the American
pray you know if you've ever traveled
overseas as an American you get that
special American pricing right for meals
for drinks for taxis you get that
special American VIP price 186 bucks
yeah pell-mell let's try thirty-five
dollars and twenty-five cents because
you see this is the International
addition it's the same damn look there
might be a different cover here but it
is the same thing the only other
difference is probably going to be the
hardcover to spot cover conversion if
it's an international version now I want
to illustrate this point by point
another highly recommended book book yes
this one in the hardcover comes highly
recommended again done Douglas coma
rather is a master with TCP and IP
protocols and also came highly
recommended to me with the American
pricing of 145 dollars and 44 cents for
the hardcover well the paperback will
only set back ninety two dot 71 sense
however if you search for the
international edition they'll sentence
lost a modest sixteen dollars and
forty-seven plus 3 99 in economy
shipping I did buy this book last night
the international editions they do
disclose it here somewhere I believe yes
it is the international rock cover
edition a lot of times these
international editions are printed and
intended for print in Canada and
intended for Canadian students yeah
point being we want to save yourself 130
freaking box I know if it's freaking
probably 10 times from this video just
because it's just it's so obvious your
price gouging people when they already
have forty sixty a hundred thousand
dollars taken out in student loans which
are not forgivable yeah why not just put
what's a hundred dollars more oh boy
they that's all I have to say today
let's end this on a positive note there
is a way around this guy's use an
international edition again it's the
same darn thing it's just probably going
to be in a softcover edition and the
cover the cover art maybe a little
different with the content on word for
word alright guys so this video was
helpful expand your mind expand your
knowledge and stay frugal yoga gouged
definitely research that internet
l'addition and save yourself some cash
alright guys thanks for watching we'll
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
