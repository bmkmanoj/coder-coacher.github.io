back online is new today we're gonna
have some fun at the Nashville software
school let this be an educational video
for the Nashville Southwestern owl
almost two weeks ago I sent a tweet to
them concerning their application on the
website for potential students it is
totally unencrypted and we're gonna be
intercepting some information I'm
sending over the wire today using a
program called Wireshark it's a packet
sniffer ooh it sounds so dirty let's go
on down in addition to the tweet I did
email them on their unencrypted contact
page but that went unanswered as well as
you will see in a minute where's the
application here we go okay okay here we
go let's let's apply right now huh
according to Chrome my connection is not
secure all right this looks good I want
to show you guys the information that
students would probably give and how
that might be vulnerable okay let's go
ahead and submit so what I did here was
filter through all the packets that were
sniffed I have a few other windows open
in different browsers right now so there
were a ton of packets and I searched for
post requests because when I hit the
submit button on this application that's
a post request and here are the results
as you can see this is all unencrypted
help Danielle five five five here's my
email please fix comm here's my frickin
github I love graphic design I gave you
my social security I can blah blah blah
everything I entered in there can be
intercepted so if you're at a coffee
shop or even if you're at your home and
somebody else is on your connection they
can easily take this information and a
lot of this information is ripe for
social engineering the other thing I
want to add about encryption is that
adding an SSL certificate is free you
can use it with you can make one
yourself with let's encrypt otherwise if
you go through like you know your web
hosting provider sometimes they provide
them for you
the point being they're very inexpensive
and they're pretty straightforward to
install if you're a webmaster or a web
developer who spends a few hours just
learning how it works
thanks for watching guys I hope this
video was helpful in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
