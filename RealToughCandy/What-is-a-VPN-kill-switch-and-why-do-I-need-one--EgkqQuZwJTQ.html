candy from real tough candy calm back in
this aisle with you today we are talking
about VP in kill switches and they are a
critical component most especially if
you are dabbling in torrenting you know
using BitTorrent or some similar
application to upload and download
content what kind of content that is not
my business but let me tell you why kill
switches are very handy so a VPN is a
Virtual Private Network and it makes
your internet connection private now
there is a difference because you're not
anonymous with the VPN you are private
and there are some nuances but at the
end of the day there is actually a
significant difference between the two
that's the subject for a different video
VPN kill switches kill your internet
connection it's like a tripwire whenever
there's a break in your connection you
know I'm not I'm out like cogs flying
out of the VPN tunnel and this spring's
whoa watch out for your eye taking an
eye out with one of those plan cogs
whenever there's an interruption
especially with torrenting you know some
downloads take an hour or two depending
on your internet speed and other
considerations there might be an
interruption in service well when there
is that interruption your true IP
address is exposed oh yeah and you know
depending on what your torrenting you
don't want that exposed because you
might getting some deep doo-doo
regardless it's always a good practice
to have a VPN Killswitch employed anyway
no matter what you're doing because the
purpose of you having a VPN is to remain
private so why would you want to risk
that leak of your actual IP address you
know regardless of what you're doing so
I found some information about some
different VPN providers that do offer
the kill switch some of them you may
have heard of some of them maybe not I'm
not getting endorsed by any of these
guys and I might be doing a video soon
you know comparing the top five most
popular VPNs and you know some that
offer services more I don't know what
the word is friendly VPNs we'll put it
that way VPNs that are working for the
customer the point of this video again
was to tell you about the VPN Killswitch
how important that is to have one again
it's like a tripwire whenever your
connection gets interrupted it will cut
off the internet access so your IP your
true IP address is not exposed we don't
want that happening because obviously if
we're doing a VPN we're engaging in VPN
activities that's why we have the VPN in
the first place so why not have that
extra layer of protection thanks for
watching guys hope this video was
helpful and we'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
