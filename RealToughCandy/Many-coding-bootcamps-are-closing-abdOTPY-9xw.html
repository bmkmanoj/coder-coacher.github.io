calm back in the saddle with you guys
today how are you doing hey listen you
guys are doing some incredible stuff I
just want to give a shout out to some
people I want to give a shout out and
welcome to Jimmy Tryon he's from west
coast
he's doing some great stuff he has a job
interview coming up going with job fair
good luck with that code new hey why not
give you another shot oh I get one too
my last video you're doing some great
stuff too with your YouTube channel and
more and more people joining the board
here on the Gator chatroom have some
great little micro conversations about
different tech topics awesome time over
there link in the description box for
those people who like to chat it up one
more thing I have a super killer
announcement to make
not in this video though it will be
announced in the next video there's
actually two big things that are
happening in my life that I want to
share with you guys related to tech
entrepreneurship to incredible things
that I'm so excited to share but I don't
want to clog up the video with that so
we'll talk about that in the next video
and I hope you guys are there for that
let's talk about this topic today is one
of the topics we have been talking about
in the chatroom over the past couple
days is these boot camps these coding
boot camps that are shutting their doors
now the two that come to mind
immediately are the dev bootcamp outfit
which Kaplan bought three years ago okay
that's new to me and in fact I'd never
heard of Deb boot camp until a
subscriber I'd mentioned it and then
also I know one personally that has shut
quite a few campuses it's one I applied
to like way back when when I thought I
would still enjoy Java hire and yard
clothes quite a few would they shuddered
quite a few campuses here Arkansas
Little Rock that closed it San Antonio
Minneapolis Wow
yeah a lot I have a feeling this is the
tip of the iceberg in the coding
bootcamp world and I want to share my
thoughts on why now I'm not going to
consult any peer-reviewed journals on
this this is purely my thoughts on it if
you agree or disagree I'd love to hear
your thoughts in the comments and if you
think this is just an anomaly or this is
more of a trend happening
I personally think this is a start of a
trend why because I was here when it
first started getting popular in the
mainstream media I used to have a
student subscription to The New York
Times it's the only way I would ever
have a subscription to The New York
Times at a steep discount the
subscription has since elapsed but this
was a few years ago and they were going
really really hard on promoting coding
coding shortages
let's panic there aren't any code
workers are there any web developers etc
and they would interview people in boot
camps like these and other boot camps
full stacked whatever hack right there's
so many I'm a voracious reader and I
still read newspapers and they were
everywhere this was in 2014 so in 2014
this is where this mushroom cottage
industry kind of started exploding and
now you see youtubers even plugging
coding boot camps they haven't gone to
them but they the people who only boot
capsule like yo dude you're legit can
you plug our boot camp I know three
right off the top of my head whoo plug
these boot camps guys I don't think most
of these boot camps are going to be
around in a few years I think this is
kind of the Wild West gold rush of
capitalizing on the frenzy of people
getting excited about learning a new
skill the problem is twofold number one
though marketing was terrible
I can't tell you how many times I've
gone to websites like these Koni boot
camps now dev bootcamp I've not been to
but for example like dev boot camp where
they say no experience necessary
anybody can code on free code camp they
are the founder Kristi Larson he is
adamant proponent of teaching everyone
to code which is a lofty ideal but
that's just not happening I think it's a
great ideal but I'm a realist and I
don't want to be cynical but it only
appeals to a small section of those
people in this world why because it does
take a lot of bringing power guys
I consider myself myself an
above-average intelligence person and
maybe I'm overestimating
but it's difficult people who have been
doing it for 10 years probably say yeah
is easy I can code the programming logic
behind the Mars rover in 200,000 lines
of C in my sleep well the average person
can't yes I agree more people need to
learn how to code I don't think you
necessarily have to have an aptitude for
it but you do need to have certain
traits you can't just yank some guy out
of the coal mine or the hood or wherever
and say here sit in here for eight hours
here's like 12 books go read them and
learn how to code and immediately
invoked function expression in
JavaScript immediately above function
expressions are difficult if you don't
have six to 12 months of learning really
really boring things this is all to say
that this marketing thing has been
pulling in people who maybe have no
actual interest in sitting in a computer
for 12 hours but you know it's easy for
the dollar sign to take over our pupils
I mean I know that's a big motivation
guys if this was paying minimum wage if
these boot camps promised web
development jobs at 8 bucks an hour 12
bucks an hour 15 20 bucks an hour I
wouldn't even be bothering with it I'd
go back to doing videography and making
YouTube videos on you know vinyl obscure
vinyl records so the marketing was way
out of its weak and it was I think it
was pulling in a lot of people who are
immature who have actually not a lot of
interest in the real true work of web
development pops don't want to learn how
to code the number 2 thing that I think
is going to be sparking off a lot of
these closures closures is the fact that
the concept doesn't really stick with
people in the real world you know become
and it goes back to that marketing thing
become a web developer in eight weeks
that's just not accurate yeah they're
going to teach you the basics but as far
as being up and ready guys most people
who have been in a business will admit
to you or people who read these resumes
going to the coding bootcamp eight weeks
12 weeks it's not going to cut it they
want to see some projects they're not in
not just projects things that are alive
in the real world like what is your app
do have people been using it
and not just the theoretical you know a
lot and to be fair a lot of these boot
camps do do projects or final projects
but it's just not cutting it for eight
and twelve weeks and the reality is
starting to catch up the thing with tech
as you guys know is that it changes
everyday I mean there's new stuff
emerging everyday and people who started
these boot camps were quick to deploy
and like everything else on the internet
including the real tough candy Channel
hey this channel could be dead by
tomorrow I hope not but it could be like
everything else on the Internet the
shelf life is very limited
most internet things web web focused
things have the shelf life of a gallon
of milk now these boot camps the iron
yard and boot camp these have all popped
up in the last few years going back to
the New York Times pieces for 2014 guys
2013 2014 is when I've seen a lot of
these here we go look at this dev
bootcamp they burned the coding boot
camp industry in 2012 if a coding but we
can't work for you that's awesome
but people need to know the context of
these things because if you're going to
this and you're paying $15,000 for eight
weeks it's better freaking work there
better be some guarantees the reality is
catching up with these wood camps and
they're there marketing was is just
disastrous it needs to be more focused
on people who maybe have a little bit of
spark of an interest and people with
certain traits that might need to be a
little more developed hey we're all
diamonds in the rough here guys I'm not
trying to make it a special snowflake
talk but there are millions of people
who don't know they have a passion for
this kind of stuff I didn't know and
then I started doing it the reason I
started doing it is because I've tried
damn near everything else and this is
the only thing that I have an obsession
with technology and I also have a love
for it I've seen the things I can do for
people I've seen how it's changed my
life I've seen how it's changed and
saved people's lives traversée media
his YouTube channel has saved his life
he talks about it in his very powerful
video on depression
anxiety he uses it as a vehicle as a
therapy method for him to get through
his day that's incredible
and I think millions of people soon feel
the same way as I do and want to get
into it they just never thought about
doing it that's where we need to focus
our efforts on getting these people in
and I see it my subscribers I see it in
you guys I see it in the Gator chat room
I see it on my youtube channel and I see
it in the deaf spotlight when I reach
out to you guys or when I get emails
from you guys and chat with you guys
we're doing some amazing things and even
maybe your family and friends don't
understand what you're doing it's that
doesn't matter because they're going to
benefit from what we are doing from what
you're doing in a very short amount of
time guys I hope this video you found
interesting or maybe helpful I don't
know let me know your thoughts about
these coding boot camps and why
specifically what you think the trend is
going to be do you think we're going to
open do you think there's going to be
another revival of this or is it a
downhill thing from here or is are these
just some anomalies with these closings
let me know guys thanks for watching
we'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
