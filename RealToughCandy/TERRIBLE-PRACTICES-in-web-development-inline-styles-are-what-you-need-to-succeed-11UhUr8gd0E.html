conventional wisdom in web development
and that makes me happy real tough candy
back in the saddle with you guys today
how is it going it's been a few days
since I've been on camera hanging out so
thanks for coming back to the channel
after our brief hiatus at least with me
doing videos the last couple days have
been really exciting I've been
showcasing a new portion a new element
on my channel these web development
interviews with people in the business
and I pity the fool who does not like
awesome announcements because these ones
freakin Rock announcement number 1.5
michael Kornblum
my super subscriber has started a garis
chat room a tech chat room for this
channel so it is a dynamic way of
talking about code and getting to know
people offline in an online format on
the chat room is open to everybody like
all of my products I guess you could
call them I don't want to call it that
it's too commercial like all my
offerings and all of my platforms that I
create or am involved in they're open to
everybody so this is a place it's not
like Stack Overflow it's not Stack
Overflow is great obviously everyone use
it but it's everyone uses it but it's
impersonal people can be real Dinks and
a lot of questions go unanswered that is
not the case with my offerings and
that's not the case of that getter
chatroom people are geeking out and I'm
like they'll be two other people talking
about tech and I'm like trying to type
my insights or whatever I'm like oh my
god things are moving its dynamic oh my
god fireworks
super exciting do not go over there if
you have like 8 cups of coffee try to
get that blood pressure down because
once people start chatting about tech
it's over and there are people of all
levels so I encourage you whether you're
an advanced intermediate beginner or
just don't even care check it out if you
have not signed up for the dev mojo
newsletter for aspiring and beginner
developers it's very simple sign up
easily right here at real tough candy
calm well lastly if you like what's
going on on this channel you want to see
more of it I have added an option to
support this channel very painlessly and
very easily if you shop on Amazon in my
description box from here on out I'm
adding a Amazon link simply by shopping
on Amazon you can support this channel I
don't know who is buying what you don't
pay more for anything
Amazon simply credits me as a referrer
so I'm referring you to amazon.com like
okay cool real tough candy thanks for
showing people that Amazon exists and
it's a very easy way to buy some garbage
bags a computer and some tech books look
through this link so I appreciate your
support in that department as well let's
get on to this freakin topic like real
tough candy is just one big commercial
no it's not let's talk about in line
styles many people watching this channel
perhaps most people watching this
channel know there are three ways to
insert a style sheet when we're talking
about CSS you can insert it externally
which is something like this this is the
most recommended method to keep because
it keeps it nice and modular nice and
clean you can also put it internally in
a style tag in the head here as you can
see probably familiar to you as well not
as popular as the external method and
not best practice but it's still a
viable option and finally number three
the inline style oh so hideous so
unintuitive so many colons for God's
sake please make it stop
as w3c schools calm notes use this
method sparingly this no matter what
book you read on HTML and CSS they say
please avoid inline Styles this is so
90s just do not do it unfortunately the
rest of the internet has not caught up
with best practices and there may be
some situations where you cannot use in
internal or external stylesheet now I'm
going to show you a very relevant
example of that the first I want to show
you how you can quickly transform an
external stylesheet into something
internal let me show you an example of
what I'm about to transform your so
we're going to do a responsive pricing
table let me just lay this all out let's
say we're listing on
eBay whoo that's a site that's kind of
not really up with you know the hippest
and best practices if you use eBay a lot
as a seller everyone that knows what I'm
talking about so they still have the
option of using let's just get rid of
this they still the option of using HTML
in their item description box mmm this
is promising so this is a great listing
template we're going to sell a men's hat
and some kind of pricing chart down here
I don't know let's just go with it
so there's your standard nor your HTML
now because this site is already how
explain this because the site is already
created there is no body tag there's no
head tag this is just an HTML box to
display in this box right here so you
know there's you could probably link to
an external CSS sheet somewhere on like
an upgraded version of github or
something maybe I don't know the most
efficient way to do this is through an
inline tool so we're going to convert
this responsive pricing table well go
ahead and get this HTML get this yes oh
wait a minute what they're not in the
same how am I going to do this so here's
what you do
I have already copied and pasted the
HTML along with the CSS here is the CSS
and then we have the HTML here so what I
simply did was copy this CSS here and
then we're going to go up here and we're
going to put it around style tags right
now you're probably saying but real
tough candy that's not an inline style
that's an internal style what are you
doing
excellent question so just make sure you
have the head and the style I'm going to
go ahead and copy all of this and I'm
going to bring it over to my convenient
inliner tool I simply copy and paste as
you can see have a doctype I have the
head bottle but again that stuff's not
going in our ebay file but I will show
you what I'm doing I'm hitting convert
this is on MailChimp comm there's other
ones available simply Google CSS in
liner and now
boom it is converted but I don't want to
take this stuffs okay they kept my body
they kept my style tag so I'm going to
go where it starts actually with the
actual HTML which is going to be it's
just going to be right about here go
ahead I can just stop on the divs copy
that
alright we're going to go back to our
eBay page here or HTML file boom boom
now theoretically if I hit the standard
a chart looking like this should show up
we'll see the words boom guys how cool
was that you know how long it would take
you to do manually and inline Styles in
the CSS page now this was a simple CSS
imagine CSS was like 500 different IDs
500 different classes I mean it would
take it to monkeys a week to do that so
this can come in very handy is
definitely not recommended for any type
of web development under normal
circumstances however there are places
where this does come in handy this can
also be used for cyclic wordpress.com
where they don't let you upload your CSS
stuff or your JavaScript they don't even
let you use JavaScript period so just
get that out of your head right now
wordpress.com is for a certain section
of people probably not web developers
but if you get stuck with it like I did
before I knew I was going to be a web
developer this can be your best friend
as well because they do have that HTML
box like if you're doing like a blog
entry they have the option of doing HTML
and you can put stuff in there and
easily tweak it to your heart's content
the styles and even the fonts and stuff
like that obviously I mean anything with
CSS that's inline you can tweak to your
heart's content hope this video was
helpful guys more content coming more
interviews coming so you get an email
from me it's not the Ukrainians or the
Latvians or even the Lithuanians or
maybe the Russians reason the Kazakhstan
EES reaching out to you for some
opportunities to be featured in one of
my
lack forms my blog my videos are even my
newsletter to showcase your talents no
pressure though if it's not your thing
don't worry about it my feelings won't
be hurt but it is a great opportunity
thanks for watching guys we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
