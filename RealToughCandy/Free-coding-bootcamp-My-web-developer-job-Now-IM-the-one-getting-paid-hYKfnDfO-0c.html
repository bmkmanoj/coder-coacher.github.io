calm back online with you guys today
trouncing through the remnants of a
blizzard how special middle of april
right blizzard over the weekend it's
crazy here so big this day 12 third week
of my job this weekend I had a little
crisis of confidence with everything I
was doing just getting acclimated to the
staff getting acclimated to how they do
things at an enterprise level and just
getting comfortable with the workflow
Friday afternoon my senior developer had
to run some errands so he was out of the
office that afternoon and said we having
a little problem with this chunk of code
on the back end I'm gonna have you work
on it and see how far you get it
shouldn't be that hard and every time I
hear that phrase huh
shouldn't be that hard I panic because I
it takes me multiple times to get most
things right so he leaves me with the
code he even gave me a little bit of
sample code to try and insert my own
values into it no look for hours go by
I'm feeling frustrated but a little
optimistic yet and five o'clock rolls by
time to get off work don't have anything
solved then he said this was like a
straight for a problem I think it is I
just don't connect the dots so over the
weekend I was just panicking and I said
definitely Monday I'm gonna get a
talking-to because I just couldn't
figure this out get to work Monday I see
my senior developers car they're a
little girly because I like to get there
early it's like oh boy here we go
turns out his alarm on one of his phones
wasn't sprung ahead so he was there an
hour early
saved by the phone saved by the phone so
yesterday and today I have been starting
from scratch PHP I thought I knew PHP I
thought I could at least stack over pull
my way through PHP but I'm starting at
like the basic basics like
classes inheritance versus composition
and by the way anyways noticed being an
office you don't get much done at all
like it's been a while since I've work
in an office environment and you can't
get anything done it there's like the
office dog who wants kisses in love
there are people on speakerphone there's
conversations going between you between
two people it's just like I can't focus
like welcome to the world of the office
I guess it just it's definitely a
different learning environment but it's
also one where I know I have to learn
the stuff so it's not really so it's not
a luxury like this is a must learn also
to here's a protip I was having problems
identifying some of these functions and
methods because phpstorm settings are
different on my machine than on the work
machine like the color scheme is what
I'm talking about
and I noticed when I was coding my own
stuff on the work machine that I could
suddenly better identify things with my
company's code so like the functions I
was writing for the same color as the
functions they wrote that really helped
a lot the other day Andrew Lyne one of
my subscribers he's always try man with
good questions and good insights he
asked if the company gives me time to
learn things and the answer is yes I'm
not going home to go learn more but I
will because I personally want to not
because someone said ok here are some
stuff for you to read tonight it was
more like spend your time wisely here
and do whatever you want after 5 o'clock
the future is in your hands so my
company is very generous that way
setting aside these training hours and
saying you know what at 5 o'clock it's
five o'clock you get out here and the
rest of the nights yours and that goes
for weekends too if I didn't want to if
I didn't feel like studying myself on my
own hours I wouldn't but I'm really
needing to get the stuff down so I do
you asked a few other good questions to
Andrea get to those in my next video
where I'm gonna be talking about my
interview or really interview like chat
with Netflix well I'm at the taco shop I
gotta go I'm hungry as always I think I
have a tapeworm I'm probably not if you
like this video like button come on now
we have a comment tell a friend as
always thanks for watching see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
