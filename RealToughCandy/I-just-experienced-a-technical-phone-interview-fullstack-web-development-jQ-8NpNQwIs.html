never gets super distracted when they're
supposed to be doing something really
important just got out of a technical
phone interview for a full stack web
position and winning that freaking phone
rang at 2:03 p.m. I thought I was going
to soil myself between 2 o'clock and 203
I was convinced okay no he's not calling
that's a interview cancel when it
happened I said let's do this I got to
answer this phone I was tempted to just
put it on silent but I had to answer
that phone they were mostly
straightforward full stack questions and
they started with the basics he opened
up with what is a difference between a
class and an ID in CSS a great classic
beginners question of course near that
one ding ding ding okay she gets to
proceed and then it went from there
there was a jQuery question involving an
alert box he also asked me about my
sequel which inner and outer joins
and I froze up I was like I can tell you
what an energy is but not an outer
Wadden you know so there were some
moments where I stumbled before this
interview I was researching stuff like
the inner workings of Redux dev tools
object destructuring
intermediate to advanced concepts that
are for intermediate to advanced web
developers who are getting paid as
mid-level and senior developers I'm a
junior developer and if I had to do
things over I would have stuck to the
basics of web technologies he asked me
about 15 20 questions within a half-hour
and I did get most I did answer most of
them correctly some of them I had to
rein myself in because they're
open-ended questions such as can you
tell me about react and you can start
explaining react in so many different
places so I kind of gave a very brief
history of it and then incorporated its
benefits what it does that they were
between a library and a framework all
those technical things under the guise
of a narrative so that was really
helpful technique now when you do a
technical phone interview for web
development they're not going to throw
you to the alligators right
just remember they're people too they
usually want to see you succeed and if
they're calling you it's because they
want to confirm with your the right
choice that said the first couple
questions you need to make sure you
really get those on point because that's
gonna develop a sense of trust between
you and that interviewer who's gonna say
yeah okay the transferring pretty good
let's push on because they're gonna be
that person to recommend to their boss
if you're a good fit or not it's not
necessarily about answering all the
questions correctly like I said I got a
few wrong
I felt dumb on a few of them I just like
choked up deer-in-the-headlights the
works but at the end of the interview he
said it was awesome he loved my
responses he loved the way I thought
through the problems and the questions
and my communication skills were on
point so we're going forward with that
just wanted to share that experience
today if you're a junior developer
especially of course it's nerve-racking
but after this experience I will say if
I can do it you can do it and the
questions aren't nearly as hardball as
you read about on the internet those are
for mid-level and senior positions where
you need to know exactly how closures
work within the v8 chrome runtime
environment PHP plus my admin - the
functional operator you know that comes
with time but as a junior developer it's
our job to know the basics and it's
probably even more important that we
show our ability to communicate ideas
thanks for watching I hope this video
was helpful check out my new website
newly revamped real tough candy dot Tom
we'll see you later so why don't you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
