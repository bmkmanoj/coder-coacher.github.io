can be back in your area today wanted to
give you the heads up there is a class
coming up for you developers interested
in databases there's something about a
database that is just charming I don't
know call me an uber nerd but databases
are just so interesting and this is a
free course starting on march 21st
straight in the mouths of babes mongo DB
university itself i want to tell you i
was at an open source conference about a
year and a half ago back when I was just
starting out in the IT world and oh my
god I was overwhelmed I listened to Van
Halen on like 11 in my car on the way
home just just to let it all out i was i
was zapped I was active all energy after
that ate our conference and mongodb one
of the presenters gave a presentation on
MongoDB and I got a little free sticker
of this little tree leaf or trees I
don't know if it's only for a tree I
never figured it out so cool though I
just it sounds awesome and I'm excited
to learn about databases wanted to share
this again it starts March 21st 2017 go
on over to mongo DB university which is
a google at mpm 101 p i'll also include
the link in the description box it says
this course will over basic installation
JSON schema design querying insertion of
data indexing and working with the
python driver now to be totally
transparent I have basic working
knowledge of Python so I need to brush
up on that i can probably define this
variable and right to the word put or
perhaps putz depending on who you're
talking to and they say after completing
this course you should have a good
understanding as to how applications are
built on top of MongoDB using python
plus have a great foundation when
prepping for the MongoDB developer
certification exams somewhere on this
page I read that it also supports Java
but maybe that was just a teaser so I
would click here either way probably
never a bad idea to have some basic
gone down seven elite course each week
requires three to five hours of your
time probably not for me personally I
know when they say any kind of time
frame I double it triple it oftentimes
quadruple it so i'm thinking probably 15
hours a week will be the going rate for
me and then what's in it for us as far
as afterwards we're going to get a
course completion confirmation say that
five times fast at the end of the course
if you achieve a 65-percent or above
that's right you get a d-plus you still
pass the bads my style just kidding I'm
not going through one hundred percent no
snow blower crap guys want to put your
best foot forward but I find these
sometimes arbitrary percentage is pretty
funny in a sad ironic sort of way so
here is the agenda system requirements I
will let you pour that on your own
bottom line up front reiterated a
mongodb for developers class coming up
March twenty first ending May sixteenth
and as some of you many of you or most
of you or even all of you might know M
stands for mongo in the mean stack so
these guys are prepping you for success
in this a real world see you guys later
