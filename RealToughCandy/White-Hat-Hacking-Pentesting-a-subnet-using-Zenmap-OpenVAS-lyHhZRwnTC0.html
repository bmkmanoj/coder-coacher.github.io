for you beginner beginners out there
that basically means we're doing it in a
legal way we have all the permissions
and authorizations to you know system
gather information on the system and do
pen testing and so on and so forth
so this is a controlled environment and
I do have permission to break things on
this machine and the subnet so we will
be doing that just want to start out by
saying the hacking process consists of
five main steps foot printing scanning
and vulnerability assessment enumeration
exploitation which are the actual
attacks and post attack activities
including covering your tracks and
planting back doors
so the difference between black hat
hackers and white hat hackers again
white hat hackers they're doing it to
make things better they're probably
getting paid legitimately whereas black
hat hackers are doing it illegally and
want to make your life miserable while
brag about it on the dark web so we need
to use the right tools to map the
network and identify any vulnerabilities
that can be at the opening for a future
attack now to do that today we're going
to start out by using Zen map which is
the graphical user interface version of
nmap and I use Zen map I want to
gradually my personal goal is to be able
to use and map but it's a command-line
interface program and it's just you know
it's a little overwhelming for me is as
I've been saying these past videos an
intermediate to advanced beginner so I'm
sticking with Zen map it's a great
program to start with because you can
see everything and you know stuff isn't
it's not cryptic and then the other tool
we're going to be using today is open
vos we've used this in previous lab so
she'll be familiar if you've been
following this series and both open
source so they're free for the download
and if you're following along at home
definitely go download these two with
their great programs if you plan on
continuing your cybersecurity education
so we're going to be using these two in
conjunction with one another that is
really a good way to use these because
you can use them individually but the
real
power from what I've been learning and
seeing and just experiencing is when you
can combine programs to create this
super power of information so we're
gonna do a little less yammering and a
little more doing but I want to tell you
guys what we're gonna be learning today
and what hopefully you can take away
from this lab after we're done
so after this we're gonna be able to
identify risks threats and
vulnerabilities and an IP network
infrastructure using Zen map dink to
perform an IP host port and services
scan we're gonna be able to perform a
vulnerability assessment scan on a
targeted IP sub-network using the open
boss we're gonna be able to compare the
results of the Zen map scan with an open
boss vulnerability assessment scan we're
gonna be able to assess the findings of
the vulnerability assessment scan and ID
critical vulnerabilities and most
importantly maybe not that's arguable
but lastly we're gonna be able to make
recommendations using our grey matter to
compute these things and analyze these
things and go back to our boss so that
we can tell him or her what steps need
to be taken in order for this risk
threaten Vollmer ability to be
eliminated we're gonna be using the CVE
database listing to kind of guide our
opinions and recommendations on that so
let's get right to it step one we're
gonna scan the network with Zen map
again this is an open source tool so
it's free for the download so just go
ahead and double click on that if you're
following along at home now we're gonna
navigate over here to this command box
and right away you might be seeing these
letters like oh my god this is
overwhelming I know for me not knowing
the translations of these things can be
pretty overwhelming so let's just start
from scratch we're gonna chillax we are
gonna just simply type in nmap and then
we're gonna do - I'm s n - minuses X
I'll tell you what this is all about as
soon as I start running the skin 170
2.30
. so you don't actually probably not
mine it says that probably the better
term is - so one - and then two dashes
respectively and then exclude once when
- 30 nuts or none whatsoever - you got
38 sort of - and then we're gonna type
in 170 2.30 8.0 / 24 and then after
we've put all that in we are gonna hit
the Scan button and now our Zen map it's
doing its thing so here's what I did for
the command I put an end map which is
the end map I don't know how to explain
it so I won't basically I started out
with an map the - SN or - SN is a ping
scan so it's pinging all of these hosts
on the subnet the exclude was excluding
my IP which is 1 7 2 to 3:30 dot 0 dot -
this is my local machine right here I
don't want to scan I don't want to ping
scan my local machine because I know
what's going on on my machine I'm not
concerned about you know idea yet I know
you know what the operating system is
and all that because I've access to it
so this is the result here of the 5
hosts and now we're gonna go to ports
and hosts actually we're gonna go to
host the details first so the first
thing we see is that this has a big
question mark on it so it cannot it
tells us that it's scanned a host like
something this exists 1 7 2.30 20.7
exist at 11.20 in about seventeen five
machines five hosts rather exist but we
don't know much about them from simply
pinging it we simply again ping scanned
it so it's telling us that these exists
but as far as open ports not gonna
happen as far as the operating system
not gonna happen all we really have is
an ipv4 address so
we want to get a little more detailed we
have the MAC addresses that's fine but
to be honest I could do a ping scan in
terminal even me being a beginner so
this is nmap is a little using Zen map
for a simple ping is probably not ideal
so I'm gonna show you a better way to do
this so we can get even more information
about these hosts because IP addresses
and MAC addresses are great starts but
we want to know a little more this
fisheye tool is pretty cool too but
that's not part of the lab so back we go
to the N map output so we're gonna keep
this n map here and we are going to get
rid of SN which is the ping scan and
we're going to type in lowercase s
uppercase s and this is telling Z not to
perform an end map on as a cinema Stan
sy n it's a form of TCP scanning that's
less intrusive on the target host so now
after this is done spinning Zen map is
gonna identify open ports without
completing a TCP handshake and that TCP
handshake could be noticed by network
network administrator's and even though
we're white hats we don't want to be
obvious that we're doing like we want to
impersonate the bad guy so that we can
identify all the possible threats so
let's check out our first host here and
we're gonna check out ports and hosts to
see the services using the TCP protocol
as you see here the protocol TCP TCP so
on this first host we have port 22 which
is open and that's SSH we also have
report 3389 which i've not seen before
and that's ms WB t server gonna be
honest
couldn't tell you more about that what
about what that server does but I'm sure
a few quality minutes on the Google
sphere could answer any questions I
might have about that service so at this
point we have four more hosts we could
go through to see exactly what these
guys are working with what TCP ports
are in existence and our online support
so for 170 2.30 dot 0.11
we have a few additional you have port
22 and port 80 port 111 and 3389 again
so let's see if we can find anything
more interesting ssh may HTTP been there
done that so 11 and 12 have similar or
identical rather services whoo dock 15
show me what you're working with
we have port 21 open ftp a highly
exploitable port we have some unknowns
here we have LDAP Kerberos security open
very interesting so in our final porch
we have a few more a few more unknowns
but point dot 15 hmm if I were a bad guy
probably start here as far as further
investigation so you will notice again
that the since can can identify the
services but not the versions of these
applications right so you see this
version box on all of these hosts that
I'm clicking yeah not popping it but
what if we want to show even more detail
about the versions now there is a
command for that we're gonna go back up
here to that little s big s we're gonna
get rid of that and what are you gonna
do an uppercase o
and now this command is for an OS and
operating system fingerprint scan so
let's go ahead and see what that's all
about it just gonna let it do its thing
here again excluding my machine which is
the - - exclude 172 3.0.2 the dot - is
my machine I can find all of this stuff
easily by because I have physical access
to it
and then this number is the subnet it is
scanning everything in that subnet which
is these three devices and we have
lift-off guy as I'm seeing little
penguins here so that tells me we're
working with some Linux stuff so let's
start out with this Linux box here so
and then we'll go to host details
perhaps yep see these little penguins
that means this is a Linux machine it
tells you the OS down here but notice -
I want to point out that it's not a
hundred percent accurate Xen map and end
map
actually it's and now that's that's the
the engine behind then map and map is
guessing and has if there's a 98%
probability that this is Linux
conversely let's find something that's a
hundred percent conversely this Windows
box which is actually a Windows Server
2008 sp1 or Windows 8 100% certainty we
have a little random up here too so as
you see each of these hosts has been
identified with the probability pretty
cool and it's keeping our remember that
first scan we did it just gave us the
MAC address and the IP well that stuff
is still here see the one seven two to
three desert eleven is here MAC address
is there Linux box 98% certainty plus it
has ports listed OS classes TCP sequence
which tells you index 254 we're gonna be
honest don't know how I could exploit
this or what this is a question for a
supervisor comments and whatever has
anything to say okay pretty cool so
let's get back to what this
documentation in this lab has to say
this is our official document that we're
gonna be sticking to that I need to be
sticking to and not getting off track
it's very easy easy if you're the
curious it's how you pick to look at all
this information but I have to stay
focused in this theoretical situation
because I'm getting paid for it not
to tickle my fancy with investigating
other things I can do that when I'm off
the clock so back to what we're actually
doing this scan discovered both open TCP
ports and made a guess at the operating
system for each post the OS icon in the
left pane changed as a result of that
guess the Penguins for hosts 11 and dot
twelve here here represent Linux
machines and the windows for dot 15 and
17 here here represent Windows machines
so let's go back to this mystery meat
here mmm
operating system met year DG 8 3 4 G of
the web or Western Digital WD TV media
player hmm interesting
that's the operating systems name 96
percent certainty so according to Zen
map there is a 4 percent chance that
this is an accurate and looking at the
documentation here telling me that the
OS scan has not identified this host as
either Linux or Windows what Apple gets
no love in fact this machine is a Linux
Cali distribution ok I thought was Kali
Linux ok but they they were getting all
cyber security nerd on us saying it's a
Linux Kali distribution you know the
hacking box so it's a Linux flavor that
specializes in hacking so there hmm
so this kind of gives me the indication
that there might be somebody with some
software in an operating system that
really shouldn't be on here this is an
enterprise network so what the hell is a
Kali Linux machine doing on this
enterprise network that runs the Linux
Apache servers and Windows 2008 and 2012
I am suspicious hopefully we get to come
back to that so let's go what do we do
now what pretty much covered all this
they wanted us to just look at the
hosted details here but we pretty much
investigated all this what is this
ticking time-bomb thing not cool so now
we are gonna do one more thing one more
command we're gonna get rid of this
capital o and then we're going to early
we're gonna type SV no I didn't hit skin
now in this sin in rather let me start
over and the sin scan from earlier that
we did Zen map ID'd the services running
on the machines but not the versions
this scan this thing I just typed in the
small case s uppercase V V is for
versions so it's gonna discover the
versions of the software on open TCP
ports and we'll make a guess at the OS
based on the services so but unlike the
fingerprint oh scam the service sv scan
can provide a more detailed OS version
so spoiler alert this scan theoretically
will be able to detect the operating
system on 1 7 2.30 dot 0.7 is Linux but
this level of detail will take a little
longer to run than previous scans I'm
already noticing right away that this SV
is taking longer than other scans but
it's a little more intense so it's going
through trying to make sense of what
versions these two Linux boxes are on
these two Windows boxes are on and then
what this mystery meat which is
apparently kali linux is on but will it
say Kali anywhere I wonder is it Kali I
never know how to pronounce these things
and end up looking like a total rube I'm
just gonna go with Kali California
California Linux yeah not at all okay so
our scan is complete and now we are
gonna click 17.3 is 0.07 which has
already been clicked and now we're gonna
go to courts and
hosts ah as you see this says Debian
which is a Linux flavor so I don't know
why this documentation is saying we have
a Kali Linux Kali Linux because it
doesn't say anywhere on here that is the
case but again that's what supervisors
are for and if this situation were in
real life I'd ask him or her about the
discrepancy between this and the
documentation so as we see imports and
hosts the versions for these are up so
for port 22 TCP SSH the version is
OpenSSH 6.0 p1 debian for protocol 2.0
okay I see what they're saying so it's
not telling you this still won't tell
you if this is Linux whatever Mint
Ubuntu Kali Kali it tells you Linux here
Linux but nothing more specific as to
the flavor but here it does tell you the
version of the port and the service the
service rather tell you the version of
the service so as you can see this HTTP
the version is Apache which is Linux
based which would make sense because
these two are Linux boxes and then
finally down here this matches the
versions with all these services and of
course cross-referencing you can see a
little windows you can barely see it
once if I can zoom in barely see it but
these are little windows so that
verifies that this is indeed the Windows
machine right here and so is this sweet
alright guys so that is that what we're
gonna do what are we gonna click scan
we're gonna save this we're gonna save
it to a directory so we're going to
click scan save all scans to directory
in order to navigate to security
strategy
she's folder and then don't actually go
back in this thing
is there no back button let's go back
here to security strategies we're gonna
create a folder right here today I want
a scanners scans go ahead and save
can't save file okay
do I need to go one up man I'm about to
go ape on this thing one up for didn't
save all scans to directory try this
again secure strategies what's the
inventory this doesn't make any sense
maybe okay how much for this one more
time if I can't get it we'll just move
on this is kind of time-consuming doing
this and not showing you guys from this
let's try this ok can we maybe do this
can you maybe work with me it is an
insecurity strategies but all right guys
last time like last time last time gonna
try this
okay not gonna do it the inventory will
not be saved we're just gonna minimize
that maybe I'll give it another go for
part three I think we do reference this
in the last part of the lab okay so
mostly without a hitch we scan a network
with Zen map you got to see the
different commands and how that sniffs
out the other hosts on your network very
cool utility so now for part two we're
gonna conduct a vulnerability scan with
open boss let me give you a little intro
here open boss and similar tools perform
vulnerability assessments of UNIX
windows and network infrastructures and
can perform a network discovery of
devices operating systems applications
databases and services running on those
devices these tools are typically used
to complete the standing and
vulnerability assessment phase of the
ethical hacking process once the network
mapping scan him which we conducted
earlier in part 1 of this lab is
completed conducting a vulnerability
scan on entire subnets can be noisy
making them easily detected and
time-consuming and we can limit the
breadth and scope of the scan by
specifying the hosts we want to scan in
a simple text file ok so to save some
time and save some power both
computationally speaking and manpower
speaking we are going to create a simple
text file and identify the host we want
to scan we're gonna be very precise with
what we want to scan so we're just gonna
go to our desktop here we're gonna go
new text I'm gonna type target's text to
now we're gonna open it in text editor
just then don't panic
the only do not pad text editor notepad
yeah
we're gonna type the IP address is
discovered by nmap okay so go back to
send up 170 2.30 it does they're not
seven let's try and do this here and
again these are the addresses not my
workstation but the other IP addresses
that were discovered by Zen map in the
first part of this lab so we're just
gonna go down the list you know we're
gonna do we're gonna work smarter not
harder and you said I'm doing I'm just
pasting and then changing the last two
numbers to identify our hosts check it
over once I would you got 30 days there
son
Don 11 got 12.15 17 looks good let's
just check our documentation to make
sure yes that's not helping
check your documentation make sure it
matches we are on the right track boom
alright and now we're gonna do final
exit save and now let's just go ahead
and minimize this we might use it again
I don't remember if we do but it's
always good just keep it on standby so
we're gonna go ahead and open and open
boss okay so there's a problem with the
website security certificate are we
going to get jammed or what yep
we are the documentation says we will
get jammed so we're gonna click continue
to this website not correct not
recommended I hate doing that you see
that big red X you're just like dude
come on
but we're gonna go ahead and click that
finally loaded and now so I want to make
sure um make this clear because I had
some confusion about this as well that
open boss is the scanning engine with
the green bones security assistant which
you see right here is actually the web
interface
- how is nmap is the interface but nmap
is the engine will open boss is the
engine here and green bone security
system is the graphical user interface
so we're gonna go ahead and sign in with
our credentials and if your password is
as simple is this one please tell
somebody about it and change it Pass is
not an acceptable password anywhere we
don't want to store that why hello
welcome to your user okay so now we're
gonna go up to configuration we're gonna
go ahead and navigate to targets now we
are going to click the blue star icon in
the targets header to create a new
target which I believe is that that's a
blue star right is that a target icon or
blue star argon icon in a target header
indeed it is go ahead and click that and
in the name box we're gonna type in this
is P which is the subnet actually we're
gonna type in the subnet sorry for this
network which is one seven three that's
zero zero obviously your results and
your name will vary for your own subnet
and in the host section we're gonna
click from file radio button we're gonna
click browse oh god this is the moment
of truth is this that I hope this is the
text file okay this is this is the text
file perfect and I think that was on the
desktop so again this was the list of IP
addresses we scanned in Zen map that I
made in a text file so we could hyper
focus on those hosts so we're gonna go
ahead and open that and then do we do
anything with the court lifts or
comments we're gonna go ahead and create
target and now we're gonna go select
stand management now that we have okay
see here our hosts have loaded
our text that is freaking cool okay so
it loaded our text file of ip's a host
addresses so now we're gonna go up to
scan management we're gonna go on your
tasks we're gonna go over here the
navigate over to the name box and
instead of unnamed we're gonna type scan
172 dot 0 0 again this is the subnet I
don't think we need to comment on
anything nothing here it needs to be
messed with
so we're gonna go ahead and create boss
oh cool so now the scan 1 7 2 2 3 X 0 x
0 which we just named appears in the
task table on the Greenville and
security assistant homepage suite we are
going to click the start task button
which is the green arrow here and we're
gonna start scanning let's scan it baby
so it's getting queued up it's doing its
thing
and we are going to watch and wait
hey guys we are back that took about a
half hour do not expect a one-and-done
that was pretty intense
so now we're gonna get back to it step
23 we're gonna go ahead and ooh yeah 23
we're gonna go ahead and click this as
you can see the threat was listed as
high and the task details appear at the
top of the page followed by the reports
section so we're gonna use the scroll
bar to locate the report section we're
gonna go over here yeah yeah why not
okay disregard we're going to review the
results of the full report by clicking
the details I come and now we're going
to click the first download icon in the
report summary section to download the
full report and the PDF format
and then we're gonna click the down
arrow on save and go save and we're
gonna try going back to this about
perfect
I'm actually not perfect we're gonna go
to see drawings security strategies
we're gonna save this
and now we have been a close yes good
yeah we're gonna be out a green loan
that's our completed task there sorry
guys this the 30 minutes of waiting and
a pot my last brain cell so we conducted
an open vulnerability pardon me miss
turtle but we conducted a vulnerability
scan with open boss and the best is yet
to come because we downloaded the full
report there's gonna be a lot of good
stuff in here we have five high risk
items forging the medium risk and 21 low
risk that's a lot so we're gonna go
ahead and get out of here and go to part
three of this which is the evaluation go
ahead analyze now we are gonna go to
this piece see you go back to security
strategies ooh
Marconi's the screwball because you know
what I'm gonna go ahead and try saving
this again on the desktop
boom okay cool so my kid like Zen back
uh-oh errors occurred well you will deal
with those as they happen and as they
pop up so we're gonna go ahead and open
up our and next and which is our first
scanner didn't number way back when we
did that first scan which was just the
pain so we're gonna go ahead and open
this and since these are just XML files
and then how do they want us to open
these next perhaps oh so weird so this
is the scan report one of the first one
we get it any exploited second one this
is pretty me opens right up in the
browser oh this is really neat this is
really cool just for just for
completeness sake so again these are all
the stands we did on the five hosts it
does an XML document we went and opened
in the internet browser Internet
Explorer that is pretty sweet
so now we're gonna go to the
vulnerability scan which we saved you're
gonna go ahead and open this up
so this is the report created by the
open boss application and it's an
overview and details for each host so we
have results
it's just minimizes to see up Oh so plus
that 1 7 2 . 30 that's here about 7
that's our first post and then died 11 a
second host and as you can see I'm not
gonna go through item by item but as you
can see each host has a breakdown of the
threats so each host on my sub on the
sub Network with sub network is that
right kind of seriously about 30 minutes
of waiting for that open boss that put
me over the edge every computer we
scanned in Zen map now appears on here
and every threat per the computer is
carbon compartmentalized so we can go
ahead and read everything about this
let's just go ahead and then we'll move
on but I want to show you the high
threat font once it into that 3.0 that 7
vendor security updates are not trusted
ooh remember that guys that 3 3 8 9 open
port I was like I have no idea what this
is yeah it's a high threat because it
gives you someone here this force is
running RDP and is prone page to
information the scores revolver ability
and the flaw is due to RDP server which
stores an honest a private key use for
signing a terminal server's public key
in the DLL library which allows remote
attackers to calculate a valid signature
and further perform a man little attack
to obtain sensitive information
okay so this is the national
vulnerability database run is sponsored
by the Department of Homeland Security
oops
are you know weird-feeling using this
product but this is what we are using
for this lab and it's pretty good
database from my preliminary research I
can't tell you anything conclusive but
let's go back to the virtual machine
here and we're gonna type in so one of
these vulnerabilities on here
I'm already steam populated in this a
vulnerability scan there is a certain
vulnerability we use the function here
to find something that's really funny
so it's CVE 2005 - 17
okay so this is a high-threat Wow
so on host 172 30 got 0.11 there was a
high-threat is this the 3389 use there's
the one I had my eyes on the whole time
isn't it where was it so the CVE
reference is CBE - 2005 1794 and that is
what you would type in over at the CVE
database which was that Department of
Homeland Security database and this was
for let's just see what okay so this was
this was war machine 117 up 13-0 got 11
and the vulnerability is is high for
this Ms where the tea server WBT server
on port 3 3 8 9 so again the reason the
way we found that was that we were just
reading about the host and about the
high risks the high vulnerabilities and
so the reference here for the
information I've done there so it's that
information we're going back to the CDE
ok first copy and paste that
see you 2005 17
and now this should pop up with that
Microsoft web tea whatever yeah sure did
so here's the summary it was published
in 2005 not surprising Microsoft with a
12 year old vulnerabilities still
floating around it shows you the impact
references to advisory solutions and
tools and content technical details
pretty sweet so check this website out
if you are using open boss and you can
research it through that report pretty
cool pretty cool
so it says review the additional
information use the scroll bar to
display the references section compare
the information in the database to that
provided by open boss the same
references are listed but open boss
simplifies the discovery again that is
the CBE database site and I will include
it actually in the description box seems
like a pretty obscure site maybe it's
just because I'm a beginner it's
national vulnerability database lots of
information here helpful to boot alright
guys thanks for watching this is the
spoiler alert spongebob is going to be
in the final video here thanks for
watching and I hope this was helpful
let's just go through all the things we
did today I know this is kind of a
whopper of a video but pretty awesome
stuff from start to finish so we used
open boss and Zen map and then assess
the findings of the vulnerability
assessments can after you know waiting
anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour
depending on what you're scanning we
even customized Network addresses we
wanted to scan so it wouldn't we can get
more precisely target or hosts and
generated a report from open boss this
is something professional-looking how
cool is that we didn't even have to type
anything on here it looks like we're
real pro all right guys thanks for
tuning in hope this video was helpful
hope you learned a little bit I don't
