tough candy calm back in the saddle with
you today is Thursday March 9 2017 a
very interesting couple of days in the
world of cyber security
what with WikiLeaks vault 7 and so on
lots of good stuff in those papers let's
talk about what we're going to be doing
today we are configuring a virtual
private network server just the server
today we're going to hopefully do a
video soon to configure the client for
the VPN but today is just going to be
the server now this is going to be a
whopper of a video I'm telling you right
now I was doing some preliminary reading
over our steps involved today I'm
setting this up and unfortunately not
unfortunately but just to give you a
disclaimer can't really cut steps today
and I'm excited about that because this
is going to be one of the most thorough
labs the real tough scandi channel has
done on any sort of tech topic so use
what you can use it all if you're a
beginner beginner great if you're an
intermediate or even advanced they need
to brush up on your skills you guys are
welcome to so thanks so much for joining
me today in this adventure today's tools
and software or simply going to be using
putty and the open Swan VPN and upon
completion of this lab hopefully we will
be able to configure the server side of
a Linux Debian open Swan VPN
we're going to be able to describe the
advantages and disadvantages of
different VPN configuration options and
finally we're going to be able to
discuss how to prevent attacks against
data and transit using a properly
configured VPN so if you're watching
this video you probably know what a VPN
does and all the basics but just to
brush you up VPN is a private network
that enables remote users such as
partners customers employees and so on
to leverage the inherently insecure
public Internet can to connect to an
enterprises private network resources in
a secure manner so if you've seen those
whiteboard presentations and people draw
figures or graphics of the Internet it's
always depicted as a
cloud and that's what they're referring
to here this little blurb is that the
Internet is an untrusted collection of
stuff we don't know about we have no
idea what's up in there so in order to
combat that or kind of you know make our
way through that in a more safe and
secure manner we tunnel through that
just envision is the secure tunnel going
through that big cloud and that tunnel
is the VPN that the VPN connection
rather so the VPN is typically built
using keys and certificates which must
also be kept secure but as we saw in the
case of Edward Snowden who partially
comprised keys and certificates and
created and use false credentials you
can exploit a VPN that way it can also
be exploited through hair pinning which
is the unauthorized access of a computer
connected to a VPN usually by malicious
software but sometimes by active hacking
so you know if there's a software that's
loaded onto a computer connected to a
VPN that malware is going to go into the
tunnel as valid traffic rather than you
know envisioning this hacker trying to
pawn his way and claw his way through
the tunnel they're going they're
starting from the beginning so they
weasel their way in and get in your
traffic through that way and then the
lab explains down here that VPNs are
often and establish and administer
administrator administrators we try that
again
VPNs are often established and
administered by network ops or system
admins with little or no security
training I don't need to go into a bad
juju of that so that said let's go to
our steps again we're configuring the
server side of the Linux Debian open
salon VPN let's get to it
so step one configuring the VPN and just
to give you some background this is a
virtual desktop here and we are going to
be double-clicking putty Exe open that
application window and then
we're going to navigate over here and
type in the IP address of the Linux
Debian open salon VPN server which my
documentation has provided me I'm not
guessing here I do have this as
documentation so that's always good
let's go into that 30.0 dot 100 and then
we want to make sure SSH is selected and
then we are going to just simply hit the
open button now putty wants us to log in
so I'm going to use my credentials you
log in a student password alright
awesome we are in the server we are in
the Debian Linux machine in the student
as a student in the student account and
now in order to configure this VPN we
need to have super user known as su
privileges so basically super user is
nearly the same as root there are small
nuance differences that's on my area of
expertise but for example I think when
you're on the super user each command
gets logged whereas with root it's a
little different doesn't work that way
but you know for functionality for
simplicity sake consider this very
similar to root so we're going to type
in tour for the little wait a minute
first you have to go to super user so
we're just going to put su and now they
want to password password is very simple
I don't recommend doing that okay
oh so it did give us root AO please
disregard everything I just said about
super user and root again beyond my
scope of knowledge so the open tslot
software has actually already been
installed on the server by our system
admin theoretically so in these next
steps we're just going to use the IPSec
verify command to make sure the IPSec is
properly installed and working we're
going to be using something called get
this the IPSec Lac command to check for
any existing VPN tunnels and then we're
going to update the IPSec configuration
file so
we could do that and this prompt we
simply type in sex verify check if
that's good to go okay so we're getting
a lot of okay's we have one disabled
opportunistic encryption support is
disabled disabled and we're seeing no
failures there so that's cool all right
and then the IPSec verify side bar here
explains each check in detail so for
example checking that Pluto is running I
don't think they mean the planet
formerly known as Pluto so we're going
to reference this little key here I'm
really curious what's the heck is gluto
okay that's a the daemon that performs
the internet key exchange functions
configured with the bill is called Pluto
and it's running okay so if you guys
have a few minutes after this lab you're
interested go ahead and come back to
this mark in the video and this will
explain more about what these checks are
in the IPSec verify command okay cool
cool so now we're going to use a thing
called if sec wack status commands you
display the status of the IPSec
installation and verify the status of
any existing tunnels prior to
configuring this particular VPN tunnel
now title panel setup can be done either
manually or automatically automatic
config is done by accepting a software
as a default configuration and contrary
to common practice in most cases of
manual configurations easier and
actually less error-prone and gives the
security engineer
more control and open swan
however the automatic approach is
usually preferred so that is the
approach we're going to be taking in
this lab where I was hoping to do some
manual stuff okay so I want to read this
blue section further here because it's
very important so prior to beginning
this configuration process there is one
serious security consideration so take
heed what happens and I know for me
since I'm an intermediate beginner
this is probably going to happen what if
I accidentally make a configuration
change or select something improperly or
you know trip and hit a button or
improperly documented any of those
actions could cause the two systems to
stop communicating with each other and
it's sort of like locking your keys in
your car or your house but if you left
the back door unlocked or hit a key
under a mat you'd be able to access the
house and so the other thing is in this
situation in an IT situation if you
don't mind the system being less secure
you can do the same thing but in most
cases systems are most secure if either
two people with admin rights are
physically sitting each at the local and
remote keyboards or both systems are
physically brought to the same place so
that one person with admin rights has
access to both systems either option is
valid or the second approach is the most
secure in other words the best case
scenario would be we have bulk systems
brought to you the same location with
admin rights to do you're staying in to
access to both systems just had it had
to give that disclaimer important side
information to remember so now we're
going to do a tip sex it's sex back in
the command for that is its act wh ack
and then we're going to do two dashes
and status okay a lot of stuff popping
up right here a lot of stuff okay just
take a quick peek at that
okay so all of this is to say that the
first part of the IPSec wax status
results confirms that net key is used as
the protocol stack and explains how the
interfaces are configured the results
also indicate that debugs mode is turned
off so we're going to go back up here
and try to find that net key I'm not
going to take too much time to find it
just because they're still issue but
here it is you can see right here net
key okay and this again these are status
results if psych wax status results
confirming that net key is used as the
protocol stack and then explains how the
interfaces are configured for example we
have an Ethernet here 1 7 2000
debug mode is turned off and now the
second part here you can't really see it
let me highlight some of this stuff the
second part of the IPSec whack status
results it's some of us which VPNs are
allowed and which ones are disallowed
the warning message here points out that
no VPN subnets are disallowed so we need
to pay close attention to the list of
allowed V P ends and you can see the
addresses here these two are allowed
let's try and sign those here we go so
we already have 2 VPNs that are allowed
with these addresses or I guess maybe
these means I don't know which is more
proper term for that okay so these are
ipv6 addresses so yes indeed these are
addresses here of the VPN whereas these
guys are ipv4 with inner classless
inter-domain routing designations CIDR
we're just going to confirm with our
documentation that we are seeing the
same thing in DDR cool ok very cool so
now there's a third part of this it's a
'quack status specify the configuration
of all possible ARP SPS which are
encapsulating security payload and ESP
authorization attributes so we're going
to be seeing ESP use offs and age
CRS as you can see right here off ESP
and Kabbalistic scroll over let's just
like this window point to make this
little bigger you can see everything
there we go okay
so we're seeing that all these guys here
and the ESP encryption configurations
includes a name and initialization of
vector lengths what else minimum and
maximum key sizes which is key 5 min T
cells max I did just see that up there
somewhere just want to make sure again
this is matching on documentation who
are not screwing anything up to terribly
okay yeah there we see the I ve lem
which is initialization effector links
no maximum key sizes and so on okay and
then we have the final part with these
the final part of the results way down
there for the DISA standard out here
which are the I kgs internet key
exchange so these results show the
configuration of the allowable I say II
types so the first thing we see is the
encryption algorithm the block size and
key lengths and then the results
displayed a hashing algorithms and hash
size the diffie-hellman group and bit
length follow and finally database
statistics the sing the highlights are
showing pretty cool guys all this stuff
delineated here the oakley group and
some pretty complex in volt seven stuff
if you ask me but this is all laid
before us again encryption algorithm
block size and key lengths and then the
result displaying the hashing algorithm
and flash size and be if you helm any
group local group give V Shulman 24 and
if it when follow and the data do
stitches
all right looking good this lab
documentation notes there's no perfect
way to configure VPN and the absolute
correct configuration depends on the
news of your organization and
environment but for the sake of this lab
according to what my boss means we're
going to establish what's called a host
to host VPN it's also called a host the
host tunnel so we are going to look at
this diagram just because I know to this
I'm so learning so I want to get a nice
visual representation of what's going on
here and as I started out explaining in
this video whatever you see this
ominous-looking puff it is a dark cloud
of unknown cold in turn left so here's
our tongue this is what we're
configuring the VPN over here is the
Linux machine here's our client when we
need to get through this ominous death
and destruction and god knows what to
get cleanly and securely and safely
through to our remote machine okay so
we're reviewing this and the side round
follows the convention of placing the
VPN server on the left and the virtual
workstation on the right the left side
of the diagram is usually reserved for
the local machine which is the one we're
working on and the right side the remote
machine makes it easier to remember
because the first letter of left is else
as is local and then on the right our
right arm for remote and just as a
reminder most of you guys notice it's
important remember that these machines
can have any old name Tom Jerry real
tough candy whatever but the convention
of left and right issues in okay so we
ID'd the machines in this graphic and
now our next step is to create the
configuration file which is going to be
called its x.com F configuration conf
and as the case as this occasionally let
me start over as is the case with most
VPN software packages the configure
file / open swan is configured by
entering a series of configuration
statements using a general purpose text
editor like the VI editor with which
ships with Debian 7 and I saw their
software packages that use menus and
other GUI devices to make the job easier
for less knowledgeable users but the
command-line approach can actually be
faster and easier we'll see about that
although it is common practice for
experienced security engineers to sit
down and enter commands from memory or
scraps of paper you go and earn you go
to the uber innards those are the guys
with eight figures to their name well
this should be in wind because they're
so damn smart and talented these
security engineers start from the
existing configuration file and edit to
create a new file but it's bad practice
that can often lead to lengthy
troubleshooting and sometimes two errors
that can go undetected but leave a
system vulnerable to certain times the
text so basically that eight figure
yearly salary just went down to about
five figures because you put your
commands on scraps of pizza napkins not
recommended so strongly met recommended
best practice begin fresh you create a
new configuration file each time so that
is what we are going to do we're going
to create a new configuration file using
the open Swan host the host
configuration worksheet we're going to
generate a set of commands we need to
create a new configuration file so we're
going to minimize this I don't think we
they tell us in this documentation to
get rid of this I don't think they did
nope
so we are going to just minimize this we
might need it later don't know but right
now we're going to open up this
configuration icon okay here's our sent
they sat down minimize the putti window
so weren't we minimize buddies and now
we are opening up this configuration
worksheet whew what's this this looks
kind of janky guys I don't know this
looks a little 2005 ish I don't know and
this was looking real rush I'm
OpenOffice calculator
dear God couldn't you Oh
okay we're going to know what we're not
going to complain about it because we're
getting paid theoretically we're on the
clock the boss man is waiting so a
little less chitchat a little more doing
so now the spreadsheet will generate the
correct spacing syntax required to
create the new if set configuration file
and now we're going to review the
instructions on the top of the
worksheets before proceeding wow it's
really hard to read actually so our name
we're going to go real tough candy so in
the values to create the configuration
statements and column a okay exclude
statements by placing an uppercase Y and
column E soul over here okay
there's Colony lines beginning with the
pound sign or comments only and executed
by tip SEC only fills in red may be
changed while she just lost to create a
new configuration file in the
spreadsheet type VI dash etc god I
cannot read this guys and I've won blind
type VI etc if that confidence helps
command line highlight on text and
column a right-click the highlighted
area okay and so on and so far I'm not
going to go through all of this we want
to configure this a Oh
not so fast okay so in cell two of the
spreadsheet we got that part done we're
going to just click out of here or not
okay you know what I'm going to pull
this over don't we typed our name
perfect and cell b20 we're going to type
two all the way down here then your
entry we're going to type two to
identify the specification version that
the file conforms to this statement is
required in configuration files after
version one so this is second version
and now we're going to go down to d23
and we're going to type in percentage
sign default note let's just go over
here so I'm not just like being a code
monkey
it here's what it says or explicit IP
addresses of interfaces percentage sign
default row will fill in the required IP
address at runtime so we're making our
job easier because this entry is having
the actual braise off of the operation
ie the computer fill in the required IP
address at runtime pretty sweet and then
again the - I did a clinical just to go
back to reiterate this is required of
you know any versions after one and this
is the second version so now we're going
to go to s you know just I just pull
this over - oh my goodness
oh let's see what's the best way to do
this probably feel bad birthday okay you
know what what is over like this in X 24
we're going to type Y to exclude the
clips debug configuration statements 0.4
okay there's a here's something
interesting we're trying to do a capo
why there we go okay in his life why do
you hurt me
okay never got that capital y so is we
found out the beginning of this is it
fellas up here somewhere
what's the capital y was C Y okay so why
is basically exclude is the command for
exclude and what exactly are we
excluding we are excluding the clips
debug all okay so now you're going to go
to cell F 25 to the Pluto debug the
configuration statement
so we'll go right over here
and if this were a real-life situation I
definitely be asking my supervisor if
you can please do something to update
this configuration sheet as far as the
interface goes this is just this is a
mess let's understand I'm typing full
stop showing up should I highlight is
No okay all right guys for the sake of
time and just because this is
theoretical I did put a why there I'm
following the documentation the first
why I type doesn't pop up but it's going
around like there's a character there so
we're going to assume there's a why
there there's no idea when it's doing
that to me all right
well as soon as there we go okay we
popped out it is that sweet okay
so as far as the Pluto debug which is
what we just excluded unless we're asked
to do so by a developer or you know
high-ranking security analyst this to
man should not be enabled okay
so Excel do 26 we're going to type the
following jump directory let's just see
I want to be totally a code monkey here
or rather a cyber security monkey just
being an idiot you know but if I'm
getting paid for that I'm going to be
doing that but you know sometimes a
little gray matter here and there little
analog thinking is good too so dump
directory we are going to specify the
dump directory this is not required but
it's good practice to include a dump
directory statement so again this is um
F jeepers D 26 to 26 we're going to type
/var 4/1 orange slash pluto we're going
to leave exit 27 blank to include the N
80 NAT traversal statement network
address translation statement traversal
Satan rather this statement is not
required in the virtual lab because
there's no NAT gateway in this
configuration that let alone one to be
traversed so we're not going to mess
with that it's included in a spreadsheet
because it's common in most VPN
configuration so what's the statement
would do 27 if I were to type something
in here for manual entry
for NAT traversal for that statement it
would a lot or tell open salon to
properly handle the unencrypted header
information pre-prep ended to preppin
guys the hell visit can you please use
English in these things this is a course
for beginners prep ended to encrypted if
sex packets that must traverse snappy
these guys I still begin are going to be
totally transparent I don't know what
the hell that means I'm probably going
to ask my boss and you can tell me in a
more succinct manner so we're just going
to stick with our documentation not
overanalyze it we're going to leave so
f27 blank suite we're going to leave
that one blank all right moving on and
sell d28 d28 let's go over to d28 what
are we working with pono sack we are
going to select auto see there's a
drop-down right here we have our choice
of Clips net fee or auto or induce Auto
to allow the protocol stack to be
selected dynamically the net key or
clips protocol stacks may be specified
or the protocol stack can be selected
dynamically the default is net key if no
protis x equals statement exists if both
ends have proto stack these will auto or
if there is a conflict so moving right
along we're going down to so c 30 right
here we're going to type percentage sign
oh they want us to go that way but we're
going to the percentage sign default to
add the section title that begins the
group of commands that configures the
security associations essays and related
tunnels for negotiating key admin and
then the second con selection section
second con section rather in c 42 so
we'll work our way down here see right
here man this spreadsheet and yeah i'm
trying much complaining to be honest it
really sucks
Khanh west right okay and that's in c42
right here it's going to create the
section title that begins the group of
commands that configures the actual
tunnel between the local left and remote
right machines that are used to securely
to securely carry the users information
so remember that oh that's nice eh
that graphic we were looking at let's
not remember that graphic refuse
anything else we held a nothing go coop
right to the cloud so in event c42
server yep so this okay I was on the
wrong one guys sorry about that
so just left right again this creates
the section title that begins the group
of commands that configures the actual
tunnel the actual VPN funnel that's
saying that hackers are trying to saw
their way into between the local machine
on the left and the remote on the right
and in our case again we're working on
the local left machine which is the
Linux Debian server so we're going to go
to C 31 we're going to come back up here
to be 31 we're going to select ignore
the default auto situation statement and
egg 1 so we're going to go to C 32 we're
going to review the options in the cells
drop-down menu some of this stuff
probably looks familiar
secrets well that's probably bought it
Oh Oh RSA that looks familiar I was like
raw egg what is that it's RSA I juice
the default authentication method is
actually RSO signatures which is our ASI
G right here but we are going to what do
they actually they want to review these
options but what are we actually going
with let's read further to see what with
what when we're actually going with for
the authentication method so F 32 before
you okay really destined to blank
another option is to use a PS k or
more sophisticated approach like RSA PSK
has chosen often though because it
appears to be easier to set up but a
passphrase or even a string of random
keyboard characters use and the PS can
be correct fairly easily with modern
techniques and hardware
conversely RSA creates he's using an
algorithm that intentionally creates
keys that are much harder to crack there
are ways to make PSK more secure but in
this lab you will use our okay guys
that's some time I with brain with a
gray madacorp the analog a little bit of
critical thinking reading between the
lines
they say the default authentication is
RSA but they don't explicitly tell us in
our documentation what to use sure for
this form its default RSA but nothing
was specified however as we feed on here
there are ways to make PSK more secure
but in this lab you will use RSA so
we're going to go to race RSA hi geez
now we are going to go to cell C 33 C 33
we're going to select three des from the
drop down menu to establish designer IPS
anchors we're going to leave cell F 33
which we don't mess with X for a long
time which is fine by me we're going to
leave s 33 blank to include if the
command okay and C 34 moving right along
we are going to go to md5 just specify
the i ke hash and cell a 33 we sell f34
the why exclude separate I can't use
hashes basements what's just ensure that
is the case so they said that is plus 34
guys I know how riveting you must be at
this point if this is where you actually
flesh it out so
obviously your sheet is not going to
look like this it might vary wildly it
might vary define a little bit but I
know this stuff is probably oh my god
can you please just set it up already
but this is the guts of it yes a lot of
it is snooze worthy I admit it's no I
don't know I can't even compare anything
to it it's pretty damn dry put it out
there but very important to do so you
cannot skip this critical step so if
anything that you love you your feet wet
and your eyes ready to deal with this
kind of stuff we are almost done
techno that looks a little overwhelming
but it's just credit soms letting a few
more drop downs and we're out here so
we're going to go to Seoul c35 we're
going to select M ODT 1024 from self
drop down to specify the i ke PFS group
in Phil 833 again F in D 1024 and the Y
excludes a separate i ke PFS group
statement over here in a 3 wait a minute
stacking it right it's in cell F 37 okay
wait a minute
going on now I can't be too hasty in
this so f 30 okay f-35 my bad I did not
see a Y over here to start a panic there
is a y here perfect that Y excludes it
separate i ke fashion statement
we're does it exclude separate ij8 PF s
group statements my bad everything is
starting to look the same at this point
my eyes is over but god this is tedious
okay so we selected m OTP 1024 sweets
we're going to go to F 36 now we're
going to select that row scroll on over
to F
six try and take why inherent to explode
the phase two algorithms statements that
one popped out okay that was speech in
cell C 37 c 37 how we're going to review
the options which effects that we
already did this like I said this is
starting my eyes are starting to glaze
over and I would probably take a break
at this point but this is a real-time
video that were recording so I'm
pressing on we're going to type Y over
on F 37 they just want to take a peek at
our options here I have definitely done
my share of speaking for this so we're
going to go ahead and go on over and we
are going to attend why because this Y
is accepting phase two combinations and
excluding a separate phase two ciphers
basic the things to take the phase two
statements will include the option
selected in the next two rows and
spreadsheet however in this lab we're
going to exclude these statements and
accept any default whose two combos so
now see 38 you guys I promise we're
almost to the promised land we're going
to review the options and d5 or sha-1
6mg five and then we are going to go
over here s 39
and you see this why look exclude the
separate phase to PFS group statements
and sell f40 check type y to exclude the
I Cain these statements pop that one in
there
boom sweet so c43 we're going to select
0 2 0 0 dot 0 finish drop-down to allow
any address on that side of the VPN to
work yes BPI now there are several
options for handling the left IP address
as one can see by selecting this
drop-down menu here and if you've wanted
to enter specific IP address you can
select IP this one right here and in the
options column
oops rather type the IP address in d4
uses so you would select this IP address
right here and then you would enter your
specific IP address right here in the G
column the t43 rather solve a43 sweet
sweet sell G 44 we're going to be typing
the following IP which is 170 2.30 dot 0
dot 0 slash forward slash 24 now this
address is subnet address remote machine
specified in the CIDR notation so that
is the one we're going to sticking with
again it's a subnet address for the
remote machine and so cd47 we're going
to select tunnel from the drop-down menu
winter options here and okay we have
passed through transport and tunnel
we're going to go with tunnels to
establish a VPN tunnel as the connection
type and we're going to leave
47 which is over here we usually type Y
or whatever not or whatever but you just
have Y and so gently 47 we randomly
blank to include the command and now
step 37 work guys we have a few more go
there is no left RSA signature
authentication fee for this lab so in
cell c4 th we're gonna select percentage
sign month and to include that man we
are going to leave out Y which it's
pretty counterintuitive Y always means
yes unless you are using this
configuration works worksheet which
means something's going these different
okay which means do not include kind of
queer okay so now guys all this work I
should have been saving or periodically
because that was a lot of tedious work
we're going to go ahead and say that
we're going to just go stick it on the
desktop and we're going to do
select Microsoft Excel might be 7th 2001
we're going to select a file type stuff
oh oh that matches our documentation and
then just to ensure just to put our mark
on there we're going to put our name for
real time candy no one's going to touch
that boy and then go ahead and click
Save
we're going to go ahead and keep free
format
okay guys so quick edit there I went
ahead and copied these let's just copy
them again for good measure
blink we're gonna minimize this and we
are going to go back into potty because
we're going to be tweaking and copying
some stuff so I locked myself out and it
was 172 38.0 got 100 SSH perfect
go ahead welcome students and then
supervisor password okay so now we're
going to save a copy of the existing
existing configuration file always a
good idea to save it before beginning to
edit in case I need to restore the
original which in my case likelihood is
about 95 percent of that so we're going
to go ahead and just type this command 1
go ahead and press Enter oops
okay did something wrong no surprise
there are things you're burning with me
you guys made it this far holy crap and
then okay I didn't understand instead of
a dot underscore this one's an
underscore cause nothing that should
work it did so now we're going to go in
to the VI editor and open our existing
configuration Petra Cunha College okay
here we go and our configuration
colleagues cannot talk this is our
config setup right here so now we are
going to go ahead and type a
all right so now that is done and server
side as a VPN tunnel is configured in
order to test this connection the other
end of VPN has to be configured so this
is by no means a complete ready to go
VPN we only did half of it and we are
going to have to configure it on the
remote machine in order for the
configuration changes to take effect so
that's going to be a different lab
walkthrough it's going to be called the
VPN client for secure file transfers or
our my change of titles but I will tweet
that and put that on my youtube channel
when it is done the next two days or so
hope this was helpful any questions let
me know the lab the lab holy crap my
last brain cell is seriously it's blotto
this was an intense lab thanks for
watching it was a long one but was
helpful and we'll see in the next video
