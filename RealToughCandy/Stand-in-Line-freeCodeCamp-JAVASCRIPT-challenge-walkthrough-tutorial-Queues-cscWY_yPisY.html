candy back in the saddle with you today
we are working on free code camps basic
JavaScript stand in line challenge this
one is a real Tuffy sure there's only
six lines of code and you only really
need to code two more lines but as I've
been noticing every word in programming
in JavaScript it means something there
is no excess so let's get to it they
explain what Q is up here let's go right
to the directions if you're on free code
camp you can go through all this but
let's go to the meat of what we're
dealing with wants us to write a
function next in line which has which is
right up here and it takes an array
right here in a number right here as
arguments and this array is our ARR and
this number is known as item AB a number
to the end of the array then remove the
first element of array so this little
sentence right here is packed with
information we're actually going to be
extracting everything we need to code
just from the sentence so they finish
the rest of us we'll get right back to
it the next in line function should then
return the element that was removed so
all this stuff before I started this
problem was super overwhelming I like
I'll never figure this out there's all
this code what the heck is json
stringify I don't know but you got to
focus on what they're trying to tell you
to do not what this says number one add
the number to the end of the array so
that's one direction just in this one
sense and I don't mean the band that's
one thing we're going to do right now
the second thing is remove the element
or remove the first element of the array
so let's go back and work on this
instruction I'm seeing three things here
just in this little half sentence add
the number which is known as item right
up here
to the end of the array so what I'm
seeing from this is that adding
something to the end of the array and as
you know in arrays to add anything to
the end of an array is going to be a dot
push and conversely to get rid of the
last item in an array is dot pop as you
probably know so we got that okay dot
push or we're already getting there add
so what do they want us to add to the
end of this array the number so let's do
this first so the array in this little
block of code here is going to be known
as R as they explain written directions
because the function next in line takes
an array in parentheses arr so the AR R
stands for array add the number to the
end of the array so something is going
on the end of this array so you just
push once again means we're adding
something at the end okay but so you see
these parentheses something has to go in
here because there's one more thing they
want us to do which is add the number so
you're probably thinking what number
what number well if you go back to the
first sentence of what they wanted to do
you see this number is known as item
just like array is known as R so we're
going to add item
always with the same like home so that's
the first step that's the first half of
the sentence we already bang this first
half out huge right so now that we did
that half let's go down here because
they now want us to remove the first
element of the array so this half of the
sentence I'm seeing two things remove
first element of the array and as you
know to remove the first item of an
array s dot shift
and they want us to do the same thing
the array is known as a RR sort of date
RR shift does it say anything else no
it's just those two things remove the
first element of you right so we should
be good to go right let's keep on
reading the next in line of function
should then return the element that was
removed notice my little nagging tone
here because we got something more to do
we have to make this our duck shift into
a return so we're just going to get rid
of this this is just totally meaningless
it says change this line I said goodbye
this line oh I changed all right we're
going to put in return and turn red all
right the next in line function should
then return the element that was removed
and that's it let's see if all this
yammering has any sort of successful
results we're going to storm that castle
and down here is actually where all the
magic happens the function right here
pass with your test star comma six
notice down here this all compute
let's try nine we just relax oh
theoretically if i press this big clear
and green button or white and green
button this 90 will no will show up
right here in place of the six because
this six is this six so we're going to
keep an eye out on the six it should
turn into 90 let's see if it does yep
you see that we could even do something
ridiculous like I don't know sixty seven
billion perhaps whoa look at that
again too simple but critical lines of
code I hope this tutorial was helpful
you have any questions a it's kind of
the blind leading the blind but I hope
this was helpful we'll see you around on
the next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
