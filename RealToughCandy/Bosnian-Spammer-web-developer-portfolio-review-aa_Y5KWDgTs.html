9 years of experience looking for remote
work in your company some of my
portfolio websites that I designed and
developed www time in dev comm best day
Joseph Danny from know Jeff Danny calm
back online is you today just published
fresh blog post on a controversial topic
can you learn how to code using YouTube
to long didn't read no read all about my
reasoning along with two special
exceptions in the dev coding world on
YouTube over at my blog rediff.com that
said let's get into it got this email
from a developer today gotta say the
hustle is impressive the technique is
not spam message totally unsolicited
let's go look at this guy's portfolio
just to see if this spammer has what it
takes to get hired he has nine years of
experience and looking for remote work
day and props for your use of the purple
and pink gradient I love gradients
they're kind of getting to the point of
being in the realm of like CSS parallax
effects where just like ooh this is kind
of looking dated but it's still cool so
uh hold on while you still can buddy
this was like a standard layout for a
standard portfolio sites
what are you working with nine years
experience oh those 404s man I don't
know let's check out what you've been
doing with your portfolio now this is
your top draw this is the first item you
have here in your portfolio quit smoking
research you designed it you use html5
css3 PHP WordPress and jQuery so safe to
assume a wordpress be site that's
perfectly fine let's go see what it's
all about
loading pretty quick for a wordpress
site that's good
did you actually code this dan did you
do this I don't really know I some about
this is a little suspicious this looks
like a lot of work for one developer I
don't even know if myself and a teammate
could do all this we might have to
subcontract some of this stuff it's a
lot of stuff you gotta be taking care of
here quit smoking research calm all
right audience you tell me did this dude
code all that how are we looking for
responsiveness here oh of course it
looks brilliant so this tells me one of
two things you didn't do most of this or
you did do this and you have no reason
to be spamming me because these are
really nice-looking sites and you're
more reliable
to get better response rates and more
positive responses if you just apply to
jobs I'm not looking for remote workers
I'm not looking for WordPress developers
but I know a lot of employers who are Oh
polar bears when you spam people when
you spam people you're not giving the
readers of your email the confidence
they could have in your work Bosnia and
Herzegovina Mirza did you send this guy
my way is this mirza day and mirza
diamond dev calm
it might being pwned who's responsible
for this uh-oh
it's invalid good job going with the
email validation - awesome my email has
been sent hopefully we'll hear from them
soon is there a lesson to be had in this
video yes there is number one don't spam
number two if you're doing these really
snazzy looking websites and they look
too good to be true
you need to have a github repository or
some other way where people can look at
your code
ideally github otherwise people are
gonna doubt what you're doing like are
you sure you didn't copy and paste this
and have you given any reason for me to
believe that you did code all this hope
this video was helpful check out my
revenge website real tough candy calm
and we will see you in the next video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
