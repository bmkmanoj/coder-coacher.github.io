candy from real tough candy calm back in
the saddle with you today we are
iterating over a race with map over at
free code camp calm we are in the
object-oriented and functional
programming section right here about
halfway through right before that big
whopper basic algorithm scripting we're
gonna try and get this map method down
today and explain element by element
just what the heck is going on and how
it's useful and you're going to be able
to see how convenient this method can
work for you to make your coding journey
a little less painful so let's get
started as we can see here we have a
variable old array which turns out to be
in a raid of 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5
and then down here they have
conveniently coded a new array variable
for us and they've given us a little
hint on the other side of this equation
is old array so we're gonna see how
these guys interplay in just a second
here let's just go through briefly oh I
won't explain this whole example here
but the map method again it's a
convenient way to iterate through a race
so when you're using the map method
just because you declare the method for
example will go down here down to old
array and I'll just say I'll just attach
dot map to it doesn't necessarily make
anything useful for us it simply means
that the old array dot map the stop map
is going to be iterating through these
numbers but we wanted to perform for us
we wanted to dance monkey dance we want
the dot map to do something for us and
make our lives easier so in this
situation we want to the map function to
add 3 to every value in this variable
right here old array so every every item
in this array needs to have 3 added to
it so for example instead of one being
output here you see 1 2 3 4 5 matches
with this right now
so if we added 3 to the number one
obviously that before so that'd be the
first output here and then adding 3 to 2
would be 5 adding 3 through B 6 adding 4
3 2 4 etc etc you guys
the picture so that final product is
going to be our final result rather is
going to be printed down here by the
time we're done so again we're gonna be
using the map function to add three to
all of these items in here and we're
gonna save the results into the variable
new array look it's already been hey
they're setting us up for success and
old array should not change okay so
again with these free code camps they're
just like ninth grade algebra word
problems ninth grade wasn't that easy
let's see what we're working with to use
the map function okay so right away
we're going to be translating this use
the map function so let's go ahead and
add our map function to old array okay
and we want to add three to every value
up here and save the results into a
variable and again like I said we want
this dot map to dance for us we want it
to do work for us and the way we do that
is by adding a function so inside this
function which I am currently declaring
I'm going to put in Val this is the
argument now I don't have to use Val but
it's short for values so that kind of
you know you generally want your
whatever you're declaring whatever
you're coding you want it to resemble
real life thing so values right values
you know I can write real tough candy or
any mishmash of things but it doesn't
really translate to what this is these
are values so we're gonna throw in
okay did that we're gonna keep the
semicolon around you know what no or not
it's just getting getting in my way
so right now we're gonna open up so
that's our first line okay let's let's
not get too far ahead of this right now
so this is the first line old array dot
map throw in a function to make the map
do something so I'll show you exactly
how this is gonna make sense so we open
up a bracket because we need it to
return we needed to provide us something
so we want to return Val but not just
now the value plus three per our
instructions add three to every value in
the variable old array these guys right
okay so then you just want to sticky
some icon on there we're gonna clean
these guys up we still have to close our
function right here this parenthesis we
have to close we'll go ahead and close
that before the bracket here and then
we're gonna end it with a herb something
cool why do you hurt me mm okay well
maybe I actually it should be it bracket
perhaps much better
guys please rewind what I just said
about putting the parenthesis before put
it after your closing bracket here so
let's just try this again
there's our semicolon and then we're
gonna do the bracket semicolon or good
lord bracket parentheses semicolon
this is all you need before we hit the
big nuclear call the president button
president of your choice plateau guys I
couldn't even raise this person but
after i after i heard a nuclear launch
code I said oh my god I don't know what
I'm doing
everyone run just kidding
okay so here is what happened when this
map was activated it started iterated
and this function valve can along for
the ride and as a result Val +3 is
returned in each of these instances and
by instance I mean each of these items
in this array so for example 1 + 3
everyone should know that is 4 and then
3 + 2 output 5 down here 3 + 3 output 6
3 + 4 output 7 3 + 5 out put 8 and again
I could put anything in this function as
my argument like that as long as it
matches down here return me tough + 3
pass with flying colors
but let's go back to them just because
that's a little more real-world boom
okay guys I hope this was helpful thanks
for watching thanks for all the great
encouragement I'm gonna have a hundred
100 subscriber contest some great prizes
coming up if you're watching this video
and I still don't have a hundred
subscribers or about the 100 mark hey
stay tuned because you could win
something really cool thank you guys
again for watching and we'll see you the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
