today's topic is Craigslist freelance
developer ads the good the bad and the
ugly now this is a topic that is a
perpetual tech water-cooler topic that
marketing thing getting yourself out
there getting a side job as a freelancer
or making your full-time thing how do
you make yourself stand out well I don't
have all the answers to that but I do
want to go through a few ads that people
have posted on Craigslist for web
development services and we're going to
kind of pick apart what they're doing
right and what they could do better
picked out a few ads and most of them
for consistency's sake all of them
actually have the wordpress keyword
prominently displayed as one of their
specialties so let's go through the
sides and here do you want to pause the
video I'm not going to read this whole
thing so we'll just start it off his
title is WordPress WordPress expert
slash Julie I'll zoom a lot and I'll
speak today laravel SEO graphic design
PHP CSS okay so he's got you've got the
words of definitely go down to the
professional WordPress developer SEO
expert graphic designer with nine years
of work experience
so I'm reading through this and the
first thing I notice number one now when
you guys to kind of follow along with
this and start working on your
constructive critisism skills too
because it's a great skill to have and
you can always improve on it
the first thing I'm noticing is that is
that there's no picture and it's tired
and trite but the same holds true a
picture is worth a thousand words plus
number two all of this text is the same
it's the same to paragraph two line two
sentence block paragraph styling and
it's fatiguing for the eyes rake this up
with headers or larger font somewhere or
even like getting creative with
characters like some dashes or equal
signs or something or Asterix types work
good as well but it's just a lot to take
in and number three that I notice here
is that this guy is talking a lot about
him I'm professional WordPress developer
I graduated from Faculty of computer
engineering and naval architects
architecture by the way let's just
assume all these ads are legitimate I
don't know if they are or not but for
the purposes of this video let's assume
they are
I'm a certified Google partner I'm
hard-working I'm very passionate I have
a fast turnaround so what do you do for
the customer that is almost a bigger
issue here in this ad than omitting a
photo because this ad doesn't tell me
what he can do for me he hid the
keywords laravel SEO graphic design he
has nine years of experience that's
awesome maybe have a little bio section
down here you don't want to do a bio on
Craigslist link it to your website have
a portfolio site where you can just
throw out as Craigslist roofs so you can
throw it on there not feel weird about
you know credulous creepers and people
can go there and you can make the sale
over there be very careful when
describing your skills because people
don't want to hear about you all the
time they want to know what you can do
for them unfortunately in this ad the
customer isn't put for
he or she now this one's in Seattle
WordPress website builder and SEO
services helping native website
development an SEO company I'm the one
I'm highly-skilled my services include
I've been helping businesses again a
little too much emphasis on I in add
what he did or she did do right was a
put a graphic in here this picture is
outdated this font is a little outdated
it's serviceable WordPress is a very
forward facing platform they pride
themselves on their 5-minute
installation up and going beautiful
templates this isn't beautiful this is a
darker blue color and these gradients
inside this text here and this font
family whatever it is it's like the
beanie baby font it's unfortunately a
bit outdated there so a step up but
still a lot of work to do as far as
making it more customer centric and
because WordPress is front facing really
working on those graphic skills when we
put your photo in here let's go a step
up ooh $999 web design this one is in
Central Los Angeles under the small biz
ads category I really like this graphic
it draws you in some of these elements I
don't know if he he or she created this
or not but this little like orbital
pattern brings you in to this $999 web
design thing so let's go to his a little
ad here the other thing I like about
this ad is that it's extinct you don't
have let's go back to disguise this this
tends to go on your eyes you feeling a
little fatigued look how nice and
compact his hat is he's worked with
clients clients he word your clients
that have never had a website that have
a website and so on and so forth typical
price range $9.99 to $4,000 they already
know upfront what to expect so not only
is this person putting their clients
first putting making a customer-centric
ad this person is also telling them
being a chance to save thousands of
dollars the person who wrote this ad is
telling potential clients how it's going
to benefit them yeah there are hundreds
of
people who can do WordPress sites or 999
books I'm one of them but you know what
I'm going to save you thousands of
dollars and your website is going to be
in the latest cutting-edge design well
tested on all devices and it's going to
have the customer experience in mind
when I design nursing so very well
produced at this one's in Chicago the
title is WordPress custom web design and
development Northwest Suburbs the thing
that popped out immediately to me was
the creative use of characters the
piping the pipes here the ditch the two
dashes to create some blocks of text to
grab your attention guys if you use
Craigslist like I do all these ads start
looking the same they have a physical
location or at least a location in which
they specialize Roselle need website
help we're a small local team of web but
look at the emphasis on that local I
love this ad I love they put the Queen
WordPress icon up here they don't have
more than one picture and I don't listen
do you have a modern do you need a
modern mobile-friendly website are you a
business owner that's overwhelmed
WordPress services and look at it give
the double dashes these are the services
they offer we offer training on all new
website projects where we will teach you
how to manage your own website that's a
huge thing that not a lot of people even
think of if you do freelance stuff
you're going to have clients calling you
and emailing a weird freaking hammer
thing how the hell do I work this thing
the follow-up care is like a tattoo you
can't just you know paint the Statue of
Liberty on phones by it'd be like here
here's a band-aid go home
there's aftercare you need to teach
these people how to use their product
primary technology stack WordPress html5
css3 so on so forth they're very
transparent in what their stack is and
what they do I love it and here's the
other thing here is probably the biggest
thing this what it comes down to the
trust factor if you have photos or at
least one photo if you don't have proper
grammar or punctuation we don't have a
logical structure to your ad you get
dinged on credibility and you get dinged
on a trust factor with each of those
things you
there is a high trust factor with this
at I don't know who owns this place I
don't know who project manages I don't
really care because at this point I'm
looking at the satellite it's solid and
a free quote I'm starting to believe
what they're saying like these free
quotes are always scams but the hell
thought not and check that out their
website the cosmetics anyway mimics this
app clean professional to get her done
look at that nice looking website
Craigslist is like the YouTube with a
very robust adult section it can be
sketchy
yeah there's trolls there's perverts and
so on but you can also find quality
clients and it's up to you to make that
decision to put yourself out there as a
person looking for clients in Craigslist
it's free it's quick instantaneous
darn-near
and to do it right you're going to be
fine with some quality leads and you're
getting your name out there it's free
exposure even if you don't get a single
unit I hope this video was helpful guys
lots of stuff going on I can never stop
talking about it I'm going to be in the
get er chat room for real Jeff Danny
tonight from 10:00 to 10:30 at Central
Standard Time see you later
we'll see you in the next video thanks
