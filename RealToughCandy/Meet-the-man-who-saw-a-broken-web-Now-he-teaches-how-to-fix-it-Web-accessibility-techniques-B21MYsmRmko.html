had is simple and is that you are not
the user and there's just like a not a
lot of reflection when and that goes for
me too
you know I'm coding I don't I
unfortunately just kind of blast through
it and don't account for my audience
base who if I can judge by YouTube
subscribers I'd be so diverse in any
metric you could possibly use and I just
I just kind of gloss over it and use
myself as the user but in actuality I'm
not the user I'm the developer okay
can't even bet to blow your mind all
right go for it okay I was born with
cerebral palsy again it is the toggling
sense of years physiotherapy maybe get
to a point where I could articulate and
move to the extent that I can now
however I experience is used with fine
motor coordination when I basically am
looking at a mobile website where
basically the links are not padded on
navigation to such an extent then I can
touch them on my smartphone then this is
a site I would rather not use I also
have ADHD is really a lot of animations
that are not somehow or another
integrated to you know basically using
the interface distracts me using in the
background
distracts me camera cells distract me I
also find that as I get older in years
that his site does not have good print
contrast then you know I have trouble
using it you know so as a result of
which these experiences on my own give
me a little bit more of an insight
and they successfully than the average
bear it also gives me because of the
life I have lived a great deal more
empathy towards others we who are
disabled who have who live on the other
side of the digital divide
you've basically come from environments
that are totally different than myself
because I myself have been kicked out of
that tree house I have been barred entry
today house and it sucks what would you
say is people who normal abled people
what do you think is the number one
thing they don't account for when when
you xing are designing a website what do
you see the most could i see a lot of
and I miss been culprit of this okay is
basically usage of Aria roles putting
all tags and images using a readable
typeface yeah
color contrast line spacing text I am
gonna share one trick here to determine
whether or not your color contrast in
your text is readable take a screenshot
of your website desaturate the image see
how much contrast there is if you're
looking at text take off your glasses
and squint how much does one long and
learn to the other even if you see a lot
of bleed over when you're doing this one
test you may doubt that white knight
does taking and accounting for people
with disabilities take away from another
group or is it just expanding for
everyone to benefit let me give you an
analogy here okay you're going to talk
to a hospital
or a university or any their um building
that's paid for by the state if you in
the state of Arkansas on you'll see
things like buttons will kill chairs on
them that won't magically open the door
game now let's say that you are loaded
down with book bags briefcases a laptop
case maybe have two or three kids who
are in tow it is far easier to basically
take your elbow and slam on that button
and let that door open for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
