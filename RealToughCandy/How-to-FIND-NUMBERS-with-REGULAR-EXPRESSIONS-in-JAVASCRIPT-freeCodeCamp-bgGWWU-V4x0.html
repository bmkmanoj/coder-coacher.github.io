candies back in the settle with you
today over at free podcast doing that
basic JavaScript one of the final
lessons today we are finding numbers
with regular expressions another pretty
straightforward you probably do this
lesson in like a minute if you just you
know whiz through it personally I took
about two minutes but you know I really
want to start understanding these things
i know i've been saying it's over and
over my videos but don't want to be a
code monkey and even though i think i
understand it when i first go through
like okay I don't refer to the
directions to you know i won't i'll say
it for the demo but you know i'll call
in something and feel confident because
I didn't have to google it or whatever
but then the next day or a week later
i'll go back to the problem be like i
have no idea what to do so i'm just
taking a few more extra minutes with
this problem today and i find for me
personally i don't know about you but
experimenting with different inputs and
noticing what's being output down here
it's really helped me understand the
anatomy of what we're doing so let's
find some numbers and then play around
with it so we can really understand it
just a smidge better so they tell us we
can use special collectors in regular
expressions to select a particular type
of value and you know the regular
expression from last lesson starts right
here and then one such selector is a
digit selector which is backspace i was
forbidden which ones which backslash DS
which is used to retrieve one digit such
as number zero through not 29 in a
string makes sense in javascript is used
like this kind of went via have you ever
watched heavy metal videos on youtube
whether people are like given the devil
horns this what that reminds me of else
remember it a little better appending a
plus sign after the selector such as
devil horns the d+ devil horn g allows
this regular expression to match one on
the mortgage
again pretty straightforward and as in
the last lesson they're going to be
using g for global nick allows the
regular expression you find all the
matches rather than stopping at the very
first match so if we didn't have the g
year as well see when we play around
with this it's just going to return this
one and stop but the g is global is
going to go through the entire string so
now they simply want us to use the
backslash d selector to select the
number of number of numbers in a string
allowing for the possibility of one or
more digit well fair enough and simple
enough so what we're going to do we need
to keep this plus sign around because
the plus sign allows the regular
expression to match one or more digits
can play around the fastest and we're
done so it's going to be forward slash
and we're going to do is backslash be
cause she and then I think you're done
possible is that isn't that stupidly
simple but then so let's see what's
going on this little expression here
returned to what is that to mean it
means it found two instances of numbers
the first instance is three and then of
course the next one is or but what if we
did something like I don't know what if
we took this plus dollars and again the
plus sign just to say it again allows
the regular expression to match one or
more digits so let's see what happens to
nothing much but what if we put the plus
sign back in and took out global what
will happen I don't know
one the reason that happened is because
the global without the global it stops
after it finds the first instance so it
found the first basically a return just
the first instance if we took out the
lane watch this we're taking out the dot
links and now this box is going to
return three because it's not a global
here I don't know if it's called a
parameter or what it's part of this
regular expression I don't know the
proper term for it but it's simply g4
levels we take up the global it's going
to return just three down here mushes oh
as an object in an array so let's
continue on and play with this and if we
put G here we can remember we took out
the dot length right here so instead of
just getting a number of how many
numbers are up here it's going to return
an array of numbers it's going to return
the three and four me thinks I don't
know it let's see yep turns three and
four as strings dull Ramiz are these are
numbers up here in a string and they're
returned as strings in an array down
here so let's have a little more fun
with this week I think Oh
take out the plus sign from the digit
collector and see what happens 34
nothing so what the heck appending a
plus sign after selector allows this
regular expression to match one or more
digits well it's met what if we put ok
ok I think I know what to do so we're
gonna put the what was it called again
the plus side we're going to put the
plus sign back in the lead let's see
something like this and see what happens
put an underscore here why not 67 and 49
dogs see what happens so this is the
expression we would normally use under
normal circumstances and only about the
dot length I just want to see what it
returns 33 67 and 49 33 6749 perfect but
you think something interesting will
happen now I took this out and I right
yes I am because this plus sign is
actually looking for instances of
numbers from what I'm seeing whereas out
the plus sign this D is simply giving
you all the digits it's returning down
here all the digits it recognizes so
we'll go through it so there is a 3333
6749 3367 four and nine so you can see
what this plus sign is helpful because
in reality there's 49 dogs not four and
nine dogs but so this gives it a little
more comprehension and then more
comprehensive feed or so let's put in
the dot lengths and run it and do it
happens so there's four now that we do a
dot length it's returning the number of
number
that it seems as we won't know how to
explain it as holes i guess because
there's an instance here there's three
that's it since one will call it
instance to is right here insolence
three is right here and instance for is
right there that's already turn four but
now if we take this do is eat this plus
off of this D rather my prediction is
that it's going to return one two three
four five six I think it's going to
return your sticks down here with your
friend right that's what I've been doing
with this fine numbers with regular
expression just playing around with it
expanding my understanding of it because
honestly there's I don't know is there
are lots of complaint about is there I
don't know I don't want to complain but
there's a lot to actually make you want
to do one it leaves me wanting the
challenge lizna warming so just playing
around with it expanding my mind with
how it works in various formats
functions and all that good stuff thanks
for watching and we'll see in the next
video
