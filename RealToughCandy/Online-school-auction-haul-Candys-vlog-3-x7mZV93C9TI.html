you don't have to have dialed is not in
service at that time you guys what is up
real tough can be at black in the battle
with you today on this thoroughly dismal
let's just pan up here to proof proof it
proof it I proved it it's cold and
miserable I'm wearing a winter Columbia
jacket because so cold this is hardly
any motivation today but I wanted to do
this blog number three for you show you
guys some of the auction items I picked
up that I won through bidding at the
high school auction I was telling you
guys about involved - some of you may be
saying real cough Danny you said in vlog
2 that you listed two stuff you
contracted true indeed and isn't that a
conflict of interest well not at all
because I did have the same
opportunities as people who were not
listing it because there is you know
preview days and opportunities for
people to come and see these things so
there really isn't an unfair advantage
there I just got to see it first so you
know some of the stuff I did realize
with a pretty good deal for example this
hot hold press corps I'm never going to
use this thing it's essentially woo
it's a warming cabinet to tear hear
about this for 225 bucks probably a
double or triple and money on that so
that was exciting in great condition
just needs a little bit of a touch up
this is up here
all of this was one lodge and I got it
for things gotten kind of a bidding war
with somebody but it ended up being a
thirty five bucks and this is all
ceramic glazes and stuff it's actually
starch from the art department so
there's like oh stuff I've never heard
of I'm like ooh is this like illegal but
it's essentially clay zero Kopacz plus
five pounds about $12 sticker on there
brand-new or just about and that's you
know six or seven boxes deep see I've
been on some old biology stuff I got
outbid on a lot of stuff there's nothing
Singh from
from the art department
Jill speed boring I don't know what this
stuff does old Geiger counter pretty
cool that box makes it look super
ominous this was from the biology
department I got all this stuff up top
here plus some other scientific stuff
for like famous seven bucks you guys can
see my orange Columbia jacket winter
status I actually can't get this open
without really prying it but I was
talking to one of the helpers at the
high school he was helping prep this
stuff he's like be careful when you open
that thing because there was a lot of
white powder in it well that's
reassuring heaviness I haven't gotten
the courage to pry this open and look
inside so I want to know what's inside
it's pretty heavy though
so let's go down now this one was cool
and me see if I can focus here my camera
is so really out of focus a diatonic
scale so the sound is pretty well wedged
in here but it looks like I don't know
if it's an antique you know 100 or more
years old but it looks thoroughly old
two of these tuners are missing and it
says equally tempered scale and it has a
resonator that box acts as a resonator
and I'm not sure how it actually works
never actually seen those go what else
do I have
there's the other boxes back there most
of those are art supplies like I said I
got for the glazes for forum clay Oh in
there then there's some other stuff but
these I did bit on these I got these
things for
focus can give my words right today I
got these for seven dollars these are
original Spanish stories I think so the
17-footer they're massive and these are
great for renovation projects and you
know these would look great in any kind
of situations are you trying to rehab an
old home or business and want it to be
original
these are WP air a era Works Progress
Administration original to the school
from late 30s early 40s nice and they
have the soul of students on them so
freaking cool somebody at the option on
pickup Dave bid on another pair and I
had no idea how I was going to get those
out like I didn't have any tools they
looked on just massively hard for me to
you know crank it off the wall there but
they volunteered to take it off for me
that was really nice they dismounted it
and fortunately the storage area is tall
enough to speak to all the things are so
yeah those are basically my pickup very
happy this is another science department
being that I got it's a heart toll
optical disc again an old scientific
instrument I don't know what it does and
I'm standing pretty ignorant right now
but you know collectible stuff and this
press core I'm particularly excited
about especially because it has wheels
because it's going to be really easy
they can't leacy them but it does have
wheels and it's going to be pretty easy
to get out of here I'm not going to put
the stuff on eBay didn't kind of sick of
eBay honestly they don't take their
solar is very good not whining just
saying you know try and put it on a
Facebook group few Facebook groups they
seem to be the better way to do business
at least in my experience because
there's a lot of scammers on the
internet yeah there's a lot of scammers
in person too but feel like there's more
trust at least in my location
when you're dealing person a person and
they can't file ridiculous charge bags
and then you know say the item wasn't as
described and then they send it back and
instead of a laptop computer you have a
feather oh talking about that one
sometimes anyway that's what I got it's
dark in here
