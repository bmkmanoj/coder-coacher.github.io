candy from real tough candy calm back in
the saddle with you today we are doing a
brief but mildly intense video oh that
sounds so scandalous on the use of tilde
wTF is a tilde you're probably asking
well guys it's a freaking squiggly line
and 99.9999 nine times out of 100 you'll
be calling it a squiggly line or
squiggly something or just hey even
squiggly in almost all situations
it's a squiggly but you may come across
that one academic that one nerd that one
IT professional who has been coding in
Fortran since 1979 who insists on
calling it a tilde so let's just let you
know what I always like to verify it
let's have dictionary comm tell us how
to pronounce it just in case you weren't
clear children brilliant let's go back
to terminal now actually the tilde does
have a pretty cool usage in terminal it
is shorthand for your home directory so
let's go ahead and put my working
directory here right now we're in
downloads and if I wanted to know my
home directory let's just say I'm a noob
I don't remember a blah blah blah I'll
just hit the tilde press ENTER and it
will tell me not only is this my home
base here but also that it exists so
that's pretty cool so it verifies the
existence the tilde verifies the
existence of your home directory and it
prints it and verifies boom all in one
line so what's the do I don't know let's
change directories this is also cool
because you don't have to type out oh I
want to go back to my home directory
I think I'll press users or type users
and then right away me me me and guys
what I'm coding or doing any type of
stuff in the terminal I'm always
misspelling stuff guess what you can't
misspell a tilde so go ahead and try
that out
and let's just see oh yeah it works
let's try something else if you do a
tilde minus sign that's gonna print your
previous directory so theoretically when
I hit enter it's gonna it's gonna print
to users run away Jezebel / downloads
let's go see if it does boom and yeah
cool we could also do something like do
like - profile we can open up my bash
profile and see what's inside there
shall we
oops I forgot to do open open tilde
forward slash - oh if you're reading
this you just got pwned
this is the tilde boom pretty sweet
anyways guys that's all I have to say
about the squiggly line again in nearly
all situations you might even go
throughout your life never referring to
this or hearing it referred to as the
tilde but I assure you there is more
than one IT person out there or one
academic who insists that the proper
terminology is tilde and you know what
they'd be correct because that is the
proper term but in the real world
outside of the ivory tower outside of
the matrix it is a squiggly guys I hope
this video was fun if a little bit
helpful cool - thanks for watching and
we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
