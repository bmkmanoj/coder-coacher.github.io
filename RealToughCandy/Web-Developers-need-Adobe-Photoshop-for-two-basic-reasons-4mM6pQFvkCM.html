from real safe daddy calm up in this
battle with you today how are you guys
doing two quick announcements number one
if you're new to this channel and you
don't know where to start I have a
playlist called noobs start here and I'm
telling you guys I have one of the best
comment sections in the tech world on
YouTube there are so many people from
way up here and advancement to general
noob all the way in between who just
really have some high quality comments
so even if you're not interested in the
video itself but the topic interests you
check out the comments because I'm
telling you I hope this always is like
this but because my channel is so small
I have time to you know really read the
comments so I know who is contributing
what and you guys know who you are thank
you for your contribution in making the
channel even more dynamic announcement
number two deb mojo sign ups are going
swimmingly you don't know what that is
it's my new newsletter for aspiring web
developers and beginning web developers
handpicked remote job opportunities
killer tutorials it's all protein and
these tutorials i've picked from around
the web and they are the cream of the
crop I've spent I don't need to tell you
guys how many hours trying to find
quality resources and excited to share
those so that can be found to sign up
over at real tough candy calm very
painless takes only a few seconds to get
you signed up for that I will not spam
you it's all protein it's all protein
today's topic you're probably wondering
what the heck is this monkey doing on my
computer real tough candy well today's
topic is Photoshop and the workhorse the
pack mule that it is in web development
now I've spent probably a few hours
trying to avoid signing up for Photoshop
because they have moved away from a CD
and download base I don't know if I ever
did downloads but they did do CD based
programs and put on your computer
they've moved away from that to the
subscription model and who does that
benefit the company because every month
you're paying over your shekels to
continue your use of Photoshop and while
the updates and all that the cloud
itself yeah yeah yeah I prefer the CD
and I might
go back to that but I have a Mac without
an optical drive so that's kind of a
pain in the butt having to get a CD
drive so this video is going to focus
rather on the Creative Cloud because
that's what this is and in all honesty
because it's so easy to just pay month
after month I'll probably stick with
this I can fantasize about getting the
CD toppy from a few years back but let's
be real probably sticking with this one
having Photoshop on your web development
machine is important for two reasons
number one to create number two to
deconstruct when you're creating things
for your client or for your own usage
you want to be able to do it in a
streamlined way a professional way and
Photoshop is in a class by itself now
the example I have here is a thumbnail
let's see if I can I'll show you guys
what I'm working with you these this is
the basic template I have created for my
thumbnails you know I keep this stuff if
you guys follow the channel you this
probably looks familiar this gaudí of
fat graffiti thought take that monkey
off take this off so this is what I work
with with my base and this isn't
necessarily for web development but it
could be because when I'm creating
another site what if I want to cite that
mimic exactly this let's just say I want
a real tough candy MailChimp web app I
don't know why let's just say I do now
if I wanted to recreate this image I
wouldn't even have to create this in
Photoshop but for the purposes of
developing it into a template for a
website I can do that very easily so I'm
assuming element right here that I
probably want to do something with we'll
go I don't know do a red and then of
course change the transparency so what I
going to here alright so I got that one
and then maybe there's probably a since
it's like some kind of sidebar create
that into a sidebar we'll make this soft
but not pleasant tacky green and then go
down onto the transparency so I know so
what I'm doing right here is just
creating different elements for myself
so when I actually start creating these
things I can say okay oops second site
okay this is an element right here I
need to create to some kind of link this
is going to be
navbar I don't know maybe this can be a
footer like down here this little
computer could be a footer and make that
a different color you guys see how fast
this is going and it looks a little
shoddy but with a fast and dirty
technique earbuds with a few tweaks to
make this looking really good
you don't even have to show this to
anybody necessarily of you know if
you're working for a client they
probably like to see it what you plan on
doing it's up to you but this can be
used just for your benefit so you can
say okay I'm breaking down these layers
of this image I like to make into a web
app or a website now of course you can't
code in things this isn't Dreamweaver or
anything like that but you can do little
tweaks to help you like for example down
here I'm going to be renaming this
rectangle to footer just for my just for
my purposes rectangle - this could be a
one without a nav bar vertical nav bar
and so on a quick and dirty example
indeed but you guys can see quickly how
this can save you hours of time and just
looks that much more professional again
probably not the best example but you
guys are seeing where this is going so
that was breaking down an image but
creating an image for a web page can
also go very quickly - let's just say
well not know what color I want to start
with that's a nice one bah boom oh I
think it's looking cool instead of
coding it coding the color and then
opening your browser and saying okay
this is good let's go back let's click
through or you know if you're using atom
or whatever just like going back in
coding this is so much more efficient
even though you're not using any code
guys the more I do this the more I'm
realizing a lot of web development
doesn't involve any code obviously that
is the basis of what we're doing out
here is coding but to get to that point
you have to build yourself up with
different skills and using Photoshop is
one of those skills like I said I've
tried to avoid downloading Photoshop and
using Creative Cloud but it's almost
mandatory I would say it is mandatory in
2017 and beyond also - you can have a
lot of fun with fonts I have downloaded
em that's a cool serial killer type font
that's cool guys how cool would this
look like a punk shop on swears my ass
this is freaking cool this is like
straight out of the Sex Pistols era this
is something that is going to be
waiting for you to continue to build now
if you're feeling really bold you could
actually save something like this and
use it as a custom button or get
creative and use it as I don't know some
kind of icon on your website this in my
mind in real-time just went from a
website a background color that I liked
to a button or some kind of icon that
looks freakin cool for a punk shop idea
may or may not have I don't have a punk
shop idea right now I will not bore you
with the rest that is just some of the
basics that doesn't even scratch the
surface of this program the Creative
Cloud is probably the way to go you can
get the disc some few years back but the
Creative Cloud is probably the way to go
you can even go to Amazon they have a
subscription card so you don't have to
activate it right away you can hold on
to it and keep it around for when you're
ready to activate your Creative Cloud
subscription I'll put that link in the
box because that card just don't lose
that card deconstructing web pages and
creating things for web pages and web
apps are two of the biggest things Adobe
Photoshop is going to be doing for you
there really isn't anything to compare
it to there's some open-source program
they cannot compete with there's nothing
like Photoshop there's a reason it's
become a verb in the English vernacular
it's it's amazing it's an amazing
program we'll see you in the next video
I hope this was helpful
