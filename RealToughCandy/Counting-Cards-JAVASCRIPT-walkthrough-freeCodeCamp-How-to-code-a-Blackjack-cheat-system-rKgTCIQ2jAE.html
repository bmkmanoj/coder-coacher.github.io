candy back in your area today doing free
code camps counting cards challenge from
their basic JavaScript section now this
one can be tricky I don't know I think I
say that for just about all of them
fortunately for me I do have a motivator
waiting in my kitchen I just took out
some home smoked bacon oh my god I know
the P guys down the PA guy must get paid
I cannot wait so the more efficiently I
get through this challenge the quicker I
can Mao down on some beautiful animal
protein let's see what we're working
with today
blackjack not only blackjack but
cheating at blackjack counting cards
frowned upon by casinos worldwide
apparently anything goes in the Wild
West free code camp because I don't know
I think they might be condoning card
counting huh call it in people this is
called card counting referring to
counting cards now if you're not a poker
player blackjack player or you know
don't frequent the casinos you might
want to refresh yourself refresh your
memory to be reading this section but
not going to go over it like I said if
you need to refresh good reference point
then they give us a chart about the
count change you know I think I might
have to give us a little reference point
here because having more cards in the
deck remaining in the deck favors a
player each card is assigned to a value
according to the table below okay each
card has a value when the count is
positive the player should be hot when
the count is zero or negative the player
should debt low okay so let's go to our
instruction you will write a cow card
counting function it will receive a card
parameter and
increments or decrements decrement I can
never say anything the global count
variable according to the cards value
see table the function will then return
a string with the current count in the
strings beck is the killer's positive or
whole it's account is zero or negative
the current count in the players
decision better hole it should be
separated by single space holy crap was
a lot to do okay I don't know about you
but reading that it's pretty
overwhelming so let's take it little by
little sentence 1 write a card counting
function they set us up for success over
here at free code count because they
already declared a function here it will
receive a card parameter and increment
or decrement the global calipari okay so
they're telling me it's increment plus
decrement - decrement beaker mcdu Kerman
whatever the function will then return a
string okay i starred on here some more
context clues if the color is positive
or hold if the count is 0 or negative so
in other words if else it is what we
need to be doing however since I
discovered the sweet switch statement
was cases then forget if else if too
much work too inefficient and I just
love the case studies my phrase not
theirs so what I always looked at you
just prepared for these things give
myself some room what are we starting
with a switch statement but before I
even do that because I'm not pair
programming I'm by myself flying solo
I'm going to do what I feel most
confident and that's defining these
cases so all of these are going to be
cases and we have three separate little
I don't know what you want to call them
module so we'll do what call it module 1
it's going to be case two case three and
what I'm doing I'm just going down these
cards in case entomology
well Ivan our numbers so that makes my
job is here t6 okay and then we're going
to go to the second little module here
which is count change zero for card
seven eight and nine
okay seven eight and again these are
just card numbers okay son and then our
last module negative one minus one is
going to be taste good and now we're
going to be having to go to strings
because Jack Queen King and ace
obviously our numbers so Jerry for Jack
Q for Queen K for painting and then
finally we're going to do a eight
alright so we got that part let's just
tighten this up so those cases were
banged out pretty quick right so now I
don't explain in other videos as I've
noticed over the course of doing these
exercises computers are stupid they need
to be told what to do sort of like my ex
ah just kidding totally just kidding so
we're going to open up these cases of
course with the switch statement because
cases go with the switch when we're
putting in a switch the card parameter
and then switches always open up with
curly braces so that's the opening brace
and then I'll put the closer down here
that looks fine right so now we just
need to finish these up cases two or
three four five six what does that match
with well plus one so we're going to do
just total brain fart were ah counts or
enter your variable counts and that's
we're going to increment so that's the
plus increment one and then we'll break
it and then I'm still learning like best
practices for we're like indentation I
have no idea this is probably this is
probably too clean to be actually legit
too aligned to be really legit but
now it's what I'm going with so that's
our first little our little module here
this plus one count change and
corresponds these cases which are
actually cards okay so now we're going
to our next little section card seven
eight and nine which is going to be a
count change of zero so we'll do count
nor any new increments or an increment
zero break and then let's move on to the
next one count change minus one in the
advance of cards ten through ace which
corresponds to this coach - or decrement
decrement can I just clear something a
hold on let me let me put on another tab
here call you can see my browser history
increment oh my god I can't spell I'm
losing it
incredible in decrement decrement guys
you're so patient say it
decrement decrement okay decrement
wasn't so hard why decrement why is this
doing this to me
unmatched what okay I'll deal with that
in a minute so what did he say decrement
decrement deck Decca decrement decrement
so this little minus sign is a decrement
what is that little minus sign decrement
oh he says it so smoothly so envious
count decrement equals one because
that's a little decrement that could be
and then you break it and I'm not
getting any errors this is actually a
really good sign should I just tighten
this up even though it's probably not
good practice to have it all aligned
okay so that's looking good right let's
just I want to get on the same page with
all of this stuff not possible kind of
possible
so now we have to do the return
statement change me so we're going to
throw in the couch in addition to some
awesome stuff why don't you do that can
you put another parenthesis there you
know some stuff in parenthesis and
here's what we been acquitted it's going
to be an if-else statement with some
shorthand operators so it's going to be
so basically what we want to play in
here if college and I'll show you I'm
doing count greater than zero return
this is a shorthand for return it's
going to return count is zero or
negative it's going to be hold but if
it's greater than zero it's going to be
bet and it did say down here the current
count and the players decision better
hole should be separated by a single
space so that's where our space is see
what you see I'm doing space that and
then the shorthand for L in the return
this is semi core full colon colon okay
and then we're going to put this one
else return hope and calm all right well
it's not giving me any errors do you
want to run it and see what happens okay
let's do it
zero hold okay let's try let's try I
want to do a string let's try two
but yeah yeah so now let's try I don't
know 9 bet whoo-hoo I'm like Jack hold
and then I don't know what happens to be
throwing like punker just for kicks one
bet okay well hmm
it's not totally tweaked it's not
totally tweeted to perfection but this
is one way look do you guys have any
suggestions on how to better code this
I'd be totally open to it this is the
way I've been doing it but I'm sure
there's more than one way to skin a
function especially when it concerns
card counting you know those jokers and
I don't mean the cards have methods to
their madness all over the board thanks
guys for watching hoping this was
helpful and thanks for writing to my new
subscribers I got like three overnight I
don't know where they came from YouTube
doesn't tell me these things but thanks
for the sub I'm obviously doing
something right or are you just enjoying
me doing things wrong hey either way
it's a sub I'm not complaining speaking
of sub my Bacon's waiting thanks for
watching guys see in the next vid
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
