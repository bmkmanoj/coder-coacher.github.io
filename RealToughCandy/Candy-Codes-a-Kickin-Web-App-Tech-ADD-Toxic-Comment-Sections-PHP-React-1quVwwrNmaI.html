back in the saddle with you today we are
resuming a candy coats a kickin web app
by request of beach bunny who says what
tough candy love this series please more
methodology videos like the last year
well miss beach bunny today your wildest
coding wishes are coming true because
this is video three in this series and I
have a lot of splainin thought oh so two
on board those who may have forgotten
what this is I mean I'm trying to
onboard myself here because I haven't
worked on this app in a few weeks
oh it pains me to say that that's right
guys I've lost about 75 to 85 percent of
my motivation for finishing this site
you know how it is you have these great
ideas you crank them out you have that
little victory yes this pump that no one
else can see you get that rush that the
drug like rush and then it's just
downhill from there and it's not on
account of anything besides my own
self-imposed ad D if that makes any any
sense that is all a long winded way of
saying I've been working on other
projects like bum bum bum bum my react
project holy crap guys my react project
I am so excited to show you but oh just
then didn't do so now that I've given
you all kinds of live excuses for not
working on this project I have done a
few things on the comment section which
ironically I'm probably going to
scrapped altogether comment sections are
so the most toxic are the most toxic I
will say the most toxic part of any user
experience on the Internet I mean you
guys are all on YouTube you know how
disgusting it is it's
it's nasty it's just nasty and yes
comments can be filtered but that also
means someone has to filter through them
and that person is mean I'm just I'm not
the point I just can't even wait through
it even with the spam filters you have
to wade through so much stuff is it even
worth it
and what kind of experience is it for
people to just say oh congratulations
great job oh yeah I think I'll comment
it post oh yeah oh yeah we post the baby
we posted it even though I have not won
a soft spot in my heart for comment
sections I thought well just just see it
through and see what happens
how would I want in an ideal world a
comment section to look okay for number
one I want to have icons that are
open-source photos that are funny cute
and random now here is what I did I
first of all made a border radius of
like 50% where's my CSS uh W Debbie
Debbie Debbie Debbie Debbie Debbie
Debbie pardon my mess on this coat is
medicine a thing knowing I had to clean
up this coat I said I don't want to work
on this project
Oh higher higher Co janitor where is the
border radius uh what is it five round I
put RAM on there whatever okay
so it's fine root M that's the size of
this which is like I don't know the
conversion is in pixels but I wanted it
to be random I wanted to be circular and
I wanted it to fade to its original
color on Harvard just for something cute
just for kicks so I got that part going
I got the form validation here which
does need improvement you got a name
that's just not gonna cut it that
placeholder code is in the PHP file
which is under cookie comments so here's
my placeholder text in the PHP file
placeholder approval of with the comment
and then we have you got a name so
instead of you've got a name we're gonna
say name
cool that looks a little better right
already just like that oh okay you're
saying yeah yeah yeah big deal why don't
you just use disgust or something a
little more easier why don't you just
use WordPress and use a plug-in it's so
much easier totally agreed but I want it
to code this from scratch just to see
how much work went into it and for
somebody who did not know much about PHP
before this little project I certainly
know a lot more about page look at that
oh that responsiveness just gives me the
warm fuzzy feeling in my heart
ah now one more point on this comment
section I wanted to do something with
these icons that was a little different
a little creative and a little
challenging and it was just an idea I
had and I was wondering if it will work
with the help of Google Stack Overflow
and a little experimentation it did work
have you ever been on a website where
there's a comment section and you don't
have to sign up to make comments in
other words random comments are
available well those random comments
people can't pick their avatar now with
my method every time you refresh it's a
different economy purpose of that might
be pretty low priority I didn't want
people's eyes to be fatigued with each
anonymous icon I could have done just a
random icon and stuck with it even if
you refreshed it like let's say I'll
refresh this it's a purple smile purple
monster right and I'll refresh it it
should be a purple monster but I kind of
like the I'm kind of keen to the idea of
anonymous people staying truly anonymous
so that you know as a fad who commented
on September 14th 2017 isn't always
associated with the robot with a heart
and it gives people a little more sense
of control like oh I'm a dumb computer
well let me change that mister bite me
mister bite me has a very bad attitude
and now he's just a pink monster so
here's the comments that Jay s file that
I created
and basically it's an array of all these
photos right so here's 22 photos and
then my function of getting a random
image as you can see here you can
probably recognize this a little this
little block here math dot floor is your
a friend with these kind of fun things
and then a very simple function that may
or may not have some usage I don't know
you know this font is probably not the
most accessible either I've got to be
honest guys I'm not really satisfied
with the offerings I'm bringing you in
this update but it has to be said and it
has to be made clear that this is the
honest truth of my progress on this site
and I think it's important to have that
honesty when developing the coders do
get distracted they think about great
ideas all the time sometimes not so
great ideas and they start working on
them personally right now this react app
I am so excited about this is a
portfolio piece another portfolio piece
in addition to the dev a spotlight here
that I will be adding to my portfolio
and very excited about that to show it
off to you guys the code in react is so
fun so going forward with this dev spot
light web app really important that I do
complete this and I want to get your
guys's feedback especially on this
comment section I worked many hours on
it and it's not that I'm gonna be
butthurt if I end up scrapping the whole
thing which I'm leaning towards again
what are some better ways to incorporate
social interaction on relatively random
websites would you guys even use a
comment section I wouldn't mind doing
without but I also know that I'm not
going to be the one looking at the
website every week as a visitor as far
as going forward with other components
need to hook up some PHP so the search
bar can trace everything in these
modal's boilies can trace everything in
here and find something for example
let's say I want to search WordPress a
little
Alisa digs WordPress so ideally I'd type
word pressing hit enter have some
instructions here for typing enter like
put a little magnifying glass here for
user experience user interface oh look
it's autofill people and once I hit
enter have that pop up and boom it would
show Elise so that's another thing other
than that you know just small design
things this is mostly this is about
people's stories and you know building
on top of those awesome stories to find
motivation and just breaking away from
the typical WordPress site alright guys
that's it for me I'm real tough kandi
and I welcome all my new subscribers Wow
hit a thousand subs the other week very
exciting and pushing on with that
welcome everybody new old intermediate
and we're looking forward to I'm looking
forward to seeing in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
