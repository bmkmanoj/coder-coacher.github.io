back in the cz with you today tell me if
this scenario sucks for your movie
programming question what do you do
Google it you end up on Stack Overflow
the answer to your problem is 7 or 8
years old you don't know if it's the
best answer you're tempted to ask but
after seeing some of the responses on
Stack Overflow you say oh no I'm not
boasting my question risking looking
like an idiot or being called a bad name
or being down voted into oblivion
because you're new or because you think
differently than some people maybe
you're a glitch in the matrix well take
those scenarios and many others over the
last 10 years a stack overflows
existence it has finally come to the
attention of some of the movers and
shakers that Stack Overflow that it's
not the most welcoming of communities I
use that term in air quotes because
Stack Overflow is really short on
community there are a core group of
users some whom might be called
gatekeepers of tech and a lot of people
with really poor communication skills
who aren't welcoming to new people and
as a self-taught web developer as
someone who is an advocate for
self-taught web developers Stack
Overflow is a horrible introduction to
the web development community the
rudeness the the the dismissal of so
many people and their questions look I
get it
there's rules there's way to ask
questions on Stack Overflow but as a
newbie you kind of don't know where to
start on Stack Overflow because there's
so much going on as the Bosnians might
say boy you son meghanadha better
anything than nothing right okay it's
gone on for 10 years people have felt
unwelcome time to change things but this
might be too little too late there are
so many other communities popping up
where people can get help from people
who really want to help newbies Stack
Overflow has a reputation of not being
newbie friend
because it's not new be friendly that's
the reason I have never asked the
question there I have an account there I
use it to check jobs and I don't know
just serve questions or stuff but as far
as posting questions not gonna happen
even after I have read over the rules
just because I deal with enough stuff
going through YouTube comments and
dealing with my youtube channel which
don't get me wrong most people are
amazing but just filtering through
people who think I shouldn't be here
because I have lady parts smaller
communities of techies are forming all
the time and I think this massive model
of Stack Overflow is becoming a little
archaic itself those are just my
thoughts let me know what do you guys
think do you guys use Stack Overflow as
a newbie have you been down voted have
you been treated poorly because your new
asking questions looking for help maybe
you had a good experience let me know in
the comments below
thanks for watching guys more videos
come in always I'm not going anywhere I
hope you're not and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
