saddle I want it to pop on for a brief
video just to show you guys a big WTF I
don't know if this happens a lot but I'm
pretty neurotic about checking out my
video manager you know my channel isn't
that popular it's getting there okay
it's getting the views I'm not going to
stress depressed but I do like to
monitor what's going on in my channel I
get some videos last nine to some videos
earlier today on this beautiful
Valentine's Day so I don't know if this
is some kind of april fools or another
NWO no World Order thing going on with
youtube / google no idea but i was look
at my videos today and I was like
something's missing besides the views
something's missing here the green
monetization button has completely
disappeared and I checked and
monetization is enabled on my account I
didn't get an email from google or
youtube saying my count was you know
ineligible for monetization and to
verify this I did go to community and or
was it channel we'll see in a minute
won't we Shan know so I'm all in good
standing I have zero Community
Guidelines strikes and dear copyright
strikes for this channel that was pretty
intentional and then I went to montes
monetization to see what was up and I
keep getting this 500 internal server
error maybe the Russians have a relay
attacked I don't know WTF they wanted me
to send them a screenshot if I see the
highly trained monkeys so yeah I don't
know guys is this happening to you what
is going on with this let me just
refresh your screen again this has been
going on for like who knows how long but
I've been checking in for like 45
minutes on this page and nothing
fortunately or unfortunately for me
again I don't have that many of you so
I'm not losing out that much on google
adsense but for some of you guys who
monetize I mean some of you guys put up
a video and have 3,000 views in 20
minutes or you know an hour but if
anyone has any information on this WT
f is a 500 error I don't know but just
to give you guys the heads-up if your
little monetization revenue is looking
low I don't know how often this occurs
something to watch out for thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
