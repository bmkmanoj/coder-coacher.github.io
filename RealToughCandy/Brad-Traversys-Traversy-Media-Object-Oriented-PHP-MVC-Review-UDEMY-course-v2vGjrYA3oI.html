reviewing a course by one of the most
prolific and well-loved web developer
instructors on the entire Internet
Brad Traverse II of traversing media
most of you know his channel on YouTube
he has extended his talents for quite
some time to external platforms
including you to me and the class I'm
gonna be reviewing today is object
oriented PHP and MVC I bought this class
a few weeks ago because at my full-stack
job I'm a full stack web development job
it's PHP based and I thought I knew PHP
because I was like copy and pasting from
Stack Overflow and tweaking WordPress
themes doesn't really cut it when you're
in an enterprise environment and I
needed to learn object-oriented
programming as it applies to PHP I said
ooh
what a great opportunity what better
place to do this okay it's a ten dollar
course eleven dollar course whatever it
was unspecial I'm just gonna take you
through this course today but before I
do I know I just like just get to the
review I will say that PHP is just
doesn't get a lot of credit nowadays
people say it's outdated or nodes taking
over okay argue about it all you want
but the fact is that there are thousands
and maybe hundreds of thousands of jobs
that feature PHP around the world PHP is
a need-to-know language object-oriented
programming need-to-know concept if you
plan on doing a full stack web
development so if you're learning to web
development right now and you're like
starting out with the full stack I'm not
gonna say go and drop everything and buy
this course or buy any PHP course that's
probably one of the worst things you can
do as a self-taught developer I'm just
dropping everything and going on to the
next thing but do keep in mind PHP is
gonna be necessary at some point in your
career the coolest part about this class
is that you make your own framework your
MVC framework your Model View controller
he
called this one Traverse en bici but as
you build it of course you can customize
it and name it whatever you want one of
the best things about Brad style is that
he's very project focused with his
normal YouTube stuff within an hour hour
two hours because he'd probably stop in
the video a lot maybe three hours you
have a cool-looking project that you
coded and you can show off in your
portfolio I think he does that just
unlike anybody else and that's no
exception for this course let's just dig
deep into it and I don't know will
creating the users controller and we get
right into the code here let's see let's
say that they fill something and then
they get an error and the init
re-renders we want that data to be still
be in the form you don't have to we
don't want them to have to refill it so
we have to do this stuff for that to
happen it's gonna have Iman's I like to
about this course and about all the
other courses that he does is that the
mistakes aren't edited so in this course
for example there was one I don't
remember what video it was but he was
having trouble loading something he's
like why the heck isn't this working and
watching him troubleshoot is reassuring
because it happens to everyone he does
do an intro to object-oriented PHP and
although this is in intro as it says
right here intro it's nothing more than
that and the reason this is here is just
to prepare us for diving into this stuff
because this course isn't designed for
new coders and he even said that in the
intro you know if you're new to PHP
maybe this course just isn't for you yet
so that's where I would say maybe grab a
book did some documentation have another
course I have Edwin Diaz as PHP course
Edwin Diaz a style is almost
diametrically opposed to brad's Edwin
Diaz likes to talk a lot he's very
energetic he's very fast and very
engaging in that way whereas I think
Brad is more methodical and isn't afraid
to make those mistakes
I don't think Edwin Diaz is afraid to
include his mistakes either but he's
pretty quick to code whereas Brad is
very more I think Brad's pace
a little more aligned with my style
here's a screenshot from the project
that you that we make you basically can
add post login logout functionality a
basic blog highly recommend this course
you can't go wrong Brad always delivers
those great projects that you can show
off their portfolio already great for
tweaking and customizing and in addition
to some other resources with PHP this is
going to be part of your PHP personal to
make you stand out as a back-end coder
and full sack web developer the last
thing I will say about this course is
that it's short I don't mind paying 11
15 20 bucks for a three hour course
that's the way it should be having a 20
hour course is like guarantee that I
won't finish it so I do appreciate the
relative shortness of this course it
doesn't mean he skimmed from the
material at all but he does get straight
to the point with this thanks for
watching as usual so many videos coming
up guys I want to give a special shout
out to my girl Kandace newest patreon
