excite you do you fantasize about your
website's receiving 1 million organic
ants kme - in this video we're going to
be discussing two metrics that people
think about a lot and attach a lot of
value to but when in fact there are two
secret metrics that people don't really
talk about a lot which are going to be
your kidneys and secret weapon when
developing yourself as a web developer
start the video real toast handy for
real tough candy calm back in the saddle
with you guys today how are you guys
doing yesterday's video and Alcoholism
in the workplace was a very tough one to
do um not something I would normally
discuss on the channel but I just had to
share my thoughts and get it out thank
you guys for the great discussions over
in the Gator chatroom and sharing your
experiences and adding some insight on
that awesome conversations off YouTube
were having on the Gator chatroom thank
you michael Kornblum for starting that
chatroom again and also shout out to
code know a new guy who was documenting
his coding journey right here on youtube
from scratch and he did a really great
video the other day on books many of
which i've never heard of to get started
so if you're interested in his channel
he like I said he's a new guy on new to
youtube and new to development world
he's building his brand he started off
right his name is code noob
Joseph if you're here give a little
comment down below so people can click
on your name and check out your page he
also set some really great stuff about
this channel so I'm doing something
right thank you guys for your support
today's topic is the numbers game and
the numbers game in web development
people often talk about two things I
hear it over and over number one the
biggest thing I mean absolutely just bar
none number one is income as a web
developer and the potential in coming
off six stage is $150,000 $200,000 some
of these senior software engineers whoa
I mean really rolling in the dough we're
also going to be talking about hits or
unique visitors basically that big
number that summarizes how many people
have visited your website your web app
or
ever downloaded your whatever you've
created Anderson are some nuances there
it hits us what the same as unique
visitors and so on but the point being
that we're ideally shooting for very
large numbers with any of the variations
on that on that basic metric but real
tough candy can you please stop
promoting your stuff for one minute and
just talk about the topic at hand well I
figured I use my website as an example
now if you're an aspiring web developer
the odds are you're still working on a
portfolio and even if you're in the
business you know you're working on your
personal project and you want to beef up
that resume and when your resume says
you know XYZ website has 5 million views
5 million hits or you know 3 million
unique IP addresses and etc I'll just
say hits or the restaurants video has 8
million hits that's a pretty big metric
I mean 8 million guys I know we see
these viral videos that have a hundred
million views on YouTube but guess what
that's a big number and so is 8 million
a hundred thousand is a lot you're
working on this thing I saw 8 million
hits yeah I'm going to go ahead and put
that on a resume and in fact I'm going
to put that in my portfolio and some
kind of interactive thing to show off to
recruiters that I can create these sites
with like a lot of hint well here's the
thing my website does not have a lot of
hits and that's just fine by me why
because I have a high conversion rate
kids don't really matter in this game
some people might disagree with me but
hear me out there are false metric
because hits do not equate you to any
type of action now on my website I have
various calls to action that is a huge
term the call to action is what is
fueling web development whether it's
explicit or not if people aren't doing
what you want them to do then you have a
failed project whether it's an app
websites blog whatever so for example I
have a call to action here this is the
private post because I check there like
the other day and they're doing like 15
dollar deals probably udemy web
development classes all $10 now inside
this web post I have a call to action
click here to get your deal if a million
people are
hitting this site and don't heed my
calls of action what good is it I have
in about Me section wait let me go to us
I'm a little better where I do have a
explicit call to action deaf spotlight
series now this is obviously to show off
the great things as I've been mentioning
in my other videos of fellow developers
who doing great things however there is
a call to action down here are you in
number are you an emergent developer or
know somebody who is get featured here's
my call right here contact real tough
candy now admittedly this could be a
stronger call to action I will be
finessing this but for all intents and
purposes it's serviceable if people
aren't doing what I want them to do on
this site it doesn't matter if I have a
million people visiting doesn't matter
if I have a hundred million now that
number sounds freaking sweet perhaps you
have a web site that has a lot of hits a
lot of views but if they're not doing
what you want them to do it doesn't
matter
focus on your conversion what percentage
of people visiting your site are
clicking on your links or contacting and
how do you tell that well on most
hosting sites pretty much all of them if
they're legitimate are going to have
some stats they're going to have a
metric page and if it's not explicitly
pointed out you know what your
conversion rate is for cooking on links
you can compute it even though this
website doesn't have a lot of traffic
the conversion rate is high the
conversion rate for dev mojo is
disturbingly high like this newsletter
and by the way I hope you guys are
enjoying this issue three is coming out
next Tuesday and lots of people signing
up for this thank you for your
subscription I appreciate it this
conversion rate I can see over at
MailChimp calm and people who are
clicking this link and also heating my
calls of action inside the newsletter
there's not a lot of people signed up
relatively for this newsletter but the
conversion rate is astronomical you
don't see those kinds of numbers under
normal circumstances your calls to
action whatever they may be are going to
be your gateways to success not hits
hits don't mean anything guys you can
ask any youtuber out there who monetizes
their videos yeah
to find it's a fine thing to do to turn
on those ABS but you know when you let
it roll for five seconds it's worth like
a fifth of a penny and I'm not like well
please just stop it's not worth anything
like I'm trying to give you the scope
here of you know what that's worth the
web world the advertising world doesn't
put a lot of weight on people who are
just exposed to advertising like these
Adwords or something you have to click
on it you have to engage with it the
person has to do those things in order
for the Creator to get credited and to
actually you know start the ball rolling
with making money enough of Isreal tough
candy website let's go to one of the
most expensive cities in the world San
Francisco USA personally you couldn't
pay me a million bucks to live there
because I'd probably blow it in a
weekend but the second thing I want to
talk about is the income thing you know
that six-digit thing I talked about
early on in the video six digits guys
that's a lot of money okay I don't know
where you live but that's a lot of money
San Francisco is exorbitant ly expensive
it is disturbingly expensive and you
want to know the most disturbing part a
six digit income in a tech city okay
this is a tech hub feel like a bum like
you're really bad hangover this is a
Jacke hub San Francisco is a tech hub it
is a go-to destination for web
development and tech in general and I'm
going to scroll down here this is from
smart asset calm so take the stats as
you will I don't know the source of this
but let's just for a minute assume this
is correct
the average cost the US House it's 2014
with about two hundred nine thousand
dollars comparing it to San Francisco
over seven hundred thousand dollars a
hundred thousand dollars in San
Francisco it's not going to get you far
and that sad well if you look at other
emerging tech cities like Austin Raleigh
Durham Minneapolis I think in even
Indianapolis $500,000 is going to get
you double or triple where you could
just living basically in San Francisco
it the context people can say yeah I
paid six digits I make one hundred and
ten thousand dollars
here guys the average cost of an
apartment in San Francisco is like 4500
bucks I just read it here four thousand
six hundred and fifty dollars for a
freaking two-bedroom apartment in San
Francisco so you are spending over fifty
thousand dollars let's see you make a
hundred thousand dollars if you're
spending half of it on an apartment and
I don't really think that's anything to
brag about San Francisco and Manhattan
don't even think about it yeah you can
work in Manhattan but you probably have
to travel two hours to get there in
rush-hour traffic
and cut ten years off your life just
because it's so hectic let's just say
it's not my cup of tea but the point
being is that these numbers means your
salaries you hear people talking about
it bragging about it simply stating it
six-figure incomes in some cities in
America and Vancouver Canada good luck
it's nothing to brag about is context so
look at the city look at the cost of
living when you see these companies
throwing out these numbers and the sad
part is these come these cities and
companies in these cities rather are
offering dev sixty seventy thousand
dollars a year so if you start thinking
about conversions your success in
conversions and your success in putting
back income into a context I think I
think your life will be a lot easier as
a developer and you're going to have a
little more control over your life
because you're going to start seeing
things going your way I hope you enjoyed
this video guys so much stuff going on I
have like a ton of announcements I
didn't even get you I know like there's
the most boring things of this video of
the videos that I do but there's some
really great stuff going on maybe next
video all right guys have a great
weekend thanks for watching hope this
video was helpful see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
