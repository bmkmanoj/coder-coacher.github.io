getting your website out there in the
search engines you basically want people
to find you you want to make it easier
you want to rank to the first page of
Google and all of that good stuff you
want phone calls copywriting it focuses
it's mainly is moreso sales and
marketing you know you're basically
persuading someone to buy from you to
you're selling yourself we as developers
everybody that's trying to you know
whether you're working for a company or
selling your you know have your own
business whatever you need both SEO and
copywriting so the reason I say that is
because I think about my experience when
I first started with SEO I was able to
rank the website you know the services
to the first page of Google right but if
I didn't have the skills necessary to
sell myself for it you know copywriting
fit the words be creative with the words
I'm not gonna get any customers or
anything
so my area it just it depends on the
industry you're in and it also depends
on where you are so I was mainly focused
on local SEO I was doing service
businesses in a local area wherever I
was I started in Colorado so it just
that all it just depends and it's a lot
of work people is not overnight
people think that from my experience a
lot of people think once you implement
some SEO tactics its overnight no it's
not overnight I first rank my first
website ranked in Colorado Springs which
is a bit smaller than Houston the niche
I was in was in a limousine niche so it
was a it was somewhat saturated area our
industry I would say in that area so I
guess it took about three to four weeks
of really implementing things and just
waiting just being patient whereas in
Houston I was able to rank my page I
believe I got up to page two in Google
and it took me for that one page it was
in pest control the pest control
industry it took me about two to three
months
I still click on the second page I'm
sure you may still just click on the
second page but I don't it can still
work you know it's not everyone can get
on the first page of course and put you
know it can still work
to me blogging of course we you can we
can structure our blog post but it's not
as it's more so for us it's not like
whereas in copywriting you're writing
for a purpose you're trying to get your
client to buy your service or a product
or download something blogging to me
you're just blogging I mean it's like a
journal
you can sale something whether it's
yourself whenever you're trying to write
an email to get a job at a company you
can if you're trying to sell your
product whether it's your product or
doing an affiliate marketing you can
sell your services if you have services
offline or online it's a lot of things
resume even me when I first started out
blogging you kind of just I'm gonna
create a website and I'm gonna post one
or two posts and be done with it and
someone's gonna find me I think a lot of
bloggers starting out have that type of
mindset so it's not gonna help you know
at all I think to set you apart from the
50,000 other people it's to just be
consistent for one pick a niche you know
an industry I think that works better or
I found it works better than generally
you know just putting up and putting
something out general you have to be
strategic with it I mean consistent even
if you post one post a week
just be consistent with it choose a few
keywords that you know people are gonna
be looking up and googling I would
suggest you know going on udemy
udemy.com and taking little courses on
SEO copywriting you know that you learn
a little bit of thing to implement and
that'll set you apart you just be
patient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
