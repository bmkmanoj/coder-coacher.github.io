company not sheep so I'm walking to work
man I thought mile-and-a-half I said now
I'm not gonna drive I'm getting a
computer all day
may as well stretch my legs a little bit
get the anxiety out before I clock in
probably gonna be just like a lot of
paperwork today like every job my main
job is just to show up and write tax
forms all that crap so we'll see how it
goes I got to get a coffee though cold
hope you guys having a good one I'll
update you after work
I have learned more in these four hours
at work than a month on my own
I'm already I'm already doing stuff I'm
already at work of course a lot of
paperwork doing a lot of get lab stuff
already
SSH Inge the Dickens out of things and
just getting familiar with everything
it's very windy I probably already said
that I'm a total mess right now getting
ready to go to lunch may or may not do
an update after this depending on how I
feel and everyone at the office is being
real helpful too
there's an office dog that's been quite
entertaining these past couple hours
apparently likes french toast but I'm
gonna go get some lunch and probably
work more this afternoon and yeah well I
made it out alive I don't know how I did
not get fired I got invited back to
another day at the job I love the people
I'm working with I cannot stress this
enough I have had so many jobs working
with people who don't care who really
don't care if they show up to work or
not don't care about the way they do
things and you know the sad part is I
used to be one of those people and
thankfully I'm a little different
nowadays
and the senior developer I'm working
with is a great guy and I've also had a
lot of developers on this journey who
are a little hesitant to share the craft
or maybe a little condescending because
they really know a lot but this guy is
neither of those and just made the do so
much easier he worked a lot with a
particular customer today fixing stuff
on this clients website basically
shadowed him gave some feedback too so
that was cool so today was a great
training day eight hours of busyness
there was no downtime aside from my
breaks and lunch time I had a delicious
bagel by the way for you foodies out
there Oh everything bagel you
go wrong with those for lunch but I'm
looking forward to another day tomorrow
and bright and early so that's really
exciting hope you guys are doing well
thanks for watching
real tough candy here signing off gonna
be doing some more videos soon with this
new journey and hope you found this
video inspiring
maybe a little enlightening and I made
it so that's great I think see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
