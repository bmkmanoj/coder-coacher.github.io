candy back in the saddle with you today
we're working on freak oil camps basic
JavaScript section of the course working
on the Gulf's code challenge today now
this one is unlike a lot of the previous
challenges in this section because
you're actually coding a lot whereas a
lot in the previous ones it was one or
two tweaks or one or two lines of code
this one has I think it's like at least
seven well there's seven different
returns here or different strings are
going to be implementing today so
there's a lot of typing there's a lot of
a relative amount of critical thinking
compared to some of the previous
challenges so a lot of attention to
detail needed well I suppose that could
be applied to all these problems but you
know what I'm saying let's get started
here over in this corner they're
explaining how Golf works I'll let you
read it on your own time most of us some
of us do know how that works if not this
little paragraph is very helpful so
here's our challenge your function will
be past par and strokes arguments right
up here return the correct string
according to this table which lists the
strokes in order a priority top is the
highest and bottom is the lowest so
that's cool because they've already
given us the table these are our we
don't have to I take it back about the
critical thinking portion because they
really hand you what you need to be
working with the biggest challenge is
accuracy in my experience doing this
challenge so I will say though because
we are doing relatively so many lines of
code what I've learned is that copying
and pasting the basics and then tweaking
as needed is a lot easier than doing
everything from scratch so let's start
with the first if statement we're going
to be doing some ifs and else ifs in
this function and I'll show you what I'm
talking about so let's start off our
first one so it says if your stroke is
one it's going to return hole in one and
notice i said if as i said before so
it's going to be if and then we'll say
oops okay here's something I almost did
once again it says strokes with the
capital s here but
the argument or parameter I'm not sure
which one this is on the top I think its
parameter someone with a little more
experience please let me know what this
is referred to as up here because I've
heard conflicting stories here they're
saying arguments but I've also heard
brother regardless strokes in this
function is referred to with a little a
lowercase s and I wrote big ass because
that's what this says but this has
absolutely no significance in this
function as far as capitalization go so
we have to go with what this says it's
the only thing the program recognizes so
if so rope is one so this means equal to
and we're going to be using the
comparison operator equal to and this is
I believe referred to as a strict
operator so there's no like converting
or anything literally if strokes is
equal to one and again that's three
equal signs it's going to will do
something like this will return this
string which is full in one and
definitely mind your punctuation the X
Club on grammar stuff like that they're
obviously the printer won't run if
you're not paying attention to exactly
what is written inside these strings
hole in one exclamation okay make it a
little clean here clean it up and then
don't forget to set Michael and that's
my number one new mistake I just keep
rolling but won't run if you don't have
the semicolon okay well we set that one
up pretty easily we're not getting any
errors over here so sweet this one is
done let's go to the second one if
strokes is less than or equal to power
minus 2 that's going to be an eagle so
now instead of doing it if we're going
to be saying else if so if stroke isn't
equal to 1 it is in fact equal or less
than or equal to power minus 2 now
that's red so stroke again but this time
it's not going to be the equal to sign
because you see down here we have the
less than or equal to so let's go
go to car when you to go okay and again
that's freaking semicolon oh come on
don't do this to me what okay what am i
doing ah i forgot the return statement
sweet so we're already two done out of 7
i'm feeling pretty good i'm feeling
confident but now just seems like a
little inefficient to keep coding and
coding else if else if so here's I'm
going to do I'm going to highlight line
suit I'm going to highlight lines 9
through 11 I'll clean this up when a
math when i'm finish with this challenge
so how many are left 1 2 3 4 5 i'm going
to paste this five times there's that
first time i pasted it paste it four
more times 1 2 3 4 and so now instead of
risking not coding else if return etc
instead of risking doing something wrong
in those segments i already have them i
know they're good to go so we're going
to take we're going to pick up where we
left off we left off here after this
eagle so now we're at par minus 1 and
that's going to return birdie so we'll
go down here 1 2 3 in so strokes is
equals so we're going to go back to our
triple equals sine is equal to par- one
that's going to return 30 and like look
how fast that one there's no semicolon
to worry about it's already pretty good
to go so moving down the line if strokes
is equal to par and then we're going to
get rid of that operator and turn it
into a triple equals sign if strokes is
equal to par this one's easy it's going
to return car moving down the line if
strokes is equal to par plus one it's
going to be a bogey so again we don't
have the correct operator so we're going
to get rid of that we're going to do
triple equals fun
The Strokes is equal to R re power plus
1 power plus 1 is going to return bogey
and then I do every time okay i'm going
to show you where I made my mistake and
I'm going to come back to let me finish
this out first so buggy and then moving
down the line else if shrugs again we
got to put that some triple equal sign
in for the comparison operator for the
correct one is equal to par pull off two
minus two three new to it will return
double all right everything looks good
i'm not getting any errors but i did
notice something actually looking over
this that i have to IX i missed one so
see this eagle string this is the same
one as this one we can't be having that
because well show you so i copied that
or cut it rather and it's going to go
down here because we're still missing
this last one this was just an error on
my part because i didn't notice this but
that was redundant so Oh finally we're
on the last one else if strokes is
greater greater than or equal to par par
plus 3 gonna say go home and again watch
your punctuation because it won't run if
you don't have an explanation oops oh
alright it looks clean it looks like
it's ready to be oh and what doesn't so
we're going to get rid of this to return
change me okay and this is the entire
function so now let's test it out and
see if it works big money big money big
money big money you're a shooting star
people so let's test it out as they say
in their little notes here let's do two
and nine and they say in the notes up
here is that where is it they basically
say oh here it is par and strokes will
always be
numeric and positive so you can't be
like adding strings like Jaime or
negative numbers or whatnot let's do 10
and 2 and 10 see what happens yeah and
you can just keep experimenting with
numbers not going to change perfect so
there is our function for the Gulf code
hope you guys found this helpful as
always leave a comment to leave some
questions like the page like the video i
will be doing more of these videos if
people find them useful and i hope you
enjoyed thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
