to buy this book oh yeah because I was
somehow terrified by the $40 price tag
that is a little pricey for a tech book
especially when we all know that tech
books don't have the shelf life of
normal books but this book is incredible
and I regret not purchasing it when I
was first learning JavaScript in jQuery
I just thought those two concepts were
just more freely available online were
accurately available online and just
less overwhelmingly online I mean this
is a lot of material but John Duquette
so many people have said amazing things
about this book about its design and
it's beautifully designed it has a
beautiful layout and these photos just
are gorgeous people love this book and
people leave great reviews for this book
but again I was starting out I said 40
bucks that seems a little expensive in
the era of $10 udemy courses free online
resources documentation freely available
to anyone with an internet connection
this kind of stuff just seems like you
shouldn't have to pay for it but what
cost is it if you spend weeks trying to
understand if else statements going to
seven different resources what I love
about this book is that it's mindful the
other thing about books now books don't
get a lot of love in the tech world
understandable the tech changes
completely every six months but books
are beautiful because books are still
very efficient at delivering information
here's what books have that videos and
other online resources don't they have
an index that you can quickly access you
cannot quickly access an index on a
udemy video you have to really search
through the different modules in
different chapters here is what this
book has that videos don't have what all
books have that videos don't have
chapters
and you can quickly go from chapter to
chapter whereas where you're trying to
load a video sometimes the flow just
isn't there with this book the flow is
here I think it's eight chapters let's
go to the table of contents here and he
also gives an intro to programming too
so that's nice it does have an
organizational structure that makes
sense because it starts off with the
basics you know arrays data types
objects of methods all that great stuff
and goes into stuff like JSON
determining position of items on the
page stuff like that now I know some
people may be a little skeptical of this
book because it's jQuery and true indeed
this book was published in 2014 this
copy right here maybe that's the latest
version I'm not quite sure true in 2018
you probably don't want to be actively
developing in jQuery it's on its way out
however many projects that you're gonna
be working on use jQuery
there are things in jQuery that you can
still use little components that you can
pick out and use that are still very
useful Ajax for example now yes we do
have the fetch method that's probably a
lot cleaner
but Ajax works good too you know
there are things in jQuery that are just
really convenient and look at this
layout look at how this is formatted you
don't see this in any kind of video and
the information is right in front of you
the other thing I will sing praises
about this book is it not bogged down
with random projects they're just this
is a reference manual and it's probably
the best one out there I can't say
enough great things about this book if
you know for sure you want to do web
development I would say get this book if
you're questioning whether or not you
want to be a web developer stick to the
mark Meyers books they're half the price
and they're a lot more interactive this
is a great reference manual a lot of
this stuff I already know but I still
found myself reading about it because
the way he says these things is just so
unique without going off the rails he's
a great technical writer and whoever did
the layout for this book deserves a
bonus thanks for watching guys I
recommend this no doubt to any web
developer who plans on sticking and web
development thanks for watching we'll
see in the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
