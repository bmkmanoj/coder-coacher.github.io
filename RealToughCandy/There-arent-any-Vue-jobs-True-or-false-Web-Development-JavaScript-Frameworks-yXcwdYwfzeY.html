if I said true and false
does not compute view the epitome of
hype driven development or does it
legitimately and uniquely solve a set of
problems let's use the number one tool
for any web developer go calm to find
out view jobs calm browser dozens oh
stop the video dozens of UJS openings
all right let's go see dozens of UJS
openings the first opening full stack
engineer and developer out of detroit
michigan career now brands is one of the
fastest growing tech teams and metro
detroit where do i sign up what are the
requirements series it's actually a view
job did you put this job on here and
it's not even for wait a minute I'm not
seeing view I'm seeing laravel I'm
seeing PHP I'm seeing CSS get HTML and
some other things but I'm not seeing
view interesting alright let's go to the
second one front-end full stack
developer remote job a Oh freelance gig
okay let's see what they're looking for
salary 92 140 sau okay here we go
essential criteria experience in
JavaScript web app development view Jay
s preferred you see their preferred this
company might not even be developing in
view they probably haven't made a
definitive decision as to what they're
gonna be developing in because angular
is also beneficial let's go down to
another one view front-end developer oh
this isn't my language I don't think I'm
qualified for this one JavaScript
developer angularjs and view all right
required skills and experience Oh view
Jay s typescript and angularjs one point
XO
basic familiarity excellent English back
up points for laravel Oh interesting I
thought PHP was dead let's all remotes
in Latin America let's see what do we
need what do we need skills blaze meteor
Mongo note in view alright this might
actually be a de facto view job
interesting so there are a few view jobs
here but it looks like a lot of just
prefer you to have view skills
let's check indeed alright we'll take
out this Jos part 1813 jobs let's just
do a little comparison here 13,000 jobs
for angular react 50,000 jobs alright
and I do realize there are probably
other job descriptions that have this
word in here but as you can see all of
these are for actual web development and
engineering let's go back to this view
senior software engineer marketing
technology they want three years plus
experience knowledge of one or more
general-purpose programming languages
including JavaScript Python PHP and go
frameworks such as react viewed node
laravel lumen Silex flask all right
see what about junior view ok you ready
for the five jobs to pop up 139 junior
full stack web developer experience with
front-end JavaScript frameworks such as
angular react and view is a pulse now I
don't know if you guys are seeing a
pattern here because I certainly am
maybe I'm just biased I'm not seeing a
lot of exclusive view jobs out there and
even so after I take out the qualifier
and just have the basic view 1813 jobs
compared to the openings out there for
reacted angular this is a lot that said
if you love you go for it you will find
a place because a lot of these places
that are hiring for angular and react
we'll consider you as experienced you
know the sad thing about view is that it
probably does have its benefits but when
senior developers and below are crowing
its praises because it has X amount of
stars on github you know that's a
problem I've heard this from many
different developers as the selling
point stars I hope this video was
illuminating and maybe answered your
question as to whether there are view
jobs out there or not to be perfectly
transparent at my current job we're
developing in view but I know I'm
probably the exception and not the rule
thanks for watching we'll see you the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
