to get distracted like coding along my
editor and something the urge would have
hit me um adoptable Horace's real tough
candy from Rios Afghani calm back in the
literal saddle with you today
how is it going I want to give a shout
out to my newest subscriber dr. timaya
who is a dentist turned developer if
this guy has a really cool story welcome
dr. Kimia thanks for tuning in leave a
comment in the comment sections people
can check out your channel you have some
really great videos and if intros are
really cool so welcome and all the music
you today on this video is from my
upcoming album electric pomodoro an
album for tech types available soon on
VanCamp link in the comments section
it's going to be a good one I made it
with you guys in mine so more
information on that next week do stop it
focuses on the collision of two others
free stuff and DevOps now let's talk
about free stuff clean tech it's
everywhere and if you're a female we
even have more opportunities to indulge
in some of these different areas in tech
I'm not going to say women have it made
but there are more opportunities to
encourage us to participate in the text
spear I understand most of my viewers
are not female I don't want this video
to be exclusive for anybody watching
this I highly encourage you to become a
member of some meetup groups meetup calm
there's probably one in your area at
least in your region there are feel like
they're sprouting up all the time and
they're very diverse I myself am a
member of women who code the great ones
are females but if you're a guy there
are also you know gender-neutral many
gender-neutral organizations and very
exclusive organizations that welcome
everybody who do have these tickets or
relative can eat DevOps what the heck
does that even have to do with web
development exactly I'm not quite sure
so that's why I got this ticket
and these conferences they are so
specific usually looking up with
breakfast and lunch there's a banquet at
this one I mean it's it'll work all of
this makes intellectual sense to me but
to actually know what he's saying
like understand it like really absorb it
you know what I'm saying I'm going to
have to go to this chat and it says
we're going to overview the concepts and
features of Dockers swarm mode including
the least privileged security model
load-balancing service discovery rolling
upgrades and much more another thing too
I want to emphasize with aspiring web
developers and you guys already in the
business doing whatever you do with code
is that it's not always so modular it's
not so isolated once you start working
even if you're freelancing you're
probably going to be asking somebody
outside of your immediate circle for
helped or if you're on some kind of chat
room or board or whatever you're going
to be working with people in the tech
world who accent your skillset it's
never so insular as it is when you're at
home in your mom's basement wherever you
know type amounts of wine encoding once
you get out in the real world you're
going to be working with different teams
and DevOps is kind of a movement my
understanding that facilitates the
different areas of tech and that's why I
have an interest because DevOps people
we again from my understanding their
focus is on shipping product and making
money and that statement really appliers
off some neural activity right here
because though making money and getting
things done sounds like my thing the
other nice thing about getting a
discounted ticket or a free ticket to
one of these conferences again this was
a $300 that's a lot of money for people
talking at you yeah there's interaction
there's great ways to network but it's
mostly people lecturing you can try
before you buy I mean I don't really
know for sure if I'll ever incorporate
these talks and stuff into my day to day
life five ten years down the road I have
no guilt about taking these tickets
because I'm not fully 100% in the
industry yet okay I do freelance stuff
I'd like to do more I have a lot of side
projects I'm so busy with tech like all
you guys I'm freaking busy with this
stuff I'm going to link to a pretty good
blog entry by this dude Patrick Dubois
about DevOps what they do what
like and why it applies to web
development and if anybody is in the
DevOps field I would really like to hear
your comments and insights about what
you do how you do it what you love what
you don't love whatever you want to say
about it put it in the comment section
to help some people out I'd really love
to read it guys thanks for watching
especially for my ladies in tech if you
are interested in this kind of stuff I
highly encourage you to do it the
opportunities are there and if you don't
take advantage of it somebody else will
why not that opportunity belong to you
guys thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
