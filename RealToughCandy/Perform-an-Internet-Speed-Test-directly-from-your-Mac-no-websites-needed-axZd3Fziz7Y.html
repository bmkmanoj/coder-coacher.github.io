back on turn it as quick text tutorial
this one I'm super excited about because
I just discovered it looks three nights
ago and kind of obsessed you are going
to be able to check the speed of your
internet connection using just the
terminal it's convenient you don't have
to install an app or go to some silly
website check my speed or bite me
whatever so full disclosure I was
actually googling to see if possible and
in fact it is this whole page right here
on the blue to forums explain how you do
that so like I said I'm numb genius I
copied and pasted these instructions did
I mention this you want to make sure
your machine your mac has w get
installed doesn't ship with w get so
let's go right here just i'm not going
to go through this whole homebrew
installation thing but in seoul Homer if
you have it already it's a package
manager and it's going to make your life
a lot easier on your machine when you're
on your machine doing your thing and
even like on their very top fold here
they say Homer you can install w get
that's probably one of the biggest
selling point set so easy to install
stuff like that so get w get on your
machine be a home brew or some other way
it really doesn't matter just make sure
it's on there so now we're going to do
now that we know w get is on your
machine simply copy and pasting and this
is on the bluetooth for me i will leave
a link in the description box go to your
terminal and paste that look at that
already good to go so I'm gonna do a
speedtest watch it
Oh work and unfortunately I have two
masks to my personal info because
Chinese checkers want to kill me and
other near dwellers not making other
Chinese in particular they are known for
their real bad hackers oh but as you see
it is working my download right now is
6.5 five- uploaded 15.8 9 megabits this
is really good just to see exactly how
badly your ISP is screwing you over on
data speed because they promised me 25
up 25 down and as you can see it's
nothing close to that so let's try that
again if you want to repeat it so yup
here it installed and right here is
where I actually ran the test so it's
top / selling speed test enter let's see
how we do
doing a little better 11 11.5 two down
and I was testing the upload speed 9.76
well I'll keep checking this throughout
the night and my isp might get a phone
call tomorrow they would really care but
I got a really cool tool just the hop on
the terminal and type in dot slash I
hope this was helpful again homebrew w
get and check the link in the
description box for the actual copy and
paste code they want to show you this
this guy Matt mart he deserves a shout
out because he's the one who quoted this
pretty awesome Matt thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
