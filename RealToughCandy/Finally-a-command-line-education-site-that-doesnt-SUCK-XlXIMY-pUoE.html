tough canycom back in the final with you
today wanted to hop on real quick ensure
this a neat little resource I discovered
in my adventures on the internet it's
called the command challenge CMD
challenge com and it's off the beaten
path you know sometimes I just the
repetitive homo genius nature of some of
the bigger training sites just gets kind
of old and everyone's doing the same
challenge and learning the same things
just like wow I really am just another
number and the system well I've
discovered this and it's a progressive
way to learn the command line so they
start off with the hello world you know
the bait the very basic of the basic
start with the hello world and work your
way up from there so each one of these
is considered a challenge and the
instructions are to simply print hello
world now this is there are many ways to
print text on the command line and they
even give you the hints that echo work
so to see that I cone with a little
world I don't work in the world and they
give you some instantaneous feedback on
the command line and it just gets your
eyes used to working on the command line
as well even if you get stuff wrong
let's just say well print the last 5
lines of access not logical your current
working directory what say I don't know
I OWD no that's not correct command not
found so just kind of get your again
your eyes and muscle memory in your
hands used to working in command line
and the proper way to print the current
working directory is PWD which is boom
and then list files list names of all
the files in the current directories one
file per line of Els boom now it may
seem like I can whiz it through those
but trust me I hit a complete standstill
by the sixth challenge here which I have
a personal goal of doing about one a
week and not trying to push it here but
I
want to learn some of these things
because so much of the basics no matter
if you go to a code camp or any other
online resource one of the first things
they say do these command line
challenges whether you're an info SEC
person aspiring web developer whatever
you're going to have to know the command
line this is just a fun alternative way
off the beaten path to learn it github
link there as well and I was clicking
and exploring her there's like 130 some
ways of printing hello world and like
are you freaking serious I'm lucky to
remember one of them and here they are
they're all of these worth pearl minus e
print hello world OMG be before the more
advanced users i'm definitely not very
yes a listing echo anyways hope you
found this video helpful the website
again is CMD challenge dot-com a little
resource thanks for watching and we'll
see the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
