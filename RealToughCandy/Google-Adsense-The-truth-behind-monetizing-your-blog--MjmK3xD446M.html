online passively is to like monetize
your blog just palletizing all you do is
like hip about a transition but many
like make it like somebody that's how it
works trust me I'm like a blogger
the reason it looks like I'm watching a
dirty film right now is because Google
frowns upon the sharing of financial
information as it relates to their ad
system there are so many of these guys
talking about passive income and just go
start a blog and monetize it
if so fruit tough gain is gonna start a
blog it's gonna be worth my time so I
did a lot of keyword planning using the
Google Adwords Keyword planner this is a
very powerful tool when you're thinking
about getting ideas for blogs because as
you can see here this suggested bid 120
bucks that's an idea if you type in so
this term is for casino right and these
are matching words or similar words the
search term live roulette is searched
for on google.com between ten thousand
times and a hundred thousand times and
the suggested bait is one hundred twenty
dollars and 33 cents I can't go through
all of that today but just just know
that this is a high number and to
illustrate that let's just put in like I
don't know rock and roll for 67 that's
actually not so bad a lot of them are
just like 50 80 cents rock and roll
artists dollar 75 that's not so bad but
if you go back to casino I mean this is
a highly lucrative search word so I did
my research and started a blog on online
slot machine reviews start at the blog
getting ready to smash that Google ad
code right up in that site's business
but I realized you have to get approved
you can't just copy some ad code
stick it in there and then say okay pay
me you have to go to google adsense you
have to apply they manually review your
website or your blog within three or
five days they give you the thumbs up or
the thumbs down well after about a week
of waiting I got a I got a message from
Google Adsense saying your application
has been denied you don't have enough
content I don't have enough content you
know I had posted like five or six
reviews had a frequently asked questions
page bla bla bla but I added some more
blog posts and resubmitted get a
response a few days later we're sorry
your your second request for approval
has been denied because this falls into
the category of gambling apparently
that's just snacks
friendly enough for Google and now mind
you a lot of online slot sites aren't
gambling for money they're called social
slots and you sorry the term sounds
funny
social slots and these are slots where
you just go and have fun like on
pogo.com you just you know waste time
and I'll just do it for fun without any
money but no they didn't care they just
said sorry this is adult content adult
content what I'm getting at is that you
just can't start a blog and expect to
monetize through Google AdWords now for
me on my slot blog I ended up going with
a different advertiser provider but the
clicks aren't nearly as lucrative as
Google Adwords okay it's one thing they
have down its the algorithm and how to
maximize money there are alternatives if
your blog doesn't get approved and they
have a lot of reasons for not approving
your blog hope this video was helpful
the next time you hear somebody saying
go monetize your blog remember it's a
lot of work and you can't just blog
about anything so here's the question
though if my blog was denied because
it's caught it's casino related where
are these ads showing up I don't get
that if anyone has any information on
where these ads might show up besides a
gambling site because clearly they're
asking people to come visit their
casinos to pay money that's why these
prices are so high in a couple of weeks
I'm gonna be having a guest on the show
who's gonna be talking all about
copywriting not blogging copywriting and
how that relates to SEO it's a lease
from the dev spotlight if you guys have
been checking out the deaf spotlight
profiles go check her out and read up on
Elise's activities selves super excited
I have a boatload of questions for her
and you can pick her brain real soon on
that thanks for watching soon the next
