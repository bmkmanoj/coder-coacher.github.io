portfolio today
real tough candy female tough lady calm
back online with you today how are you
guys doing got a request video you do a
video on how to set up a portfolio
website to host on github one day
appreciate it
wait tech solutions today's video is for
you thanks for your question
let's head over to github and we're
gonna go to my repository page my
portfolio it's an older one this isn't
currently up to date that's kind of
redundant this is my portfolio it is
hosted on github and it was coated and
designed using a static site generator
called Jekyll Oh weird words incoming
it's a lot to take in if you're a newer
or aspiring developer the ecosystem is
very different from what you've probably
been working with previously also Jekyll
is written in Ruby and uses a templating
language called liquid I know right
please let me just show you the layout
of on some of this stuff just to show
you the ecosystem and the syntax and
what this kind of stuff looks like so
this is the code this is the actual code
there isn't any voodoo magic with this
the code for the what is this the Jeff
spotlight
yeah the deaf spotlight page okay so
this is the output two photos and some
text and some links various font sizes
and whatnot and this is the code to that
looks a lot different than your standard
HTML page just very interesting syntax
so I'm not gonna go through all the
different components that make up a
static site generator I will show you
how to get started with some of these
okay but first I want to show you that
you don't have to use Jekyll it's
definitely what the most popular one
they have a lot of great themes and if
you pick a good theme you know 80% of
your work your design work and your
development work is already done if you
pick something like I don't know let's
find a good portfolio that might be nice
this might be nice pick something like
this to work with then it's large just a
matter of replacing photos and hacking
through like that you know obviously
replacing some of this text and putting
your own
I'll touch on it this is just like any
other github repo clone or download work
on your own machine and then put it on
your own github page after you're done
tweaking and customizing it but back to
this there's Jekyll there's Hugo they
are ones for react to Gatsby
there's one for view there's probably
more than one next metal Smith Pelican
that's written in Python it's just a
they're a fun little thing to get
started with and the coolest thing about
static site generators is that they are
super fast in a nutshell they don't have
any back-end and any back-end
functionality you just use third party
plugins like comment sections or you
know some sort of functionality to send
emails or whatever they're super fast
they're super succinct and they just
look nice I have a few more in my
repository section here let's see test
portfolio Jekyll I actually just forked
this and then put it on my page here
this is this one this one my bank might
be nice portfolio theme so what you
would just do then clone or download to
work on your local machine and then go
from there I'm gonna give you a heads up
if you're working with Jekyll or
actually any other static site is that
you need to fire up instance of a server
when you're working on your local
machine it can take a while don't let it
discourage you I have spent so much time
just like troubleshooting like where's
my gem file looking for stuff but once
you get over that hurdle it's pretty
smooth sailing probably the biggest
thing to get started is just reading the
documentation QuickStart instructions
this is the Jekyll homepage lots of
documentation here to get you started
just read through the guides once your
portfolio is on your local machine
you're developing you're ready to put it
on github ok there's one step that a lot
of people do not do and I'm gonna show
you that I'll go to my portfolio here
I'm gonna go to edit actually I'm not
going to go to edit I'm gonna go to
settings my bad
settings and then come down here and
then you want to activate github
ages and once you activate github pages
they're gonna give you this link okay
so just take note of this link and
you're gonna copy it copy the link they
give you right here and then go back to
your project because you want to put
your link here so people can actually
click on it instead of just seeing your
code do ensure that you take care of
this little section right down here so
that your site gets updated and is
public for people to look at and easily
accept accessible you can also put in a
custom domain if you swing that way I
don't personal preference not a big deal
to me to you it might be other than that
that's those are your basic steps for
getting started probably the biggest
thing is just deciding on what generator
you want to use but I I would I would
recommend Jekyll they have some really
good themes a lot of these just don't
have themes or they have like blog
themes which aren't good for portfolios
of course I just googled Jekyll themes
and you can find a lot of different
sites that offer Jekyll themes you can
usually just clone them from github if
you have any more questions feel free to
ask you should be an email root of candy
at gmail.com and happy static site
generating happy portfolio Eng if you
decide that static sites aren't for you
maybe you want to do like a wordpress or
something I would just go with
traditional hosting I use Namecheap have
nothing bad to say about them but github
github and static sites work very well
together alright guys thanks for
watching we'll see you the next video
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
