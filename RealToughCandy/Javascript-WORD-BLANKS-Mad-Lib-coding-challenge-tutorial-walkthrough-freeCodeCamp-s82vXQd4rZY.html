you today we're working on free code
camps basic JavaScript section word
blanks this one is a toughy they're
going to come into a lot of errors I
think I've probably tried this tutorial
to record it's like four times this
might be met this time but you know what
we're just going to let it roll and see
what happens watch it work brilliantly I
don't know what's going to happen let's
get it on we're going to use our
knowledge of strings to build a maglev
style word game we're calling or exam
doing they want us to create an
optionally humorous fill in the blank
small sentence okay so at the very
minimum it has to be a sentence we're
going to need to use string operators to
build a new string result using the
provided variables these variables are
located here
and we need to use additional strings
which will not change and must be in
between all the providing words the
output should be a complete sentence
play what a little less chitchat a
little more code let's code this and
we'll talk it out afterwards have
effects so the first thing we need to do
is build on your strengths what do you
know they've already told us with
results so now here is where it gets
tricky since it's a string we're going
to put it in close and start off well
this just
so they wanted to be a stuntman let's
start a dog your dog food your
we're going to add a plus sign to each
of these because that signifies space
see what I'm talking to you know about
my own
Thanks
ever
how about you what happened why not
again these plus signs organized with
spaces between each of these words so
it's not when they want big streets it's
going to concatenate so let's try in one
can't run this and just see what happens
looking the rain
told you it was actually going to work
okay so it passed me but it really
doesn't make anything so need to be a
little more critical on what we're doing
here we can't just be code monkeys we
actually have to recall our fourth grade
grammar lesson maybe 12th grade for
Romania many others of us the outputs
wreaths your dog big ran quickly that
doesn't make any damn sense so we're
going to do a little switcheroo even
though we're even though we're matching
this up
it doesn't matter so we're going to do
let's put an adjective before a noun
that sounds like a good practice right
so we're just going to switch these two
so instead of your dog pig ran quickly
theoretically it will print your big dog
when quickly I found pretty sweet so
they have your life just because we're
switching them and now you want those
hear it let's run it and see what
happens bringing that rain okay it
worked your big dog ran quickly but
we're still going to the domestic a
little bit more sleep a period or Neela
let's access to do
look at that notice you want the
exclamation mark to be right up against
I wonder what this will be such an
experiment set the plus sign signifies a
space will it
I think it's because it's reading it as
an explanation on to my adverb I'm
treading into no-man's land don't take
advice in that department so that works
someone wants to explain why this
doesn't work oh I know why that but it
means anyone explain why there needs to
be a plus sign here in order for this to
work
unexpected spring rolls
bring that rain I keep passing me okay
oops see now there's face right there so
I'm gonna clean that up wedge it right
there
so let's say we want to get a little
this is mad libs after all let's make it
a little race here
what about camp got that
to happen
mop your fat pants say excuses pretty
sure all right what lies it gets missing
semicolon
up but it's still around okay you see
there's all kinds of stuff you can be
wrong with this challenge but
essentially you're just looking to work
this problem it's past
it could not make sense out here but you
want to try it to get it to make I hope
this tutorial was helpful
is it the blind leading the blind you
tell check the description box below I'm
gonna have the link to the github page
that helped me work for this problem but
I just wanted to do a video to give you
another dimension of how this problem
can be solved thanks for watching like
comment subscribe it might be doing more
of these videos I'm just going to title
them blind leading the blind JavaScript
vol 1 pretty sweet see you guys later
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
