programming 101 today I would like to
declare that JavaScript is dead PHP is
dead at Ruby unreal is dead dead
programming languages today on the real
tough candy Channel some people are born
gamblers I only gamble when I'm drinking
heavily and it's usually just penny
slots when I make a choice I want to be
relatively certain the choice I'm making
is going to pay off in the future
that's philosophy also applied to me
when I was first learning about
programming languages I scoured the
boards at Stack Overflow and various
other hubs for geeks JavaScript is dead
PHP is dead you idiot
angular Express and node are all dead
and why the hell are you using a
variation of JavaScript for your
back-end stuff it all of these comments
got me feeling really down you know not
the depressed way but in the way where I
really couldn't make a decision on what
language to pick because these gurus
these geeks and these people who are
really smart
are also really confident and cocky a
lot of the times and their language is
the only language in the world
every time I seem to get a grasp on what
language I wanted to learn some
commentator a journalist in tech or
maybe just a guy with a lot of points on
Stack Overflow would come along and
squash my dreams this language is dead
you're stupid and stick to the kitchen
not very encouraging for someone trying
to learn a language for the first time
there's not a lot of designated
Authority people sort of rise to the top
and these strict technical people
sometimes have a very bad way at
communicating things so there's not
really an authority an authoritative
figure a newbie can go to and just sit
at their feet like a student of
Aristotle and just absorb everything so
for me every time I pick something I
picked god I don't know Ruby Ruby on
Rails at least five languages right so
every time I'd start getting into it and
I came across a problem I'd be like this
language sucks let me go let me go to
the internet and have them confirm the
fact that this language sucks
take your language take any programming
language put it in Google and then ad
sucks
you'll get tens of thousands of results
or he's dead
now that's another thing visual basic
declared dead in 2008 the Microsoft just
because a programming language is dead
or legacy doesn't mean it's wiped off
the face of the earth it just means it's
not as popular and no longer actively
supported there are thousands of
institutions across America believe it
or not that still use Kobol
what's Kobol I wouldn't recommend ever
actively going out of your way to learn
it at that code that's dead and no
longer maintained Eric Watts they need
people to maintain it they need people
to update the documentation and they
need people to migrate that code to
something a little more modern
eventually so here's the takeaway for
noobs when you come across these
articles the Stack Overflow intelligent
ramps these comment on tech articles by
intelligent people going on ramps and
you hear the words X language instead
keep going with your language I can't
tell you how many times I've looked over
these forums that say javascript is dead
why are you using javascript javascript
is a toy language it's stupid you're a
toy or a poodle get out of my life make
me a sandwich why does it always go back
to that sandwiches hmm so most of us
when you see those words don't panic and
don't put a language when you see these
things over and over because they're
posted everywhere I gave up JavaScript I
gave up Ruby I gave up something else
because I kept seeing these things and
you want to know what these people are
full of they may think they're
right because their language is the best
oh yes it's it's the best it's the best
but if you quit that language on the
recommendation of a smart dork which is
kind of the same thing I guess I've
never met an idiot dork great yes I have
you go on the recommendation you've
wasted two or three months or maybe just
a week learning this language and it's
not going anywhere trust me guys
especially JavaScript okay
yeah a lot of the web is built on PHP
but people are also saying PHP is dead
have you checked WordPress recently PHP
is quite alive so I went back to
JavaScript and people saying that
javascript is dead that can really suck
my left one because it's simply not true
it will go out of fashion but there are
millions of applications built on
JavaScript and they need people who ever
owned these things who ever monitor
these things these companies these micro
businesses they need you to maintain
update migrate and so on and so forth
that language javascript will become a
legacy language eventually final
takeaway if you're learning a language
and you like it even if you don't like
it try and stick with it
like I say my other videos I don't like
telling people what to do but this is
going to save you a lot of time and
frustration every time you read some
knucklehead on the internet saying your
language is dead it's not dead even if
it's a legacy language it is not dead no
programming language is dead there are
government agencies that still use
mainframes for 1970s
I assure you none of this tech is dead
guys stay alive in that chrome answer
bringing them back from attack thanks
for watching this video guys we'll see
you the next one
stay tuned subscribe like comment you
know the drill
keep this channel alive if you like what
you saw you believe in liberating free
information support me on patreon it
really helps even a dollar really helps
a lot thanks a lot guys we'll see the
next video
