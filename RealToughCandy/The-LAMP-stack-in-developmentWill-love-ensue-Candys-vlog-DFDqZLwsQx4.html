you don't have to have dialed is not in
service at that time this first little
vlog I'm going to be doing I'm not going
to be doing them too often because I
want it to always relate back to tech
for my channel but sometimes in tech you
just have to get your butt off the
computer and get outside well I'm
getting outside today going to a school
actually that's going to be torn down
very soon
ooh I think this girl wants to beat me
up hold on I found a snare drum a
vintage Ludwig snare drum last week in
the freaking dumpster a great mechanical
or physical condition probably plays
pretty darn good do so we're going to be
checking some dumpsters so on our way
over to the school let me give you guys
an update on some stuff I'm working on
as far as tech projects started working
on my first app for my portfolio as some
of you viewers and subscribers might
know I've been not doing this very long
just started doing it seriously for
about two months learning JavaScript and
stuff been dabbling in it for about a
year and a half deciding what to learn
and how to learn it and all that good
stuff but trying to build a portfolio
for got the idea about you know two
months ago so I've been working on that
and one of the projects I kind of just
started tweaking and working on this
image map for you guys who know HTML
image maps are a relic of the 90s and
not really used all that much
they're pretty dated looking but I found
a really cool way to incorporate it into
a app so I've been working on this app
and adding functionality as I'm working
on the image map I know right like how
does that even happen but so I'm working
on that and I added my sequel database
last night I started tweaking on that
that sounded really bad I don't do drugs
oh okay we're leaving anyway and I
started working on that database and you
know getting my sequel set up and then
pH or he set up to work on my Mac and
actually before the end of the night I
had the lamp deck I was working with
Linux Apache what CM my sequel and PHP
and I never intended on doing that so
that was pretty cool the image map is
really the founding idea but not the end
result I know that sounds cryptic but do
a few videos on that and show you guys
yeah I swear to God all these people are
on playing GTA and I'm not the good guy
in GTA look it's run over in GTA is good
guys effectively they all get run over
I'm a hapless pedestrian so this is the
school that's going to be torn down as
you can see up top there I don't know if
you guys can see that you see that
little fringe top right there that's
part of a WPA building and for you
welfare historians the WPA was form of
constructive welfare back in the
Roosevelt era FDR and the school has a
lot of asbestos in it they're getting a
new school and fortunately or
unfortunately it's out with the old in
with the new it's kind of a shame
because the old build school has a lot
of character like you go inside and
there's these old wooden banisters and
like secret little closets God knows how
many disgusting pieces of DNA and each
of them what do you have in here this
one friggin stinks there ain't nothing
in there that's just garbage
let's go to this dumpster dumpster over
here and see what the poppin beats by
dre beats by dre got some beats by dre

that I might be back later this dumpster
isn't going anywhere for a few days and
for God's sake
share the road here with these freaking
off-road vehicles
I know my right so one thing I do want
to throw in there as far as education
I'm not going come on y'all know I'm not
going to just walk around talking about
dumpster diving gotta throw in some
educational portion a few nights ago I
don't know how I think one of my
subscribers actually left a comment yeah
oh yeah I got a lot to tell you guys so
if you haven't check out the video for
my 300 subscriber anniversary
celebration come party with me video I'm
giving away a free book for learning
JavaScript and I think you should
register because there are hardly any
strings attached and it's free so go
ahead and check that video out the other
thing I wanted to add which goes back to
that video is that a subscriber listed
one of his favorite resources for
learning JavaScript and I had never
heard of it and I just checked it out a
few days ago and it's called watch in
code and it's by this guy named Gordon
Zhu and tonight he's doing a 1-hour
asked a programmer session you can ask
him anything you want and he has worked
on some amazing projects I can't
remember exactly what his resume has on
it but it's nothing to sneeze at and so
that's going to be exciting I'm actually
signing up tonight by the time this
video goes up however it probably be
over but he does do the ask a programmer
a number his name for it but that's
essentially what it is he does it every
week and it's at night so you guys you
know have day jobs can come home and
chill out with this dude for an hour and
ask him your questions about JavaScript
and I thought that was pretty freaking
cool
and I'll put his link for his program in
the box below is a free course now I
know the Internet is flooded with these
free courses but this guy seems legit so
I can't recommend in one way or another
right now but I'll let you guys know how
that goal is when I attend that session
whoo seating up in here all right guys
