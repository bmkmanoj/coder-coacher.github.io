tough candy calm back in the silo with
you guys today hey not on camera today
because the video I'm doing is going to
be a full defection of this website more
specifically this landing page homepage
wherever you want to call it and it
definitely deserves our full attention I
don't want my presence getting in the
way of what we are looking at so the
voice is here the face is not I assure
you
my evil twin is not abducted me what are
we looking at today marie forleo's
entrepreneurs marietv and philanthropic
collection on marieforleo.com assassins
cryptic we'll be going through it in
just a moment but basically here's what
you need to know about her in order to
understand more about this website so
marie forleo number one endorsed by
freaking Oprah Winfrey she is a very
successful self-made woman entrepreneur
of multi disciplines and she's also a
life coach so that's all to say that she
is successful and also to say that her
image is her brand and her brand is what
sells there's a lot of protein in that
sentence so give it a thought I'm going
to throw on this video for just a few
seconds so you can kind get a feel for
what she's liked just let it roll free
for a few seconds and it will go over to
her website ah
hey Marie yeah knock knock who's there
little lady
little lady hell know you could yodel
hey it's marie forleo and you are
watching marietv the place to be to
create a business and life you love now
I have a question for you do you ever
have one of those days where it feels
like you're doing a ton of things so
that's very clean kind of funky a little
loose you know not too uptight her
button here is button but her intro is
you know getting in the really oh and
worry about she's gettin it she's
getting it
like that intro a lot it's funky but as
you can see very professional but also
not too not too serious a little a
little laid-back but still trying to get
your attention with professional
elements so she has three hundred
eighty-five thousand subscribers again
endorsed by Oprah so start thinking
about her demographic right the biggest
thing to remember is an overwhelming
majority of her viewers are most likely
women that said let's go to her site now
again she's an entrepreneur so at the
end of the day she wants to make money
which is freaking awesome get that money
more you get that money so you might
even consider this an e-commerce site
which is highly refined so let's just go
ahead not going to go through the entire
site but we'll take a look at a few
select design elements that I noticed
when I was looking at this site last
night number one this hero image which
is actually not an image but a video I
was going to call it a gift but as you
can see look at the fade in this is a
very nicely done example of this again
10 out of 10 so she's looking at slow
motion she's smiling it's a warm
inviting image video rather and notice
how this video stops in her eye her eyes
are focused on this herb her mission
statement but her her motto her slogan
the world needs that special gift that
only you have
it's clean its professional but there's
a little bit of funkiness and a little
bit of looseness look at this this is a
little you know she's not too uptight
right there's a little bit of a cut in
the dress I don't know if she paid $5.00
for it I don't know if she paid $100,000
for it and even if she paid a million
she'd still be getting her money's worth
because the stickiness of this page the
time you spend the time people spend on
it increases with each element look at
this Marie why is that little M there
underline this is kind of weird is that
like her thing I don't know much about
this woman what's up Oh was and make
them want more Marie Forleo make
connections make mistakes make history
make peace make them want more isn't
that cool I encourage you
the site on your own because I can't go
through every element today and take
things that you like guys the sites like
these listen you can't steal or picture
and call it you but you can take some of
the ideas take the ideas that you like
and use them for your own so now let's
go down here and learn more oh I want to
learn more I want to learn more
whoo hi I'm Murray an entrepreneur a
writer philanthropist so she's inviting
you more as you scroll down you're
getting I don't want to say sucked in
but I'll say it you're getting more and
more sucked in to this woman's life now
the other thing I want to point out is
that even her photos when you're
developing you may or may not be doing
the graphic design work depending of
Anik your freelancer or what your role
is in your position but if you're doing
photos notice too that these photos are
intentionally constructed where she's
the center of attention
she has this on the side this is kind of
like the rule of thirds here this is a
third this is the third and then this is
a third and it just the door kind of
sucks you in you don't notice that so
the door is the center point here to
direct you to her message and her photo
okay I want to what's going on here oh
and now we have a like an epic lot quote
okay cool this is her mission her work
is devoted to sharing ideas tools and
resources that will help you create well
anything
dang girl you're making some promises I
don't know should I believe this oh and
now learn how to get anything you want
notice each block is sucking us in more
and more and guys again this is an
e-commerce website you can't tell that
it is it's so perfectly executed I
challenge any graphic designer or any
any front-end developer to find fault
with this I really honestly I would I
would enjoy hearing your guys's
critiques on this website download now
so she's given you a free product in the
third pane here actually this is the
fourth pane whoa
Marie TVs oh okay watch now take a leap
in here she's showing off her her
protegees customers clients I don't know
what she would like to call them but
happy butterflies ooh now as we keep
going down and down we're getting
Weston more and more she's a thought
leader for the next generation Oprah
frickin Winfrey people and not said
Oprah frickin Winfrey up here look at
this
here's another design element this
parallax effect that is the photo in
front moves at a different rate than the
photos and back watch as Russell Simmons
Arianna Huffington this is kind of her
lookbook panel right here let's go down
that's a very nice parallax parallax
effect very well executed she has more
photos Richard Branson these blockquote
and flock quote right here matches up
with this I can go on and on and finally
the last pane on this entire website
landing page because there's other
things you can go to different parts of
her website but this is just the front
now this is a photo of perhaps of
underprivileged African children in
Africa now this is an interesting one
because all of these photos and all of
these pains up until that point have to
do with Marie right Marie as herself
Marie being cute in front of a door and
introducing herself Marie's epic
blockquote
Marie trying to tell you you can get
anything you want very inspiring you
Marie's clients Marie and famous people
African children now this is an
interesting technique as well a ten out
of ten in my opinion why because again
going back to her demographic mostly
women with some young guys okay some to
be fair some this photo depicts African
children this photo depicts pencils this
photo also depicts yellow shirts but
this photo does not represent African
children and it does not represent
yellow shirts it represents empathy
because this is part of her side project
of supporting kids overseas or
impoverished whatever I don't know who
it supports but women value empathy and
this is
it part of her this is part of her
landing page and it's a value that her
viewers or her clients or customers
they're placing it like at kind of the
top so this photo is actually a very
well chosen photo because unfortunately
although it is a stereotype of the
Generation X white lady from America
helping black kids or in Africa or Oprah
helping kids in Africa it's it's a
stereotype but it is effective my
favorite element and all of this is
probably the hero video where she comes
in and it fades in and then she's
looking at that message combining so
many elements to create a page that
sucks you in it really does like so what
is she looking at the world needs that
special gift that only you have an
individual message for everyone who
visits this page oh she's talking about
me I encourage you guys to check this
website out because there's a lot to see
I mean feel of the baro baro as far as
design ideas and if you're into
e-commerce this is a great way to do it
guy I'm not I'm not going to sugarcoat
it this is a sales page and her team has
done it very brilliantly and giving us
some ideas and doing that man I want to
steal this I wonder about how
efficiently code this that forget
efficiency I just want to code it but I
hope you found this video interesting
maybe giving giving you some ideas
lookbook here courtesy of marie forleo
didn't even have to look at the source
code because there's just so much going
on just above the hood if you will
