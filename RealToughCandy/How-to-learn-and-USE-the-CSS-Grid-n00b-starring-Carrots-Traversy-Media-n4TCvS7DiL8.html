very very nice what the heck is this
grid system all about and why do I need
it
great question I don't know I do know
that it is the talk of the CSS world who
has been for quite some months among
many other things gen Simmons is
absolutely crazy for CSS grid as are
many other front end designers and
developers I don't have anything special
to share about CSS grid the only thing I
can tell you with certainty is that I
found two resources in my research that
I think I'm gonna be referring to for
the next couple weeks
this first one shout-out to Chris Hawkes
who shared this the other day the grid
garden over at CSS grid garden calm it's
an interactive tool where you can learn
the syntax of the grid and I'm stuck
right now on level 22 no level 23
freaking stuck so learning about the
fractional unit has has caught me off
guard a little bit so working on this
and also traversée media of course he
drops a responsive grid CSS video today
45 minutes what I like about Brad's
stuff is that he doesn't get so far in
the weeds like a lot of instructors or
people doing videos where it's just like
well in 1767 the descendant of Columbus
discovered to CSS grid ancestor like he
stays on topic and it's packed with how
to's he's all about the implementation
and getting you up and running so I'm
not even done with this video but I can
tell you that if you're ready to
implement CSS the CSS grid check out his
video I'm sure all you guys are already
subscribed his channel other than that I
can't say I've been wowed by any other
CSS grid video or resource for dummies
I'm at the dummy level
with this because I just used bootstrap
or skeleton or some other framework to
do it for me and this is my little
effort here this is what I have so far
just playing around with some layouts
you know the planner on with the grid
column and stuff and as you can see it's
very simple to change the way this lays
out boom just like that with the change
of one little digit so lots to learn
lots to go through but got to keep it
simple got a start simple short video
thanks for watching and if anyone has
any suggestions on how to solve this
problem I'm definitely listening I don't
get the fractional thing maybe I should
read it
it's alright guys thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
