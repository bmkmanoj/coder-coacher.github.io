wanted to pop on and give some context
to this video before I press the play
button on it this is part of a video I
did the other day on using social
engineering techniques to plan an attack
this is the second part of that video of
the reconnaissance phase of social
engineering
so basically here's the scenario
we have been hired by agent a to
ultimately conduct an attack to wage war
with this woman's company's email server
we want it to go down in flames we have
the name of the email server we have the
kind of firewall that they're using so
now we need we've we used our we
maximized our open source intelligence
sources so now we are throwing out a
line reeling it in and hoping that this
woman will get in touch with us and in
this video she does so like I said we
got we used our open source intelligence
sources including her blog the company
website and now we are going to place an
ad and you will see in here exactly how
this works so we can get even more
information I do want to add even if we
can't get specific information from this
woman in this phone call eventually we
are gonna be able to create this
composite this this bigger picture and
who says we have to use this information
for our email server attack any
information in this scenario is good
information so without further ado there
is the backstory
let's go reverse social engineer this
woman named Luanne Garfinkel so here's
what's happening
my mentor this guy you know he's been
he's been doing the blackhat thing for
some time he's making this educated
guess right because he looked over her
her getconnected profile which is the
knockoff of LinkedIn so he's guessing
that LuAnn probably left her old job at
assist as an assistant director of IT
over at Global toupees or US or whatever
it was for her new job which is you know
director of global IT for a promotion it
was only was promotion based so this
woman we're creating a psychological
profile
this let's go back to this woman just so
I can show you this woman is a career
woman she's driven she keeps a blog
going on i.t insights on firewalls for
God's sakes she's a nerd and she loves
her job and she's committed she also
likes making money she's crawling she's
climbing up that promotional chain and
she's ready for another promotion she's
been in this current position since 2009
man she's getting some cobwebs on her
it's time to give Luanne what she wants
we are gonna give her the opportunity of
a lifetime because we are gonna place
some ads targeting Luanne you know
Millennials and Gen Xers largely don't
read newspapers anymore
but people like LuAnn and Luann's
husband do and the odds are she's gonna
come across the Help Wanted section I
don't mean Help Wanted
I mean Help Wanted I hope you notice the
emphasis so let's go to the ad okay
we've created this profile based
exclusively on the information LuAnn has
given us so we're gonna be placing this
in area papers major paper surrounding
Dalton Georgia including the Atlanta
journal-constitution
Chattanooga Times Free Press and the
Northeast Georgia n' print and online
editions just in case they're reading
the paper online wanted VP of global
information technology for North Georgia
manufacturer great comm skills and the
ability to work with board of directors
minimum 20 years experience and related
degree salary commensurate commensurate
with experience it's not going to say
that I know how to read it I just never
gonna pronounce it I'm not qualified to
be a hacker just yet two serious
inquiries only contact Hollyoaks there
is room number one thing I would add I
mean I'm not the boss here I have a I
have a hacker mentor in this theoretical
situation I try and do like a targeted
ad on the knock off LinkedIn account
that
she's on all the time because you know
she's always oh I just completed a cost
and now I'm doing whatever so I tried a
social engineer to see where website
with some websites would be where she is
on what what does she access where does
she frequent what does she frequent
online and then place try and get like
an Adsense ad on there or something
advertising this job but that's just me
this might just work like a charm
so the end of this story the social
engineering says this is what happened
so LuAnn not only responded to this ad
but she submitted her resume via email
as requested and went through what
seemed to be a normal hiring process but
think again because my hacker friend was
the guy who set this up the guy paid
paid for this act he put this ad to
target to reverse engineer LuAnn
Garfinkel so this guy my my hacker
friend my hacker mentor interviews LuAnn
right and she reveals all the specific
information about the technology in
place at global enterprises so otherwise
this information be really hard to
gather but she was loving it she loves
spilling to the interviewer who was a
hacker and then the final interview was
held at a downtown hotel that we
organized with a quote-unquote corporate
recruiter because that was that was what
LuAnn was told and the reason we got
away with that was because the
prospective employer this was a story
anyway didn't want to reveal its
identity for reasons of confidentiality
so LuAnn was like alright cool I
understand that we also assured her that
job offers would come directly from the
company and so that's the other reason
we got away with using an email address
that was like you know Hollyoaks a
juvenile calm because we didn't want to
give away we want to keep his company
confidential and so this is what
happened in the end after we got that
information LuAnn was contacted by this
recruiter and basically told that the
individual that she was gonna replace
that LuAnn was
place had decided to put off retirement
for another year but LuAnn left us
pretty impressed and expect a phone call
within the year she did not realize it
but we were using burner cell phones
that were discarded after we got her
information the email address was a
burner account was an anonymous account
and she was oh that is the end of this
lab she was pwned now there is one final
blurb on how to avoid these things this
documentation said the answer is
awareness training and constant
vigilance will no freaking DAW
they also say something about like
giving rewards if you snitch I don't
know I don't even know if that's I don't
know if I agree with that I don't even
know if that's if that helps anything
one thing I do know is that you should
never trust somebody unless you have a
good reason to and never give
information unless there is a compelling
reason to now poor LuAnn was suckered
into it but going back to do not
disclose information unless you're given
a compelling reason to LuAnn were you
given a compelling reason to disclose
your firewall despite our aside from
getting maybe a few cents from people
clicking on your blog no you weren't
keep this to yourself boy hey I'm
cursing my blood pressure I don't know
if I can guys I can't hack being a black
hacker this is too much thanks for
watching let's see the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
