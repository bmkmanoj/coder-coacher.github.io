calm back online with you today doing a
follow-up on my Bitcoin perhaps
misadventures well I did get paid I did
cash out if you watch the last video I
had like 130 bucks in here which when I
cashed out was about a hundred and
seventy bucks cuz I got that Bitcoin
like right around this price range and
then I sold it like right around right
around this price range so I made some
money just by receiving money from an
overseas client the transfer to my bank
account took less than 24 hours so that
was pretty sweet however the overall
process is riddled with BS just like
PayPal I've used PayPal for years and
just out of the blue they'll be like
well we need you to confirm your
identity please call us or send us five
documents with your photo on it along
with your voter registration card and
some DNA mixed into that light you've
got to be kidding right you're out of
the red and Suggs and so does your
customer service yeah this was kind of
my experience here because after I added
a payment method my first bank account
they rejected my bank account and
removed it and I then added a second
bank account and then they said we need
to verify your identity but only if
you're buying cryptocurrency instead of
selling it so I transferred it without a
problem but if I was to buy like Bitcoin
cash like client you know any of these
crypto currencies through coinbase I'd
have to send them my ID and like I think
it was they a utility bill or something
I'm not playing with that do it the
reason people use Bitcoin is to remain
anonymous sorry to sound crabby but
these kinds of websites are just they
just pissed me off because they're not
honest and they take a lot of personal
information what reason do you have to
trust them thankfully like I said to
transfer money to my bank account I
didn't have to do that and I'm gonna
keep looking for a better site like
coinbase it's a little more user
friendly this just reeks of like
agenda21 I don't trust this site I'm
gonna link to it just in case you wanted
check it out but if anyone has any
better ideas for wallets like I said
they're more like customer or like a
user friendly please let me know getting
paid in Bitcoin was super easy
transferring it was really fast it's
just this whole authentication process
of you know sending in ten documents and
DNA samples that I'm just I'm not down
with that
thanks for watching I hope this video
was helpful please alight comment
subscribe air your grievances tell me
about your life what do you up to tell
me everything
thanks for watching we'll see in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
