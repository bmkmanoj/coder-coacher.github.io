calm back in the insane fullscreen
saddled with you today we are taking a
peek at what many people have called the
ugliest website on the internet every
graphic design nono is beautifully
employed in this design
it's from the Paisley wallpaper sides to
the ungodly non matching font colors oh
look at look at the stroke this cyan
stroke to a blue blue font face items
that are claustrophobic ly squished up
against each other
purposelessly is that even a word cars
jumping up and down there is so much
going on here blinking lights a Chinese
chick on a vintage motorcycle a dying
drag is singing girl group hits from the
60s but somehow all works I think I know
why let me go to this Newsweek article I
pulled up about this website and about
this woman who designed this website and
who owns this company so this is Ling
this is her face plastered in various
formations across this page squeeze my
brains this woman owns a car leasing
company in the UK and she's been doing
for quite some years so let's put this
Newsweek article right take it take a
peek at this you see that number
that was in 2015 now I'm assuming a lot
of that total comes from this website
oops watch this this this is the promo
video I saw for questions
it is outlandish and I find myself
coming back to see what kind of
hilarious insanity I mean it's
straight-up
design perverted but it's it's
family-friendly website aside from these
brains popping out and I think what
makes this website really work is that
it breaks every single rule of modern
day design not only that but the person
behind it breaks a lot of rules the
funny thing too is that this can this is
almost like a deconstructed 9ds website
you maybe think oh this hasn't been
updated in 20 years but then you think
oh there's some nuance here that maybe
this is one big funny thing that's also
just so interesting I have to learn more
and there's other things to this entire
site's encrypted I can't really do much
more justice to this site by talking
about it wings and cars.com think about
how the unconventional help breaking the
rules has propelled this woman and also
think about how different would the site
be if she use something like WordPress
or some other content management system
if she wasn't on this whatever Kawasaki
I don't know what that is behind these
guys singing girl tunes the Rolling
Stones
I it's just it's too much I love it
and it has a real stickiness to it
because I found my I find myself going
back to this page again and again
exploring some of these functionalities
here it's a fully functional site
apparently according to this Newsweek
article she left China in 1997 and then
took a crash course in Linux in Finland
managing to scrape a website together I
think the biggest takeaway from all
this is that this isn't necessarily
about selling cars you just want to be
suckered she gets pulled into like
blinking fuchsia botanist
oh no oh all right guys I'm signing up
let me know what you think at this site
I have gotten so many giggles from this
thing it's just it's incredible five out
of five wouldn't change a damn thing
thanks for watching see the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
