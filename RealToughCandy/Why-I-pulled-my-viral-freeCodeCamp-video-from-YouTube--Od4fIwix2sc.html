collecting collectible Thundercat action
figures reels up Danny from real tough
candy dot-com back in the saddle with
you today how are you doing guys I'm
changing up the sequence of events on
these videos stay tuned because at the
end of this video I have some killer
announcements yeah you're like Oh
announcements good one they're actually
really interesting about my music to
release coming up some people are doing
some awesome things in the RTC community
that is going to be at the end of these
videos so for these faithful of the RTC
network today's topic was free code camp
worth my time in the abstract this video
is about shaping your brand to reflect
what you represent now let me give you
some backstory about this particular
thing this is my highest money-making
video on this channel this video has
made me over a hundred dollars and it
was during a time in my channel where I
was just making videos like I was just
getting into JavaScript and coding for
web development and was applying to a
boot camp in Chicago and one of their
prerequisites was that and finish the
basic JavaScript section on free code
camp feeling bored feeling a little
brave I hit the record button it did a
screencast uploaded the video three
months later in February April around
April I thought had like 15,000 views
and now it has like 21,000 views it's
insane it's nothing like the rest of
this channel which is a shame for two
reasons number one my content has
completely transformed itself and number
two the video doesn't represent Who I am
as real Chuck candy I'm sassy I'm
confident and I'm tech savvy those are
my three core values for myself on this
channel now none of those are
represented in this video why am I
telling you guys this well because if
you are doing freelance stuff or you're
doing side projects or trying to build
your own brand as a web developer or
whatever else
you need to be very cognizant of what
type of attention your social media
posts are getting your public
appearances what you say offline you
have to be careful about forming your
brand and I was slow to realize this
video is not going to my brand remember
back in February this channel was
nothing like it is now I was doing
videos on like liver tiyanak tea which a
video that might be still be up
kombucha reviews chat my cat was
reviewing cat food nothing like it is
now and this was part of that old style
now this is one of the videos I did
leave up from that era because it was
making me money
this videos revenue by far exceeds other
things I'm doing on this channel which
is a shame because I have so many
awesome videos I've been doing this past
couple months for web developers for
tech types for freelancers trying to get
to the digital realm and so on edit
quality content this not so much I was a
frustrated movie and it may be a
testament to how much improvement some
of these camps need
I know free cooking's worked for a lot
of people but as a new back then not so
much I was pretty frustrated and didn't
have much guidance there so also this
video has 21,000 views there's a lot of
assholes and there's a lot of asshole
comments try not to curse on this
channel but calling it as it is getting
that bad attention is going to bring
down your social value as a brand and it
was getting to the point yep I could
moderate all the comments but I also
have to read the comments yeah the
trolls you suck but I also have to
invest time and taking care of you it's
not something I'm interested in you can
say whatever you want that people have
gotten really creative in their dare
trolls
show your face if you're going to
critique me that's fine but be
constructive and show your face stop
being a so this video is bringing
a lot of negative attention it some
trolls from other people who just take
women and so on and so forth it can be
disheartening for a lot of people for me
doesn't bother me because as I said in
many other videos you're not my friend
you're not my client I'm not dating you
and I'm not even
when I stand with you yeah it's like
that so that part is a bottoming it
bothers me that I have to waste my time
filtering through all these comments
it's not worth it and if you decide not
to filter those comments your social
value on YouTube is great being taken
down because this video has like 77
dislikes where is it 83 oh I've gone up
like six in the past three days sweet
253 likes 83 dislikes not a very good
ratio 81 comments I did get a hundred
subscribers and I think you guys are
getting my point it can be a hard
decision to make and this is something
I've been thinking about for at least a
month because I'm just not here on this
level anymore and if you're trying to
build your brand or even just build
yourself as a person and you want people
to perceive you as having certain
qualities you have to represent those
qualities my videos since May 5th 2017
have portrayed me as somebody witty as
somebody confident and as somebody who
is savvy in tech and it's not just a
portrayal because those things are true
that's how I am unfortunately this one a
video full up algorithms on YouTube are
not always the greatest I also pulled
off another video let's see this is like
second most popular video here guys it's
the entrance exam this was also made
before my channels transition to
something a little more interesting
full-stack Academy is actual coding boot
camp entrance exam ok as you can see not
so huge as as the free code count video
but 2,200 views that's not too shabby
for this channel I have 800 ton
subscribers on this channel also doesn't
portray my core values as Who I am on
this channel there are going to be many
opportunities for you to put yourself
out there in ways that aren't
immediately erasable there are many ways
around that in one of those ways is to
do damage control take your video off
delete your post retract your statement
there's always a chance to control your
mistake or control what doesn't
represent you this video doesn't
represent me anymore it portrays me as
an ignorant rube I am still very much
ignorant in many departments of life I
am also a Rube in many departments of
life taking the actual coding bootcamp
entrance entrance exam in July 2017 is
going to give many different results
than it did March 6 2017 I've been
working my butt off like many of you to
get these concepts down so as to advance
my life I just had to make this video
quick because I'm using revenue but it's
for a good cause it's for a long-term
purpose of building my brand a way that
I want to be portrayed in a way that
reflects favorably upon and once you
start doing that you're going to be
feeling better about your life I feel
like a burden is lifted off of me for
taking these two videos and making them
private now see I didn't make them I
didn't delete them because I think I
might want to do like a retrospective of
when I first started doing JavaScript
and like where I am you know like
February 2018 all right guys I hope this
video was helpful to keep your brand
positive keep it keep building it in a
way you want it to look now it's time
