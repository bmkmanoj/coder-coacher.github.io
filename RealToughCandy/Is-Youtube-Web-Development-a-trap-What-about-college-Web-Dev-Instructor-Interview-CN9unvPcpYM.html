some questions during the dev spotlight
how back in the day you were on like the
BBS I don't know a call like messaging
system the early internet days spent
some time in Southern California and got
interested in web development there how
did that how did that transform into
your passion for teaching people about
the Internet well let's let's fast
forward a little bit to find time and
the beautiful snaked out of Miami
Oklahoma okay
I mean I had always thought that web
development was interesting but I you
know was constantly running around there
was a period of time when I was live
when I just didn't have the time to
learn it was interesting but it was
something I was tied to later that was
during my Southern California time
because when I was living in Southern
California I wasn't living in Southern
California I was living in Mexico oh
okay California's a beautiful place to
live if you have money okay if you don't
have money it's just as ugly and brutal
as anyplace else in the country so I was
walked beastly doing a three hour
commute each way to word to and from
work this included a border crossing
post Patriot Act working eight hours
coming home and subsequently passing out
so I really didn't have the time to
really look at web thumbing until I'd
moved to Oklahoma okay at that point
things run you know basically a lot
quieter things you know you really
didn't have much to do out there unless
you were very religious or very addicted
to meth or I had a gambling addiction or
drank or I'd homicidal tendencies or
were it was or answer I didn't want any
part of those so basically what I would
do is talk to myself after one look
where
was am i happiest and that was in the
world of tech so I would basically draw
on YouTube three of us at this time
trails were just starting to break we
had people like Bucky Roberts from the
New Boston okay
we had Travis Nielsen from dev tips
Scott Levinsky was just starting to come
out okay and these were the videos that
I watched and whenever you watch and
then more people joined the home
tutorial thing helped throughout the
early to thousands tens up to now the
thing is so these videos are great some
of these videos would rival anything
that you would see on plurals
add or change meows in one culturally
quality material however you had other
problems though some of them weren't you
know some of these videos experienced
problems such as you know basically the
content that they were covering were no
longer relevant standards and best
practices on the average of grade and
the rate of once every six months okay
this taking into account the standard
march of technology along with open sort
the lander bullets were swapped we're
where we create and solve problems and
Amelia our crane it's very hard for the
content creator to maintain a sense
relative or a yell of relevancy and
staying power for their content you know
additionally had the problems I sort
were concepts were not being described
properly if I want to basically learn
about expressjs and I am totally new to
the node ecosystem you know I would like
a little bit of background information
on Odin NPM
even one or two minutes just to
basically describe it some contact you
don't see them
people tend in and I start leads
engagements with a lot of these videos
because you find out about a concept you
now need to look it up
which means you're now into another hog
post for another tutorial next you know
you'd have another rabbit hole and
engagement gets lost and we have you
know other issues such as you know some
content creators are great with
interacting with their community others
aren't right so there are potential
places where basically when tutorials
whether they're subscription or YouTube
based where a drop wolf of engagement
occurs okay now I found that for my own
learning style a class a traditional
classroom environment works in a words
well you're getting answers in real time
you're teasing apart concepts that are
not technically described in a video you
can give background information that
basically time constraints of a content
creator cannot address the problem is in
my hand I tried this in a classroom
environment at a local Community College
and the problem was this state
curriculums take years to go from their
initial proposal phase at a point that
they hit the students desk as a result
if you are expecting to go to a
post-secondary educational institution
and learn the latest and greatest in the
web technologies thing you've just been
hosts for a few thousand bucks Michael
listen to this I was looking at this
college curriculum the other night
and it was a two year degree in wet I
don't know what they called it like web
tech or something and it was a focus on
web development and the stuff that they
described in their curriculum was ten
years old
they were talking about image maps XML
just the whole course on XML I mean it
was ancient I couldn't believe it and
you know it's four hundred bucks a
cribbage
it was unbelievable I was I can't I
can't believe that that's even legal
it's a worthless degree basically how
were four different things that a
classroom environment can provide us in
hi I am a before good certain that I do
it some anecdotal stories about that
demos well in 2015
I took a class to get my associates here
the Waco web design the book publishing
day was 2010 now among the autism
spectrum I'm on the autism spectrum and
I had this evolved sense of ethics the
two of those together his interesting
because I'm sitting there with a yellow
highlighter going through this book like
a mad slash are wrong out of date that
worth standards forever I'm going the
forums and say okay this is how you
really do this I'd link to these
articles my teacher didn't like as a
result of age but yeah oh my god yeah
look I'm gonna basically reiterate
something that you told me when you had
a new syllabus one of all responsible
for our own educational experience so
she kind of cringed and put up with it
and did you pass the class yeah I did
with the scene because by this time I
was
laya conflicted between my moral you
know my sense of ethics and you know
basically playing the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
