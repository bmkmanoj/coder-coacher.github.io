in the saddle with you today we're going
over a Java program how to change a bank
account balance of a bank account this
is an assessment offered by the iron
yard Academy they're a multi-city coding
bootcamp and for people who are
interested in pursuing the Java track
they offer a mini course that's pretty
much two web pages but you'll probably
spend five or eight hours or even more
reading those two pages like I did if
you're a newbie as far as doing this end
of mini course little assessment here it
took me probably about two and a half
hours I know it sounds totally
ridiculous because there's literally
four lines of code total but once you
start doing it to the rephrase the first
20 to 40 hours to me have been a real
pain but it just keeps getting easier
and easier so as a relative newbie I
encourage everyone in my boat to stick
with it because you will learn so
whether or not you're taking this mini
course or maybe you just want to learn
how to do a cool little app like this it
doesn't matter because I'm gonna go
through it right now now let's just see
what they want us to do obviously write
some code and follow the lines for
guidance defining deposit buggies and
withdraw funds so let's go over to where
they're talking about with these to do
lines we need to increase the property
account balance by the amount and then
decrease so the first thing that threw
me off is that their mini course gave
all the examples with one file starting
off with this the main file and they
never really attached anything to it so
that right away threw me off but I was
investigating more and this told me it
was read-only so I said okay I don't do
anything with that and also the
documentation noted that this is just
for printing and checking your work to
see that these two balance out to 100
after you deposit 300 dollars well 300
something and withdraw 200 something so
let's go see over at this bank account
Java file what exactly we have to do in
order for this to shoot out 100 at us
okay like I said I the only thing I want
you to do literally is code about four
lines I do not code any of this which is
nice because I probably would still be
working on this days later so let's
start with the first thing they want to
they want us to increase the property
account balance by the amount so if you
look increase what does that mean that
means you'll be using this plus sign
right okay so here's what we're gonna do
it I'm going to let's just give us some
room here probably a little sloppy
practice but it just gets me in the zone
and I'll clean it up when I'm done we're
gonna define a new integer let's just
say you can name this whatever you want
notice the camelcase convention there
and this is going to be equal to what
they tell us they want us to add account
balance to the amount in order for that
to equal to deposit funds because you're
when you're depositing you're adding so
plus mulch but now we need to assign
real tough candy to actually equal
something so what is real tough candy
well
now which of candy is going to be the
account balance so now that we coded
this the account balance is actually
pretty real tough candy is account
balance plus amount and now account
balance is also account balance plus I'm
not let's go to this next one we're
going to do the same thing
something SEC will say more candy equals
and they tell us to decrease because we
need withdraw it's decreasing or
depleting funds by the amount and E
semicolon and guess what now we're gonna
run it and see what happens
success cool and if you guys are
interested in the iron yard Academy I'm
not plugging their institution I haven't
attended their school but they do offer
you a free t-shirt if you successfully
complete this pretty cool made in
America by the way American Apparel so
they say haven't got my t-shirt yet I
hope this was helpful this is a really
cool program I'm not really sure how I
feel about Java being a beginner's
language for people or rather for people
just starting out learning programming I
think I'm gonna stick with JavaScript to
be honest yes there's more Java
platforms and devices out there than
people I think like 7 plus billion
device isn't running Java but javascript
just seems well that'll be another video
for another day I hope this was helpful
we'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
