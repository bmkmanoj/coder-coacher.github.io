back online
with you today for perhaps the final
installment of candy codes a kickin web
app this site is online it is ready to
be seen by the masses I highly encourage
you to come visit this site being the
developer of this site I've read these
stories probably 1520 times and they
never get old
the newest arrival is Casa Darrow he has
his own YouTube channel he is such an
interesting dude this is the one that I
haven't covered in previous episodes
just growing up in Alaska and some of
his early computer experiences were just
they were riveting a lot of these
stories as far as like what they're
doing now has totally changed because
they're working so hard to improve their
skill sets like I know dr. Khmer adjust
and that's one they had to fix a
sidenote
the z-index his picture needs to come up
above Michaels but dr. Khmer had just
graduated a coding bootcamp and is doing
stuff with the blockchain and he did a
really funny rap on the blockchain
Elisa's on a different is pursuing some
different stuff mirza
tossa Darrow Jim you wanna hear the best
part is that at least two people on this
site have received Google scholarships
to study web development possibly three
I know at least two of them have earned
Google scholarships which is just
freaking awesome congratulations guys
now down here we have a plugin so this
is a totally back-end free application
that's it's it's a website it's not
really an app I gotta be honest there's
is there there isn't a lot of
interactivity this is disgust you know
it you've seen it it's pretty
straightforward and each page here let's
go to Jim's each page has a comment
section down here disgust plug-in this
is a totally responsive site totally
responsive and let's go here I want to
show you this for phones we have a
setting for iPads that was nice photos
there let's go over to the code and see
what we're working with now this is one
thing I do need to clean up these files
are just
all over the place it's mostly just
basic admin stuff I need to address with
this all the most important components
are there this is the index.html I had
to make a polyfill for the jQuery
plug-in for I think it was Explorer or
Safari I'm not I don't remember which
it's been a while since I've messed with
this index page one of things I want to
point out is that I did include a no
script message here in case people are
using javascript now I know it might
sound kind of ridiculous because we
probably all have JavaScript enabled but
there are some people out there who
don't use JavaScript you can totally use
the site without JavaScript this the
only thing that would be different is
that this would this jQuery terminal
would be eliminated and you could just
click on the photos this is all CSS
there is no JavaScript at all and there
is no JavaScript at all on any of these
either the other thing with the profiles
that I did did include were comments and
also using comments for your eyes
advantage so instead of just you know
putting a comment here putting a comment
there put a horizontal line here as a
comment so you can really see it and
segment it with your eyes and go okay
boom there's a segment boom there's a
segment here's a CSS boom
and that just categorizes things better
for your eyes and less fatiguing and
again some cleanup stuff I could
probably just like pull this and put in
Adam and then use a tool to clean up the
whitespace and stuff that's not a big
deal so for the responsiveness of this
site as you can see this doesn't look
like bootstrap this doesn't look like a
WordPress site and that was intentional
I as a creator as a creative person I
just bootstrap sites are clean and
beautiful but they're really cookie
cutter even if people really know how to
use I'm still kind of smelling bootstrap
and that goes for WordPress too you can
smell a brilliant WordPress site a mile
away these these nostrils can anyway so
I wanted to do something that was
totally unique that didn't look like
anything else but that was easy to use
you know WordPress and bootstrap are
very easy to use from a user standpoint
so here's one thing I fix with this eye
you can let's say we typed in that that
would still return his profile also you
can use the terminal to go to an About
section you can use the terminal to type
help really cool I forgot I did that so
you can you know explore some Easter
eggs if you can even use the clear
command on that explore some Easter eggs
in the terminal but like I said it's
progressive in the fact that it caters
to people who are developers and also
family members and people who stumble
upon this site so currently this site is
available on github like I said I'm
looking for some good names to
permanently house this site probably the
biggest thing I have to do and the site
is encrypted all github pages are
encrypted which is super nice so that is
that thank you for watching thank you
devs this site is almost a time capsule
it's been a few months since I published
the last developer that was Casa Darrow
like I don't know probably September or
October hopefully a season two will get
here I'm not real sure where that might
lead thanks for watching check out the
site these devs are killing it you're
gonna get inspired by reading their
stories the end we'll see in the next
