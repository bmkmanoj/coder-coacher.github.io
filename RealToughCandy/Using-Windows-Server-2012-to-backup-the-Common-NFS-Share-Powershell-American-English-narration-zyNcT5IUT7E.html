tough canycom back in the saddle with
you today how's it going thanks for
stopping by today is part three of my
little video series if I could talk
today my little video series on
implementing a business continuity plan
now this is in the event that your
business gets plowed over by an
earthquake good God it happens awful I
know so for the unexpected events in
life you always want to have a backup
you always want to have a plan B in the
enterprise environment so let's just
recap what we did in the first video we
installed a Windows Server backup and
then we went on we pressed forward to
use that back up to make a daily backup
of Active Directory that was pretty cool
and then in the second video I did the
very last video I did prior to this one
we configured to websites to use a
common NFS share we configured we didn't
let redundant webOS servers to use an
NFS on a third storage server for web
content and now today finally to wrap up
the sweet action we're going to be using
windows to back up the common NFS share
so if you're following along at home or
at least doing some sort of seller
activity here just know that we are
kicking off not from scratch but rather
under the assumption that active
directory active directory has been set
up for backup windows server has been
set up for backup and then also that
these websites have been configured to
use a common NFS share so all these
components are in place as we start
today this is not some scratch
unfortunately so I'm on a Windows Server
2012 virtual machine right now and just
for kicks and giggles I'm going to go
over to my remote desktop connection
here because that's what like
documentation is having me do hey I
don't get paid enough to ask too many
questions about how the boss wants
things done I do complain about them
offline and sometimes online but not to
his face so let's go ahead and maximize
that target windows you know we're on a
remote connection here because we can
see that IP address and we're going to
go ahead
it in get in to powershell now the
PowerShell icon is this little like blue
box with an arrow on it reminds me of
like the usps I don't know why we
deliver for you all that good stuff so
we're in PowerShell right now and now
we're simply going to type CMD for
command and we're going to open up the
command shell prompt so this
documentation is noting that we're using
PowerShell which will become a command
prompt because while PowerShell is the
new microsoft paradigm fancy words the
NFS mount in the next step is only
supported by a traditional command
prompt to the CMD that you guys are used
to seeing in documentation capital C
capital m tackle be so the PowerShell PS
drive commands do not support all the
same switches at the command mount
command supports so that is why we're
reverting to the command prompt so now
we're going to mount whoo so dirty we're
going to go mount dash 0 and in the M
type can be card 172 dot 30 dot 0 dot
200 a little slow there because I'm a
little lagging some on a virtual machine
we're gonna do /er /w w w and then we're
going to press the asterisk and then
we're going to go ahead and press enter
what alright guys if you get an error up
here the reason i got an error is
because i had to restart my server
before i just started in this video and
i forgot that it restarted everything so
i had to go back to part one and install
my windows server backup as well as
configure the Active Directory backup so
I did that and then this was already
done prior to me starting the recording
session of this video to configure the
website so we should be good to go with
this now I retype the command mount- om
type r 1 72 Dodge there VAR /w all that
good stuff so let's go and try hit enter
again and
should have some action okay so what is
this this is a little bit different than
why I had the first time I think we are
getting somewhere actually we're not
getting somewhere because you know what
I have to do is go to CMD that's right
go to command okay and we're going to
type that one more time I'm actually i'm
not going to edit these errors out just
because you might have the same issue so
we're going to go ahead and amount this
once again inside the command interface
here go ahead and do that alright guys
we successfully completed that and z is
now successfully connected to 17 to 23
got 0 dot 200 colon forward slash var
forward slash www now this documentation
also notes that I could verify that i
completed all the previous steps in the
first three parts of this which was my
actual problem and then it continued to
say if you are still having problems
check the spacing and replace the spaces
when you see the underscore here so just
an alternative way of checking your work
because again in the command line
there's a lot of stuff that can go wrong
so we're going to go ahead and change
the directory to a web server we're
going to go in hand oops get back in
this here free to go dir Z so these are
the contents of our web server here we
have two files of the index and web
3.jpg and we have a lot of bites free
and again we have two files here in this
web server so now we're going to do is
we're going to create something called
em k link we're going to go /d and then
c drive www
now what I hit enter this MK link
command is going to create a symbolic
link so that my remote to drive up here
this C Drive can be accessed as a local
folder called ww on the C Drive this is
pretty cool so this type of link is
enabling tools like eggs copy to work on
remote drives by making them appear
local to the OS and if we go up here way
back here where is it talking about NFS
so NFS again originally use in the UNIX
operating system it's used to make
remote folders appear as part of the
local file system on linux and windows
systems so let's go ahead and see if
this actually works so now we're going
to go ahead and press ENTER on that and
we created that symbolic link that is
confirmed and now let's see where we are
here ok I forget we can't do certain
commands and power shells we're going to
go ahead and change director are going
to go back to our root directory here
which is change directory CD and then
backslash so now we're going to change
directory we're going to concede ww go
ahead and change directory some new link
directory boom so we're going to go
ahead and press dir type that rather and
as you can see the contents of the C
Drive www are right here that is pretty
freaking cool now we have one more step
to go before this part 3 is complete
we're going to go ahead and oops what on
earth is going on whoa baby come back so
we're going to go ahead and type notubes
lowercase notepad we're going to create
a batch file and a batch file is a text
file that contains a series of commands
that the computer needs to execute so
we'll go ahead and do that and the first
thing we're to do is create the text
file to use xcopy to create a backup
copy of our new WWF older and then we're
going to schedule that backup command to
happen every day
so we're going to go ahead on type
change directory /i and then /y see if
that computes with my documentation it
does it does indeed we're going to go
ahead and file save as we're going to go
to the target windows 01 desktop
so
powershell and what we're going to do is
type SCH tasks a forward slash run /t n
and then we're going to put web back up
in quotes and we're going to press ENTER
now this command is going to run the
scheduled task named web backup
immediately and that is what we saved as
you can see oops alright guys I messed
up I put a backslash there and sent a
forward slash burst into this one more
time SCH tasks board / 14 / 10 web
backup now this command is going to run
the scheduled task name web back up he
immediately go ahead and hit enter all
right guys I sort of ran into a little
snafu I wasn't actually following my
documentation word for word so what we
want to do now is create a commands that
creates a new task name web back up and
schedules that task to run the batch
file we just created wants to run that
on a daily basis so we have to we have
to follow this very specifically and as
you can see ahead a real staff through
here so we're going to go in ahead and
type in SCH tasks forward slash create 4
/ 10 we're going to call this web backup
/tr we're going to put that on the c
drive backward slash users oops and
again the capitalization is important so
now we're dealing with back flashes ad
minister a whore backward slash desktop
then there's a lot of stuff to goof up
here www back up bats for a batch file
which we just created if you do /s see
and that's going to be daily go ahead
and press ENTER and that can create our
command and that has been confirmed the
web backup has successfully been created
so now we are going to run that let's
just see if that works that would be
really awesome SCH tasks for / run /t n
we're going to call that web back up
since that's what we named it and now
enter so we're going to this enter once
we hit enter it's going to run the
scheduled task named web backup
immediately OOP you see that I saw it
and then it disappeared so now we are
going to verify that the web backup task
copied the files from the WWE directory
I did see a brief flash in the pan there
but let's confirm with powershell that
indeed it was backed up so we're going
to see backslash back up look at that
boom verified so web back up that task
copied the files from the ww directory
sweet alright guys so that is what you
do again I kept my mistakes in here just
in case you run into them let's go over
what we did holy buckets we use windows
to back up comment and assess share
using powershell and i remember
powershell becomes a little bit tricky
because have to use the CMD vs drive
commands do not support the things which
is that the command mount command
supports for this so i hope this video
is helpful maybe a little confusing for
you but once you have your documentation
it's going to make a little more sense
and you know get into powershell and
doing all that stuff when you have your
supervisor and your documentation next
to you you're pretty much golden alright
guys i hope this video was helpful we
see in the next video
