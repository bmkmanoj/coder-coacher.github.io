benefit benefit about these jobs is that
they only go to us medicine so you're
not competing against global applicants
so that's nice people from overseas are
eligible for any type of security
clearance in the federal government so

seeing technical words here assist in
planning designing developing testing
integrating and deploying web-based
applications that interface with very
configurations of hardware and software
guys they'll even list the technologies
on this one they're just like yeah our
applicants they're going to know more
than what we know about anything about
web development so and IT in general so
follows best practices for front-end web
integration work guys these barely even
know they don't even know what you need
to know specifically for this job maybe
that's why they're paying $80,000 to
start there's not one technology listed
on here as far as let's just check this
additional information just to make sure
i'm not talking out of my rear a not
they're relying on you to bring your
know how to run this department okay
let's go back let's try one more um I
don't know what about like amber no
views what about like you know
frameworks and libraries what about the
Yahoo user interface that'd be really
funny oh my gosh that is doing that pop
one up what about Ajax that'll be the
last one look at that the IT software
developer position at the national
geospatial-intelligence agency working
for the Department of Defense
name-dropped Ajax cool programming
experience and C C++ Python Perl Ruby
JavaScript or Java I love of a through
JavaScript through in between all these
heavy hitters these object-oriented
programming languages well Ruby but Java
C++ that's pretty cool or JavaScript oh
well swears that Ajax there we go skills
and Ajax JavaScript database design
sequel or knowledge of and/or knowledge
of tcp/ip and network programming
special info direct deposit two-year
probationary period this is what this
means you have to be on your P's and Q's
for two years otherwise they can fire
you for any reason yep that's what I
said plus a top secret clearance
security clearance required polygraph
test you can see why these jobs have 20
vacancies in these locations these
despite the fact that they pay well you
know 123 thousand dollars per year if
you're experienced for an IT software
developer not a bad gig but when this
salary is matched at a workplace that
has casual Fridays and refrigerators
filled with craft beer and crafts peanut
butter some people refrigerate the
peanut butter I don't know is that a
California saying I don't know you know
the benefits of a casual work
environment are often times more
appealing they're always more appealing
than a damn polygraph test and the
modern programmer if you're under a
certain age or of a certain persuasion
these jobs just are not appealing I'm
not saying they're awful jobs or you
know whatever not trying to crap talk
them down to error discourage people
from applying to these if you know
really federal service is your column
because it is a calling for some people
but I just wanted to express the
observation that there is a reason that
these jobs remain open and it's because
they have hurdles
at the special info these are all
hurdles well with the exception of the
direct deposit that a lot of people just
don't find appealing so I hope this
video was entertaining educational
little enlightening maybe inspiring you
to research this more or call off your
research on this don't know but usajobs
gov is the job board for federal
government jobs alright guys thanks for
