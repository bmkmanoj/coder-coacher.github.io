I can't determine reality from fiction
would you want to know reality I did use
on to Stella's inheritance money to buy
a nice ass computer that's the reality
that's the reality Zion is not in
service at this time
side act laptop custom-built yeah
without further ado let's open her up
all right use the XM six model it's a
gaming computer I don't do much gaming
but I really like the look of them and
it's kind of what started me on this
they're these geysers have five stars
across the board for customer service
and that is true but that was my
experience as well and a lot of people
really like how they package the product
because you you don't know this computer
so and when you order you get a couple
what you get some freebies so I did I
ordered a Vidak shirt which I got they
also have zine acts and chill which is
pretty cool and then I got a free
Corsair Gaming Mouse because of your
upgrade because you get a little
interior upgrade of the computer itself
the computer as it stands is I think
it's around twelve hundred bucks and I
upgraded a few things I ended up being a
little over 1,400 bucks I increased the
memory to 16 gigabytes
and I got the 17 inch screen and think
ways I think they said a weighs about
seven pounds
you're the website you can get a lot of
really cool all their stuff is super
cool and and they're pretty willing to
accommodate whatever you need got a
power cord it looks like check and these
computers they have it comes with an
automatic two-year warranty and I think
it's a lifetime replacement on parts and
customer service I went for the XM 6
because I don't need anything super
crazy just stuff for for work and so you
can customize them so they it starts out
with a base it's 1240 bucks and then as
you can see the left it's got all the
all the specs and you can you can edit
everything from storage to you know what
type of screen got upgraded my memory
does 16 because I need that but I
expanded my storage the m2 SSD I was I
went up to this guy right here alright
well I was looking I was looking at a
similar type of computer of a major
major name-brand and I just I get kind
of bored with that I disliked the it's
just the implication that like in order
for something to be quality it has to be
you know something like Sony or
Kellogg's or you know Nike it's and
that's just not true so I wanted to give
somebody somebody you know a smaller guy
you know and leave my protection up just
give him a chance and and just just buy
everything I read it seemed like the
just seemed like a risk worth taking so
you know if I'm going to be spending
1,400 bucks that's that's a lot of money
for me so I want to give it to somebody
that I think is worthy of having my
money power supply I'm gonna talk to
power before do that you know what we
got four ins and outs here let's not
skimp yeah oh there's a Sun bunny this
is a meet right here check out all the
reports okay yeah we're not skimping
there I mean no CD drives all I mean
it's nothing nineties anymore right nor
can you drive and that was actually that
was a turn-off but you guys what was
that because they freak so frequently
that that was something they didn't want
to invest in so just get like a USB DVD
you CD whatever that's right that's
right oh my god oh my god look at the
light green this is kind of weird though
this is a hardcore gaming computer they
don't skin but then that ships with
Windows 10 I mean that was kind of a
drawback for a lot of people is that
true or what were your thoughts on the
Windows 10 thing I'm not a fan of
Windows 10 but that's what that's what
it comes with and when the option comes
to upgrade to something else I will be
doing that edge talks we don't want your
help
talk to a representative well it's
windows 10 right at the box yeah Windows
10 ruins everything so the computer
going back to the actual physical aspect
of the computer it's very thin for all
the things inside of it let's get a side
profile on that very very thin is it
light to you to your touch or it's heavy
heavy yeah yeah it's six and a half
pounds so it confirmed that Windows 10
is the only thing that ships with
probably the biggest downfall the entire
operation this is a pain in the ass it
wants to use my fingerprint to sign in
faster I'm not doing that side acts are
you listening here are you shipping out
spyware machines that you work for the
NSA
are you getting paid as an informant
info on this is a screen cleaning cloth
let's go back to some of the swag you
got here but no CDR no dvd-rw insert
disk here Singh but what the heck is
that it's a CD it's a user's manual so I
don't know important safety information
a little cheat sheet for functions and
what I do so this is a pretty cool
component from ZX they have their
proprietary antivirus that they shipped
with this computer it comes not only
with the the gaming shield is the best
software protection available for your
system it includes full licensing for
ESET nod32 antivirus and
superantispyware pro gamer mode active
the gamer mode currently suppresses all
notifications and pauses scheduled tasks
the carpoon RGB by corsair some six
fully programmable buttons on the fly
GPI switching you want to help me with
the mouse
foolish very ergonomical if you feel
good you have us here with the package
water watch the package well just a few
mats out the box how do you feel overall
about the product obviously nothing in
to in depth here because you know you
haven't gotten to explore much of it but
what are your first thoughts about
seeing it and messing around with it a
little bit and everything inside access
is providing and it's it seems tailored
to - to real people you know and some I
want to experiment with that I really
don't like Windows 10 so I'm just kind
of bummed out about that part but so I
feel good about it yeah it's a solid
piece of machinery that's what I got so
