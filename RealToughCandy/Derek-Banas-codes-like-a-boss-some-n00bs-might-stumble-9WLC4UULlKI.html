my guide Mirza a very awesome subscriber
is in the dev a spotlight don't know
what that is check it out it's
highlighting up
up-and-coming web developers and also
oops that's not it
hey where to go Michael Corps emblem is
my guest writer for this week on
realtalk datacom and he wrote a great
article on building a custom dev
environment with adam if you don't know
what that is it is a text editor to make
your life easier and it's just a little
more than a text editor it's an
environment where you can create and
Michael is a very accessible writer I
really like his writing style because
he's very intelligent but he doesn't
bury it in technical terms he speaks in
English and very easy to understand
without being condescending or anything
like that
he's very encouraging with his writing
and it's a great piece so check all this
stuff out links in description box let
Rose Derek Bono's so tell me if this
sounds familiar you're trying to learn a
framework you're trying to learn a new
language you might be a complete noob
you might be intermediate wherever you
are in your journey you go to YouTube
because you know there's free tutorials
and also it's the second most popular
search engine on the face of the planet
so why wouldn't you go to youtube and
who shows up but this guy Derek - and
you click on a video you say whoo Java
programming in 35 minutes how did I not
know it was this easy and of course you
watch it with this look at that let's
just take my internet the most common
request I get is to do a Java
programming tutorial in which I teach
the entire language or the core java
language in one video dude seriously the
entire core language in 35 minutes where
do I sign up especially as a newbie who
has consistent headaches from trying to
figure out what a nifty statement is in
JavaScript like just let's just change
languages and go to Java okay first and
foremost I want is that Derek if you are
watching us I'm sorry from slaughtering
your last name I don't know if it's
Bonasera badass or gayness I tried
googling yet nothing's coming up and
second of all this is not an attack on
your channel I really respect
Derek's channel he has multiple millions
of views over 600 45,000 subscribers and
I'm really impressed with that if I'm
envious this video itself has 2.6
million views
what he is doing is very
attention-grabbing and he knows his
stuff so this isn't an attack on his
channel rather a light-hearted look at
why these videos might be a waste of
time and are a waste of time for
beginning developers and again no
offense to Derek if he's watching this
or his fans are watching this I'm
subscribed as well so it's not an attack
piece or anything like that but the
problem with the videos that he produces
is well let's just let's get into it
let's let's go through just like 30
seconds and see also create another one
and this is going to be a dog and finish
and then the final one I'm going to
create for you cat lovers is a cat so
new come over here and class come over
here and type cat that is all we need to
do - I don't need to worry about
anything else and we're just going to
click on finish okay this is going on
normal speed so you can see how
problematic this can be for a new
learner who needs to take things a
little slower and I did try some well
then you know it's kind of not a very
good argument because there is the speed
button but I'm not going to work that's
not really going to work so you're
watching this and as a beginner about oh
I don't know the 7-minute marker so we
could just consult the comments after 10
minutes okay 10 minutes could understand
a single word watch it - high speed
learning 50 minutes about 7 minutes or
so for me I first watch this video I
said what's actually going on guys these
are not tutorials per se these are more
like show and tells these are
exhibitions there is showing you from
start to finish and a very speedily
format the basics of a programming
language now I want to go over to
JavaScript because most of us probably
aren't dabbling in Java so there's time
so of course it's going to be confusing
so let's go over to what he has to say
about JavaScript and just check this out
and again just kind of give you a feel
why this might be detrimental to
beginners and I'm going to open up
another script tag don't need any of
this stuff right here then inside of it
first I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a variable that is going to store
a name and how I'm going to get the data
the store inside of that variable is by
opening a prompt on the screen this
isn't something you would do all the
time but this is just a neat little
example okay again I want to be very
clear nor disrespect to Derrick but this
isn't how you teach people to learn a
language this is more a Show and Tell
and exhibit from start to finish of how
JavaScript works rather than teaching
somebody how it works because number one
he's going very fast number two this
doesn't make any sense okay
this doesn't explain the theoretical
behind it or even what a variable is you
know what the prompt is what the stuff
inside here is and so on and so forth
now I'm an advocate for people who are a
little slow to learning JavaScript
because I'm one of those people it took
me a year and a half to actually decide
on a language to learn because I am a
little bit slow with that but once I
start getting it it's like yeah okay
cool I'm on it I'm on it
but I know how tough it can be learning
a language and you know when a Derrick
bonus video comes up it's very enticing
to want to take take these videos as
gospel as how to learn something and
then an hour and a half later you're to
steal a phrase from one of my
subscribers you're wondering why you're
hot talk is frozen in the middle after
five minutes just look staring and
thinking or looking around I'm thinking
what the heck just happened that I am
menacing to is that you've not only
wasted two hours or an hour of your life
you're more confused than ever and one
of the worst things that can happen is
that it turns you off to learning about
tech because these tutorials are not
beginner friendly in the least they're
not even advanced from me now you can
read the comments here the best comment
I think
should have this started this video out
with this comment by a simple programmer
many of you are probably familiar with
his Dania is one hundred and two
thousand subscribers John Sodom is
awesome tutorial I've been talking about
the importance of learning Java and some
people always tell me that they find it
difficult this video definitely makes it
super easy for everyone to understand
good job Derek JavaScript tutorial hey
we all make mistakes but I just thought
that was ironic and funny so here is my
take away without continuing continuing
to roast Derek if you are a beginner or
even an intermediate and you're trying
to learn a language please stay away
from these videos for the purposes of
learning you're not going to learn
anything from them you're going to be
wondering about the status of your hot
pocket and why there are freezer burn
flakes in the middle after five minutes
when you watch these videos they are not
for learning they are simply for looking
this is a Show and Tell exhibition style
channel and please if you're a newbie
and you do watch these things don't let
it turn you after programming or web
development or whatever the topic is
there's a lot more happening than just
an hour tutorial to learn the core
concepts of the language derek channel
is again very popular he talks about a
lot of things he's very intelligent and
he has some really cool cooking shows I
saw my watch to make like a gumbo the
other night like oh that looks good
please beware of these videos because
they're going to waste your time and you
older I get the more my time is worth an
hour of my time wasted is worth more
than $500 to me to be honest
wasting time is the worst thing you can
do as a grown adult don't believe me ask
someone who's passed the age of like 29
maybe 30 I don't know point being at a
certain point your time is worth even
more than money okay it's golden it is
beyond gold I can't even quantify it
coat on and prosper guys thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed this video and
we'll see you in the next one
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
