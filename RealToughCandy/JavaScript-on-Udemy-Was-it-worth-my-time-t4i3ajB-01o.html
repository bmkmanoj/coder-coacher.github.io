an island on thousands of resources
online to take advantage of in the world
of tech education which ones are legit
which ones are just math and which ones
truly suck well this is a drop in the
river of tech today's but I'm going to
be reviewing of course I recently took
you to me that took about three weeks of
my time udemy and JavaScript the weird
part reviewed today on the real Jeff
candy Channel guy this man real tough
candy from your cough candy calm we are
here on udemy and as I said in the intro
there are literally thousands of
resources just in JavaScript my mind is
about to explode just thinking about all
the resources I've come across tripped
over heard of gave up or embraced it's
overwhelming and as more and more people
are coming to tech you know it's kind of
a hot topic in the past couple years
really hit the mainstream I mean the New
York Times has been pumping these boot
camps I've read so many articles but
that's kind of getting out of the sphere
of this video which is a review of a
particular course on udemy
now the reason I'm reviewing this course
is because it's I don't want to say it
took I invested about three weeks of my
time in this course and the name of the
course is let's navigate on over here
JavaScript the weird parts here's my
little Coursera stack here JavaScript
understanding the weird parts by Anthony
Tony Alafaya software developer
architect and UX dude 99% complete I'll
consider that good so again recently
finish this one up the reason I decided
to take this course in particular is by
recommendation of a youtuber named
coding face his name's Joe and I really
enjoy his videos check out his channel
he's a self-taught programmer working
here in the States
out east full time job talks about
everything for
you know lunchtime Chronicle and stuff
going on to program tutorials in other
words he is a relatively high trust
individual I decided to give this weird
part JavaScript understanding the weird
parts a world it was ten dollars got it
on special you know you might see this
class depending on what day you log on
to you to me for ninety five bucks I'm
not sure what the retail price is but
try and get it during a sale they you to
me is designed to get you to sign up
when you get the psychological thrill of
knowing you're getting it for $10 so
they have a lot of $10
of course sales and that's where I mean
I just don't want to veer too off course
here but bills $10 courses guys I
snagged almost all of these up for 10
bucks because the other thing is to not
with just JavaScript understanding the
weird parts you can come back to the
course whenever you want once you finish
you can still watch the videos and watch
the lectures and you know if they have
exercises participate in them so let's
get back to this javascript
understanding the weird part scores and
before I go through the pros and cons
let's just go through what it's all
about and again it was $10 by the
numbers there's 85 there are 85 lectures
11.5 hours in videos now pay attention
to that keep that number in your mind in
the back burner we're going to we're
going to address this in just a bit
skill level all levels 74,000 plus
students have enrolled in this class not
too shabby
so it doesn't say what year this was
published but going through some of his
screenshots and stuff it looks like he
published this in early 2015
maybe what late 2014 which you know in
the tech world it's kind of old but to
be honest all this stuff relates back to
vanilla JavaScript with the exception of
the section on jQuery and jQuery you
know it's been around for a few years
also so nothing too outdated all this
stuff is still relevant let's go back to
this video eleven point five hours thing
I don't know if you remembered but in
the intro
Oh section of this video the beginning I
said I was on here for about three weeks
I was using this course nightly for
three weeks for anywhere from a half
hour to three to four hours sometimes
you know maybe even more but at least at
least a half hour at night even if I
wasn't learn anything trying to push
myself through so that doesn't really
equivalent the equivalent of 11.5 hours
because this is just the thing the
videos are of him lecturing not you
engaging in the content or teaching
yourself how to use these concepts so he
talks this is a lecture style course all
of his videos are of him lecturing and
showing you what he's doing to
illustrate the concepts you don't get
homework you don't get exercises you
don't do labs this is like that class
back in college freshman year in the
auditorium where you sit back grab some
notes that are like yeah big goal wins
launch fortunately this is much more
engaging but it is a lecture style so
you have to take notes you have to kind
of invent your own labs for example
understanding the prototype for me
understanding the prototype is really
difficult because it's pretty abstract
it's not every day you hop on to a code
editor and start you know banging out
prototypes and exploring them in the
JavaScript console in chrome I'll
probably have to go back to this
multiple times and keep coding and keep
you know inventing these challenges for
myself to do because he doesn't teach
you in a lab how to do them you have to
teach yourself are doing you have to
apply it yourself again for a ten-dollar
course I'm fine with that
but just so you're aware you're not
going to be challenged to prove your
knowledge after each section and there's
a lot of freaking sections here the
hardest section for me was with building
objects oh my god I thought this section
no odds and ends okay some of these were
difficult as you can see what it was
objects and functions
some of these lectures I thought I would
never get through and Allah closures
holy crap see some of these I will have
to go back to even as an intermediate to
advanced beginner just because they're
massive and these lectures of him
talking about it or 20 minutes there's a
20 minute there's a 20 minute there's a
20 minute there's a 17 minute and to be
honest this section is unnecessarily I
think it would be better if it was
chunked into smaller sections just
because I found myself really regretting
this section because I went on and on
with some really advanced concepts for
me if it could be divided into another
section that would've been awesome but
by the time that was over I'm just like
I guess I'll go to section 5 you know
which is important because prototype
prototypical inheritance for a type of
inheritance is a core concept of
JavaScript let's be certain all of these
concepts are stuff that make JavaScript
weird and that is what defines
JavaScript all of the things that xx
talks about in this course go back to
what makes JavaScript JavaScript a lot
of these concepts are not concrete like
prototypes like wasting like the lexical
environment which you know the lexical
environment was pretty easy for me to
understand but it not might not be easy
for you to understand but Tony does a
great job of speaking slowly and kindly
he doesn't make you feel stupid which I
really appreciate I have had a few
courses both in real life and on the
internet where the instructor is just a
dick fortunately Tony like I said he's
very calm he's very professor like and
professional and if you have a problem
with him speaking at a certain pace or
not a problem but maybe you want a
little faster in the videos I'm not
going to do any copyright infringement
here if I show you a video I would hope
not
but let me just give you a taste of what
his style is but we understand the
object prototype we can even more deeply
understand what we mean by everything in
JavaScript is an object or on they go to
period coding B is a function if I do
dot prototype we'll see that there's
this empty function object that's the
prototype of all functions any function
you create in JavaScript will
automatically have this proto this is
the classic Toni lecture where he speaks
clearly and concisely he gets into the
console he explains to you everything he
explains why the hell these curly braces
are there that's awesome he doesn't
leave you guessing so that is what I
really like about this course one of the
major cons which I addressed of a course
like this is that you have to invent
your own labs if you think just watching
the videos it's going to make you learn
sorry to break it to you but that's just
not how our brains absorb things maybe
you're a whiz candidate that's cool but
if you're somebody like me a career
changer where these concepts don't
necessarily come easy you're going to
have to invent your own challenges and
you know what let me show you doing some
of my notes here I'm also taking these
are some angular notes sort of class
that she teaches on angular but no I
don't have my notes open here but point
being I have about 4 typed pages in my
editor of notes again JavaScript
understanding the weird part I'm going
to go ahead and throw whoops no no no no
now now I will throw 4 out of 5 stars
you know loses a star for not having
that lab component also - this is why it
loses that one star is because it says
it's geared towards everybody even
everybody everybody even beginner
beginners but that's not quite the case
because he does go into jQuery this
whole framework library that I was
really excited about
he bases it on JIRA jQuery and I don't
have experience with jQuery all I know
is vanilla JavaScript and a little
dollar sign thing and like doing
different conventions and syntax I
didn't know anything about that and I'm
not about to go learn jQuery just to
come back and go through this module so
unfortunately a lot of the stuff you
know in jQuery was not something I could
understand so four out of five hope this
review was helpful going to be doing a
overview of my Coursera a Coursera good
god I'm not going to Coursera udemy
stack here these are all paid courses I
think I got this one for free when I was
signing up for a boot camp that was
teaching Java JavaScript understanding
the weird parts if you think you're
ready to move beyond alert boxes and
functions highly recommend this course
Tony's a great instructor and you can
take it at your own pace the for the
most part to the chapters and the
content is digestible and you're going
to have this course as long as you to me
is still in business
thank you guys so much and while your
comments and encouragement and thanks
for watching the videos stay tuned and
subscribe like comment you know the
drill
keep this channel alive if you like what
you saw you believe in liberating free
information support me on patreon it
really helps even a dollar really helps
a lot thanks a lot guys we'll see the
next video
