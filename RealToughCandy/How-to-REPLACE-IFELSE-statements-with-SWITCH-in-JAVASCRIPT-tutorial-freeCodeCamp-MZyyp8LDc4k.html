the saddle with you today we are working
on free code camps basic JavaScript
replacing if-else chains with switch and
we're moving right along with these
switches like I said in my other switch
videos I really enjoy them I like
writing case with the : like it's a nice
switch if you will a nice change up from
all these semicolons and just getting my
eyes accustomed to different things
we're kind of moving right along here
let me show you where I started here a
few days ago I think probably last week
is when I started they said it's gonna
take about ten hours but since I really
kind of delved into a lot of these I'm
probably going on I don't know 1820
hours maybe some of these problems I did
spend a good 3 4 hours just trying to
really understand the anatomy not so
much doing the code monkey stuff because
you know you can google it and find the
answer in about 10 seconds or watch one
on one of my videos but to actually see
what was happening and letting that
marinate and getting used to just doing
it naturally doing it non cerebrally and
for me personally that's my main goal
with this course I'm gonna be doing I'm
a few others down here I'll show you in
a bit but just the number one goal for
me is to get this knowledge so that it's
non cerebral I don't have to think about
it or refer to the pseudocode and you
know I can see a problem even if it is
something simple like a switch statement
and bang it out and have it run and be
happy with that so we're gonna see
that's going to happen and today this is
the first one I'm going on without doing
it previously like the other videos I
have done for you guys or with you guys
I should say hopefully you're following
along another ones I've done previously
and then do them again when I'm
recording this one however is kind of a
cold video I haven't done it so let's
see what happens replacing if-else
chains with a switch if it works that'd
be awesome
if not a little realism just got
injected right in the arm on the real
tough candy Channel so let's see what
they're telling us if you have many
options to choose from a switch
statement can be easier to write
then many chained if else if statements
so we all know that right we've gone
through this the following pseudocode
can be replaced with and then the
instructions so enough a little less
chitchat enough chitchat let's get right
to it only change the code below this
line only change the code above this
line so this is what we're going to be
changing here's our function here's a
variable answer everything looks
familiar and then we're gonna be
changing this value to test it at the
very end
so basically we're replacing all of this
with switch you know what I'm seeing
this right now that I'm probably gonna
screw this up somehow with all this back
spacings so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
start the switch up here and then just
delete this later I'm gonna use this as
a reference but obviously at the end
we'll have to ditch it so bear with me
I'm a little slow with this like I said
not at the point quite yet of it being
non cerebral so let's work through it
together
the first thing we need to do with the
switch is let the computer know what we
want because they're very stupid we
don't tell them what we want switch and
then we're gonna do as we always do
what's inside here well and then here as
always is where we start our curly
braces oops I don't want to go down too
far cuz I still want to use the if-else
for reference so what I'm basically
doing because I'm coding this part right
now and this pseudocode represents this
portion and then this pseudocode
represents this down here so again just
using it for reference right now so
switch eval and then it's gonna be this
is this is gonna signify our case one
Bob and
yeah so dancer will break oops I've
already forgotten something guys case so
it's gonna be case what case is it gonna
be is it gonna be okay it's not giving
meteors that's okay so we'll go to the
next case case
the next one is 42 oops
case 42
answer break move this up so I can
reference it what's next
case one answer there is no number one
there's no number Walton break this
would be so awesome if I'm doing this
right if not what are you gonna do try
again
all these coding camps have been
applying to a lot of over her are saying
if you can't take rejection
don't even bother so prepare to be
rejected with an open mind
basically so case 99 is going to be
answer equals missed break how many more
we got going here you have one more yep
case
yes sir eight nine haha break
Oh am I forgetting something appear
don't mess that up
I put a semicolon instead of a colon I'm
not getting any errors but who really
knows what the heck I'm doing certainly
I don't just kidding I gave a valiant
attempt here be interesting to see what
exactly I'm doing wrong okay but who
knows maybe I'm not doing anything wrong
let's run and test it yes who the man me
too man who the man me the man me a
chick me to check me done check yes
that was supremely satisfying that was
the first time I've done that challenge
and it worked that's awesome let's throw
something in so we threw seven in and it
says eight nine oh my god let's throw in
Bob okay see that string up here at the
case is Bob and now this should have
spit out Marley in this black box yes
guys can you relate to this this is
freaking awesome some of you're like are
you serious is the most easiest this is
the easiest so easy it's dumb well call
me stupid but this is supremely
satisfying case 99 let's go through them
all why not we're having a ball right
miss me by this much taste one should
say there is no number one right here
that should spit out there is no number
one and then was that all of them do we
do 42 happy happy joy joy dude seriously
that was so awesome
so there you have it the one and done
replacing if-else chains with switch if
you found this video as satisfying as I
did please subscribe like comment you
know the drill
that kind of stuff just to let me know
CAIR thanks for watching guys and we'll
see in the next video
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
