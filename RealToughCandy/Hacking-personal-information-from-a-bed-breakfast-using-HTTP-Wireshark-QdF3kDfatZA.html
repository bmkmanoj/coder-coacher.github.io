candy from real tough candy calm back in
the saddle with you today we are taking
a look at the seedy underbelly of HTTP
now this actually google.com is HTTPS
the S stands for secure and that means
my connection is encrypted at the end of
the day what that means is that it makes
hackers their job gets a little bit
harder when it's HTTPS because you know
clear text is scrambled there's a few
extra precautions as you can see this is
guaranteeing that this is encrypted
there's a certificate asserting that
encryption and usually you'll see in
this address bar up here if a site's
encrypted it'll have that little lock a
lot of times it'll be green and you can
click on it for more information to see
the issuing authority for that
certificate authority and the issuer and
so on
now let's contrast that with a site I
found that uses HTTP notice there's no s
on HTTP that's because that's not secure
it's highly insecure or unsecure which
one is that don't know point being you
have to be very careful with these sites
because what you send over the line is
going to be possibly intercepted and
we're actually going to be doing that
very shortly here using a contact form
and I'll show you just how easy it is
for hackers with malicious intent to
take is seemingly harmless information
of yours and really make your life hell
so I urge you if you're using a public
Wi-Fi spot and you guys are you know
surfing the internet please be careful
and take precautions you know assess
assess the risk and ask yourself if it's
worth doing I'll show you what I mean
so again this is an unsecured insecure
not only sure on the the context there
not a safe site to be sending
information back and forth and a lot of
times in tutorials and videos and
reference guides and books they say okay
you know if it's an HTTP site if it's an
site without the security here without
the encryption don't give sensitive
information like Social Security numbers
and credit card information but what
they don't tell you a lot of times is
you shouldn't really be sending any
information over HTTP because with this
kind of information yeah you're not
giving away DNA samples or a credit card
number but it can't lead to that with
your name email phone number and
possibly a few details in the comment
section a hacker can really socially
engineer you and also set you up for
reverse social engineering attacks
because I already know once I intercept
this from you that you probably are
gonna be visiting this place and might
be leaving your home you know so stuff
like that you got to think deviant with
this kind of thing so what we're gonna
do is fire a fire up a Wireshark this is
a packet sniffer it sounds so dirty
so I'm going to fire up this packet
sniffer and everything going over the
wire right now is being intercepted by
this program so again let's just say
you're at a coffee shop what you're
doing is being picked up by my program
okay this is picking up just my
information right now
this is totally legal everything I'm
doing here is on my own network so we
keep it legal here at real tough candy
so let's go um I don't know John
Williams why not my spouse is Wendy
she's a lovely woman
john-john Wendy this guy's a baby boomer
baby woman I still use yahoo email we're
gonna go ahead and do let's make it a
little more believable and then oh gosh
even our birthday uh he's was a New
Year's baby 1955 good year good year uh
married 1984 also very
spouse birthday Oh golly do I remember
this thing John you never remember my
birthday you prick
sorry I have way too much fun with this
um visit Shipshewana dot org okay would
like to visit hoon
tonio June 1st through the 15th will be
visiting from Memphis TN go Vols okay so
we're ready to submit this is an this is
a bed and breakfast in India northern
Indiana okay
you know John wants to take a little
vacay nothing wrong with that right so
my little program is sniff sniff sniff
sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff now we're
gonna hit the sub-niche button and this
form has been submitted through HTTP now
let's go over here let's power down our
Wireshark and we're going to filter out
as you can see there's a lot of packets
here Wireshark is a very it's an
incredible application and there's a lot
to talk about but I'm gonna try and stay
focused here so let's filter out HTTP
and as you can see these are the packets
that were picked up through Wireshark
every every little thing I did on here
was picked up by this program now this
is oh this it's like handy oh I'm so
excited
where do I even start so one thing we
can do to even get more specific is to
type in I already have this as a preset
here HTTP request method the get method
now this is gonna show me
a lot of goodies now this is where we're
gonna see our clear-text and what we're
gonna do
oh I'm just there's so much information
here and I keep it legal but I'm telling
you if I didn't keep it legal I'd be
having a heck of a good time right now
so we're gonna go and follow the TCP
stream and let's just see where did I
give up the information so today with
John right
is this even in the stream let's go down
here I think it's more down into this
packet ah yes yes yes here we go this is
where our money is that's sure
so as you can see all of my information
is available in clear text okay if
you're at a coffee shop or a hotel or
any other place with a publicly
available Wi-Fi connection somebody an
evil real tough candy who likes to break
the law could set up shop run Wireshark
and get all of this information let's
see your name's John Williams your
significant others name Mouse name is
Wendy oh look we have an email John
Wendy
John Wendy at yahoo.com what else do we
have we have a birthday here birthday
field yeah um let's see your wedding
anniversary oh yes this is a little
tougher these numbers are kind of
throwing me off here but you know I'm
already getting I have a name and an
email address for a social engine a very
targeted and succinct social engineering
attack so let's see what they sing the
comments here what did Jon have to say
would here we go oh it starts right here
would like to visit June 1st through the
15th will be visiting from Memphis go
Vols Wow so what does this tell me about
this guy well he wants to visit June 1st
to the 15th he's from Memphis he's not
gonna be home golly there are so many
vectors here I guess we'll maybe be the
right word the attack vectors here are
numerous and to be honest guys this is a
perfect example of why you want to avoid
HTTP you know do what you can to avoid
this kind of situation if you can't or
maybe the risk just you know it doesn't
bother you it's a risk it's a big risk
but that's obviously your choice at the
end of the day but this is just to
illustrate how easy it is to pick up
traffic
I'm age TTP a lot of HTTP sites still in
service with these kinds of forms I mean
I had my choice I went through dozens of
these and I just picked this this one at
random but in 2017 there's really no
good reason there is actually no reason
at all to be having HTTP sites
certificates are very easy to come by
nowadays and a lot of it's ignorant
unfortunately people don't think of who
you want to be you know sniffing my
packets so it'll never sound right who
would want to be spying on me or you
know tracking me well that's a really
crummy attitude to have because honestly
there are hundreds of thousands of
people who would really like to exploit
you there are many people who would like
to have this information about you so I
hope this was educational Illustrated
HTTP and Wireshark and if you like this
video go ahead and give it a thumbs up
really appreciate it thanks to all my
new subscribers and we'll see you in the
next video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
