back online with you today
freshly revamped website but hey that's
not why I'm here
I'm here because I get this question a
lot what's the best web hosting for web
developers especially people who have
portfolios or are experimenting with web
development well real tough Danny calm
as well as almost all my other websites
I developed for my personal uses in my
portfolio are on meme cheap why number
one they're very cheap number two
they're trustworthy and number three
their customer service is outstanding
and especially for beginners who maybe
they're not quite decided on whether or
not you want to pursue this you know
you're only out ten bucks for the year
enough for me personally I use the
professional tier here it's quite enough
for my purposes mostly its WordPress
stuff that I'm hosting along with some
other experiments there comms are less
than eleven bucks a year and they have
some specials on the stranger top-level
domains like dot science 48 cents a year
it's very affordable to experiment
explore without getting into a lot of
trouble financially anything - with the
shared hosting plan is that Namecheap is
including SSL's positive SSL's with
every domain name so instead of you
having to fool around with a self-signed
certificate they create one for you and
it's trusted so these self signed ones
not good not good most people aren't
going to be visiting your website
because it looks like it's been hacked
but with their positive ssl you can get
up to 50 of them for it your cPanel
account
you take paypal for payment so if you
don't have a credit card or just prefer
PayPal really a quick way to go there
customer service is on point I was
having a problem last week with an SSL
and some chick named Natasha probably
from Bulgaria helped me out really
quickly and pointed me in the right
direction with that their documentation
is on point
some people might have an issue with the
shared hosting portion but this is just
for a portfolio you're not creating the
next Facebook so don't let that fool you
and don't don't think you have to spend
a lot of money to get your stuff on
there within an hour you can buy a plan
get a couple of domain names and get
rolling the cPanel comes with an app
called Softaculous Softaculous is the
bomb because you can install WordPress
with a couple of clicks their famous
one-click installation is actually like
two or three they have a bunch of other
platforms you can explore they have all
kinds of crazy things I'd never heard
about that you can host on here it's
cheap it's trustworthy and it affords
you so much room to experiment and
provides the basic necessities for your
apps migrating to the paid tier on
Heroku or using AWS probably it's not
something you need right now as a
developer who's you know pushing their
portfolio in certain cases yes but
usually not the one thing I will say
about the value plan is that it only
hosts three websites that's why I
migrated to this professional plan
because I needed more web sites and I
needed more space too so hope this video
was helpful probably as time goes on
I'll have more constructive criticism of
pame cheap but honestly I've been with
them for about five months now and I
have no complaints Thank You Namecheap
and thanks for watching we'll see you in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
