protest of these horrible cover letter
sites that give you really bad advice if
it sounds like about to break something
in the next couple of minutes is because
I am I might have even lifted a radiator
in my rage during the last hour or so
but that's between you and me roll the
video
real tough candy from real touch candy
calm back online we see you today to
tell you that a lot of these resume
sites suck they make you fill out
ridiculous information and include
redundant information that you've
already included seven times in previous
documents people this has got to stop
and in today's video I'm going to show
you four aspects of how you can make a
killer killer cover letter to be fair
there are some useful things in this
document but this is just a distraction
so let's get out of here I'm gonna show
you my cover letter okay and I'm gonna
break it down for you this is my cover
letter that I send you organizations of
course it's not benevolent company the
sense of information has been changed
but this is my skeleton now in a
technical cover letter you need to do
four things you need to introduce
yourself you need to argue why you'd be
a good fit for the job you need to fill
in places that your resume can't
describe you also need to further
explain other aspects of your resume now
let's start with the first component
introducing yourself you don't need to
go on and on when our two lines will be
just fine this is what I did hello
benevolent company my name is relative
candy and I believe in developing things
that solve problems both succinctly
stated who you are and what you're all
about in one freaking sentence right
next line I read more about your opening
for what developer and designer and
believe my professional goals align with
yours since 2014 I've been developing
and designing websites and apps that are
visually functionally and financially
successful now what I just read to you
is arguing why I'd be a good fit for the
job
because number one my professional goals
align with yours as in the company I
have experienced this company is looking
for an experienced developer they want
people who have a portfolio that stands
out and it does so that fulfills the
second requirement arguing why you'd be
a good fit now the third requirement
fill in places your resume can't
describe now I keep my resume to one
page because by that second page people
aren't reading this part fills in the
third requirement filling in places that
my resume cannot describe my daily tech
my weekly tech my monthly tech and what
I'm currently learning this one's an
important one because it tells the
hiring manager and whoever else is
reading that you take your job seriously
and you're always learning something and
in this industry you always have to be
learning something now the fourth
component further explaining other areas
of your resume so emphasizing what you
have on your resume this paragraph is
where I hit on that fourth component
because in my resume I describe about
how I make user interfaces and I
describes on my soft skills but I'm
illustrating it more here here I'm
already wrapping it up and I've hit
those four components I'm signing off
and there's one more thing this job is
in a state far away from me I want them
and take me just as serious as other
local candidates I'm gonna throw in a PS
well I currently reside in bumpkins
ville I'm looking forward to relocating
to sunny st. Petersburg using proactive
language that tells the hiring manager
and whoever else is reading this you're
serious you want to have an interview so
again to recap the four pillars
introduce yourself argue why you'd be a
good fit
fill in places your resume can't
describe and further explain other
aspects of your resume this cover letter
has gotten me interviews with some
really great companies companies you'd
be like whoa seriously yes and it's
because this cover letter gets people's
attention without them
interest also - this gif is really
overused but I just love it and it
spices up the cover letter thanks for
watching I hope this video was helpful
