candy back in your business for this
edition of free code camps basic java
javascript javascript walkthrough today
we're working on selecting from many
options with switch statements now for
me this was getting a little relatively
advanced your basic JavaScript yes of
course it's basic but in this section
here they're introducing an entirely new
concept the switch statement now this
from my research is ideal if you have a
lot of conditions to test and if you're
working through this portion of the
course sequentially the exact previous
challenge was a metric crapton of
if-else statements or else if statements
rather and it just kept going on and on
so I think they're trying to tell me
that the switch statement is a good
replacement for that because it's a lot
more efficient so we're going to do the
walk through this part up here just
tells us when to use a switch and what
it does they give you some pseudocode
for reference and then some instructions
so let's go to the instructions and use
this as a reference point right here and
see what we come up with they want to
stir it a switch statement which tests
Val and sets answer for the following
conditions alpha beta gamma and Delta
okay so there's a lot in these little
lines here so we're going to write a
switch statement that can be the first
thing let's just start right there and
computers are very literal and they're
very nosy so when you tell them exactly
what we want he might say they're
clueless test Val so val is going to go
in there in the parentheses and then
we're going to start some curly bracket
just gotta love those and welcome like
this you know just clean this up well
later like to give myself a little room
when i'm coding these things so now ok
we're going to refer to our pseudocode
because i'm still still haven't
committed this to memory so we're going
to do case and this is our first case
we're going to be testing for also send
theirs
one case one case one and then I'm
simply going to go to the other line and
it's going to be and CE in referring to
the instructions here it wants me to now
set the answer for this condition so
essentially i'm just going to write
answer is equal to alpha put in the
all-important semicolon and then put in
a break statement okay so there it is
let's go to our next one case 2 is beta
so answer this all right and then we're
in your case 3 here gamma just keep
going down line Rick case for mansion is
sit down here Delta answer Delta and
then close up a little bit and this is
very encouraging right now because I'm
not getting any errors so let's see what
happens we're going to test the value of
one so theoretically because it's
testing one it should come up as alpha
we're done here in this little black box
let's see it awesome she also let's test
it with case 40 stray sure number four
here and it should pop up Delta and
black box if I've coated everything
correctly delco sweet done we'll just
try three she's going to show up as
gamma yep gammon gone boss number two
data should show cos theta sit down here
I get the beta and that's it let's try
just try something just for fun trick
can tell on here let's what it does okay
pass me because it didn't it didn't
return anything because I didn't have
anything specified for 10 so that makes
sense I hope this was helpful guys this
is number I don't even know what 80
something in the whole challenge maybe
70 something I don't know but we're
getting towards the end of this basic
JavaScript going to do a few more videos
before we move on into the other section
but thanks for watching I hope this
video was helpful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
