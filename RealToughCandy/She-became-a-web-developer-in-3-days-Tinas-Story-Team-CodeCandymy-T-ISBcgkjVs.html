became a web developer you know ly the
first day I was homeless I was trying to
get my text editor inside the cd-rom it
was ugly the second day was fine
second day was fine second day I learned
my HTML and for those of you who don't
know hypertextual misogynist leprechauns
third day was a breeze I learned CSS
completely stylistic subhuman
markup language baby I got it the best
part of it was though I still found a
job oh you mean like got a job I thought
you said found a job cuz I found about
five hundred jobs I didn't get one
though if I had to give one bit of
advice I'd say don't even bother with
JavaScript I don't know I don't know
like who uses that in 2018 all you need
is some HTML as long as you can write in
each one you got a job like I said I
found like 500 team code Karen abhi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
