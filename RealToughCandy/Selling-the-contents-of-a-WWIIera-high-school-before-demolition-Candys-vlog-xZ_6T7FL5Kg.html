you don't have to have dialed is not in
service at that time still in late 30s
early 40s and reason I'm here today is
because I diversify my income stream and
I do a ton of different contracting
projects and this project is for auction
for the access school item so I've been
listing them as it in pictures and
getting them on the internet for bidders
into these pickup date so all this stuff
like the hill banisters you look
original those are for sale so I'm very
missable pretty cool up in here for the
original floors spooky in here a lot of
the stuff we couldn't sell just because
there's a lot of asbestos with
chalkboards and original woodwork we
couldn't pull out we didn't have
authorization to pull out go up stairs
here so yeah this is a WPA building tool
this is all part of it and plowed right
over
this to back is a lot of these inbuilt
aren't going anywhere they're going to
be plowed right over show you guys one
of these rooms I did did this room
listed these desks lift that all the
stuff so looks like somebody did take
this chalkboard even though there's like
mmm maybe asbestos behind it but stuff
like this is pretty cool this old
woodwork people go bananas over this
stuff for home renovation projects even
stuff like this globe
well these desks holds like 15 bucks 15
box office chairs but this building is
really cool has a lot of character if
you were to look on here
this is pretty cool
this little chalkboard lying on the
bathroom check out this old pink
bathroom this thing's cool the scene is
so cool
check out these doors these doors look
original and this high school was
originally a high school then it turned
into a school like specific high school
courses like big video like history math
up here or something and then some
elementary too but you see man if I
wasn't in trouble I'd run into that
bathroom I just run out just run out the
window pretty cool
I didn't list anything in here but let's
go check out what's over here this
little door looks original
they put a board on here
these chairs were lifted let's about 360
items ranging from electronics the
chairs I may be doing a video soon on
the hows and whys and what wears a whens
perhaps of contracting some more school
chairs and how you guys can really make
some good money and what you should be
charging you know not specific dollar
amounts because every industry varies
you know writing your contract so you
guys are getting the most of what your
worse it's not something you're
interested in so hopefully be doing a
video on that soon
if you guys see the old stage we got the
litem staged in here oh you're good
this is the old weight room the other
old weight room see some of the original
brick up here it's pretty cool yeah we
sold this gym equipment myself and
another contractor with all this stuff a
lot of it he's gone already there with
ton of barbells over here in dumbbells
and stuff here's something here's a real
collectible I think this went for 100
bucks
old North Carolina Tarheels hundred
pounder there's a set of them that the
other one over there but we got the old
cafeteria here mostly cleaned out this
one's going to we sold filled all this
kitchen stuff
I actually bid on something on this
auction after I listed it where is it
this didn't sell too big couldn't list
it you see that crest core that hot
hauled oh yeah beam 230 bucks I double
my money
that's a candy that's one of Candy's
hello.c else and all this stuff is
restaurant-grade look new probably fifty
sixty thousand dollars of the stuff here
all that was listed plus I started been
picked up stainless steel this morning
there were two grown-ass men about to
get a physical fight over these Lovett's
and loppers can you believe it it was
insane that they didn't remember their
bitter numbers so they were both
claiming the same panel of lockers
it turns out his lockers were actually
in the girls room how fitting but yep

ready to be picked up these tables sold
for 40 bucks each plus the puffit chairs
these are really nice tables listed
