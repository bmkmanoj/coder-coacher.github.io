and
so I was at an appointment the other day
and this woman can I help you with
something
I'm sorry what was your name it was one
of those things where the person working
the front desk made it feel like you
should be grateful that she was treating
you like crap unfortunately that kind of
customer experience isn't a rarity there
are millions of people who are
absolutely miserable and they want you
to know about it well I have to be
honest with you all I'm excited about
artificial intelligence taking away a
lot of these jobs what I'm not excited
about is the transition of people who
are in these jobs going to someplace
else because that's going to be rough
for them however how awesome would it be
if these miserable people were given the
opportunity to do things that they enjoy
and get paid for it artificial
intelligence is a real thing now in
2017-2018 most of it is not all that
smart it's more like automation 2.0
artificial intelligence as we know it
currently succeeds when the parameters
are very well defined in singular
domains our official intelligence would
not thrive as an attorney because they
pulled from different sources and
different bodies of knowledge but if you
put an artificial intelligence in charge
of approving people for mortgages for
example now there are very specific
parameters that program is looking at
saying okay approved denied approved
denied I wanted to share this article
with you guys today what I really did
love about this article is that there
are some practical considerations and
also not just this dystopian nightmare
yes the bots are coming the bots have
been here I remember in the 80s when I
was a wee lass I got a tour of where my
aunt and uncle worked they worked at a
factory that made robots it was it was a
machine that was automated that's all it
was okay now that's not to diminish the
amazing capabilities of those machines
but it wasn't like they're these
autonomous creatures these demagogue
guns coming out to eat you because you
thought something wrong I'd be more
concerned about Google coming to kick
you off of all their platforms because
of wrong think or Twitter a lot of the
fear comes from the fact that we don't
know exactly the implications or exactly
what jobs these these bots will be
taking over here now here's the other
thing - I've been thinking a lot about
this I think there's a lot of panic in
the media because once people are free
from the nine-to-five and doing these
monotonous boring unfulfilled
soul-eating jobs once that cycle is
broken then people are free to do things
that are fruitful and that really
satisfied them now that scares a lot of
people in charge I think not to get too
conspiratorial maybe in another video so
the idea is the money produced by these
jobs that artificial intelligence now
rules over is going to help subsidize
people's basic income it's called
universal basic income it's not a thing
currently but that's the idea what's one
of the ideas once artificial
intelligence starts taking more and more
jobs guys think about it artificial
intelligence has been here look at
automation in the automotive industry
there are a lot of people who were
displaced the big component missing was
that they didn't get retraining or the
cities look like dystopian nightmares
all across the Rust Belt I'm excited
that artificial intelligence is coming
to take some of these jobs what it does
concern me is that the money is made
from these technologies are not going to
be subsidizing people or retraining
people so there are some Siri
considerations before before this is
actually a good thing
but anyway start with this article it's
an op-ed piece it could be just science
fiction
it could be not but those are my
thoughts on automation in the workplace
what do you think is this a good or bad
thing and what are some solutions what
are some ideas to offset the impacts of
artificial intelligence taking a lot of
these jobs alright guys thanks for
watching and see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
