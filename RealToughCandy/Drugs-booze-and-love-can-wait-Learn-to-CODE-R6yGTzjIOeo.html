tightwad a spendthrift maybe you just
like getting that bang for your buck and
the most out of your money
first things first because time
sensitive this is the last day for the
$10 udemy course special don't believe
me let's check this out here there's
like nine hours left on ten hours left
at this price
everything on udemy.com is ten bucks now
to be fair they do do these specials
here and there you never really know win
though and it's a beautiful summer
weekend I know but it's a great time to
get in that education the other thing
that's great about these udemy courses
is that you don't have to do them right
away you can you can set them aside for
next week or the next month or six
months from now when you're feeling more
confident or you're feeling ready to
dive into that subject for example I
bought a course on get that I'm doing
intermittently right now because it's
not really a pressing topic for me to
learn for what I'm working on in my
portfolio on my other websites but it's
there for when I need to just go there
you know study for five minutes watch 10
minutes or whatever come back next week
the courses are in your little area are
in your account until udemy goes out of
business which is it happening anytime
soon if you don't know where to start
if you don't know young should I do
JavaScript note some more back-end stuff
check out Jo food coding phase he's a
self-taught programmer and he learned
from you to me and he has some great
advice and he backs up all of his udemy
courses that he's taken on during his
description box just check out his page
most of you guys know coding phase but
definitely if you need more more
specifics on what to take I would trust
what he has to say and he's working the
courses he recommends if courses aren't
your thing or you want to supplement
these video courses or something else
what do I have in my little lap but Mark
Myers is books now this book is one that
I talked about in I don't know 80% of my
videos just because this was the gateway
for me and it's also designed for you to
go online and test your knowledge of
this material online so you really
challenged yourself a lot of times
you'll read or just watch a video and be
like yeah
I get it but then when it's time to
actually create something using those
concepts or remember them you're like oh
my god I'm going to have to google it
which is fine but not for a hundred
percent of a time with this though he
chunks it down into small little
digestible bits you know each page is
pretty much a chapter and a lot of my
subscribers have bought this book and
one even said you know she's happy and
excited to start program again after
giving it up I'm like yes that's awesome
to hear he also has one that I use I
still use it even though I'm competent
and HTML and CSS basics I use this from
time to time just as a refresher just to
challenge myself can I make a table from
scratch
etc I'm just like well they're books
books he also has one on jQuery which I
don't have in my lap which is just as
perfect as these ones the other thing
shameless self-promotion hey if someone
doesn't have impostor syndrome in this
industry it's me because I work at my
buns off and I know you guys are too to
be in this industry as a full-fledged
member in the web development community
now if you have not signed up for dev
mojo that is my newsletter for aspiring
dev this is it
this is the web view from the email
version so this is exactly what your
beginning the dev mojo newsletter is
aimed at aspiring and beginning
developers who are trying to get a foot
in the door trying to just you know
finesse their skills a little more it's
protein Pat guys and I keep it I try to
keep it as compact as possible so many
job boards have like hundreds of
listings and ask them are freaking favor
one of my subscribers said this was the
best newsletter he signed up for all
year and I really appreciate that
comment really try hard to cater to
beginning and aspiring developers
because I know how hard it is to find
legit material guys most of it sucks
there are various reasons for that but
with everything that I create I try to
make it as targeted as possible and as
protein-packed
as possible I call it the energy bar
this Deb Mojo newsletter and it
certainly is looking like it is helping
people so you can sign up for that at

I'm having a guest blogger one of my
super subscribers Michael Kornblum he
wrote an article about the top ten his
favorite and most effective atom
packages if you don't know what atom is
it's a text editor catering towards
coding you could use it for typing
reports I don't suggest that but it's a
text editor for us developers who are
trying to make our lives easier with
different packages and it's going to be
tops Michael Corvin is very articulate
he's empathetic he's very understanding
of beginners and intermediate developers
and he's always blowing up the comments
section with some insightful stuff so
thank you Michael you rock dude thank
you so much and also okay this is the
last legs this is lastly
I'm starting a new series on my blog
real tough danny calm why because the
media the government and businesses are
all in a collective panic saying there
aren't enough defenders there aren't
enough developers there aren't enough
developers like these walking
matroyshkas all that just keep
unstacking and like this collective
screaming of there aren't enough
developers ok I'm changing that because
every week I'm going to have a developer
spotlight featuring aspiring developers
who are working their butt off who know
what to do and how to get there and they
just need a little push so next week I'm
featuring one of my subscribers Mirza
he's from Bosnia he loves to bootstrap
it up and he you're going to learn a
little bit more a little bit more about
him in my spotlight series on real tough
canada.com
ok is that enough promotion for you guys
I don't know I could throw something in
also jQuery go learn it alright guys I
hope you have a great weekend stay safe
out there it's too easy to have too much
fun in the summer months but I hope you
stay safe keep learning and we'll we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
