teaser tracks available over FAA camp
link in the comment box
today's topic today's topic is react on
Udacity react is the most recent program
to be offered as a nano degree before we
get into the meat of this video let me
tell you something very very important I
don't have a problem with this course
being 500 dollars it could be five
thousand dollars I still don't
necessarily have a problem with that I
have a problem with the value offered
for the price so I was investigating the
other night because I have you know my
various collection of programs that I
use to learn react in different
resources and this nano degree came up I
said oh these guys look legit you know
they do all kinds of stuff for fortune
500 company employees but ever but I've
got to be honest my stomach initially
dropped a slight bit when I saw that
price but I thought ok it's not about
the price I have to remember this and
especially if you're doing freelance
stuff apply this to your own small
business or if you're doing real gig
based work any kind of freelance stuff
doesn't have to be web development you
can offer things for five hundred five
thousand fifty thousand dollars there's
nothing intrinsically wrong with that
but the value has to match your asking
price let me show you what I'm saying
this landing page or splash page or add
page whatever you want to call
doesn't really tell you what you're
going to learn okay there's a little bit
of what you're going to be learning in a
very vague sense but somehow I don't
know last night I found the syllabus oh
this is the official react nanodegree
syllabus and if we go down here we will
see the protein of what we are paying
for this is included in our $500 feet
excuse me $4.99 fee and you also get
some code reviews you can ask questions
and you get a fifty little nano degree
certificate upon completion I want to
emphasize one more time there is not a
problem with a $499 course I don't have
a problem with it I shouldn't have a
problem with it and neither should you
but you should be critical of the value
offered for that price now unfortunately
the value on scene here is matched or
exceeded with other resources let me
show you what I'm talking about Kai Rupa
is this dude I discovered I love his
style he's funny he takes it lightly and
he's also very smart he's a great
teacher and he's very gentle with
expressing technical topics and they're
fun they're gullible he's active online
he has a YouTube channel that I've been
using to follow along with but he also
has his website that's been in operation
since like the late 90s I think 98 or 99
is when he first started this thing he
has a companion react book available on
Amazon but I think mostly it is here
published here on his website and this
is what I've been using along with his
videos on YouTube to learn react he is
very thorough and this is free
information if Chi Rupa brings down the
value of react education or any type of
web development education but because
it's free no he's not because I can't
call up cut Rupa at 3:00 in the morning
when I need help I can't just email him
expecting help for him you know
expecting him to solve my react homework
there are certain things that tie Rupa
won't do for me
and that's fine that's expected because
he's already going out of his way and
giving out this material he's also
heavily promoting his $29 book or
however much it is over on Amazon if
you're interested in learning react on
its own as opposed to in like a
full-stack environment you know with
Mongo expressed reactive node and just
you just want to do react I highly
recommend this guy in desmos Oh last
week I could recommend a decent book on
the Myrna staff which implements react
into a full stack setting but Kyrie
would calm this this guy is the step so
let's go back to the syllabus of all of
these things here almost all of them are
touched upon on Cairo vogue.com which I
can access at any time for free I can
also follow along with his YouTube
videos which the one tube combo guys
it's its if that's where it's at for
free maybe watch a few ass big whoop
where is the value here I wouldn't pay
499 dollars for this course even if
they're going to send me a little
certificate or even if you're going to
provide some kind of customer support or
student support or code reviews guys we
do that stuff all the time on my Gator
chatroom is where we throw up questions
and support one another at all hours of
the night so even that value you know
and it has to be a little bit more for a
500 dollar course there are many ways to
add value that free courses cannot
compete with I'm not going to go through
them all but there are creative ways and
not so creative ways where you can
entice people to sign up or something
that costs money versus a free program
now this is a new now degree offered at
Udacity so there's not a lot of student
feedback in fact there's no student
feedback
however this quote implies that this
course has been taken by a lot of people
outside of Udacity
so the problem here as far as just like
general marketing is that there aren't
any social proofs where are the quotes
from people who have taken this course
who endorse it there are no student
endorsements outside of Udacity this guy
talks about fortune 500 company
and their students and the quality there
but so what this isn't a fortune I'm not
a fortune 500 and I'm here to learn
react where are people like me endorsing
this course again if you're freelancing
another thing to take note of social
proof topic for another video hope this
video check some insight on value versus
price perhaps some social proof and how
to improve the competition when there's
free resources out there as it stands I
would not fork over five hundred dollars
for this course in fact I would not fork
over fifty dollars for this course
because kat aruba comm has really
provided a service there and it's going
to get creative it's you know these
educators and this education platforms
we're going to be charging money of this
caliber or of any caliber to the second
program guys my time here is up all the
music you heard today is for my upcoming
album electric Pomodoro Garage Band was
not abused or even used in the making of
this album these beats were programmed
by hand lovingly created for you so I
hope you enjoy it thanks for watching
we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
