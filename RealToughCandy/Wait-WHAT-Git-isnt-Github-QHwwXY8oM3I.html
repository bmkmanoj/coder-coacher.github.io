was a bbw and had very little room for
stupid questions and stupidity in
general that said she really cared about
her job and loved teaching
so while she never really did say
there's no such thing as a stupid
question she did encourage her students
to ask questions because if one student
had that questions the odds were others
gig to with that exact stir in mind
let's talk about today's topic wait what
get isn't github real club candy from
real Club panakam back in the windowsill
with you today today's video is going to
be brief it's not tutorial or anything
just want to tell you guys this massive
discovery I've had and maybe you guys
are kind of wondering the same thing or
didn't know that there is a difference a
significant difference between git and
github now I'm taking this class over at
you to me not quite finished I'm not
gonna get my full review on it just yet
but I have learned massively just by
watching the videos and coding along and
getting along with the videos so as you
can see in this slide that I've
conveniently stolen for the purpose of
this video get is an entirely different
thing than github github is a website
where you can publish code share your
code with others it's a hub for gitch
you see that I'm saying I know that
might sound like super obvious but get
in itself the big picture is a version
control system that was developed by the
guys who developed a Linux leet Linus or
leanest Torvalds back in and it made its
debut in like 2005 Linux was around
before then but get with a capital G was
developed by that dude and came out like
I said in 2005 github is a lot younger
than that where's my github page so this
website is probably something you guys
are familiar with as developers or
aspiring developers or people who maybe
just end up on github because so many
people have accounts there where they
share their code so again like I said
not a tutorial video but if this is
something that's been confusing you or
maybe you
no idea because this is actually what
I've been doing in github as far as the
heavy protein it's in the command line
here and setting stuff up and pushing
things to a repository is one part one
thing I've been working on and there's
all these terms and different concepts
and stuff spots so this is pretty
awesome because I thought github was
good and I was like okay I get it people
publish code here but isn't that's what
bitbucket for is for and just like you
know emailing people your code is to
share it once you understand that that
gets github through this little section
in the concept of get life as an
aspiring developer just a lot easier
like I said the course I'm taking is on
udemy and it covers git and github so
you can understand Bowles and use them
both practically going to give a review
coming up on that too
we'll see you guys in the next video
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
