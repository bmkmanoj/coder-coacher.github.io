we'll come back online with you today I
did a video a few days ago about why I
love being cheap has a web hosting
provider and this is reason number 7621
Softaculous hosts a bevy a collection an
array a gorgeous cornucopia of
open-source platforms and different
projects for you to work on now feeling
a little deviant today I went all the
way down here to the others folder oh
you always know there's some gooey
goodness in that and I found an open
source auction script called we bid its
PHP based like most other things on here
let's just go sort through these by PHP
as you can see a lot there and these are
just like the featured ones a few
JavaScript ones some Perl some for the
old schoolers out there some Perl
scripts the PHP is definitely the
overwhelming programming language used
throughout most of these so I've been
playing with that today I already bought
like an 88 cent domain name the dot
online top-level domain so the idea
behind this site that I'm working on is
an auction site for developers who want
to sell their graphic design their web
apps their websites and I know like
different platforms offer these but I've
never seen one under one roof and we're
trying to make one that's more community
based it's gonna be totally free for
users and sellers and there's gonna be a
big trust component I want to talk about
that later in another video because in
my opinion that's the biggest thing
that's missing with all of these sites
is trusting who's selling and who's
buying so here's the bones of the
platform this all looks familiar your
CSS your fonts your images I'm gonna be
changing all of these I really want to
start customizing it this TPL was new to
me so this is the bid TPL file and this
is for when you're about to place your
bid a lot of this looks familiar for
example here's javascript inserted into
this template file
and also the templating itself it looks
really straightforward which is a nice
welcome relief from like you know ejs or
something that can get really sloppy
with all the modules this is using
bootstrap as well as you can see the
column that's a dead giveaway that
there's bootstrap somewhere in here I
gotta say PHP is like a working woman's
programming language I mean there's not
much it doesn't do most things I'm
interested in involved PHP especially
ecommerce almost all these ecommerce
sites use PHP in one way or another and
honestly I really don't understand the
height behind the node when it comes to
taking over what PHP does PHP does its
job very nicely not hating just saying
all right I have some websites I need to
go auction for a $0.99 thanks for
watching and we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
