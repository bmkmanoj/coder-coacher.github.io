calm back online with you today got a
question from one of my longtime
subscribers Chiquito
if I want to build websites for
customers is it essential to know
graphic design like Photoshop and
illustrator or all those graphic
programs and I guess graphic
fundamentals short answer no long answer
yes web developers have a bevy in a
cornucopia of tools available to them to
make their graphic design lives easier
one of those examples is bootstrap
themes like these frameworks like these
incorporate graphic design principles
like contrast alignment harmony balance
appropriate use of the color palette and
so on and so forth they're already baked
in so you can save time with that and
focus more on your primary job which is
to develop the web ie make websites
graphic design is a unique skill set
that said it is a lot more
straightforward to learn than the
principles of web development because
there's no consensus on the principles
of web development however there is
consensus there are hard rules for
graphic design and what makes good
graphic design efficient graphic design
beautiful graphic design beautiful is a
little subjective of a term the point
being there are a lot more solid
resources out there and a lot more
experts who can agree on what makes up
good graphic design okay so adding this
skill set is going to improve your worth
as a developer and that's important
because there are people in Bangladesh
right now who do these one-click
WordPress installs who set up bootstrap
themes for people for 10 bucks you know
and out of the gate going into that
realm isn't upping your worth as a
developer I mean everyone has to start
somewhere I've done the 1-click installs
I still do them they make me money but
the competition is is very extreme
youwell need a tool like Photoshop and I
do stress tool because these are just
methods for producing solid graphic
design work also - these are great
alternatives to web-based resources that
might help you in your graphic design
journey let's say a client calls hey
Chiquito I have a picture here I have
this full-color graphic can you turn it
into black and white so you could use a
website right there's a lot out there
that will transform it but they're slow
their GUI stinks the graphical user
interface sucks and you don't know what
they're doing with your photo they maybe
they might use it for their own purposes
they might track you whatever this is
just a lot more secure way of doing
things
so you just simply go to image
adjustments loops not color balanced
image adjustments black and white bah
boom that looks nice I will say when you
first fire this up and you've never used
Photoshop before these buttons these
gizmos these gadgets these widgets
thoroughly overwhelming the learning
curve to Photoshop is high fortunately
doing some basic stuff you could
probably get done in a day or two even
just simple stuff like making thumbnails
and stuff if your client has a social
media campaign or doing YouTube stuff
this really helps for thumbnail
generation custom thumbnail generation
and scratching out some ideas here as
you can see here talking about the
overwhelming portion of these programs
you see that little you see these little
triangles in the lower right okay that
means they're sub menus under each of
these like this is the clone stamp tool
there's more options here and then like
the pen tool ton of options we have
options up here we have options even up
further Photoshop is a very powerful
program and you decide how far you want
to take it I know probably about 20% of
Photoshop most of these options over
here I just don't even use like the
eyedropper tool never used it have no
reason to illustrator is another example
of that it looks just like Photoshop
it's from Adobe as well
GIMP also has a learning curve that's
open source it's free to download but I
do prefer the control and the
customization of Photoshop it just has a
little more
more actually nuanced controls and
nuanced methods and tools to use in
graphic design at the very minimum
Chiquito if you have a minute
I would just research the basics of
graphic design and kind of just put them
on the back burner it's a great skill to
have it's gonna up your worth in the
long run as a web developer and you're
gonna get client requests for graphic
design stuff it's a guarantee because
graphic design includes layout and
includes photos includes tweaking small
little widgets or even stuff like logos
logo design is a heavily saturated
market but if you can incorporate that
into like a web development package I
mean that's 300-400 bucks right there
for example that's just a number I'm
throwing out the point being it's adding
to your worth as a web developer I hope
