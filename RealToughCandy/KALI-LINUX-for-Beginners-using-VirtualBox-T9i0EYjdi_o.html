kali linux so let me tell you this past
summer I tried partitioning my hard
drive and dual booting and all that jazz
like man this isn't my style so I gave
it up for a bit and then I had like a
janky USB stick I was trying to boot the
Kali Linux from and that was given me
problems so I say you know it's just the
universe does not want me to use this
Kali Linux and shift on the cards well
guys last laid or rather this morning at
about 5am I said okay this is this I'm
gonna download virtualbox i'm going to
try it again now the reason I an initial
initially didn't go to virtual box was
because I like to run a slim thin
machine don't like a lot of apps and
just nonsense I can do without it so I
said yeah yeah yeah whatever real tough
can't get over yourself you just
download the friggin thing and let's do
it so i did it i went to VirtualBox orgy
and of course i'm on a mac so i get to
the OSX hope that's a mouthful or a
little scandalous you don't say it
correctly so go ahead and download that
depending on your certain situation you
may have to install the extension pack
in my situation I did and don't worry
the VirtualBox will tell you if you have
to if kali linux is not working for you
so that's all well and good might even
be able to see yep see it just go look
like that once you download it and then
you're going to go to a county minutes
vmware and virtualbox images site now
there's other sites you can actually go
to the official catalytic sites but this
one has a version exclusively for the
64-bit vm that we are using on our mac
so what you want to do is go ahead and
click this guy right here
and again actually that looks like and
always might sound pretty basic but it's
what you're going to be working with
this is how it should pop up once it's
done and let me tell you I think the
server was throttling me somehow because
all that's on so rude it took about four
hours to download that and I did some
other tasks and stuff and I'm
connectionless fine so I think some some
entities throttles that download I might
be totally talking out of my rear but if
it's taking four or five hours don't be
surprised so once vac is downloaded you
can simply you can do it as a few
different ways but what I did was I
double clicked it we're not going to go
through the installation again you know
and it's going to it's going to set up
just like any other thing you've ever
downloaded but I really don't need to go
through that probably a waste of your
time and this video as well but you have
any questions about that process you
know leave a comment in the comments and
I'm sure someone can help you or I well
if YouTube decides to send me the
comment so once you go through the
little setup you know they're going to
ask you they're going to ask you a few
questions if you ever smoked marijuana
just kidding they're not going to ask
you that but straightforward questions
how you want it set up the operating
system i put debian 64-bit name that
Kali Linux 2016 just the default and
then I did select debian based on some
literature i was reading he said pick
that one I said ok fair enough and then
a few other questions depending on what
your system is and so here's the thing
that I was like freaking with thing is
not working for me because this was here
and then I tried powering it on and it
was like we're not going to work for you
we don't like you like are you serious
but it turns out it was because I needed
the extension pack so if you get that
message somewhere on the Virtual Box
it's going to pop up or I can't member
if it shows it up here but it's very
clear at what you need to do simply come
back here and click where we cooking we
are we clicking all supported platforms
so this is going to apply to your back
and if you're that awesome weird one who
is using a mac for watching a video
based on a mac you would also like this
so let's go back to the virtual box and
then that should do it that did it for
me and then I simply clicked power on or
powered off rather to power on and again
double-click and then we have eggs no so
I'm going to take a few seconds here to
get fully up and running and give you a
little helpful hint mouse pointer
integration automatically captured she
bore olivium is activated it cetera so
here's the other thing we may just
consumed in nvm so this was like okay
username they want me to started using
my not real tough candy and then I don't
know how about dingleberry you know it's
thinking sorry that didn't work or more
yes it did my password is dingleberry
but then you'll do this for five to ten
minutes get annoyed and wonder why it's
not working so I powered off the machine
right and I actually decided to read so
in this little bitch of documentation
here it tells you in the description
that the user name is going to be root
and the password is going to be tour so
go ahead and double-click that again
power up the machine the virtual machine
here and then you can either hit enter
or I've always wanted to do something
automatically confer getting UC system
so go ahead and it's gonna be helpful
and reach for it to activate and then
this should make a little more sense
oops route
password is simply route backward tour
the head and click Sign In and this my
friends is where the magic starts
happening we're on just like that again
it might take a while for your machine
to download this image but I assure you
it was worth the wait now how many we
configured this to my liking I'm still
learning the layout and all this and
actually I just did a video on on
metasploit and I know there's something
called Armitage on here that is a
version of metasploit other than that I
might even be inaccurate in that
statement but I know Armitage is related
to medicines and metasploit itself CEO
there's men right that's pretty cool and
why your shirt hey guys this is not so
so shabby what's this little task
Faraday I don't know if that means boo
all kinds of good stuff terminal guys I
haven't even methods of stuff yet let's
go ahead and exit that oh there it is
nice place sweet I wonder if I can all
see I just fly us i just did a video
using metasploit in mac terminal so I'm
wondering if it's the same commands here
let me just see this and it will power
off at this point I'm just having fun
whoa it was mad so let's try to show
exploits successes feel fast it is 1577
exploits lane on do I do this can I do
this right now
nevermind that isn't happening on 280 HD
right now okay oops ok so it showed the
exploits he'll be back home yep these
are exploits mr. fool ok it's not built
yet Oh interesting normally see in Mac
you can just do it ? and will bring you
through all the commands anyways this is
beyond the scope of this video just
having some fun metasploit cali lynn it
what guys that you're wondering how to
get up and running with that this is one
of the options wanna thank you guys for
watching and we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
