Newell's real tough standing with Afghan
accom back in the saddle with you guys
today
listen the stars are aligned as I said
in my last video the internet gods are
smiling upon the RTC channel and
everything that's going on with it so
you know the internet works is here
today Ganju Maui so if you're interested
number one my dinner chat room is
already having some activities right now
as I speak and people are really lighten
up the board here with their questions
and what they're working on it's just a
community to support one another you
know if we have questions about some
projects Alltech all the time if that's
your thing I warmly welcome you to the
chatroom it's open to everyone to
participate secondly the dev moto sign
up for my newsletter oMG I got like a
boatload of subscribers yesterday this
is so awesome guys this is really cool
to see people interested in this kind of
stuff if you missed out on that you can
easily find out my website real Jeff
Kinney comm sign up easily and I already
have a back issue page of two issues of
dev mojo so that's pretty cool check
that out and put the link in the comment
box so let's get to up word let's just
assume your web developer they have
different categories for freelance
writers and freelancer virtual
assistants
a freelance mobile developers so on a
freelance customer service agents okay I
can already see where this is going but
we're going to go ahead and click on web
development because that's what the RTC
channel is focused on now we will be a
brought to our highest rated developers
now these are people just like you and
me or similar to you and me who are
trying to get their foot in the door or
maybe they have their foot in the door
and just want a little side cash let's
see what they're charging for their
projects we have vasily who is a
front-end and wordpress developer from
macedonia he charges thirty three
dollars and 33 cents an hour odd
we have mario he charges 75 an hour we
go down a twenty five an hour Sergey and
Florian charges $18 an hour okay let me
throw on a bullet point here somewhere
Oh bullet point so
when I was first going to do this
freelance thing I've reinvented myself
like I don't know eight times maybe
twelve times it's okay to reinvent
yourself everyday if you want to but
I've tried doing different things and
seeing what sticks and what I like when
I first started out I was doing
multimedia step so photos graphic design
videography my immediate network was not
that big and one of my ideas my
cockamamie ideas was that well if I
charge really really rock-bottom prices
more people will pay attention you know
what more people do pay attention but
not the people that you're looking for
because ask anybody who's been in
customer service or some kind of
front-facing position at gas station or
Walmart or a place where you deal with
the general public people who are
looking for the best of the best deals
are going to usually waste your time
because they're fussy they're low
quality in the social department they'll
try and bicker with you it's not
something that's going to work for you
when you say okay I'm trying to like all
these people in what if I charge 18
bucks an hour people are going to come
to you they're going to say well that's
too expensive I want you to do it for
nine and then it's depending on your
personality you'll say okay I'll do it
for nine because you don't want to lose
the sales when I first started out I was
accommodating to everybody steamrolling
needs and it was a freaking awful
feeling back in his up worst thing
thirty bucks an hour seventy five bucks
an hour twenty five cut the whole thing
about per hour okay projects are not to
be charged per hour because it Penn
Eliza's people who are very efficient
what if I could put just click on this
guy's profile so vas OD it charges per
hour right he has he does css3 html5 per
hour what if I can do his eight hour job
in 15 minutes does that mean I get paid
25 cents this is suspicious in any other
legitimate career field like general
contracting construction whatever you
leave these contracts they don't put a
per hour okay they say this building to
be built the school this office it's
going to cost six point five million
dollars here's my materials cost here's
my cost of labor it takes as long as it
takes and you might have a deadline on
there but as far as actual hours
just ridiculous why is my blood pressure
like edit well right now there are so
many problems in the per hour model with
any kind of creative work or any kind of
web work just because of the speed
component you know $18 an hour does that
mean you can do it in five minutes do I
still to pay you work faster work faster
work faster and again $18 an hour for
Joomla website development and OpenCart
guys the minimum wage in a lot of cities
in America is $15 an hour most of my
viewers are American or North American
and even in a lot of countries overseas
in South America this number is is it's
just not happening again I know how
tempting that can be because right now
you're under employed right you're
looking for some extra side jobs right
well $18 an hour is better than none
dollars an hour right no do not fall for
it guys this is a race to the bottom the
clients that you're working for not with
and your competition such as a Saudi
this is no I don't know vessel but you
are not on an upward trajectory when you
associate with this website in the
people here let's just take an example
okay so this guy reviewed boss'll D
right oh this one was a fixed price for
a finished word plus route WordPress
template customization Photoshop to
WordPress fixed price four hundred
thirty three dollars from September to
October it took a month okay whatever
this is the this is the clients review
of all D my experience with up work
contractors has been disappointing FS
okay this isn't an anomaly I have read
this kind of thing everywhere people who
hire here I don't know why they keep
going back
my experience with up work contractors
has been disappointing at best despite
those other contractors having decent
reviews I was constantly having to redo
the work myself I was about to give up
on up work altogether then in colossal
who completely reinstated my facing up
work he's been a pleasure to work with
blah blah blah
this pretty much sums up the tone of
upwork.com and all of these other
freelance sites guys
they're all the same it's beyond a
stereotypes at this point okay they're
all the same they are bad for your
personal brand they are bad for your
income and you're going to be redoing
these projects you're going to be having
clients who are very low-quality or not
even very low-quality just below average
because they're not paying you a lot
trust me I've been there time and time
again sinking 20 bucks an hour is better
than no bucks an hour
that's not the case because eventually
these customers are going to catch up
with you and they're going to be calling
you at odd hours or to be emailing you
they're going to be dissatisfied they're
going to be trashing your personal name
and that's not something you need this
early on in the game once you start
building your personal brand or more
confident if someone loves to trash you
that's on them because you appear right
now you know what I mean $5,000 per
project not $100 per hour not 20 bucks
an hour okay
$5,000 per project you get it done and
people respect that people do not
respect low-wage workers whether you
agree with it or disagree with it I've
seen it time and time again in all the
career fields I've been in if you're
making 15 20 bucks an hour a lot more
than zero bucks an hour but on the scale
of what web developers should be making
you're down here at that point you don't
want to be down there come up come up
stay away from up work the reason I'm so
emphatic in this video is because guys
like I said I was there when I first
started out my little micro business
doing photo and video I was charging 20
and 25 bucks an hour and for the
umpteenth time 25 bucks an hour zero
bucks an hour but it's not just an
hourly thing first of all you should be
charging per project charge per project
don't let your services all this hard
work you're going to charge 20 bucks an
hour start charging per project and let
it take 20 minutes that's why you're
finessing your skills so somebody who
walks in it takes them eight hours
because they don't have experience you
have experience it takes you 20 minutes
you bang it out thank you have a nice
day thank you for that $500 do not race
to the bottom
this video super adamant I hope it was
helpful guys if you have any experiences
with these freelance sites I would love
to hear about them I would love to hear
about people who find these sites
behaving I know John Morris he's a
youtuber and podcaster talks about up
worked a lot me all the stuff but guys
there are so many other people who will
confirm what I'm saying you don't
believe me check it out on YouTube but
ask other people in the business who and
who are freelancing and how much they
charge successful people who are in web
development they're not charging per
hour and if they do it's an astronomical
fee it's 200 bucks an hour John Simon is
I think he charges 300 bucks an hour why
because it's time is worth money and he
is worth it he's not going to spend five
weeks converting a Photoshop to
WordPress okay I'm going to be doing
some other videos on how to get clients
I've done it I've done one before on EDD
n which is an excellent way to find
people in your neighborhood in
neighborhoods who are perhaps interested
in your services of web development
whatever else you're doing but this is
not it thanks for all your guys's
support seriously I did not imagine even
though it's a relatively small Channel
this is just absolutely fabulous great
minds your great encouragement check out
the chat room if it's your thing if not
hey I won't be offended the the
newsletter is going great and you guys
are doing some wonderful things I have
reached out to a few of you for the Deaf
spotlight series guys I wish I had a
startup I'd hire you so I'd hire some of
you guys so damn fast okay that gave me
a great idea
alright enough babbling I got to get out
of here and work on my startup so you
