candy from real tough canycom just
wanted to pop on real quick ensure this
really cool CSS specificity resource I
found called bat epiphany that uses
Batman references to help illustrate the
concept of CSS specificity now CSS
specificity is probably one of the most
difficult concepts to learn and CSS
that's debatable but a lot of people do
have trouble learning it just because
there's a lot of rules to it and almost
article and smashing magazine granted is
10 years old but the information inside
of a distal ajith and even this author
vitaly freezin my tally friedman agrees
that one of the most difficult concepts
in CSS CSS special technique now what
CSS specificity is besides difficult to
pronounce is that it determines which
CSS rule is applied by the browser so
that is basically the foundation of the
definition but as you can see the
overview really tends to go on because
there's so many rules and so many
exceptions and so on and so forth about
understanding it but it's there's a
hierarchy to it and you can measure it
with numbers like oh my god can be
overwhelming if not totally overwhelming
but that's where that officially is here
to help you and again it's just a fun
little one pager but you know they use
like a Batmobile a utility belt and
Alfred as examples to illustrate
specificity in CSS cute little guide
again over at bat officially com hope
this was helpful guys we will see you in
the next video and as always thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
