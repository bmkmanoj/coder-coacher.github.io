if you don't develop in PHP this video
is super boring
real tough candy for real tough candy
dot-com nerding out with you today
welcome new subscribers thanks for
coming and hello older subscribers to
thank all of you guys for watching today
we're doing a little walkthrough of
phpstorm now as the title implies this
editor actually this IDE it's a
development environment is for PHP and
as I said the beginning of this video if
you're not a PHP person probably not the
video for you but as web developers PHP
is going to be coming into your life at
one point or another I'm coming from
Adam and I like Adam a lot a lot of
people have ditched Adam for Visual
Studio and so what it is vs code right
and I've kind of held out the reason
people don't like this is because it can
be really slow the reason I don't like
it yeah it is a little slow for me the
biggest thing for me and Adam is that
whenever you need a bit of functionality
you have to go out and search for it
you're spending a lot of time googling
for different packages and the fun
little bit of functionality that you
need for example I don't know like hot
reloading or whatever there's like 20
people who have created their little
module or their little package and
you're not really sure which one to
download so that takes a lot of time and
when you're spending 16 hours a day
behind a code editor those little
decisions really add up so that's the
biggest negative for me using Adam when
I downloaded a PHP storm I didn't have
to look for any of those packages
everything is built in this console this
terminal right here built in all I had
to do was click a button and it popped
up and it even has my settings here you
see that awesome color and stuff this
run tab gave me some deja vu because at
one time I had Android studio downloaded
and I thought I was gonna be doing
mobile development for like a month in
my life and a lot of these things look
the same if you have ever seen Android
studio so that was cool the other thing
that is very nice about phpstorm is that
it's
program and application-specific for
example I hit a new project and let's
say I'm working on a wordpress plugin no
I don't have my wordpress installation I
don't have any of this stuff set up but
once I do simply put the path in and get
going with WordPress coding standards so
all of these have different flavors I
guess it's probably the wrong word but
different standards for coding and let's
just let's see what this is all about
html5 boilerplate Wow
okay look and look what it did here this
created my boilerplate for CSS some
markdown files here frequently asked
questions this is dope this is the first
time I've actually done this on this
phpstorm some JavaScript files here just
to get you set up with the basics so
there's a lot of magic over here in this
lower left hand corner we have that
terminal I was telling you about Boop
just like that's a bash terminal and
then a database section which I haven't
explored yet but it's looking pretty
promising select your database driver
varying from a sure to Amazon MySQL
Oracle pick your database and ride even
stuff like hsqldb no idea what that is
as far as continuing to code PHP and
Adam I probably will if I'm doing
experiments or just need a lighter
experience I read recently that Adam
introduced the Adam IDE so they're
adding some IDE functionality don't know
much about what specifically that
functionality is oh look IDE PHP I
wonder that might be something I'll look
into for like personal projects and
stuff but that at the end of the day I
think phpstorm is great for larger
projects for PHP heavy projects and if
you have an employer who does PHP stuff
ask them if they'll buy this for you
it's like I don't know ninety or hundred
bucks a year it's for an IDE you're
probably thinking like dude that's super
expensive compared to something like
Adam gonna save your company money in
the long run because you're not fumbling
for packages you're not you know
spending six hours trying to set stuff
up phpstorm comes with a built-in server
I actually hooked it up with MAMP
and it was it works great and you can
just you know hit hit your browser and
have
Kojo it's pretty sweet and just a fun
program without having to worry about
finding packages that other people made
it's all built-in but it's not free so
keep that in mind
30 day free trial though so if you guys
are editing PHP on something that is
even better than phpstorm
let me know this is on my personal
computer so I can do whatever I want on
here I'm always looking for better ways
to do things thanks for watching we'll
see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
