tough canycom back in the saddle with
you today today's lab lesson is super
exciting we're going to turn your web
browser into a vegetable results may
vary depending on your browser but I
know for me Safari Oh results are superb
now this is cool for beginning
programmers developers whatever want to
call yourselves for JavaScript because
you can learn how to use functions and a
different I one less a skill set but
having deviants fun coding these
functions is sweet it's a good way to
learn it and then second of all for
aspiring cyber security analyst you can
really see how something so dead and
dumb simple I mean really it is it's
dumb simple can potentially wreak havoc
because you can show in bits of malice
here and there with this simple
JavaScript block of code and we're going
to open this up with the auction and we
can call anything just for the sake of
simplicity we'll call it life function
go ahead and throw those parentheses in
there curly bracket and then I like to
give myself some more when I'm quoting
this stuff welcome back and clean it in
a bit but we're going to open up line
two with a while loop so go ahead in
times while and this is again dumb and
dead simple while one is equivalent to
one go ahead and put another curly
bracket there bring it up a minute and
this is going to be window open will do
HTTP
let's go to real tough County com huh
why not why not Sam the masses of my own
website all right and then I'm simply
going to copy this line through here and
i'm going to paste it let's taste it for
time Luke's start a new line for each
one of you use just for the sake of
cleanliness leave for one two three four
yep and then we'll just clean these
brackets up and am oops one more line
it's ten lines total for this javascript
function in grandma's function blink and
then now this is the JavaScript that is
the core of this operation however if
you open your browser just using this
nothing what's going to happen you need
to apply this to a functionality on the
webpage what I mean by that is i'm
building a pizza button oh yes it gets
that good and I'm also going to put this
code inside some HTML so we're going to
keep it we're not going to get all crazy
we're just going to do the basic so as
you doc type HTML go ahead and put HTML
enter for head coach Hayden go ahead and
put style and then we're going to start
our body and then here's what we're
going to put our enticing image I have
one of delicious gooey pizza because
everyone yes everyone else is up we're
going to do background image URL and
then parentheses and then put your photo
of choice right here it doesn't have to
be you know my pizza picture i'm using
look that's not it i have to go find it
alright i found my URL which is later
com of a big old pepperoni pizza sweet
so again use your photo of choice there
and then is a put a semicolon here
and then closing bracket right here on
line 7 and then we're going to close
that style we're going to close our
heads we're going to start our body when
will enter and then we're gonna put our
button actually I'm going to give myself
a little more room to and you know feel
free I know you probably won't endear
like the guru singh oh and go three
lines in or whatever but since I'm the
only one reading this this is what works
for me I like some spaces so I can kind
of chunk the code and my eyes can break
it up whatever works for you whatever
ever get the damn job who the jangle gum
whatever it's the dang job done so this
is going to be a button on click to be
equal to my function go ahead and put a
parenthesis in semi colon and then go
ahead of claims I make sure that's a
quote and then we'll say three pieces of
luckys all guys is going to be good and
then we'll close a button buck Tom it
sure felt like I never do go ahead and
enter and then we're going to start this
is we're going to put our script tag
because this is where our actual
JavaScript start right down here alright
so then clean that up and then at the
end of woof we're going to take this out
we're going to this is our original call
it weirdest thing take that out all in
its place we're going to end the script
scritch in the body and then in HTML all
right and now go ahead and save it and
this will turn all pretty well name it
HTML oh I know the safe hey myself all
right guys you got to save let's go to
our browser I'm on Safari and go ahead
and open up that HTML document we just
saved all right here it is indexed here
we go ready three two one ok let's get
this Pizza button how delicious
is that look how freaking delicious oh
my godfre pays off oh oh oh my god make
it stop guys this is a practical silly
ridiculous and potentially very harmful
way to practice your JavaScript now
let's just see if we can get out of here
Oh God and if I'm thinking correct if I
open this again I'm gonna be screwed oh
yes not no I'm good I'm good to go you
can try this on firefox looks right on
Chrome don't we got a free piece of
button please let's hit it and see what
happens in Chrome ok curls a little more
well behaved your browser may vary but
if you want to funk a good time
definitely go for the safari experience
I hope this lab was helpful have some
fun to stay legal we'll see in the next
video thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
