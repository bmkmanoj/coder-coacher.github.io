savory experiences that the United
States Postal Service the wait times can
be ridiculous the clerks are often
cranky and cantankerous and things just
haven't been the same since they retired
the Ella Fitzgerald stamp but if they
have one thing one thing one saving
grace going for them
it's a DDM I'm not talking about
electronic dance music here this
technique I'm about to show you this
method of getting your name out there is
going to get you clients here is how a
CDN works from Alaska to Florida New
York City to San Diego and all at
flyover country it's fairly
straightforward every mailbox in America
is serviced by the United States Postal
Service every mail receptacle is legally
serviced by the United States Postal
Service that means they have the keys to
the kingdom they have the keys to your
clients via their mailboxes so what you
do is you design will say a five by
seven postcard you know just throw in
some specs one-sided full-color black
white doesn't matter you print up 500 of
them insert number here you sign up
through their website you could also do
it in person
and it is a very economical and very
efficient way at targeting people in
your immediate area and if you're just
starting out in web development or it
could be any type of business doesn't
have to be web development doesn't have
to be digital development you know
multimedia it could be any type of
business you are targeting everybody in
your immediate area with a mailer people
can grab it at their convenient take it
out of that mailbox who doesn't like
getting mail that's the other thing who
doesn't like getting mail it's not
really junk mail if you're from the area
right especially if your card looks good
that's not junk mail that's something
they're going to stick on the
refrigerator
and if they don't need your services
they probably know somebody who does
that's how this is an excellent way to
build your brand up so let me share my
experience with eddm personally and then
we'll hop on and I'll show you guys the
details and you can kind of see what I'm
talking about
last year I did in a DDM campaign
for a few ZIP codes in my area I think
it reached like 800 people I was
fielding calls I was fielding calls
about a day after the mailer went out up
until a few months later because again
people stick these things on their
fridge especially if you have a nice
design listed maybe you're not into
design hire somebody who can do it and
make it look good hey if you don't know
anybody all right so let's hop on the
computer I'm going to show you guys how
this EDM scene works and just how
economical and efficient it is so I'm
over at usps.com/smallbiz ascription
back so this is your homepage and they
actually do a pretty good job of
explaining what it is in a nutshell it
says EDM is an affordable targeted
advertising technique that lets you map
your marketing male audience by age
income or household size so let's say
your web development company that caters
to people making over $40,000 I don't
know just receive reticle sake you can
market that with this tool so we're
going to go ahead and do some mapping
here and I'm going to show you how
freaking inexpensive it is it blows my
mind because like I said it's targeted
advertising and you can't get much
cheaper so we're going to go ahead here
and select our route search full address
city safer zip city state or zip code
let's go nine oh two one oh why not
right this service is available like I
said all across America I don't know I
know I have a lot of international
subscribers I don't know how it works in
Canada or Israel or France maybe you
guys have something like this maybe not
but maybe do so we're going to go ahead
and click on route because now this is
not very intuitive or maybe I'm just
stupid okay so we hit oops let's go back
here we hit the show table now we have
32 routes available in the nine oh two
one oh ZIP code in Beverly Hills there
are 32 mail people delivery guys who are
out and about trudging through it doing
the thing and delivering mail
to these areas okay in this zip code
right here I don't you what else so
let's say I want to target people I want
to target a lot of people for one thing
and I want it to target a mix of
residential and business so here we have
the residential tab you see where this
is right here at least if I can get in
here a little more
here is your residential so in I don't -
uh no - c00 - there's 735 residential
delivery spots and 14 businesses I want
a little better mix so let's see if I
can use here we go here's the final -
100 - C 0 25 120 residential 76 business
for 196 total but I want a few more so
I'm going to throw these guys in here
oops why do I have another route
selected I'm gonna clear this out okay
so I want this one for sure and they're
telling me I can't send fewer than 200
mail pieces that's fine
the more the merrier let's go mmm
let's see um you know okay here this is
good for me except well it's a not half
but it's getting there
so ages 25 to 44 26 percent of all
recipients are ages 25 to 44 in this
specific area of the zip code right the
average income is $65,000 boom not too
shabby
so I'm going to select them and you want
to know what I'm only at eighty one
dollars
I'm already delivering to 462 addresses
that's the other thing guys it's an
address that little neighbor you're
sending might be seen by 5 10 15 20 25
30 35 40 people and on and on if that's
on a company fridge or if someone's
passing it around like huh okay John
talk about the smell or it can be seen
by hundreds more people by the time
you're done delivering so right now four
addresses were at 462 and sat.1 dollars
in 77 cents now I will say that doesn't
include the cost of designing your
mailer and having an effective message
on your little mailer not little it
could be big there are restrictions
but that's neither here nor there for
the purpose of this video this is just
to show you the process of getting your
name out there in a local area which
again if you're just starting out in a
great way to build your brand let people
know you're out there
and if you're in the vicinity it's going
to add legitimacy to your name because
people are going to be talking about you
if your own physical area alright enough
of that so as we see we have four or
sixty two addresses that we're
delivering to my little mail are going
to going to get real tough candy some
good kinds it's eighty one dollars and
seventy seven cents the cost per mail
piece that little mail you're sending
out to deliver it to their mailbox is
seventeen cents you round fifteen guys
it's literally pennies people don't talk
about EDDM very much I don't know why
it's incredible okay let's go to
continue okay so at this point you gotta
sign in for UPS USPS we're not going to
do that right inconvenient help you guys
get the idea like I said and I know I've
said it five times by now but it's just
it's an exciting thing because you
wouldn't expect the USPS to do this but
they really do have leverage because
again they're the only legal entity that
has access to these addresses they're
going to be your friends get to know the
people at your post office even though
the weight line sucks and if you have
any questions talk to your postmaster at
the post office you go to or most mail
clerks know about it too are
knowledgeable enough to tell you
accurate information I hope this video
was helpful rock that eddm let me know
if you've had experience with eddm if
it's something you might be rocking or
what or what techniques you use to get
local folks excited about what you do
