candy back in the saddle with you today
over at free code gap doing that basic
JavaScript section today we are sifting
through text with regular expressions
now I didn't know anything about regular
expressions I've heard of them here and
there over the course of me no reading
about JavaScript have never played
around with them never really understood
what they were but I can see how handy
they can can come in to aid in different
programs in JavaScript so we're going to
go through this and then since this is
such a really straightforward
walkthrough we're going to do some
experimenting and I'm going to try and
drag in some external resources namely
from where we go on today namely from
zabi three schools which I have
referenced literally hundreds of times
doing JavaScript HTML and CSS and just
kind of give a bigger perspective if I
could talk about what to regular
expressions are all about so let's go
through and just recap what they're
trying to tell us here and I have to say
this lesson is less of a lesson and more
than a breeze through it because
honestly I don't recall seeing this dot
match method before maybe I just had a
memory of a goldfish I know that for a
fact I do so maybe I missed this in a
previous lesson but maybe I didn't there
have been other inconsistencies in the
free code camp curriculum but that's
neither here nor there we're going to
bang this out and see what we can do
today regular expressions are used to
find certain words or patterns in side
of strings as you know anything inside
quotations such as this in a love life
sentence that is its training for
example who wanted to find the word be
in the string be dog chase 2d cat we
could use the following regular
expression colon slash be /g I then they
explain the slash is the start of the
regular expression Z is the pattern we
want to match so we're looking for this
word and then the other / is the end of
the expression G means global which
causes the pattern to return all matches
in the string not just the first one
very important
i means that we want to ignore the case
application lower case when searching
for the pattern all of that pretty much
goes without explaining so then they
want us to select all the occurrences of
the word and in tuft string and they
give us further instructions by saying
or our tip with the instruction saying
you can do to started placing the dot
part of the regular expression with the
word well that seems simple enough so
let's just get that going we'll fire
that up pass the coupe's can't talk and
called pass the lesson and then play
around with it and do some more
explaining so what do they want us to do
we they want us to find only the
occurrences of the word and in test ring
so we simply go up here to test string
and it's actually we could actually just
count them here just to I don't know I
don't know what we're proven she's not
counting them there's one to two and so
our answer damn hand this black box
should be too so we're going to go so
that's the best the word we're looking
for and they're already put in G and I
GE global maybe it's going to search
this whole thing not just the first word
and it's going to ignore uppercase and
lowercase so for example there could be
an upper case and in here somewhere and
i also want to mention that and isn't
just a word and if you put something
like andand all it would return that
word as well or count it as a word
because and actually would return it
twice because there's two M's in and on
da so we're going to take that out and
then you're done so variable and count
equals test ring match privacy's
expression because this is being fed
through here searching for and dot links
so let's run it see what's happening
here bullseye boom we got that we know
there's two we know this all checks out
seat straightforward and simple but then
I was starting to look at the problem
and like asking myself why is if dot
length in here what is the purpose of
that because for my understanding dot
length just come
whatever you want to count so I took the
length out and I can see why they have
it there nuts we're also going to take
the dot out to the documentation I'm
adamant hitting this halo on computer
let's run the test and notice it's not a
number but now they're returning the
instance of an but they're actually just
repeating it how many times they found
it so there's two and here but we wanted
a number and so the dot link returns to
us the number of times and is up here in
the strings in D string so then I was
like okay that makes total sense but
what if I played around with the search
word or what is the proper term the
pattern they call this word that we feed
in has ever want to search for words a
pattern okay so i put in 0 just because
it's a number and it's not in here so i
was curious what it would do and I in a
return null 0 is returned as null
because not on here similarly if you put
even the Z in there I don't think
there's a Z up here so we're going to
get null down here too because it's not
in here and it's not an object null is
not an object so then I was recert will
object what does I would do if anything
so I was researching this match seeing
it okay you guys know what I listened to
in my meantime meantime average time you
know moving on where were we for having
SIG's looking at this match method let's
go back here match so this is a method
and what do they have to say about this
method the match method searches a
string for a match against a regular
expression we know that okay no duh
we've already seen that at free code
camp and returns the matches as in a ray
object as an array object
so what I'm reading is that what this
returns oops pardon me we're going to
take out the dot links because i'm going
to show you what they mean by array
objects that's why some brackets right
and they have the string and a comma
string and just like you would see in an
array and it's considered an object
because as you seem when it returns
something that's not there it indicates
OOP such as null ok so it's could the
dot line is going to say something down
here about it not being an object null
is not an object so the match is a
method which correct me if I'm wrong
again I has memory a goldfish but I do
not think recode camp has explained at
least thoroughly what the heck a method
is but this kind of shed some light on
that supported by all browsers that's
always a plus and then they gave some
examples here see they give this almost
the same example or same format which is
a good thing of the usage of dot match
and it returns this string this array
array rather but it's not in brackets I
think that's all I was experimenting
with there's a lot to experiment with
your these were the two things I wanted
to see what it was all about because I
feel like you could put a lot of stuff
in here that could really jam the system
which come on let's face a world
interested in gaming the system right
don't answer anyways thanks for watching
guys hope it wasn't rambling too much
but this sift through text with regular
expression I feel like I want to expand
more on it outside a free code camp and
I'm going to be doing a review of the
basic JavaScript portion if I can even
zoom up or scroll up anything up
involving up a be nice right now this
portion right here the basic JavaScript
they said 10 hours spoiler alert i'm on
probably hours 30 of this because I'm
not blowing through it I want to
understand it so we're going to be doing
a review of that real quick akan about
well we just did this one I have about
three more lessons left and expect that
video thanks guys for watching as always
you can also find me
real tough candy calm where I blog about
babes nerds and tech oh yeah it's a heck
of a time over there we'll see you guys
later thanks for watching
okay baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
