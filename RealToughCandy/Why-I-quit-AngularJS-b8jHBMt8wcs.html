glad which I quit smoking
I quit hanging around toxic people but
enough things like angular about
quitting angular today on the real tough
candy channel if I can tell are
intuitive to discuss a topic that I quit
but I think this might happen to a lot
of people like me who have the basics
down and I'm really hungry to learn the
more stuff we see things like angular
Express note all these JavaScript
frameworks and even libraries where it's
like yo I don't know anything about this
X I get up to speed I got to get scaled
up and start being competitive I can
only do so many if elves switch types of
programs before you know you you feel
yourself reaching this plateau and the
temptation of but trying to learn a
framework is really strong especially
because they have really good graphics
for example angular I know most of you
have probably seen this symbol many
places it's one of the most popular
JavaScript frameworks out there
developed by Google and it's described
as a framework that you know I'm not
going to I'm not going to bastardize it
I'll let them explain it it's what HTML
would have been if it was designed for
building web apps now someone who came
from an HTML background in this whole
coding journey I mean this was like back
in the day I have the HTML book for
dummies when people were getting paid
100 bucks an hour to code HTML before
the whole tech bubble burst oh those
things like such fun times
real tough candy was a young teen at
trying to crank out some really cool GUI
based web pages and learning that HTML
is so
citing but that's getting off the topic
of angularjs but it does tie in because
you know when you see things as a
beginner or career changers that have
certain keywords like HTML Oh hTML is
relatively straightforward and in the
grand scheme of things relativity other
programming concepts and technical
concepts hTML is easy hate when people
say that but again relatively easy so of
course your mind is like ooh HTML yeah I
know me some HTML maybe I can expand to
angular because guess what I know some
JavaScript too this is where the
situation gets a little sticky because
angularjs is pretty technically intense
and a lot of the stuff you'll have never
seen before and while it may sound like
something you can understand because for
me going through the tutorials in
angular I was like you know everything
this guy's talking about I mentally can
process I don't really know what he's
talking about let me show what I'm
talking about recently did a review on
JavaScript understanding the weird part
and if you're beyond coding the same old
loops and stuff and your basic
JavaScript er again I highly recommend
this course but the reason I took
angular was because not only were people
talking about it not only where IC was I
seen the keyword like full HTML basic
JavaScript okay where do I sign but Tony
the guy we taught this really good class
also is doing this class and I got it
for 10 bucks
so I said okay I got the basics of
JavaScript you know I think I'm ready to
expand to a framework angular sounds
awesome so let's explore this angular
thing 55 lectures seven hours I started
a few days ago about 17 out of it about
a third of the way done right and again
I understand what he's saying but I
don't know exactly how it's working what
he's doing and in the end how it's going
to benefit me as a developer it's just
beyond me right now and to not have the
basic grasp of some vanilla JavaScript
concepts like the Dom I understand the
definition of the Dom we don't
understand the Dom how to manipulate it
for example let's see Dawg inserting
notes that adding notes and what that is
attribute names and values the dog
attributes the Dom counting elements the
Dom getting a targets name it's all more
ways to target elements so I know for me
that was warning sign number one where
you know people teaching these courses
or people talking about angular or any
other framework they reference something
over and over and you're like oh yeah
I've heard of that let's just continue
on what if I don't know how to
manipulate the Dom what the hell am i
doing taking an angularjs course I have
very little business taking angularjs I
mean I can take angular courses all day
long but in the end it's going to be a
waste of my time because at the end of
the course
I'm not going to understand mechanics if
you guys seen a partially completed
subdivision let me show you a picture or
maybe Detroit
this is how my mind is going to end up
if I don't get right and real back from
this angular course because I don't have
components to make a solid foundation
and to build from there
resource allocation of one's brain is
very important and taking this angular
class I'm so glad I pulled out a third
of the way and was being honest with
myself I have to learn that all I have
to learn how the MVC the
model-view-controller the mvvm the MV
wildcard how those things work I don't
have to learn it exhaustively but
seriously what am i doing in angularjs I
need to get more of the basics of
JavaScript down the bottom line of this
video is that I'll quit angularjs
because I don't understand the
fundamentals of JavaScript enough I have
to get those basics down in line line
without having to go to stack overflow
without having to consult Google without
having to go to youtube so that I have
that foundation and I can build from
there because even if I did have an
understanding of angularjs by the time I
was done with this whole series in about
three days next month when I'm on to
another framework because yeah oh it's
so so easy I just finished it when I'm
on it out of freaking work it's going to
be a brain dump I'm going to forget
everything I learned and probably you
are too if you don't have that
foundation down learning the Dom
learning about Model View wild card
architectures is my chart my two
priorities right now and angular is a
wild world and is so powerful I know
this but I'm just not ready for it in a
hungry as I am to devour and apply
angular to my projects just can't run
with the big dogs yet hope this video
was helpful
neither you're in the same situation as
I am now if you're 7/8 of the way done
with something like this it could be
ember view Jes Express whatever
bootstrap is your 7a is done majority
done Hey
we best to keep on cranking through but
I cut my losses and I'm going to go back
and come back when the time is right
this class is going to be here for me on
you to me until udemy goes out of
business so it's not going anywhere I
hope this video was helpful if you have
a similar experience I'd like to know
about it or maybe you haven't had a
similar experience and you rocked
angular or rock to node or some other
framework or a library and you know
don't have the fundamentals of
JavaScript down I want to hear about
that too your experiences are cool to
hear about and I love reading them
thanks for watching we'll see in the
next video stay tuned to subscribe like
comment you know the drill keep this
