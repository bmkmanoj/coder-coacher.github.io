the next week so good luck to you my
friend with those also a shout-out to
Elise Allen a newer subscriber here at
the rock candy channel check in and
saying hi and thank you for your service
three no.52 right here ladies crash test
today's topic is tech conferences are
they even worth some money guys you know
you set conferences they cost a bundle
there one day and you really didn't get
anything out of them I can only speak
for myself as a newbie and because
there's a lot of newbies on this channel
and people who were maybe just past the
newbie phase and trying to get to a
certain point wanted to share my
experiences with you guys and how that
might help you when you're looking at
these conferences it's not a topic a lot
of web guys on YouTube are talking about
but so I think this is even more
relevant my interests are open-source
technology technologies and front-end
web development and full stack where it
counts
so I can't you know I don't know much
about MongoDB and my equalist stuff
so probably wouldn't dedicate a day to
go into a conference so I decided to go
to the open source and open source
conference and at an open source
conference there are a ton of speakers
usually in different tracks so you can
pick like all a cart what you want to go
to like Oh someone's pick talking about
JavaScript in es6 I'll go to that at 8
a.m. instead of the Mongo DB conference
at 8 a.m. so it's like the Lollapalooza
of tech because you know there's like
five stages by rooms and you pick what
you want
what appeal see you in a little V nor
the PDF or whatever they give you to
choose this is one I wanted to highlight
because it seems to hit
all of the prerequisites as a typical
open source conference it's one day it's
actually holy crap it's tomorrow this
was in the Midwest this is in
Bloomington Minnesota it's 225 bucks so
right away you know I'm looking at this
I'm like 225 bucks I went to an open
source conference just like this do they
have these I guess I don't think it's
not even important
you know who's speaking the point is
they have different terms what I'm going
to was like 250 bucks
I could barely define a variable I'm not
even exaggerating and when you walk in
there's like all these meetup groups
there's like the Mongo meetup group
women in code he gets and like just like
this gone to live this runway and I felt
very self-conscious because I was the
biggest dodo in the room and all these
people are spitting out tech terms and
like networking and stuff I'm just like
I'm here for the free crumpet like it
was very intimidating at first but then
I realized something these conferences
or for the party faithful you know what
I'm saying people who are really excited
about tech go to these things whether or
not they get their tickets at half price
full price or comp price they're there
or they're volunteering and or they're
speaking or they're doing all three of
those things these people love tech and
it's not like it's not as vicious as a
place like perhaps YouTube where you
know it's the information superhighway
to throw in a 90s turban everyone's like
you know there's not five million people
here is what I'm trying to say it's a
very distinct and focus group and these
people by and large really want to help
one another and they really want to
network even as somebody who didn't have
a business card
who couldn't define a variable who felt
very self-conscious I went to this open
source conference it's just like a year
and a half ago 26 late 2015 and I get to
my car and I feel like my brains about
to explode I have a little like
Poindexter notebook like Oh returned any
times be closure I don't know what this
stuff is so I get in my car and I'm like
I usually don't listen to Van Halen but
at that moment I found the nearest
classic rock station that was playing
van Halen and turned that thing up to 11
like I push the volume control on my car
passed the limit so just so my brain
could have something to focus on besides
all this information what I'm trying to
say to you guys is that these
conferences are worth the money because
in something that might take you four or
five months to discover
yeah this information of course is on
the internet guys all of this
information is on the internet but
what's your time works for me my time is
worth it's like up here it used to be
like down here I used to have a lot of
time I used to spend weekends outside
drinking beer and yelling at people
driving by like I don't do that anymore
most weekends my time is worth at this
level right here so in an hour period I
learned as much information as I would
have on my own in three or four months
is that worth two hundred and
twenty-five dollars yes is that worth
let's find something a little more
specialized is that where's early bird
pricing four hundred and fifty dollars
if you're a principal - of an
organizational members employees see
that one I can't answer but if I was an
organizational members employee
principal to your banker suite maybe I
try to get the discount and the early
bird and go to this thing I think this
one is for yet federal open source
policy so you know your DC policy wonks
types and also I think it has to do with
health care oh please don't register me
I don't want to do this so as you can
see these tech conferences are
specialized as you want them to be they
have node conferences they have a you
know PHP whatever your whatever your
delight is they have them so back to the
issue of price I have a lot of diverse
viewers which is freaking awesome for me
personally 100 bucks
a lot of money 250 bucks
that's a hard fifty dollars more I think
in 100 bucks I don't know my math sucks
the point being this is a lot of money
for a lot of people here is a pro tip
if you're not a member of a meetup group
or if you're a woman you're a member of
women code start networking with these
meetup groups that you're interested
final technologies are interested in and
find the appropriate meetup group
because a lot of these meetup groups
they give away tickets
I didn't pay two hundred and fifty bucks
to my first tech conference I didn't say
anything because I networked the hell
out of myself and said I couldn't afford
it which was the truth just so happen
the organizer of the event had some free
tickets to give away and he said guess
what real tough candy no one else has
claimed these they're all yours he
wanted to give me two of them I said
that's not necessary I would bring a
friend but I don't know anyone that
geeky enough guys if you can't afford
these things number one go to this one
DevOps day in Chicago this is for DevOps
people I'm not a DevOps person but I am
actually going to this one so if you
like to attend but consider the cost of
the prohibitive please send us an email
so the organizers of this event are
already saying hey we're not going to
let the cause keep people out which is
pretty freaking cool because it wasn't
always like this you know the elitism
and texts used to be higher it's
changing that's awesome for people who
can't afford it so you know hack your
way into these things if you can't
afford these things guys the bottom line
is these tech conferences are usually
always worth it
ask yourself what your time is works
even if you walk out of these
conferences not knowing anything which
is really hard to do because they work
hard to pack these conferences filled
with great speakers and information
let's just say you walk out you don't
you don't care for it whatever it sucked
you didn't retain any information this
is the prime place networking getting
your name out there telling people what
you hope to do what you are doing how
people can contact you bring a business
car if you don't have a business card
shout out your website people respond
favorably to people who are honest it's
okay if you don't know anything at these
conferences there are a lot of people
who really want to reach out and help
you because guess what they want born
they didn't pop out of their mother's
womb knowing DevOps or PA
HP or my sequel or whatever they didn't
okay even if they learn it when they
were eight years old so what you didn't
and that's okay I didn't I hope this
video was helpful

conferences in your area guys this isn't
