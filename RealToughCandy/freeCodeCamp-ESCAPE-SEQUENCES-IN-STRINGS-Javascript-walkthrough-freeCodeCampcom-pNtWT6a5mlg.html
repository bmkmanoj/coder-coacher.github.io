wanted to pop on real quick and go
through this free code camp escape
sequences and strings challenge the
reason I wanted to do this one is
because I was stuck on it for like 20
minutes just started doing these free
code camp courses modules whatever you
want to call yesterday I love it but
this one was just a pain in my butt so
whether you're having a big problem or a
little problem we're gonna go through it
right now and just do a little
walkthrough so if you're watching this
video you probably have read all this
about escape characters the escape
sequence and all this so let's go right
to the instructions they want us to
assign the following three lines of text
into the single variable my STR using
escape sequences so first line second
line third line seems pretty easy right
not if you're just starting out so let's
go through this line by line they say
here is a text with the escape sequences
right now so this is a really good
reference right here go to this and
study it for a few minutes it's what
really helped me figure it out so let's
go to the first line we're gonna start
up here variable now we're going to
define the variable with a string and as
you know string start in quotes so we'll
type first
why easy enough right and note this is
really important and this really threw
me off they say no spaces between escape
sequences or words nada so we're not
gonna do any spaces here so first line
looks good right okay so now we go to
second line which has two backslashes so
if it has a backslash we have to do the
escape for backslash which is a
backslash all right so now we're gonna
do the second line you need to escape
the backslash there's that backslash
there's the escape there's the backslash
and now oh oh I did forget something
because this has to go on a second line
so we need the escape character for
escape sequence rather for newline so
let's go to our little chart its
backslash and
and we want this right here to print on
a new line so we're gonna go backslash n
so now it looks like we can go to our
third line which is what do you know
third line but you put it on the third
line itself we need to do a carriage
return as you see carriage return so we
check our little chart where is carriage
return backslash R again no spaces in
any of this and this is biggest thing
that threw me off
ah okay I'm glad you guys caught that
because I just did okay let's try it and
see what happens
errors but look all checkmarks green
right so I was like okay this looks good
I was toiling through this what the heck
this programs bugged but for the more
astute audience members out there you
would have seen I forgot something very
small but very critical semicolon that's
what threw me off
that's what is not causing this to give
me your awesome alert let's see I'm the
king of the world
so there is the solution to this
challenge escape sequences and strings I
hope you found this video helpful
subscribe I might be doing some more of
these videos if they're popular enough
for people appreciate them alright hope
you're having a good day see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
