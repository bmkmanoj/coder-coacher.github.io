it's real tough candy from real tough
candy calm back in the saddle with you
you today want it to pop on and talk
about two core elements of JavaScript
that will really help you if you're
trying to debug something well it
possibly can help you but it's a good
stuff to know regardless when you're
debugging and something's like not
popping up the way you wanted to and
you're just about to rip your face off
please don't inflict self violence
because sometimes it might just come
down to understanding operator
precedence and associativity so we're
going to discuss these two concepts in
this video today starting off with
operator precedence now we're going to
take this to a live coding environment
well a pre-recorded coding environment
let's just start off by declaring a
variable a oh come on it's so boring how
about real tough forget the camel case
it's gonna be 3 plus 4 plus 8 times 5 ok
so a basic mathematical variable
watching McCall it's okay yeah that's
technical so you know pretty
straightforward what's gonna happen when
we console dot log real tough game give
you a few seconds to think about this
now again we are computing 3 plus 4
times 5 got your answer let's just see
if you were right the answer is 23
why because of operator precedence
when JavaScript when the engine saw this
I started doing its thing it saw this
asterisk which is the multiplication
symbol and in JavaScript the
multiplication symbol takes or operator
rather want to use the REC terms the
multiplication operator took precedence
over the addition operator so instead of
3 plus 4 which is 7 times 5 which
results in 35 the engine took
four times five which is 20 and then
added three which gave us our answer of
twenty-three I'm glad so now you might
be thinking okay but that makes sense if
you're taking like a basic algebra
course but that's how does that relate
to JavaScript and how does JavaScript
know where where is it getting this
information in operator precedence
like can I assign this to be priority or
you know what is the founding document
well I'm glad you asked because I have
one it's over at the Mozilla developer
Network website I'll leave the link in
the description box and there is a form
a table rather that shows operator
precedence as well as associativity
which we'll get to in a minute but right
now I want to focus on precedence so
this table is ordered from the highest
precedence 22 the lowest precedence 0 so
the highest precedence in all of
JavaScript is grouping you put some
stuff inside parentheses and that thing
gets VIP treatment
let me quickly illustrate what I'm
talking about so 3 plus 4 times 5 is 23
right because this is this takes
precedence it's multiplication operator
but what if we put 3 plus 4 in
parentheses
guys this is VIP status priority okay
priority service because the parentheses
again going back to our little table
takes a 20 that's the highest you can
get so let's go back let's run this and
what do you guys think it's gonna be the
answer to this one now now that I threw
those parentheses in there got your
answer 35 why because of operator
precedence 3 plus 4 is 7 times 5 35 so
let's go back to our little table here
whoopsies our little table and you can
see how helpful this is if you're trying
to debug something or maybe just
understand the theories behind
JavaScript and the methods the
JavaScript engine uses to process logic
and so on so as you see at the very
bottom the poor comma
gets no loves the assignment operators
get a little bit of love as you can see
we have a few the equal sign or the
assignment equal and then we have strict
equality over at number 10 which takes a
little more priority and then again
going all the way to number 20 pretty
sweet but let's say we have something
like this let's start over so we're
gonna move on to associativity operator
precedence again using this table you're
gonna be golden using this table because
it really illustrates the hierarchy of
individual operators and where they are
on the chain let's go back so we'll
start over and we'll go to associativity
so this is all well and good right
pretty straightforward but what if we
had something like oh I don't know two
and then e is gonna be three see he's
gonna be five all right and then we're
gonna say something like real tough
candy is equal to B is equal to C oh my
god I'm already starting to get jammed
what what's going on how these are all
the same operators so now what takes
precedence you can see how this can be a
real cluster F if you don't understand
the underlying methodology and the
execution order of this so with let's
call what's console dot log B and then
we'll console dot log
oopsies console console whoo whoo
getting freaky up in here okay so now we
set all of these equal to each other
right
real tough candy equals B equals C but I
have three different numbers up here and
I'm sensing some sort of train wreck
will this even run let's see so what do
you guys think the answer is gonna be
when I log these three I'll give you a
second to think about it here's a little
hint
the soceity and operator precedence
table is going to be your friend in this
ready
got your answer bowl 5 5 + 5 y
associativity let's go back to our chart
here in our table and here's our
associativity associativity is when two
or more operators have the same
precedence and this is the order in
which they are executed those operators
are executed for example if you have
more than one dot in whatever a function
any kind of JavaScript expression
statement so on it's gonna be executed
left to right whereas if you had
something like an equal sign it beot it
be executed right to left so let's go
back to our equation here so roots of
candy equals B equals C and our
assignment operator down here tells us
it will be executed right to left okay
so we're gonna keep that in mind as we
deconstruct this problem so the first
thing the JavaScript engine did was say
okay starting at the right here is the
rightmost equality operator b2 or equals
operator either B equals C let's just
see what we end up with would be equals
c5 okay so it took B JavaScript the
engine took B and assigned it to C so
this my friends is five and now real
tough candy is equivalent to five D is
equivalent to five C is equivalent to
all right and that is because it was it
was executed from right to left and if
you're ever wondering okay what is gonna
be the result of this so I'm starting on
the right here's the rightmost equation
and they'll tell you right in the
console B equals C JavaScript assigned
this five because C is five just replace
that none this is just for illustration
purposes in the real tough candy is
equal it's also equal to 5 so this
freaking table guys really helpful in
understanding the under-the-hood
components of JavaScript and how things
are executed and understanding this you
don't have to have I mean you don't to
memorize all this stuff that's why we
have a little chart here to help us
through but being familiar with it and
knowing that it exists it's gonna make
your life easier when you're coding
JavaScript and hopefully prevent you
from ripping a freaking face off ooh
thanks guys for watching and we'll see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
