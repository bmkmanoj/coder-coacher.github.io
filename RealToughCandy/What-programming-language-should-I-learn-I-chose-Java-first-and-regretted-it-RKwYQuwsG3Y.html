those words send a chill down your spine
give you the tingles me neither
Java today on the real tough candy
Channel six hundred plus pages of
enlightening information a programmers
guide to Java certification second
edition you know the basic very basic
you might find helpful trying to learn
Java but a year and a half ago I decided
I wanted to get to this coding thing
people were talking about it it was in
the papers I still read the online
versions I know and it was exciting it
sounded really cool like everyone seems
to be doing this except me the cool kids
are talking about it the old schoolers
are like yeah where have you been so I
had to get in the mix like any
self-respecting noob I went to Coursera
I went to you to me and one of the
classes they were promoting was Java
because I didn't know what language to
start with I don't have a mentor I
didn't have anybody guiding me and there
are so many languages out there that
just getting the basic names of them
down and understanding what each of them
roughly does took me a while because I
was debating like okay there see there's
these sharp they're C++ I mean copy
paste paste I mean C++ there's Java
there's Python there's Ruby on Rails
there's Ruby all of these names as a
newbie you don't know what they are you
don't know what they do I don't come
from a programming background I don't
come from a technical background I'm a
creative type I have technical
experience in music and and multimedia
but nothing this hardcore so you know
Java I was attracted to it because first
of all was being promoted on these
course websites and secondly it just
seemed legit like I'd heard of the
language kind of I didn't know what it
did but it sounded fun I guess like Java
okay I know what Java is it's an island
and a good blend of coffee let's do it
like this is the thinking logic of a
newbie without experience in programming
or math you know hardcore mathematics
logic logical thinking etc so I find out
for this java course
and it's going good it's going groovy I
even downloaded sublime text editor like
I didn't even know a text editors what
they did how they worked I saw all those
colors changes of editing like oh my god
I think I like this so I get about
halfway through the course and I'm
looking over all my code all my little
projects you know and I'm like I don't
understand any of this I'm just a little
code monkey and this is this isn't why I
want to do this I wanted to do this so I
could learn how to create things not to
copy and paste things and not to be lost
and just like go to the next lesson so I
get to the halfway point and I'm at a
crossroads I said well I could either
finish out this course or I could start
over or I could quit there were so many
options so I decided to go to a meet-up
a women who code meetup and got some
homework help for my problems and one of
the girls one of the women who had just
graduated from a boot camp was like this
is a beginner course I'm like they said
Java for beginners but I went home that
night and was excited to keep learning
but it just I didn't understand any of
it so I decided to quit that was a few
months later after just like floating
around like cosmonauts
and wondering what language could I
possibly learn that is going to help me
in life like it's not Java here is why
Java is a very heavy language okay it
takes five lines of code at least to
write hello world the very basic program
the first one you're ever going to learn
as a newbie JavaScript on the other hand
one line let me illustrate the
fundamental problem of learning Java as
a beginner now this is your simple
standard hello world program the first
one you'll be learning as a noob I'm
dumb dumb dumb
oops - dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
hmm
that's an L by the way for the first
week I was printing a one okay we're
actually still not done because I did
this in sublime and you should be using
an integrated development environment
like eclipse in IDE
what's an IDE what's an eclipse what's
an integrator doohickey environmental
thing yeah as a newbie you got to learn
all that stuff too and you have to
compile this and you can't run it in
your browser you might be able to run it
in your terminal though let's compare
that same program with JavaScript do
that instantaneous an embedded page of
Google comm says hello world
this one line is functionally the same
thing as this Java program hello world
JavaScript Java JavaScript Java a lot
heavier lot more verbose and the second
thing is that javascript is a lot more
instantaneous and it's a lot funner for
people who have maybe shorter attention
spans or maybe just are overwhelmed by a
lot of information at once because that
alert box yeah it streams 2001 but it's
pretty cool that you can get our
computer type one line of code one line
only little parenthesis here a little
quote in an alert and you can get that
instantaneous feedback with Java good
luck dude you'll be balls deep for three
months trying to get anything to work if
you are a newbie and you're not
naturally excelling at math and logical
thinking don't do Java you can try it
give it a whirl I'm not saying don't try
it but Java is so difficult for
like me because there's a lot let me
tell you something else in Java if you
turn on a light switch your toilet
flushes and you'll be looking at that
code for weeks maybe a month trying to
figure out what the hell went wrong with
JavaScript there is a robust community
people are very excited like when I
started getting the JavaScript let me
tell you something the reason I didn't
initially go into JavaScript one of the
reasons was because everybody was doing
it I'm not going to jump on this
bandwagon everyone's doing JavaScript
please I want to be cool I'm doing Java
it's a heavy language I'm going to show
everybody that I am tops on my game like
no and I settled with JavaScript and I
loved it I loved learning JavaScript
because one of the reasons is that it's
so creative and it's it's instantaneous
you can create apps very quickly and you
can understand the code much better than
you can with an object oriented
programming language class-based
object-oriented programming language
like Java to summarize Java is difficult
Java is not as creative and
instantaneous and rewarding as
JavaScript one thing that really bubbles
my mind is these coding boot camps that
offer Java as a basic back-end
programming language like I said if you
are a naturally talented person in geek
fields you probably won't have a problem
but for someone like me who doesn't
think like that who has to push herself
to think like a programmer doesn't come
naturally for me I have to think about
it continuously Java is not a good
choice C sharps that I get choice Perl
is not a good choice try it you'll see
what I mean thanks for watching guys
we'll see you the next video stay tuned
