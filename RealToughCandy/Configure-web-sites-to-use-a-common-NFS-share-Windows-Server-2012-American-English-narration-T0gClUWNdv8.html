candy from real tough candy come back in
the saddle with you today welcome back
to part two of my video series on
implementing a business continuity plan
now this plan is going to be implemented
if there's some kind of disaster or some
kind of continuity issue where your
stuffs are broken I mean insert bad
event here now this is why that is
exactly why you would need a business
continuity plan so I'm gonna be using my
own documentation provided to me by my
theoretical boss I have my little steps
here gonna be going through your
documentation of course is going to vary
but hopefully this will shed some light
on how to do what we're gonna do today
we just configured two web servers to
use a common NFS share for web content
so that sounds a little gobbledygook E
but I think by the end of this lab
you're going to understand what we're
doing here so I'm on a virtual machine
right now this is Windows Server 2012 my
last video we installed Windows Server
backup and we also configure that to
make a daily backup of Active Directory
now that sounds overwhelming as well but
actually there was a lot of popups a lot
of just you know menus and the graphical
user interface was pretty much in your
face this one however this lab today is
more command-line so you might need to
pay a little more attention to this part
the windows install that that server
backup was like I said the the GUI was
on point and there wasn't a lot of
details you could accidentally miss type
or something like that as compared to
gee so we are gonna be configuring
redundant web servers called ww1 and ww2
which you can see right here right yeah
or to use an NFS on a third storage
server which is going to be that storage
label right here for web content now NFS
was originally used in the UNIX
operating system back in the day but
it's was originally used to make remote
folders appear like they were part of
the local filesystem on Linux
and even Windows systems so let's get a
visual representation
oops of what these servers look like so
we're gonna go over to ww1 using
Internet Explorer for some weird reason
on my documentation not my first choice
of browser but hey I don't get paid
enough to complain about it and still
keep my job so we're gonna go ww1 secure
labs on demand comm so this is just to
illustrate you know what we're working
with and we're gonna go to ww2 now so
there's a standalone ecommerce site and
some graphic here and this is www - now
you may notice a pattern here everything
is the same except this title up here
that's because www - is a clone this web
server is a copy of the www one web
server so that's an important point to
note as we're working today in this lab
so we're gonna go ahead and exit out of
there and now we're gonna go this is our
remote desktop file folder and we are
gonna connect
we're gonna have some putty sessions so
we are going to go ahead and just open
up these three four three putty sessions
and we're gonna be dealing with them
systematically let's open up this first
session here on ww1 oops we are going to
trust this host this is a trustworthy
host and accept that security alert and
we're gonna do the same thing for ww2
yeah and then we are gonna have we're
gonna make a remote connection to our
third server good this is our storage
server for the web content these three
connections are going to help us
configure the redundant web servers
which is ww1 and ww2 to use an NFS on
this storage server for web content okay
so now what we're gonna do is we are
going to go ahead and go to our storage
putty session
okay so we're there on our storage putty
session and we're gonna go ahead we were
on route awesome good to know we're
gonna go ahead and print our working
directory just to see where we are we're
at route we're gonna go ahead and change
our directory to forward slash and etc
and then we're going to open up the
export file and that's going to open up
through VI so we're gonna go ahead and
open that up boom okay so all of this
might look a little overwhelming right
now especially because we're in the
command-line there's not that that
graphical user interface to guide us
through but so this is where your
documentation is critical where you
might have to mind your P's and Q's
because anything altered in these files
is going to affect the final output and
it could possibly really jack up your
stuff so I'm gonna be very careful with
what I'm reading here in my
documentation so I need to go down here
to the last hash symbol it's this we
call it a pound sign here Tamara crab
but most of us know that this is the
hash symbol so in VI it's a little
different I cannot use a delete key here
on my keyboard you can hear me like
furiously mashing on it right now
nothing's happening so what you can do
to delete one character in the VI editor
is hover over what you want to delete so
so I want to delete that hash tag which
is a comment symbol so we want to I want
to uncomment this line right here this
VAR /ww want to uncomment that thing but
I can't delete it so I'm just going to
simply hover over it and hit the X key
boom so the line I just uncommented here
this is important because even though
all I did was delete a hash symbol so
when I deleted that it's now instructing
Linux to share this this var /ww and all
of these are options for example you can
see this little this what do you call
this little asterisk so that's a
wild-card and that means any IP can
connect to ww and then RW or yeah RW is
rewrite read/write access root squash
sounds delicious I don't think it's
edible it prevents the root from
creating files with root privileges sync
synchronizes local or remote directories
no subtree check I had no idea what that
is but no subtree check will not export
subdirectories and then finally we have
the cross mount oops it's a little
difficult with this web server
highlighting in real-time cross mount
allows multiple client mounts in multi
file system mounting you learn something
every day don't you so we're gonna go
ahead and get out of the VI editor and
to do that it's kind of a weird command
it's calling W Q exclamation and then
you go ahead and hit return and that
will get out of the vi editor and we're
back to our main putty session on
storage so we're gonna go ahead now and
we're out of again we're out of the VI
we're back to our main connection here
and we're gonna go ahead and type
forward slash it cetera forward slash
initialization which is I niche dot d
ford slash
NFS - colonel curd nerd that every time
kernel forward slash server restart now
this command is going to restart the NF
NFS server on storage dot secure labs on
demand as you can see we're still in
that putty session so again the command
is /etc /i and i t dot d /n FS - colonel
- server space restart will go ahead
fire that up ok we get four okay's we
are good to go
let's see what we have to do next
according to my documentation so that's
all restarted restore the NFS server
everything's ok and now we're gonna go
ahead and just type exit to get we're
gonna close this storage putty session
here okay
so now we're gonna go to ww1 and we're
gonna be messin not messin hopefully
something a little more targeted than
just messing around we're gonna be going
back to the VI editor
to edit some stuff in the in a different
file so we're gonna go ahead and let's
see where we are right now we're at
routes so we're gonna go ahead and
change directory again to etc we are on
at cetera so now we're gonna go ahead
and type VI we're gonna open up that VI
editor and we're gonna type an FS tab
now this FS tab or fstab stands for a
system stable and what we're gonna do
we're gonna uncomment some more stuff so
we're going to uncomment this last line
down here so what this FS what this FS
stabbed RF stab does it instructs the
Linux system which files to mount on
startup so the line we're about to
uncomment this is gonna tell this is
gonna now tell ww1 to mount this wm4 /
VAR forward slash www directory now I
know this sounds confusing but so think
back to the directory I just exported in
our our putty session with the storage
putty session you know I uncommented
that last line there so I exported that
and now the line I'm uncommenting right
now is telling ww1 to mount that on
storage secure labs.com as /var forward
slash www locally a lot of stuff here if
it sounds confusing it's because it is
if you'd like excuse me pause the video
and read this blue box here this also
may help you hopefully this will be
illustrated a lot better once we
actually get going with this so I'm just
gonna go and continue on I probably
obfuscated more than I helped the past
minute and a half trying to explain that
so what we're gonna do oh where are we
let's go back to w w w one you need to
uncomment that last line yep go ahead
and again can't hit delete in the VI
editor so we're gonna go ahead and click
X and then this one is acting a little
wonky but
we want to get out of there regardless
when I do : WQ exclamation and that gets
us out of the VI editor with that and
we're back on our home screen and now
we're gonna do this excuse me holy
buckets we're gonna do the same thing on
ww2 we're going to go ahead and change
our directory to etc the ifs tab we're
gonna go down here and uncomment this
last line again so we can do some
mounting teehee teehee okay so now I'm
gonna get out of here WQ exclamation
boom and we're back on our main potty
connection there as well so now we have
configured both a ww1 and ww2 to use the
same NFS folder on the storage server
okay that's basically what getting rid
of that hashtag did pretty
straightforward well not really not
gonna lie it can be very confusing just
fall when in doubt follow your
documentation to the tee and don't be
afraid to bother your supervisor if
something doesn't make sense
trust me the person's not gonna fire you
for asking questions so we're gonna go
ahead and reboot this web server here
through our putty connection all we have
to do is type or boot and we're gonna go
boom the system is going down for reboot
now server unexpectedly closed network
connection so actually I have I got fair
warning that this would happen this
fatal error right here my documentation
so we're just gonna say okay to close
that fatal pop-up error so rebooting
enabled us to have the changes take
effect so we're gonna go ahead this
session was terminated and we're gonna
do the same thing here it's gonna give
us another error here as you reboot the
system is going down for me Wow
so as that rebooted we
that fatal error and that is just to
find that it's okey-dokey with me and
it's okey dokey for my connection so now
what we're gonna do we're gonna go ahead
and get on a job we're gonna repeat our
steps up here to see exactly if this is
an effect so we're gonna go to w1 dot
secure look at that guy's it freaking
work
look how freaking cool that looks let's
go to www.un.org/webcast
here is changed as well pretty freakin
cool okay so we have done that now in
the next video we are gonna be using
Windows to back up the common FS s and s
n FS j tbz
the common NFS share I hope this video
was helpful I know there are some
confusing parts in there but once you
get to the final product you can
actually see the purpose of uncommenting
those lines and how that took effect on
our redundant web servers so I hope
you'll join me for part 3 where we're
gonna be using Windows to backup the
common FS NFS share if I can ever
freaking pronounce it we're gonna have
some PowerShell I action cannot speak
you PKA gonna sign off thanks for
watching guys we'll see in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
