and dirty tech tutorial on Photoshop for
your tech business today on the real
candy channel the dial is not in service
perfect time
hey everybody how's it going to RealSelf
candy from yourself can calm back in the
saddle with you today
shout out to two of my newer subscribers
digital jazz and Dan Ellis really blown
up the comments section this week with
the quality comment thank you guys for
adding you know your experiences and
your thoughts on some of the videos
makes the channel a little less
voyeuristic when people are commenting
like you guys do is I really do
appreciate it today's video is a request
video by theory eight one six this
person asked last week can you do a
video on the actual printing of the
cards this is in regards to my video on
every door direct mail as far as whoa
woohoo getting clients and web
development that aren't friends or
family using the USPS if that all sounds
Greek to you and you're not Greek I
think I'm going to be leaving that video
somewhere on the screen for you to check
out to get up to speed
for what we're doing today this is going
to be a video plus because my actual
video answering this question is going
to be about five seconds the actual
printing of the cards I take to a local
printer and I do it in person now you
probably maybe have seen vistaprint or
visa print whatever i've ordered from
these people before this is a very
popular online printing company I
haven't really been impressed with the
quality of their printing yeah I ordered
some business cards and I just I won't
go back to them not going to lie maybes
had better experiences so I'm not going
to walk you through how to do this or
any other online printer because I don't
go through online I do it in person just
to make sure we're on the same page
because you know if you don't get proofs
of your work physically and you know a
proof is just like a prototype to make
sure everything looks good in the
dimensions and Vistaprint or whoever is
sending you 5,000 of your mailers and
they're not what you wanted they don't
give refunds on that you have to eat
that cost and that sucks so I do it in
person at my local printer I make sure
we're on the same page and I get a proof
I did
prototype of the actual thing that
they're going to be printing and if that
doesn't match the prototype at the end
product doesn't match that prototype
that proof it's on them because proofs
in the pudding you guys like that you
like that so that is my actual video on
printing of the cards do not try to
print them at home that's going to look
at all you know unless you're a
full-fledged printing press go to a
professional printer because you want to
put your best foot forward that's that
part of this request video the actual
development and creation of the cards is
what's going to be this five-minute
creation phase today so this is what we
have to do there is one critical
component that we have to have for an
EDD M mailer again if you don't know
what I'm talking about just watch the
video it's painless it's only a few it's
an eight-minute video you can probably
skip and peck and choose to get up to
speed so this is the stamp we will be
needing to use go ahead and right click
if you're following along Google EDDM
stamp save that somewhere or you could
do something like this I use this one if
you're confused on either of any of
these ask your postal clerk asked your
postmaster or your carrier sometimes
might know the postmaster is the go-to
person though a lot of people at the
window will know too the other thing I
want to mention is that there is
limitations in dimensions of your design
for e GD M so it looks like the maximum
is 15 inches long or 12 inches high or
0.75 inches thick you guys can read over
the specs sheet I'll put that in the
description box okay
so we're working with two little
requirements we have our spec sheet and
we have an EDD M stamp the rest is up to
us so the other thing I do want to
mention is that going back to that
printing press thing is that you don't
want to be messing with wonky creative
designs like I want to be point six
eight inches thick and then 7.25 inches
tall in them and four point seven six
nine inches wide like stick to something
standard seven inches long by five
inches tall is a a postcard a handbill
size even which
you know you can even go smaller let's
see if I have something here for like
standard postcard size let's just go
over this quick so you guys can see
postcard size maybe can help us design
our tool box postcard sizes I'll put
this in the description box as well we
have a six by four and a quarter seven
by five
I like the seven five five they're nice
and big but they can also fit on
refrigerator and that's also a critical
component when you're doing eddm you're
not going to get a lot of calls right
away
people stick these things on the
refrigerator ok enough blabbering real
tough candy do you ever shut up
just let's go over to photoshop to
design this EDDM for printing okay so
I'm going to start my timer for five
minutes
doink if it goes off pool is not well
decline mr. Bertie okay so we're in
Photoshop CC I'm gonna say closed
caption let's go ahead and doing a
project we're going to call this EDDM
custom with seven inches height is five
perfect 300 pixels per inch RGB color
that's just fine
anything you change this you can always
change it afterwards too that's a little
too big I'm going to get command - I'm
on a Mac so here is our blank slate I
have a few minutes to design this four
and a half minutes so I'm going to go
over to Creative Cloud Files let's find
some good pictures here okay that's
probably not what I'm looking for
there's our eddm stamp blue okay we can
do something that's probably not what
about this girl okay then cool now you
want to keep these things cagey the
Postal Service is not you know Triple X
friendly probably knew that this
cleavage I probably in the end put some
text over it or something just to keep
it PG PG or people call that cheap let's
find our EDM stamp this is critical so
okay I'm going to hit command key to
transform I'm going to hit shift and
resize this it doesn't have to be any
standard size it just has to be visible
for the carrier to let them know that
you're not stealing this
and you actually key for it and the self
speedy person at the counter ring you up
because they know it's the EDM that
party is looking good
she's a hit okay great but this is for a
tech business but why do you have this
open source black cat character running
around on your card good question so I
saw this picture here what am i at three
and a half minutes okay we're going to
go like this we're going to go shift
transform it just a little wider than an
actual thing we're going to go with that
okay and then I'm going to go right
click blending options and blend that in
a little bit see we're going to blend
her down to we're going to tip her down
hold on that opacity computer design
okay and that right now you might be
thinking okay that's great you have one
side why don't we do two sides two sides
are expensive you can do one color side
and one black and white and we're going
to do is resize that I'm going to go
command - - I don't know you don't have
to be a superhero in flyover country you
guys like that you guys get it in so lie
over country okay I'm going to make this
about 90 percent complete of course
there are some tweaks here this is not
going to be total may already I have two
minutes holy crap so this is my black
and white side my cook you know people
get in their mailbox like you don't have
to be a superhero in flyover country but
they were in Kansas okay let's flip it
over bauble superhero web development
this is the name of our company and the
two rules for a fast and dirty mailer
don't make it with cheesy it's too
cheesy don't make it look outdated is
what I meant and also always have a call
to action everything else can be
negotiated if you're doing it fast and a
dirty like this I have a minute and a
half
holy crap okay I need a stroke I need a
stroke that's not a gross let's go
little small
okay I need to bring this layer up here
so it's on top
superhero web development like the size
of that stroke though I need to scale
that down a little bit let's go to 8 and
we're going to bump this up let's see
what else can i do what else can I do
alright we are at in a minute and a half
and I also need to bump up that
superhero web development ok I'd
probably change the text of this but
I'll just put this right here actually I
don't like that on two lines okay what
am i doing I'm getting totally jammed
I'm jamming my own self okay let's go to
EDM I have 69 seconds to do this what
else do we do we do web development we
do android android and iOS development
they have 44 seconds oh my gosh
am I going to do this I don't know guys
okay let's go call today to get your
project slide yeah it's cheesy but you
know what people like cheese as long as
it you're not overdoing it I have 26
seconds okay um it's going to be 8 8 8 8
8 8 8 8 I don't have an email yes I do
I have 15 seconds to do this oh my god
ok 8 8 8 superhero at gmail.com yeah
okay cool great this meets with stroke
to it you guys this is 2 seconds left oh
my god I'm totally busted this isn't
something that's mail ready guys but you
get the idea you can put whatever you
want in this section as long as you have
a call to action you want people to get
hold of you because you want their
business what can you offer you know
there might be somebody in your city
who's doing the same darn thing how are
you different might not be a bad idea to
put that in your eddm some of the things
I'll quickly go over you need to have
this pre-sorted standard eddm retail
visible um you know put
in the upper right hand corner that's
easiest I don't think that's a standard
but that's what people are used to
seeing again you can do one side black
and white this could be color this could
be any design if you're doing two-sided
this could be blank but it's a real
unfortunate waste of from you know real
estate doing only one side just maybe
just go for black and white you could do
a picture even you guys get the idea I
took two elements that relate to the
superhero web development company the
chick with cleavage I need to cover her
up with some text and the computer you
know putting stroke the stroke is a
really good effect okay I'm not going to
bore you guys with this this is the
starch I say we're about 80% there guys
as long as you have some tweaks get your
call-to-action
get your EDDM stamp stuck on there again
EDDM is the best kept secret in the
United States Postal Service there's a
lot of things I can complain about with
the Postal Service but this is a great
inexpensive way to establish yourself to
be more valid and to be legit okay
everyone starting out in this stuff
there they're struggling with this I
know I am you know putting your foot
down be like I'm not a goober yeah I yuk
it up but I can do really serious really
good work don't believe me here's my
portfolio here's my eddm that looks good
again I thought this isn't ready to ship
out but you guys get some really good
ideas hope this video was helpful thanks
for watching again if you want to know
about the printing process the best
thing that I have learned to do do it in
person stay away from what these
printing companies online some of their
printing products really suck you know
that's just my experience all right guys
thanks for watching hey buy me a cup of
coffee if you dug this video god knows I
don't need any more but I love it
patreon.com slash real tough candy if
not that's cool too because I look
forward to seeing you in the next video
