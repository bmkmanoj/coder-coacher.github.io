this web development interview job
because I want this job and I want these
guys to know that this job's important
to me I'm gonna get home and tell you
all about how it went today on the real
tough candy Channel this is the reason I
drove seven hours one way to a web
developer interview they wanted someone
who knows view
I know react they want someone who knows
db2 I know MySQL they want someone who
knows composer I use NPM they want
someone who knows object-oriented PHP I
know object-oriented JavaScript they
want someone who knows API Jilla T app
agility I don't know I use postman every
one of my qualifications was just one
teeny tiny mark away from what they were
looking for if I put forth this little
teeny bit of effort actually a lot of
bit of effort you know seven hours one
way is kind of long maybe they'll just
look past the fact that I'm one-off
maybe I don't know but it's worth giving
a shot so I gave it a shot and I was
very honest I said you know this tech
stack is something that I really haven't
used before in production and just
toying around with I have never heard of
this DB - what the heck is this thing
what what's wrong with my sequel I mean
seriously and view
oh you think there's no view jobs out
there all future projects at this place
will be developed in view to give some
perspective I believe Baltimore - Boston
is about seven hours let's just make
sure by the time they get through the
traffic it's about seven hours I told
these guys look I'm coming from out of
town I'm gonna be staying in a hotel
I'll meet you you know Friday afternoon
whatever I left on a Thursday night get
there and they were cool with it they're
really excited to see me and the
interview was with three people it was
candy meets the company and gets
interviewed by the company the company
owner the senior developer and a third
guy I don't know if he was like a
ba or what his actual role is might have
been a network guy I'm not really sure
but he'd ask he asked me questions as
well the interview itself went very well
and I felt good about it they weren't
they were really cool guys and they
listened to what I had to say I listened
to what they had to say the company was
interesting and by the time that
interview was over I wanted to work for
that company and the owner of the
company went over my resume everybody at
that table had a copy of my resume in my
cover letter that was a little
intimidating but I was ready for it I
mean I wrote him you know I should be
able to explain them and talk about him
and everything I put on my resume and my
cover letter is true so it wasn't like I
yeah my SQ penguin yeah I know what that
is like everything I wrote on there
let's go to my cover letter everything I
wrote on here is true long story short I
followed up with this company a few days
after the interview they said they're
gonna be getting back to me soon I got a
job offer but there's a twist I didn't
like the numbers I was hearing Tom I'm
gonna redo another video on that salary
negotiation because I have been
engineering this thing for months not
just this interview but other interviews
and getting him overlapping so that I
have competing offers couple weeks ago I
did a video on a technical interview
with a different company and so I had
that going on I had other offers coming
in I was talking with companies who were
you know putting out some pretty good
numbers but the company just wasn't
there or you know just something just
wasn't as appealing as this job that I
went to go interview with and this
company I traveled seven hours to I let
them know they were my top pick
I wasn't brown-nosing because you know I
don't work there I don't know what the
real environment is like but from what I
saw the projects they're working on the
direction the company is going in I said
I'm all about it I think I can add a lot
of value to your company the owner
seemed to like that to messages for
anyone who made it this far in the video
firstly when you put yourself out there
good things will happen people pay
attention to people who work hard you
don't have to be a
brain surgeon and web development to get
hired put forth that effort
I believe driving there being there in
person rather than a phone call or a
video call put me ahead of the pack
I don't know this stack I've been
studying it for the past couple weeks
before I start the job putting forth
that effort automatically puts you ahead
of I don't know 80% 90% of the pack guys
most people out there just want a job
and aren't hungry for it people who are
subscribed to this channel subscribe to
coding phases channel and a few others
out there they're hungry for jobs
they're hungry to learn and they're
hungry to prove themselves I'm telling
you I'm proof I'm proof that if you put
yourself out there people pay attention
to that second message if you find a job
opening that looks right on but it's not
quite aligning with what you're doing
hey do it anyway because a lot of this
stuff is just syntactical ok
object-oriented PHP is not that much
different than object-oriented
JavaScript yeah yeah yeah
syntax JavaScript the weird parts I get
it but once you have the basics of
programming down adding this on to your
text stack is not nearly as difficult as
adding this on to your text stack when
you're first starting out once you start
getting to the groove of basic
programming basic web development adding
stuff on like composer API agility
however you freaking pronounce it I
don't know DB to view you name it
acquisition of these skills is a lot
easier a lot easier wing verses when
you're first starting out I hope this
video was inspirational guys get out
there and get those jobs they're waiting
for you put yourself out there I'm
telling you I'm living proof like I said
you try hard people pay attention
they're gonna want you on their team
thanks for watching we'll see you the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
