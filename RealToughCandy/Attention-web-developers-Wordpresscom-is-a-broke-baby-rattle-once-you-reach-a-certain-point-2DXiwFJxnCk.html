an attempt at being funny for the intro
for these videos but I just realized
that I've been live streaming for the
past 13 minutes repeating the same two
lines over and over doing my OCD okay
folks you guys our relationship now just
went like from here to here maybe like
up here and start the video
anyways today's its topic oh transgender
rewind when everyone shout out to the
one-two combo punch of Cody phase and
Michael Thomas to hugely influential
people on YouTube that I get motivation
from daily they both visited this
channel this weekend you guys are
freaking awesome thanks so much for the
support watching the videos giving your
opinions and even quoting says he
mentioned me why these newer videos I
was like dang ok it was pretty awesome
and it was definitely a motivation so
thank you today's topic is WordPress
WordPress comm and wordpress.org now
when I first started this out about 7
months ago I'm talking about the whole
entrepreneurship web development it's
not really developed it wasn't
development back then it was more like
design and let's be honest it was more
like choose and click it was like just
add water web assembly so this is
wordpress.com and I reserve my domain
name it was like a boxy or whatever and
I said ok how am I going to host this
because I don't know anything about web
development I know very little what's
going to be the easiest way to get me
going oh I've heard a lot about
WordPress let's pick something on
WordPress so you know went to
wordpress.com and you know I'm on the
premium plan here which is like 8
dollars and 95 cents a month billed
yearly because I was some taken in by
the marketing because they said oh it's
good for entrepreneurs and self-starters
freelancers etc here's the big problem
with this wordpress.com
it was designed as a blogging tool and
it will always be designed for bloggers
so if you're trying to go
you know buckwild a wordpress
komm it's not going to work because the
only thing the only under the herd the
functionality you get is when first of
all you pay 825 for a premium plant or
it's like 24.95 for a VIP plan only then
after you pay that $100 because pay
advance hundred-dollar see or 250
whatever you will get access to this
little CSS box this little CSS box is
your window to your world in your
webpage now you can already see the
limitations of this CSS box because
first of all is very dinky second of all
if you want to target and the element or
anything like that you have to go into
your web browsers inspector yeah this is
Safari I know but you guys get the idea
they whether it's Google Chrome Firefox
whatever they all have inspectors and
look a little something like this
so if I wanted to target a certain
element I would have to dig through here
and to be honest I'm not really
confident in looking through all of this
knowing how to fetch something in
particular like oh I just want to make
this one a rainbow gradient instead of
like all the h1s and h2s how do I do
that
I don't know so that is a big
inconvenience and you don't get it you
don't get access to any kind of raw data
like the index.html any JavaScript file
for you to download everything that
they're giving you is going to be half
it will have to be fetched by you going
to be honest I'm losing motivation sighs
a minute to find everything I want to
tweak and put in the CSS file and also
to I'll save and publish it but it
doesn't save my changes I don't know of
course I'm doing something wrong not
quite sure what so that's the CSS thing
with wordpress.org good which is this
guy the only rewind for a minute because
I thought wordpress.org was just like
the parent company of wordpress.com
wordpress.org is what web developers are
talking about when they say we develop
using WordPress or we use WordPress to
make website whatever verbiage they're
using
because with wordpress.org is a whole
different game because what you do is
you download WordPress you find your own
hosting and you do your dancing you can
incorporate whatever you want because
all the files are yours WordPress helps
you get there but as far as hosting and
doing things your ways it's on you and
that was the mistake I made maybe it
wasn't a mistake but as a newbies you
know Everett 0.14 5 years old or 20 or
40 or 60 years old rattles are a little
inconvenient and they're kind of
annoying because they're always making
noise and blathering on
that's what wordpress.com is in my life
right now because it's a great place a
great thing for a certain sector of
people but as a developer man I can't
work use wordpress.com come on not even
as a designer you're just assembling
things and not even a smart way because
unlike bootstrap templates at least you
can tweak the bootstrap template not
true with wordpress.com WordPress
AdWords or word ass I don't know what
they call them
they don't work I tried them on my
website and I'm getting like Marie
Callender's frozen dinner videos on some
of my posts I'm like you're going to
advertise at least advertise something
I'll eat like I'd rather eat a radiator
that's neither here nor there the point
being you cannot add any affiliate
program because a lot of times - you
need access to the head section of your
HTML to put that cookie thingy one
situation where I do use wordpress.com
is with clients who don't know how to
use the Internet and they're not saying
that in a condescending way but a lot of
people don't understand the internet
they don't understand they don't
understand updates and all that which is
totally fine I mean it's definitely a
specialized skill with wordpress.com
when you give the instructions to your
client on how to use it it's pretty
straightforward
after I design a website on WordPress
calm for a client I'll send them an
email or go to their place of business
for a half hour to
train them on how to use it so you know
you're not getting phone calls and
emails for the next year and a half like
oh my god my sites broken or whatever
it's hard to break wordpress.com because
it's so straightforward bottom line if
you're a web developer maybe you want to
think about going wordpress.org and
doing your own thing as opposed to
wordpress.com be careful of the premium
promises and the business promises
because you only still get access to CSS
and it's very very difficult to CSS that
because the box is small and you have to
find the individual tags and stuff the
one time it is a good selection perhaps
is we not clients who don't really
understand the internet and they look
good I mean let's go you guys have
immediate perhaps in my websites real
Jeff candy calm this is what the website
looks like I mean this looks good right
hey I probably couldn't have designed
this I'm not completely dissatisfied but
again it's just like that rattle when
you're at your zero they're entertaining
but once you get to a certain point you
move on and I think as a web developer
this is exciting because I'm beginning
to see the limitations let me know what
you guys are using are you guys on
wordpress.com or you guys want
wordpress.org what do you think of
wordpress.org because honestly I haven't
used it yet
I'm excited to but I've only heard tell
and how hard is that migration if you
have gone from calm to wordpress.org to
the open source thing guys thanks for
watching a special shout out to people
who have watched my scandalous live
streams my inadvertent live streams you
guys are the best thanks for watching
we'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
