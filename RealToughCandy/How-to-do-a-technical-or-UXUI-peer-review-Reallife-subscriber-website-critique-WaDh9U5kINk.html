guys doing thanks for stopping by
today's video I'm super excited about my
subscriber Eric asked if I would
critique his website so that he could
improve the look and feel of it
first of all York I would love to second
of all thank you for letting me do a
video out of this I asked Eric if I
could do a video because I think it can
help a lot of people did a lot of peer
reviews in a previous life so this is
gonna be exciting and again thanks Eric
it takes a lot of courage for you to put
yourself out like this and to put your
website out to the world for the sake of
improving first things first we're gonna
go over to this website in just a minute
but I want to introduce to you the
metric I use the sheet rather the
heuristics the ten usability heuristics
for user interface design now this is a
list of criteria that I use to assess
websites and other creative works the
reason I use this is because number one
it is considered the gold standard in
evaluating user interface and number two
if it was just me going over someone's
website it would be a subjective just
like oh I really like this font great
job that isn't helpful and that isn't a
review that's just someone telling you
what they think there is a very big
difference so if someone asks you to do
a review please use some sort of metric
or some sort of checklist or you know
standardization or or a standard best
practice whatever where you can match
your critique points like okay I like
this font this is why it matches the
system in the real world or whatever one
other thing before we get started this
is a biggie please don't take the peer
reviews personal they're not a personal
attack they're designed to improve your
product any reviewer who makes personal
attacks or says rude things to you
they're unprofessional amongst many
other things please don't take it
personal I've seen people who started
crying after a review because the
reviewer is just tactless or you know
said things in a very glib way before I
hop into the actual critique let me just
say this is such a breath of fresh air
from WordPress and bootstrap I feel like
I'm in a basement in the 90s with the
x-files in the background I'm about to
do some serious hacking some serious
script Kitty egg and honestly when I was
looking at it last night I was I was
hanging around exploring the website and
seeing what was going on let's go to the
heuristic sheet and see what we got
going on there's a few in particular I
wanted to touch upon match between the
system in the real world the system
should speak the users as language with
words phrases and concepts familiar to
the user follow real-world conventions
making information appear in a natural
and logical order now where I think you
did this really well is right here
because you tell a story without going
on and on and if it's a web developer or
anybody into computers they're gonna
understand what what this is and it
tells a story of how you made this
website with all the tech that you used
I just think this is a very good
application of speaking the users is
language in more ways than one very good
job with that
we have flexibility and efficiency of
use accelerators unseen by the novice
user may often speed up the interaction
for the expert user such of the system
can cater to both inexperienced and
experienced users allow users to tailor
frequent actions well for me it because
of a web developer on YouTube this I
consider an accelerator for advanced
users because I recognize this
immediately now people who don't go to
YouTube for web development aren't can
recognize coding phase coding
Commander's real tough candy in the real
tough candy bonus a oh they're not gonna
recognize that but because you catered
it to more advanced users a web
developers who are on YouTube and even
people who are just curious for YouTube
information about development they're
probably gonna recognize one of these at
least coding phase
he's getting popular so good job with
their natural and logical language that
you used here just very good application
of that and then your accelerator
section down here is is on point as well
I'm gonna go to one more and then what
does not complain English aesthetic and
minimalist design dialogue should not
contain information which is irrelevant
or rarely needed every extra unit of
information in a dialogue competes with
the relevant units of information and
diminishes their relative visibility in
other words for every little bit of
information that you add here it's
subtracting from something else so one
easy way to address that heuristic is by
eliminating redundancy and I did notice
that down here you welcomed us twice
welcome to the spark one labs 3d
application code welcome to spark 1 labs
my web development portfolio etc I would
try to combine these or it maybe just
get rid of this altogether now when I
first logged on these buttons were here
to guide me so I said Oh
PHP maybe those are some PHP projects
and it looks like you know PHP like a
PHP book a JavaScript book here then I
checked out the web GL button and this
looks like one of your projects I'm not
sure if it is but maybe consider adding
some context like I was talking about
yesterday on my video on portfolios you
know give a little bit of context if
possible with like a modal pop-up or
those are kind of annoying but maybe
just like a I don't know a little box
here if possible
I don't know how WebGL works and if
that's even doable but maybe just you
know a little note somewhere I'm
explaining it this is your work and the
work you put in to create that because
that doesn't look like it's something
that's easily coded or created give
yourself give yourself credit give
yourself a lot of credit for your work
you have an art tab with your drawings
here
spaceships and superheroes and people
who have messed you up and nothing twice
about it I was like right on and WebGL
fluid dynamics takes you to a YouTube
video the thing that was a little
frustrating for me as a user was that I
didn't know where exactly I was going it
was kind of like a mystery door like
okay this is this is for documentation
and books this is for possibly a project
this is for your arch witch
I'd like to see a little bit more
description on each one like PHP books
that I enjoy WebGL projects my art my
Facebook page my blog and then maybe
WebGL fluid dynamics intro YouTube video
or something and then also assess which
ones really need to be up here I think
one of the things on your site Eric is
that you're doing a lot of stuff you're
doing a lot of cool stuff but the
organization just isn't there so I would
recommend thinking about the structure
it can be by order of importance it can
be chronological it all depends on how
you want that to go I can't guide you
further on that that's that's up to you
as far as the actual links go like I
said you're doing a lot of cool stuff
and I think it should be highlighted
there but there are some inconsistencies
in your layouts inconsistencies and your
colors and graphics if you can
standardize these in some way that would
be really helpful when I went to click
on this I thought I was on a different
website just because this was a very
different font very different colors a
different layout than all the rest then
you have some dead links here too so I
would suggest also once you figure out
the structure that you want try thinking
about an overarching theme or color
palette or two or three fonts and just
work on standardizing the look in the
layout of these pages that also goes for
down here too you have some cool colors
going on but going back to the
heuristics for some users and for a lot
of people different colors mean
different things and different
functionality I'd recommend looking into
a color palette site or other color
match or where you can take one color
like this nice dark blue it's nice it's
nice on the eyes not straining at all a
welcome relief to all these sites that
are like glaringly white but take one
color and then use that color palette
and/or color program to to find three or
four more colors that complement same
goes with the font face - you want to
try and standard standardize those as
much as possible I know you have there's
one here there's a different one here
this is different you also have a few
links down here and this I don't know if
you did this or not but I think this
needs to be prioritized
this thing is cool your 3d graphics I
think really need to be highlighted
I would definitely feature this program
more to the top of the page because it
really is kind of buried in there and
once you work out your organization you
don't have to have these this is just
explaining all this is explaining what
those buttons are right generally don't
want to do that you want your buttons to
be self-explanatory or at least explain
themselves inside the button and rather
than have a graph I'd be like this is
what this graphic does so that you could
once you figure that out you could just
get rid of all of this stuff your
mailing address author name phone great
stuff to have but should be in a footer
the mysterious info nodes again because
I'm an accelerated user on the site I
know what they are most of your users
might not know what mysterious info
nodes is so maybe put an English
translation in parenthesis and also
these I would put under here as well
just for a better flow better layout and
then one final thing I think I would
work on making this site responsive it
does respond but then we have some
overlapping graphics right here over the
text you can use a lot of things to work
on that media queries there's something
like God forbid bootstrap
skeleton all-in-all Eric I think you are
doing some really cool stuff and I think
just working on your organization of
this site is really gonna help people
understand what you're all about and by
organization I mean prioritizing things
that you want people to see
standardizing your fonts and your colors
making it flow for your audience making
it responsive and just some general
housekeeping stuff you know there's a
few dead links here I'm sure you know
about I won't go over those you probably
know exactly where they are just stuff
like that to give your page a pride of
ownership I am gonna include this link
because it's very helpful as you can see
written in 1995 a classic an absolute
must for reviewers and just a great tool
to guide you everything I talked about
today can be traced back to the ten
usability heuristics for user interface
design to try and make it a less
subjective analysis so I hope this was
helpful Eric thank you again for letting
me go over your site and like I said
with some organization retool
and just taking some time out to think
about how you want to prioritize your
endeavors I think you're gonna have a
great website thanks everybody for
watching hope this video was helpful and
we will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
