remotely I feel like I've had I feel
like I've been very lucky and I've
actually had a lot of opportunity to
work out even if it maybe was a short
period of time or work if extended
season but I would say as someone who
has worked predominantly remotely and
most of my career and not really had a
lot of souls that that now are available
I'm extremely opinionated about that
room up the dynamic of supporting
remotely and it's really very I feel
like it's ascendant in the personality
like I feel like I've met people who I
think thriving in their remote
environment I feel like I'm one of the
people who can thrive in that
environment but I definitely think even
with the ideal setup of like
understanding what you're getting into
understanding what's the part of you
understanding what kind of how to manage
your time well use the right tools I
think even with all that said I think
for most people I would not recommend
starting out remotely if you're just
getting into copper developments like
get around people like like in really
any get specifically other developers
but put just people in general whether
that's designers or whatever like just
be of being around other people who used
to talk to and not not just like sitting
in a room and like there's mean other
people around but like actually getting
in something whether that's through a
boot camp or you know something along
with like something that's going to
force you to kind of put your skills out
there and like put yourself on the spot
I've heard people recommend like getting
involved in this open source I don't
want to open up another can of worms
what open source project are like some
of the most political like people
projects that you would ever interact
with and it is very hard with you I
would say most people or very like
seeing to open-source they're like and I
know a lot of these people who are
working in Silicon Valley who like are
friends with some of these people who
would they build things that you and I
use all the time and take for granted
but essentially when you're when you see
them first in like a lot of the nuances
of why they did what they did and how
they manage their their ideas of the
world within the software it's in person
you can kind of sit
it's okay like I said I kind of
understand the specific kind of
personality that might be a little bit
awkward to me initially but if I get to
interact with in this person I could
kind of sift through the things that I
don't necessarily die with them on and
then kind of deal soaking for you
whereas if it's just I approach the
project as it you know nobody has been
known and nobody connected to this
project and I want to contribute to even
something as big as like WordPress which
has a lot of like it's known that to
take a lot of contributors it's very
hard to kind of get your foot in the
door and start contributing and I feel
like you read blog post and everybody
likes to contribute to open source and I
totally on a presenter great but I think
they actually participating large
project it's a lot harder than sin you
are blood to beliefs and so I would say
that bar is a lot higher than it seems
and I think that the way that you would
get into those projects and there are a
lot of them would actually to meet one
of the people in person who is
contributing and kind of pick their
brains out copy with them take them out
for beer like something like that and
just like hey like tell me about this
project tell me a thousand zomball tell
me what you think makes a great
contributor like what do they look for
like what kind of things to do not like
what kind of what kind of they're all
very like stylistics likes when you
submit like a for requests they're like
very big like all of them are very
particularly about like how its
formatted and my like it's silly stuff
that you're like wait I like built this
thing it's really cool and like it adds
this in it and there's a lot more
politics really about what gets except
it's and really the follow me or your
future code so that's something I would
say that most people don't know that I
actually just good to know so again I
know I'm not trying to get into the
weeds on open source but that's an
example like go and meet these people in
person and like figure out okay I just
wanted someone I could be friends with
and then if not just go meet someone
else find someone else but you really
have to put yourself at you know go to
the meetup find those venues that you
can see those people in person and try
to like make friends like friendly
making stuff like I feel like those DUHS
social like interpersonal things are I
would say most people wanted to
developers take those for granted but I
think those are really what makes the
difference between the people who are
unknown and the people are no I feel
like if you can work on those at home I
think soft skills maybe give some but
I would say there they're just as
critical to your success as a software
developer as your actual like
intelligence when it comes to
programming syntax algorithms like I say
your soft clothes are just as a foreign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
