today another episode of free code camps
basic JavaScript section of the
curriculum
today we're manipulating complex objects
how's everyone doing today I don't know
about you but this global warming thing
is real my windows are cranked open it's
the middle of winter and I feel like I
go take a bath in the lake it's pretty
obscene well we're all gonna die one way
or the other it's an existential crisis
what can I say let's move on what are we
doing today well today is kind of a
trick trick set up here because unlike a
lot of the solutions we're really not
being set up for a success let me show
you what I'm talking about in just a
second let's go over what they're trying
to tell us here sometimes you may want
to store data in a flexible data
structure and a JavaScript Java strip
whoo a JavaScript object is one way to
handle flexible data they allow for
arbitrary combinations strings numbers
bullying's arrays functions and objects
not too shabby then they give you an
example here in the pseudo code of a
complex data structure and they really
use a nice concrete example here
everyone listens to music most people
love music so they do the classic Billy
Joel piano man album from 1973 and the
format's here and if it went gold indeed
it did go gold and also they note
there's an array inside here here's your
array a three-component array there and
various pieces of metadata about the
album also has nested formats array do
you want to do more you can add more etc
and they keep going on and this is JSON
which for me I took in XML class briefly
I have to admit I really didn't pay
attention in class so yeah I can't you
add one thing or another
but from what I was reading XML is a
language extensible markup language
whereas JSON is or jason is
a format so it's not a language but a
form match here what we're tweaking
today they know you will need to place a
comma after every object in the array
unless it's the last object in the array
which okay you see right here they did
not put the comma in the array they put
the comma outside the bracket and they
did not do anything here with the gold
true except the curly brace so now they
want us to add a new album to the my
music array which is up here starts up
here and they want us to add an artist
and title strings release here number
and formats sounds pretty simple you
know the drill a little less chat a
little more coding I like to give myself
plenty of room and so what I did I
simply took my inspiration I didn't
really use the pseudocode here because
they kind of give you a pseudo code up
here for lack of a better term this is
actual code but you can apply it as
pseudo code when you're trying to do
your problem so let's start it off we're
just gonna say we want to do add an
artist per the directions so we're
adding this entirely new album but first
to log that album we need to tell who
created it will seem real tough Jimmy
put out now boom huh
real tough candy we're just gonna keep
going down the line heard their
specifications they want a title of the
album title it Bowie what we want
released years so that's gonna go in
quotations as well and again just
following the format up here if that
confuses you you can also just refer
back to this little instruction block
right here and as you see the convention
is release underscore year or the syntax
rather and what year we put this up we
put out a fresh up in 2017 okay comma
and now they want us to do format so
formats and this is where we're going to
start our array a format so as you know
to open up an array we're gonna do the
what the hell are these things called
brackets
boy hey I know what I'm doing
sometimes not really at all just kidding
kind of not really okay formats um well
I mean why the heck not you know what
we'll make this a little easier we'll do
how about a vinyl house in vinyl I know
Virgen 280 gram vinyl beat that so we're
gonna do a comma and then for the next
item in our array I think um I'll do a
cassette so I'm gonna refer up here for
the convention or the syntaxin it's
looks like sea-ice might be cassette so
we'll stick with that never I'm sure in
that they also had an eight-track hey oh
you know what bump it I'm putting out a
16 track its 2017 people are getting
more liberal with their mediums and
music sixteen track 16 T okay so we have
a three item array in this format
section here we have virgin 280 grand
final cassette and 16 track but they
also noted in the instructions that the
last item in your array does not need a
comma so there's that and then we're
gonna close up this array here's our
closer here and then you can just match
up the format up here comma okay and
they didn't want you to specify if it
went gold or not that's totally fine so
we're gonna clean this up and then you
think we're done we are not we need to
put these curly braces that you see up
here and down here right here to open up
this new segment and we're gonna close
it right down there and why is that not
going
okay that is where this is little
misleading because after this ending
curly this closing curly brace you
actually need to put a comma and boom so
without a comma not cool with a comma
everything's cool let's actually see if
it runs down here let's see what it
spits out in our little print box here
okay cool so it printed out
it's a little messy but you get the idea
I printed out both albums the Billy Joel
and real tough candy album piano man vs.
boot yo Oh
release your what should contain a
release here my music one so this guy
should contain a release your property
which is a number okay I did is anyone
see what I'm doing wrong here because
I'm thinking I'm fulfilling that um
maybe it's not maybe oh maybe 19 maybe
it's 1978 let's see what happens okay I
actually don't know why this is doing
that real year for heaven's sakes okay
that's why it's not doing that because I
put real year and not release so let's
put let's actually spell it right
hey spell release release year man I
didn't release this in 1978 my releases
in 2017 so that was simply a human error
as it always is here on the real tough
candy show so let's run it and see what
happens
boom okay I think it not only passed us
but we all got these checked off okay so
guys the biggest holdup is gonna be if
you can't get this to run because again
it's pretty straightforward I did
explain everything just to be clear but
this little comma here they don't really
tell you you have to mess with this
portion but you do you have to add that
comma in order for it to pass you hope
this video is helpful thanks for tuning
in guys stay safe out there it's real
hot we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
