calm back behind the glass rectangle
what do you today we are checking out a
clean cozy creative and concise
oh that alliteration just gives me the
tingles way of pushing your projects to
actual pages that people can view so if
you have a portfolio or you have an app
or some other kind of front-end creation
and even if you get created you can have
a back-end creation here on github if
you use something like firebase but
that's beyond the scope of this video
we're gonna go ahead and I'm gonna show
you this demo of how to easily make
anything you have on github into a page
so let's go into repositories we're
gonna start from scratch here we're
gonna go and call this year a hot night
all right
and I've already created a folder to
spare us the agony of all this pecking
so we're gonna go ahead and get push
remote you origin/master
that was fast boom and this is just a
basic HTML file that I want to show the
world consisting of my insipid poetry so
let's go ahead this is where the dirty
work starts to make this an actual page
so we're gonna go over here to settings
go ahead and scroll down to github pages
and under source we're simply going to
select master branch we're gonna go
ahead and save it and just like that my
site is on cold light hot night that's
exactly what I pushed to github now this
is a simple example but let's let me
just illustrate how powerful this is for
employers fellow devs and whatnot
because now that we go to whoopsies go
to the Sierra hot nights project we can
go ahead and edit it and go ahead and
click demo or let's just describe this
and then we go ahead and save and how
easily can a person check out your demo
now some of you may be saying yes but
real tough candy please we have things
like natla Phi which is so much better
and so much hipper well I like github
because of its social components you can
star this you can watch it you can fork
it and of course all the additional get
goodness you have that comes with github
so you can see how powerful this can be
I've deployed my portfolio on here just
a temporary home I mean ideally I'd like
to have a domain name and you can
customize and put your own domain names
instead of these github do I owe sites
haven't gotten to that point yet but
I've deployed that the beta version of
the dev spotlight is up can do a video
on that real soon because I'm so happy
the way that turned out and some various
apps in small demos that I'm working on
for people to actually check out star
whatever clone and whatnot with Matloff
I yeah it has its purpose but you can't
do that that laughs ID that's why I like
this and you guys saw how freaking quick
that was so I hope you enjoyed this
video hope it was helpful
always something bump in going on at the
real tough candy get our chat room
Michael corn boat is killing it with
this front-end class right now so fun
and we're gonna be expanding that with
speakers and people in the development
world who are killing it and really are
making an impact on society and doing
great things so I will keep you updated
with that I think we're gonna start
doing a calendar of events so you guys
can check out what's going on on what
day because we're planning on adding a
lot more events for devs of all
abilities alright guys I hope this video
was helpful we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
