confirmed our target exist and you know
what here is a really good idea to if
you guys are doing this because you're
going to be coming across a lot of
websites create a folder on your local
machine where these screenshots ooh I
just love the sound of that camera
where's my contact page and now these
screenshots oh don't do this to me oh
this is buzzing my harsh please that
came out totally the way I meant it too
it is definitely buzzing my harsh okay
well point being I definitely would take
a screenshot of everything I plan on
using and a later date unfortunately
this virtual machine is being a pain in
my ass okay so I want to do this well
awesome and we are going to be going on
to the next step so now i have their
screen i have a screen shots of those
and i want to find out more about these
people who work here and I don't you
know more importantly what's the server
and what's your firewall because I want
to get into your excuse me pardon
the language but you know if I'm going
to be gangster I may be breaking the law
I got to be a little rough I got to play
the part I can't just be like this limp
dick guy or gal looks just like it you
got to be aggressive you got to get it
so we're going to go over to who is net
now this if this virtual machine will
stop being a pain but so here is who is
who is information for
global enterprises now unfortunately
there's not a lot of stuff I can use on
here registrant email who is privacy
protect calm guys you're going to find
this a lot if you're using who is there
maybe the rare bird where you're going
to find good information because a lot
of it is masked I know when I registered
my domains it was included in the price
it was like 12 bucks to register the
domain and then to make your who is
information anonymous it was just
included in the package the twelve
dollar deal however one thing I do want
to screenshot here for further youth
perhaps I mean I'm not I'm not it's not
priority but there's a name server here
there's actually two name servers and a
tech email I don't know if I'll ever
need that tuck phone who knows but you
never know but overall there's not a lot
of useful information here as far as
getting me the information that I need
to plan this attack so we're going to
keep going the reason I am taking a
screenshot oh please stop being an
elephant the reason I took a cool shot
oh my god okay guys what you saw where I
took the screenshot is this even gonna
work don't do this time just not making
me look like a bigger fool so I took a
screenshot right here right the reason
because in the future I could possibly
once I you know hone in on like skills I
could plan a DNS poisoning or some kind
of DNS attack so you never know if
you're going to need it the worst case
scenario just delete it you know small
file whatever no bigs but hey if I can
launch a DNS poisoning attack and get
paid for it probably going to do it on a
black hat so we reached a dead end with
this who is all right so what have we
done so far we went to the global
enterprises website we got there
tact information and adobe has stopped
working and then we went to who is ok
I'm matter dead and I'm just like maybe
I need a cigarette break I'm smoking
down the block test I can do anything I
feel so empowered so now oh and not
wants me to abort where am i right so
now I'm contacting my mentor my hacker
mentor friend who will remain anonymous
so now he's telling me to use social
engineering and open-source Intel tools
this way I'm not intruding I mean if
it's online and it's open source why not
maximize it so that's what we're going
to do they also this a documentation
this little manual I was given by agent
a is telling me that publicly traded
company a great source of open source
Intel is to download the Security and
Exchange Commission 10k report and
annual report to stockholders right here
because this is a manual and that it
contains valuable documents because
these this this compilation this report
these reports they have information like
officers of the company their financial
state legal settlements short and
long-term development plans so this
could be powerful stuff but
unfortunately because global enterprises
is small can't access them through the
sec report so let's look somewhere else
it's the internet for God's sake they're
going to be out there you just have to
hone it in a little more so most of you
are familiar with the website linked in
this is exactly why I don't have a
LinkedIn profile because a lot of times
it will be used to socially engineer you
now for this exercise there's a little
knock off linkedin website it's called
get
connected so what I did I went ahead and
logged on to get connected and I
searched for global enterprises located
in Georgia and these peoples names
popped up and Lawrence Steve Byrnes Ravi
purim Keith Anderson LuAnn garfinkel the
one and only and last but not least
Brian Mize is our one more nope so this
is how this is these are the people I
need to focus on because these people
have my information the question is how
do i hone in on the one of my top picks
I want to prioritize want to prioritize
these people based on who is the weakest
link who has the most information who
likes to talk who is the blabbermouth
and how can i best socially engineer
that person now this is something
they're not going to tell you in this
lab but for me personally I have a
better time talking to men not because I
wear some low cut top and 12 inch
stiletto heels although in some
circumstances that might help in some
circumstances that might not help but I
you know for me personally when i'm
trying to do these things in simulated
environments of course but just in
general i mean i'm not lying about a
socially engineering the social
engineering thing but getting
information legitimately i have a hard
time connecting with female baby boomers
for some reason i don't know that think
i'm a smartass and they just they look
at me weird whereas with guys they're a
lot more open you know opens more open
sources of communication open open lines
of communication is what i meant to say
it's easier for me to communicate with
them and vice versa so that said i would
probably for me it will never be a
combination of somebody a type i knew i
could get information from or we can
develop a rapport and also somebody who
works on the department who is going to
give me the information what kind of
freaking server do you have and what's
your firewall now i see a few guys on
here but i'm not it's not really doing
it for me
I saw this guy named Heath but my hacker
friend told me that it used to be a cop
at the LAPD I was like to scratch back
dude off the list so the systems
developed he's the assistant director at
systems development so my idea and my my
wish of connecting with somebody who I
know I can get along with better than
other people has been vanquished so now
I'm going to focus on exactly what these
people's positions are and find out who
is the loudmouth there's always at least
one in every company who it's either
their official title or you can find out
some other way but let's not find out
since this is non-intrusive we're going
to find out some other way and the first
person who pops out is this woman and
Lawrence why because she's a recruiter
and recruiters interface with the public
every day their job is to talk and make
the company look good they want to
please potential candidates and also
she's a training manager that means she
did shoot bottom line up front this
woman has a lot to say and a lot of it
in solid information so right now she's
on top of my list she's priority Warren
so let's eliminate some people here
we're going to eliminate Ravi because he
lives in Chicago and he used to be at
global enterprises so see who else who
else Steve Burns PMP project manager pro
he seems a little too smart and a little
two up top you see is a little too high
in the food chain for me to even access
him Keith Anderson is the guy who used
to cop so he's down on the totem pole
Lulu and garfinkel now here's the thing
about loot and she's a director of
global IT equivalent prizes she is in
the home goods industry and she used to
be assistant director of IT at rugs or
us I don't know she's referring to two
pays or actual throw it on
carpet and don't spill juice not sure
don't care because not only does she
have a unique name LuAnn garfinkel come
on there's probably only one maybe two
maybe she also has a photo which is
going to make it easier to to identify
her in other context Bryant's mais nao
fact a really common name and he's
director of business development at
global enterprises not really I don't
know it's not only in the field I'm
looking for she's a director she has to
know what's going on at all times she
getting paid six figures and not on the
bottom end of it she's getting paged a
big commander bucks maybe that's right
someone bumped LuAnn man I'm bumping
LuAnn to the top of my list even though
like I said before for some reason baby
boomer women a lot of times they think
I'm a smartass but I'm just going to
have to shake it to unmake it and be
pleasant if in fact we have a chance to
talk I might actually you know what this
is my lunch and I'm the hackers so I
want to just actually hire a well-spoken
male a charming charismatic man to talk
to LuAnn garfinkel in my scheme of
things so we are going to be taking
LuAnn four tops and then the other woman
and Lawrence now whether by coincidence
or not the two women in this list are in
the top two positions are women more
easily socially engineered I don't think
so i think it depends a lot on sexual
politics like I've been explaining for
the past 15 minutes here in there which
is neither here nor there because we're
moving on because I need more
information so I have my people okay I'm
just gonna go like this and now i am
going to go back to this knockoff
linkedin site i'm going to go to their
homepage I want to see you know actually
I'm going to come in try and connect
affluent garfinkel almost alone
fire up a fake profile because I know
I'm linkedin you can't look unless your
register except it's not that hard just
just whip up a fake one in a few minutes
so where is our profile file where we
can check out LuAnn Oh LuAnn mrs. dash
think oh here she is boom this is the
woman identity confirmed so she's a top
information tech professional at global
enterprises since 2009 this woman knows
her stuff 2010 recipient of top
contributors award frequent speaker at
conferences and these are groups guys do
not let this mundane information escape
you if you're getting paid enough you're
going to be going to one of her speaking
engagements how how important is it to
find out what this firewall is and what
the server is and even more information
for other attacks how important is it I
don't know ask the guy who's paying you
because with this information you could
go to one of her conferences and strike
up a conversation afterwards or one of
many other combinations she also writes
a blog i ET insights we have hate
packing gold she is currently pursuing
an mba there is another attack vector
what's what's cool is should go into
normally on linkedin people do I don't
want to brag but you know people lift
their credentials where did you learn
that sanuks cools oh my god they're one
of well we will go there but keep keep
schools on top of your attack vector
list because they are incredibly easy to
find someone who will give you
information everything you need to know
holy crap married with two high
school-age daughters Oh Lou and come on
you've been in IT for 20 years what are
you doing telling people twin the world
you have to high school age daughters
what an idiot so she writes this blog
aighty insights and you know what we're
not going to waste any time let's go
right over to IT insights let's go to
her page here
now this is her blog musings and
observation from an IT insider guys we
didn't have to do anything invasive we
simply use the power of the search
engine your search engine of choice to
find this woman to disclose everything
we need to know to wage a very serious
attack on her company this is golden we
you are welcome and invited to comment
on my post and to share your own
thoughts insights and observations well
Luanne I hate the call me is what you're
acting like a real idiot that's really
harsh but in this day and age I think
look I guess I need to rewind I am being
harsh because a lot of people just don't
know I don't know I don't if she knew
better do you think she'd be doing this
I don't think so dude I don't know the
woman but I feel like she's been in the
business long enough where if she truly
thought she was putting her company into
jeopardy she would not publish this so
I'm going to assume that this is an act
of ignorant not an act of sabotage
because she is effectively giving away
her company's trade secrets I don't know
if it's a trade secret but her company
sensitive information she's telling us
right here she chose a pfsense 2.0
firewall during a live install it stuck
at trying to mount route from UF SWFs
pfsense 0 oh my god when I couldn't have
written it better myself so you guys
know the drill amazing little screenshot
of distance gonna go in my little
dossier on my home machine my host oh my
home machine mother so let's get out of
there because there's more to come Oh
Luanne is a very prolific writer in fact
she even talks about her open source
exploits and i don't mean exploiting I
mean her foibles she's talking about if
and source makes sense in this entry
from November 29 2016 talking about how
she moved from a real solid name brand
firewall to pfsense migrated to a BYOD
policy that saves money and have
migrated you an open source mail server
LuAnn you are money you are mighty baby
you are money and I didn't even have to
talk to you you are money Thank You Lynn
thank you the problem with people
knowing so much is that they have a real
problem keeping it to themselves I know
for me hell I've almost done 200 videos
and a lot of them are tech related
because I'm so kind to share my
knowledge now fortunately none of that a
sensitive information however when
you've been in the business for 21 years
there's a lot of stuff that's sensitive
that probably maybe your brain is just
scrambled or you don't I can't believe
how can you just not know any better how
can you say being a veteran I'm kidding
my computer oh my god I'm getting for
Clint this is the jackpot oh my god guys
oh yeah this is a two pager yep getting
fur goes oh my goodness oh my goodness
so there we have it thanks to LuAnn we
have the name of the email server we
have the or excuse me we have the type
of mail server we even have the exact
name of firewall the abscess is a pretty
good firewall yes LuAnn knows that too
let's exit but we're not done because
now that we have all of that information
we're going to get some more information
on that pfsense firewall because the
odds are that global enterprises you
know they're an IT firm IT related they
probably well who really knows but
what's just
soon they you know do regular updates so
we're going to do a little update or
rather a google search on the current
version that they are theoretically
using I got to do it here but that's
what we would do just to get a little
more information so again going back to
that conference thing probably on our
blog somewhere she's going to have a
conference schedule check her Twitter
check her social media I don't know baby
boomers really don't do Twitter but you
never know somewhere on the internet
probably on her beloved blog she's
mentioning leaving traces of information
behind in a variety of places never
thinking that someone else will be
trying to connect the pieces together
LuAnn garfinkel we are going to move on
because right now you have our
information and we are going to engage
in our targeted reverse social
engineering attack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
