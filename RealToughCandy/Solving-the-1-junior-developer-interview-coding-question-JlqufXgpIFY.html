woman at programming interview who
couldn't get the job to save her life
not particularly well today we're
switching gears up a little bit and I'm
going to be showing you a problem
commonly added at junior development job
interviews and we're going to be going
through it line by line so that when
you're in the hot seat you'll be able to
solve the problem no problem challenge
is this buzz challenge and it's based on
a game that kids play in the UK
basically kids get pointed at or pop in
the head and it's their number each kid
is a number and you go around a circle
or whatever and if you end up being a
multiple of three you go fizz and if you
end up being a multiple pull of five you
say buzz and if you end up being a
multiple of three and five you say whoa
but people are saying around the
internet these hiring managers and
interviewers at development companies
are saying that the majority of computer
science graduates can't solve this
problem and this person has also seen
self-proclaimed senior programmers take
more than 10 to 15 minutes to write a
solution but let's go to the meat of the
problem and then we're going to hop on
the code editor and go through line by
line how to code this so write a program
that prints the numbers from 1 to 100
for multiples of 3 princes and steps 5
or pardon me print fizz instead of a
number and for multiples of 5 print buzz
will assume all so instead of the number
for numbers which are multiples of both
3 &amp;amp; 5 print fizzbuzz okay we're going to
be coding this in JavaScript and what I
like to do guys these are essentially
word problems when you get these
challenges look I'm really nervous at
interviews but knowing that it all comes
down to being a word problem I'm going
to write it down I'm going to take some
candy notes okay
and then work from there and work
smarter not harder trying to grasp on it
these things I'm going to be using
skills I picked up in other careers and
other skill sets that I use such as
reading and picking out context clues
you can solve a lot of problems just by
using context clues in these types of
word problems all right and we'll just
these will be my notes here to comment
this and then leave myself I like to
leave myself some Colette candy-coat
it's not pseudocode because with
problems like these they're pretty basic
and for me writing pseudocode
again this is just for me you can write
pseudocode the solution in pseudocode if
you wish before you solve the problem
but something like this is so
straightforward you're putting all the
time in a pseudocode I mean I may well
just write the solution if I'm going to
be writing pseudocode but I will take a
few more notes and things I extract from
this official problem okay so we're in
our editor ready to roll let's read to
the problem one more time and I am going
to be pointing out so god text clothes
write a program right away okay you know
we need to write a program hey that
works we're on the same page that prints
the numbers from 1 to 100 ok prints
what's that in JavaScript it's usually a
console dot log so we're going to
confidant log 1 to 100 and now this is
just my candy code again because for
multiples of 3 we're going to print
these instead of the number so the
exception is we're going to count about
logging this
for multiples fries and then for
multiples of five buzz that's another
exception we're going to again if it
prints so we're going to call the dot
log buzz for multiple five numbers of
multiples of three and five that's one
final exception egg deception exception
console dot log is buzz for bolts of
three and five all right
just getting a little hint here that
we're going to be using a for loop or
loop starts off with four men inside
those parentheses is where we put our
goodies is where we define our counter
so going back again to our clues our
counter needs to start at one and we're
going to set up our counter using
variable we're a declare variable you
can name it whatever you want I is
usually the common most common
convention I've seen J can call whatever
you want though
oops not zero it's actually one go ahead
and put a semicolon and then we want it
to stop
at 100 so the JavaScript equivalent of
stopping at a number is less than or
equal to sounds cryptic sounds a little
weird right but I'll show you what it is
not quite cryptic once I coat it out
here so if I is less than or equal to
100 that's what that is
stop at 100 is basically what this means
but now we're faced with a problem
because the loop doesn't understand
exactly how to loop through like by what
increment like by v by xx by 2 by 2 like
Noah's art what are we supposed to be
doing we want it to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 all
the way to 100 we want to increment by 1
and the way you code that is
you're variable putting in AI which is
again our variable and then just simply
adding two plus signs now we're going to
open up some brackets good old-fashioned
curly braces yeah we the good thing is
we have the protein of this already
written and because I was using context
clues I was able to bang out that for
loop now
something tells me my gut that this for
loop needs to be matched up with in if
else if type of program because if you
read it out and read the candy code
where it's kind of giving you read my
little side notes you know the exception
is if it's a multiple of three it's
going to be says if it's a multiple of
five otherwise you know confidant log so
if else if and then finally a catch-all
statement that's going to print the
numbers that don't fall um you know
beneath these parameters so let's go
ahead and code the if statement the if
statement starts off with an if inside
the brackets we're going to put
something what are we going to put we
are going to code is for multiples of
three console dot log oh my god so what
code inside here if the number is a
multiple of three princes oh my dad when
we do we're going to take our variable I
right and then we're going to put in
this little thing that looks like a
mosquito nose and eyeballs which is the
modulus operator and we're going to put
three because that's our first one right
the multiples of three so it should all
I'll show you this I'll go through this
but let's coat it out if I modulus three
is equal to zero
we are going to do something what are we
going to do well we're going to count
about log says aren't we console dot log
is don't forget the semi-colon okay so
this is what this little guy is saying
this is the supplemental protein of this
problem if this variable is divisible by
three when divided by three rather has a
remainder of zero
princes okay so you can just a little
mine experiment if three is divided by
three what's the remainder zero so the
first one is going to be printed fizz is
going to be universe three and then six
and then not and then twelve that wasn't
so painful right so now we got that one
cranked out I'm just going to somehow
annotate that that's been completed
actually probably next better and let's
go on to our next one it's going to be
the same thing so I'm just going to go
ahead and copy do a paste a root and
multiple is going to be five so if I
divided the variable here I is divided
by five and there's a remainder of zero
it's going to print now one
alright cool but there is one thing we
need to add which is else up here else
if we're going to add another else if
because as you see it just goes on and
on
see we have one more exception to go
through that complete console dot log
fizzbuzz for multiples of three and five
okay so this is going to be three keep
it sequential here if that is that and
then we're going to add the + sign
because we want three and five to apply
to this
so we'll just go I'm a big proponent of
copying and pasting I mean why not work
smarter
harder okay but now we need to fix that
which is going to be syphilis and then
finally first of all let's set up so
these three are complete but now we need
to log the other numbers that aren't
multiples of 3 5 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 5 ok so that's
going to be our last one it's going to
be outside of this bracket and it's
simply going to be else console.log
we're going to log our variable as an
iterate again iterates 1 through 100 now
there's a good possibility I have
completely screwed this up so let's open
up our developer tools here our console
let's go ahead copy and paste we're on
the damn plying and a little look at
where in the world is my fifth buzz oh
oh I've done something wrong why is this
not doing I'm actually glad this
happened because this is what's going on
these first conditions here are catching
everything so there's not going to be an
exception that prints food bugs all of
these are being caught before it even
gets an opportunity to do this so what
we're going to do because we want to get
some fizzbuzz action it's going to go
like this I'm going to put it at the top
of the stack here so okay some breathing
room now notice the spill has an else if
on it I'm going to clean that up I'm
going to get that out of there and
that's going to be our leading if and
then we're going to put an else right
there this should solve our woes
yeah probably get a little room there
this little bit of magic here bubble
bubble and it looks like we have liftoff
so it's printing one two and instead of
three a print says four five print buzz
perfect perfect six which is a multiple
three princes nine multiple three print
print printed fizz and then ten would
buzz and then of course our first
fizzbuzz is going to be 15 and our next
quiz buzz as you could probably imagine
or compute is going to be 30 we go down
to 45 just check to see our computer
isn't broken and then 75 should be here
somewhere
sheriff is buzz and some buzzes and
senses the interesting thing about the
solution is that this isn't the most
optimal way of solving it yeah it took
me a long time to go through and code it
in there as you know I probably would
have failed the interview because I
didn't have the three and five up here
but there's also a lot better ways to
optimize the solution so if you're
feeling particularly nerdy you can
experiment with making this smaller more
compact more beautiful insert lovely
adjectives here thanks for watching guys
