your area today over at Amazon seller
central I'm going to be showing you the
difference between release date start
date and launch date they sound similar
that can be confusing but they're very
different so I'm over here at Amazon
seller central what you want to do first
things first go ahead and login and then
you want to get to your manage inventory
page so what I did to get there I just
hovered over inventory I simply hit
manage inventory now let's say we have a
product that's not quite ready for
primetime however we already started
promoting it to people like yo dude I
got this sweet ice-cubes triple threat
tincture with ginger tumeric and birch
bark coming up in a few weeks it's gonna
be available for sale sale that's really
a bad example it's gonna be let's rewind
it's gonna be for sale and in your hand
March 15th an actual physical product is
gonna be available on March 15th but I'm
also gonna tell this dude you know what
I'm taking pre-orders so let me show you
how to change all of those components so
simply go over to your products you want
to tweak and we're going to tweak this
triple-threat tincture and we're gonna
hit edit and maybe after we see these
parameters we can go through that little
scenario again so under offer this is
you know pretty familiar if you've sold
before and it did your information for
your products vital info variations
going over to offer and then there's
going to be the release date and a start
selling date
and then under more details is the third
date which is the launch
now this one's the look the most easiest
to remember at least for me because a
launch date is simply the day you
announced your product you just
announced it like yo dude I got some ice
cubes triple threat tincture coming your
way you could even say you don't know
when but you did announce it so I
announced that shoot I know that in
January I released I launched launched
it and this has no bearing on when your
actual item goes on Amazon so then we're
going to go over to offer because even
though my product is not going to be
made available this I my finished
product is not going to be ready it's
still brewing it's still doing its thing
it's not gonna be ready until March so
I'm actually going to release it on
March 15th because let's just say in the
14th I know it's gonna be ready I'm
gonna bottle it stick some stickers on
it to do all that stuff so I'm gonna
release it on the 15th however why not
take some pre-orders
so today's February 21st and I'm ready
for some pre-orders
so now that we have those things filled
let's go back to that little scenario I
kind of screwed up when I first opened
this video so in January 10th I was
talking to my buddy and I was like yo I
got this new product coming up this ice
cubes triple threat tincture I'm gonna
be taking pre-orders starting February
21st and this products gonna be in your
hand on March 15th and all you got to do
February 21st buddy get over to Amazon
and get your pre-order on and then
simply save and in your manage inventory
this is gonna stay active for a few
minutes I've already tested this with
those parameters I just showed you about
an hour ago and it takes about 15
minutes to change from active to
inactive its inactive because it's still
waiting to go alive so actually I take
that back let me correct that because
here's what I did for the other scenario
I didn't show in this video I didn't do
a start selling I didn't do
and actually let's say I don't want to
announce pre-order there's gonna be no
pre-order it's just gonna be ready for
sale and merge so this is what I did for
that I want to start selling and then I
went to March 15 no pre-order as the
product is gonna be finished on March
14th and I put on my labels on and stuff
that is what you do for that you
wouldn't even have to bother with the 30
state
and then you would hit save and finish
and then this in about 15 minutes is
going to turn from active to inactive so
let's just quickly see where we are
yep hope that was helpful thanks for
watching any questions on that hit me up
