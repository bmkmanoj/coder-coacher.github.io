of a 45 year old why fail cisgendered
poppers I wanted and I was referencing
your throw away my learn how to call
just pull away from me I have a
background in finance I have sold
children and it's why school receives a
much like elbow decision it's a totally
having a lot higher call thank you hey
everybody how's it going real skinny
loss can be calm back in the saddle with
the you today
shoutout to one of my newer subscribers
cold lady I love when you guys make
comments thanks for checking in and
saying hi really makes the channel a lot
more fun and interesting today is a
topic it is MI to insert adjectives here
to code am I too fat to code my too old
to code
am I too disabled to code like the one a
qualifier I guess that I see a lot on
YouTube is am I too old to code as you
guys can see are a lot of big heavy
hitters in the youtube coding and web
development world answer this question
is 40 years old too old to learn code am
I too old too old to become a developer
Eli the computer guy chiming in two
years ago simple programmer aka John
stahma's Stephanus shook and on and on
and on and as someone who watches a lot
of videos because the young tech is my I
think it's my final stop you know I'm
saying like I've been in a lot of jobs
I've been in a lot of careers and I'm
just sick of changing them and I think
they have a home in tech it's something
I always come back to even when I was in
other careers I was doing this stuff
whether it was you know reading about
things or trying to do some projects
that are tech related maybe not
necessarily code but definitely Technic
of a technical aspect now I think this
is like I said my final stop on a career
changer I'm not 18 anymore um but I'm
also of the mind frame that if you want
to do something you can do it now in
this country for the most part this
isn't the same everywhere
but if you are dedicated and you work
hard and you really think creative
you have a really good shot at
succeeding at being your own boss making
your own money and setting your own
terms and right now the technology field
seems like the greatest place to do that
that's what really attracts me to tech I
mean coding is really fun
creating it's super fun like I know like
I say a lot of my videos I'm a creative
person and I like I love that aspect but
I also love that it's the place to make
money is to place the site your own
rules guys look I'm too old to have a
boss that sucks okay I've been there
done that time and time again I'm over
it
so I know I'm a little old a little old
I know I'm a little late to answering
this question that people ask and I
don't know if it's become a meme or if
you know there are general genuinely a
lot of people out there who are like
maybe I am too old to code you're not
too old to code doesn't matter if you're
18 and you feel old or you're 60 and
you're almost a senior citizen or you're
a baby boomer of a different age a gen
Xer
a millennial genic sirs I haven't forgot
about you guys everyone else seems to
have just like conveniently skipped over
that generation I know you guys are out
there even people in their 70s and 80s
you don't even need these guys to Kohli
you can use your voice you don't even
have to have vision to code there is
adaptive technology out there to
accommodate you whatever your special
need is there's been a lot of
development in that arena so you know
even a disability doesn't set you back
it doesn't have to set you back age
doesn't have to set you back your weight
doesn't have to set you back your looks
don't have to set you back guys this is
the one job besides radio where no one
ever has to see your face no one I mean
you know this is YouTube so of course
you will want to see you and interact
with you and stuff but for tech jobs you
can be a digital nomad and no one ever
has to see you that's awesome you can
have two heads and still have a nice
paying job in this career field now if
you had two heads in the restaurant
field food and beverage industry you get
the boot you know there's a lot of other
jobs that could possibly legally
discriminate against you forever
two heads I don't think that's a
federally protected group yet but you
had a monster die person
the point being Tech offers very unique
opportunities for people of all
abilities of all demographics of all
ages whatever
insert religions it doesn't matter what
the demographic is there's room for you
okay I have been in careers my entire
life that are male dominated and I mean
heavily male dominated I'm an Air Force
veteran I was in the music industry for
a while and I also went to automotive
repair school okay I like the only chick
in a lot of job settings now that's a
different video for a different day but
the point being is that I had an equal
opportunity to compete and work with
people who weren't like me I had a drive
and I succeeded I was very good at all
of those things I gave them you know I
transitioned out of those things for
various reasons again maybe a different
video for a different day but the point
being it doesn't matter who you are
where you come from what you look like
who you're attracted to
how many kids you have how many kids you
don't have if you have the drive if you
have the energy you can do this I'm over
having crappy bosses and people you know
who just really don't deserve to have a
job there's nothing more frustrating in
a work situation working next to
somebody who really doesn't want to be
there but is getting paid more than you
that's kind of unfair I'm over it
you know workplace culture is very hard
thing to change I don't think I'm up for
that job so I dropped out and entered a
field where you know there's a robust
community people in this community I've
noticed are really excited the ideas
propel them and there's a lot of energy
I love that I love that a lot so if you
think you're too old if you're think
you're too fat you think you're too
skinny get that out of your brain right
now because I know it sounds tacky and I
know it sounds played out but if I can
do it if half of these people can do it
you can do it you can't you can do it
I'm trying to notch down the cursing on
the channel lock the haters dude I have
a lot of haters
what I don't care people can see
whatever they want about me but at the
end of the day guess what I don't hang
out with them they're not my friends or
family they're not paying me and I'm not
 them pardon my french but that's
what it comes down to people who hate on
you
they're usually jealous and they don't
have any lives guys I hope this video
was motivational and answer anyone's
question if they're too old to code
you're not too old to code you're not
too old to code even if you have really
bad arthritis
you're not too old to code you can still
do it anyways how to chime in with my
two cents a little late to this
questioning holy crap look at all those
are YouTube whoa just keeps going on and
on well add real tough candy to the
queue on YouTube because oh this guy
wants to start at 47 I think he's too
old too old web development Jimmy a geek
his channels really cool I love his
videos um oh my god that's disturbing
okay pages upon pages you guys get the
idea go code you guys you guys can do
this thank you guys for watching thanks
for your encouragement also and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
