on for another brief video a lot talk
today about simple but critical errors
specifically using free code camp and
their challenges I don't know if it's
migraine or what but for the past couple
challenges all about 20 challenges in
JavaScript maybe 25 something about it
just looks wrong when i'm doing a string
and they're just like semicolon to the
right of my blinking cursor yes I
realized there's a big 12 small red dots
an X around it saying missing semicolon
what compare that to this I just looks
so clean so now i'm going to start this
is how i'll usually started me to get
out of the habit maybe you guys are
experiencing this as well this is the
start just taking the instructions here
and then a space is going to call an
catenate lovely c-word now to me that
looks like clean code is ready to run it
let's see of course it's not going to
work but yet I get all these check marks
yes but add a little semicolon and boom
off the release the challenge I'm
material said you guys are having this
issue too maybe I'm just like a weirdo
but I just need to get out of the habit
of deleting us semicolon and get out of
the OCD of not wanting it on the right
side of my blinking cursor so I guess
what they want give you with something
that's cool I'm just look at the whole
time let's try it it
face to feet we screwed it up add this
and si
okay I don't feel as confident doing
minutes which in the end the trouble
again early to mascara thanks for
watching let me know what your guys
experience with this is and your style
of programming need to get out of this
habit see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
