addresses today on the real Jeff candy
Channel is not in service at this time
so but a year and a half ago is when I
really started to get into technology as
far as coding and web development
back-end stuff I made the mistake of
starting with Java so for about a year I
didn't learn anything so I ended up at
this open-source conference where
there's speakers who really know their
stuff and talk about open-source
concepts and of course me being the new
brew I had no idea what was going on but
there were various meetup booths and it
was just like a little technology
village it was so frickin cool even
though I had no idea was going on there
was this booth for a coding boot camp a
local coding boot camp and I was
wondering if they took the GI Bill
because I'm a Air Force veteran and not
spending my money on a boat camp when I
can get it for free so I asked her if
she to the GI Bill and she said you know
I don't know let me take down your email
address instinctively I gave her my
legacy email now this is the email that
has been bought and sold about five
hundred times that poor email address is
taking such a beating
it's a hotmail domain the minute I said
hotmail I felt the blood we've not just
my face but my entire body I felt a
spell of depersonalization and
derealization and I was suddenly
floating away from the table and I saw
myself and I saw her face knowing she
was judging me very harshly based on
that hotmail email address there are
certain email addresses and domains you
just don't use hotmail is one of them
Juneau Yahoo AOL don't use those email
addresses and don't use names that imply
you don't know anything about the 21st
century if you're using a yahoo email
address after all their security
breaches what does that tell up somebody
in tech it tells them that you're not
hip to what's going on in
it's not good you know for me personally
if someone had a Jew know.com email
address which a lot of people still do
they're loyal we may not be so hip but
you know they're loyal that's good from
an employer standpoint so she took my
email address down smiled at me shuffled
my email underneath a bunch of papers
and said I'll get back to you never
heard from the woman again I kind of
suspected that when I had that
depersonalization spell so from that
point on there was an immediate learning
experience where I was just like I can't
be using this hotmail email address ever
it's a legacy email address that should
be used for penetration purposes only a
Oh
fast forward a year and a half I don't
give that email address out I've trained
my brain to spew that out
I give industry appropriate email
addresses to people what do I mean I
applied for a job outside of the tech
industry now this is how important this
is guys even if you're not applying for
tech jobs people outside of tech are
still technically savvy a lot of people
understand that if you're using an AOL
comm email address might be an not up to
date you're not modern you're not hip
hey I don't make the rules this is what
people associate these email domains
with weird aside observation almost
every baby boomer I know uses a
yahoo.com email address how weird is
that what's that about
boomers are you out there so I applied
for this job outside the tech industry
it was a good paying job to be honest
I'm gonna tell you what it is I was a
product ambassador for Starbucks and I
live in a very low cost of living area
so what they were paying me was like
holy crap apply for this job I was
making more than most people were making
in the town I was doing this job in it
was frickin gravy and plus you know
giving away free samples of jars of
sugar to people puts people in a really
good mood so I applied and it was the
day that the job was closing so I had a
you know expedite this get it on because
the job was starting on Monday and it
was like a Friday at noon and they were
going to pick the last candidates that
Friday evening so I was just like I
don't even know the skin
work but in the application I gave them
my own domain my personal domain email
address of my micro business my website
with my name on it so I look legit and I
look so legit that the guy interviewing
me let me set up the situation for you
so I submit the application and shortly
thereafter I get a call back from the
hiring agency we do a little phone
screen and he asked me about my sales
experience and my marketing experience
which I have a lot of and kind of
explained that and he said well you know
the thing that made me think that you
really stood out as a candidate was your
email address because it pointed back to
your website I was like ooh really this
actually works I might have to do this
more often
that was really great so even if I
didn't get the job it was good to know
that these little components things like
an email makeover things like updating
your email to reflect that you're hip
like your business savvy go a long way
and he said that he went over my resume
and he said that email anything you know
normally we have candidates do a video
submission of why they're good why
they're good for the company but hey I'm
not saying this I'm thinking there's
only a video come on dude really but I
guess they want to filter out like
people who have like pizza sauce all
over their face which I normally do
don't get me wrong but he said forget it
don't even worry about it we gonna
fast-track you for this job
he's like a great candidate and got the
phone and I got the job now granted the
email address itself did not snag me a
job it put me a cut above the other
candidates who have hotmail domains who
have Yahoo and many who have Gmail okay
there's our email hierarchy here having
the wrong email domain the email domain
for people who are in the mix is the
part after the app fine so Yahoo Hotmail
Gmail there's a hierarchy
and having the wrong email domain
address is like having the wrong name
during an ethnic cleanse
now in essen it cleanses like right up
here is in terms of severity it's the
same kind of concept because if you have
the wrong domain and you're applying for
jobs using that domain you better turn
around and start running when I gave
that woman my hotmail address I had this
awful fantasy of her going back to her
work and hotmail these domains bring
down your status definitely consider
upgrading if you're using Gmail they're
they're probably they're safe in their
hips so as far as free providers go
you're going to be up here compared to
United Juno or Deo L or something Hey
okay sod I'm not making the rules they
were up to me if you have an AOL email
address that tells me you're really
loyal if I was employer be like hire
everyone with an AOL and Juno address
put them through some tech sensitivity
training because these people are loyal
but they just need to be up to date so
the Gmail's are up here right but if you
get your own domain name with your email
addict let's say Tom Jones at Tom Jones
kicks your butt calm that tells
employers that you take tech serious
that's your hip that you're business
savvy okay because you're paying for
something that email domain cost you and
you might even be paying for your actual
email domain address as well for example
I have my own domain but I also go
through Google to have an email service
so I can log on anywhere and fetch my
email using my own domain name I know it
sounds complicated and I'm making it
more complicated than it is but check
out if you're interested in Google
Google domains and they can tell you
Google will explain it a lot better than
I can
I hope this video was helpful it's time
for an upgrade you don't have to get rid
of your old school email address I've
had my hotmail email address for 20
years
yeah
pretty sweet there's a lot of good stuff
in there a lot of teenage dreams gone
wrong I'm sure it's been hacked cracked
used abuse that poor email address but
you don't have to get rid of it I'm not
changing mine until I die whoa
no Proclamation relative candy okay but
I also have different emails for
different purposes you know I don't give
away my premiere email address to just
anyone now if I had to redo that
situation at the open source conference
I give her a gmail address that I have
not my own domain because I don't trust
that woman I don't trust her I don't
have a reason to she might spam me she
might lose it there might be someone in
her organization who will take it or
whatever I don't need them having that
top-level email so you know give your
email address out appropriately and if
you're trying to get ahead and stick out
with other applicants have a badass
email address it makes a difference
it got me the job that I wanted and it
was a fun job it was a weekend gig and I
learned a very valuable lesson and I
hope this was helpful for you guys too
