out the free website it's not responsive
it's got a lot of images and it's
wix.com real tough candy for real tough
candy calm Oh what an obscene photo back
online with you today there's too much
sugar here today we are on wix.com now
this might be forbidden territory for a
lot of UF developers I know it is for me
it's a drag and drop website they have a
lot of problems built into them we're
gonna go over the problems we're also
gonna go over why these might be
enticing for some web developers and
also enticing for like a hundred and ten
million non web developers who
apparently use this site there's a lot
of opportunity here but the first thing
of course I just pointed out is that my
site is not responsive so it's kind of
worthless for all mobile devices here
but it is trying if I can show you this
thing watch this big icecream picture
kind of respond here maybe possibly am I
totally lying to you
all right I swear I swear to you it did
there we go you see it oh there it goes
this is the live site so it does respond
in some ways but I wouldn't necessarily
call that responsive here's my account
and this is the home page so you can
preview your site connect your domain
all that like you know webmaster stuff
you cannot tweak the code directly in
Wix this is the biggest problem probably
for web developers because although it's
a drag-and-drop and it looks easy this
is actually really hard for me to to
just like yeah maybe pull this gelato
button and then a menu button right here
why not if I was coding this it would be
so much more efficient and I could get
this done and not have to worry about
lining these things up and the memory
this application is taking to run my
little tweaks here also if you're
planning to transfer a site like this
good luck it's largely going to be a
copy and paste endeavor
there's no export option export you know
XML or whatever like there is with
WordPress so that kind of sucks the
enticing card about sites like these is
that they're very easy they're very
visual and humans are visual creatures
do you have a website up and running
that has your branding on it in I don't
know 10 minutes 15 minutes that's
powerful and that's enticing for
millions upon millions of small business
owners individual bloggers artists etc
but as I mentioned this is tough getting
lay out is tough and that goes for
graphic designers and web designers any
of you guys know all you guys know
getting this down pat is tough and
giving more control like this this fine
grained control that really doesn't do
much is dangerous because look at how
easily I can really mess this site up in
a matter of seconds it's really hard to
fix it once you screw it up and there's
gonna be a lot of time spent trying to
fix it so let's preview it I would just
show you this mess of a site so if
someone were to log on to my site using
their cellular device this is what they
would see not a pretty picture and you
guys saw how easy it was for me to screw
up let me show you some of the backend
stuff this is where it kind of gets
interesting so they give you a little
data base here which I have cleverly
named because I don't know if this is
just like a user interface or if this is
actually a database I did see that they
have like some beta tools where are they
database collection so basically from
this little gift that I'm seeing when
people leave reviews for your site for
example it updates in real time it's
like we might have like Microsoft Access
Plus there's also some tools for web
developers in the backend adding modules
don't have any experience with that
haven't really played around with it oh
we're getting somewhere
people we are getting somewhere we have
some code here and I did read that you
can add a code to your website but you
cannot edit the base code if that makes
sense anything that has to do with the
WYSIWYG you cannot edit directly using
code however you can add on top of it
using modules and perhaps some other I
don't know add-ons or whatever figuring
this responsiveness issue out on Wix is
a lot harder than just get ripping open
a code editor and putting in media
queries or whatever
to make it responsive this is hard this
is a hard system as a web developer to
navigate the biggest Pro guys is that as
an entrepreneur as you guys are
freelancing remember there's a hundred
and ten million people using this thing
a lot of them don't know what the hell
they're doing take advantage of this and
to be honest a lot of the stuff you're
gonna be doing as web developers as
freelancers has nothing to do with code
and that's okay
code is beautiful and it has its places
it has countless applications but this
site is not a place where you're gonna
be doing a lot of coding and that's okay
you're still developing the web you're
still helping people fix their problems
and get them on the line the SEO issue
used to be really bad with Wix because
they were flash-based and everyone hates
flash I guess they've since fixed that
but if anyone has any SEO words of
wisdom on that I guess it's just like
all built in I might be wrong with that
that was just my assumption would I
recommend this for web developers to
pursue on your own time
hael know what I recommend web
developers to help people who are
struggling with this who maybe you know
accidentally threw this menu button over
the gelato button abso-freakin'-lutely
WYSIWYG czar very difficult to work with
it's a very specific skill set as well
because it's all visual so this is a
this is this is a great opportunity to
flex your web development skills without
having to worry about a lot of custom
code and you know use a part of your
brain that is also problem-solving
without splitting a string and finding
palindromes in javascript hope this
