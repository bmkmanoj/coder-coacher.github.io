super intimidating for movies
nuts off Danny can we left and come back
online with you today junior devs
aspiring devs other devs if you're ready
to get into the protein the meat of how
code works of what code looks like
underneath all of this this beautiful
interface this collective interface of
the internet this video is for you we're
gonna be looking at Chrome and Firefox
as developer tools now this is a
collection of tools that are just
positively overwhelming because there's
so many options so I'm in Firefox right
now okay so if I go to tools and web
developer you've probably seen all these
tools right there's a lot where do you
even start well today I'm just gonna
show you some real basics that can get
you a long ways with your development
education and really just given you some
insight on how this stuff works
first things first get acquainted with
quick keys and shortcuts so I'm hitting
option command and I and I just pulled
up the inspector these bits of code are
showing you the basic components of the
google.com homepage say you kind of like
this this little nav bar header thing so
what you would do is just click on it
and it shows you in here their code for
coding that bar so let's take this div
ID right here is HP TL and this HP TL is
selecting about and store you see it as
I hover over here you see that it just
it lights up like that so inside here
you can kind of get some insight on
what's going on so there's this
javascript event called on Mouse down
it's gonna return our WT this or some
JavaScript code but I've been block and
that's a link that applies to the about
and if we can actually change this I
double clicked on this now watch this
I'm really getting below your mind with
this one now keep an eye up here keep an
eye on that and let me show you what its
gonna happen you see that
instantaneously edited the google.com
homepage how dang cool is that
and then on
right here you have your CSS breakdown
they're using the Arial font for the
body the table the links the paragraphs
so that's just one straightforward and
simple way that you can you can check
out what's going on and once you start
using it more it'll really open your
mind to the anatomy of web pages the
other thing that you can do in dev tools
and I'm gonna go over to Chrome I love
Firefox dev tools but chrome has some
pretty good tools too so I'm gonna do
the same thing I'm going to hit option
command I'm on a Mac and that's gonna
open up the dev tools here pretty much
looks exactly the same right there are
differences in both of the both of these
consoles so as you see it's pretty much
doing the same thing here I can hover
over and see what classes are used what
the dimensions are maybe I want to steal
like this little box or something I
could do that just by selecting it here
and checking out the CSS used and the
different components that were used to
create that little button the other
thing too that is very powerful in this
collection of tools is the console you
can edit your own JavaScript in the
console let's just go bar person equals
one and then we'll call person one so
it's a really good way to live test
JavaScript and do some quick on-the-fly
tests to see if your code is working
I'll just play around with it there's
also a security tab if you go over this
way and it'll give you the down-low on
what the security status is of your
website so this is a valid HTTPS
certificate which you can pretty much
see if you just go to the URL bar here
just gives you a little more detail on
what kind of connection it's using what
the encryption type stuff like that some
of this stuff you'll never use other
stuff is a little more advanced even
though you know I'm in the dev tools
every day I'm like what is this so
there's always something to learn it
also has a debugger I'm not going to go
through that today obviously great for
debugging code oates pretty in network
and storage
this also has some great stuff great
useful stuff for you to investigate but
don't be afraid to come in here and
break stuff because there's a lot to
discover cookies I mean that's huge data
bases local storage session storage if
you're wondering how cookies and that
stuff works
you can get in under the hood view of
that as well thank you for watching and
please like subscribe comment tell a
friend about this channel gonna be doing
a lot more stuff be sure to visit my
website real tough candy dot-com all
kinds of goodies there and follow me on
Twitter and real tough candy you'll see
in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
