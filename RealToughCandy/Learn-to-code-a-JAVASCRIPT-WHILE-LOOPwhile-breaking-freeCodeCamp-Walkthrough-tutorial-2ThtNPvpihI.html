the saddle with you today over at free
code camp doing that basic JavaScript
and you know what we're almost all the
way done with this thing and we got like
probably no more than 10 more to go
before moving on to the next bigger and
better projects in JavaScript now I
probably will go back to some of you can
do some videos there were a few I just
straight up did not understand I mean
yeah I passed them at all but it was
more of a code monkey thing and I'm
gonna bout that life anymore I want to
know what I'm doing so probably go back
to a few of those but in the meantime
today you're iterating with javascript
while loop and if you're going through
the curriculum like I am in sequential
order then you will remember that with
the loops we started with four loops and
doing a you know the three parts of the
for loop the initialization the
expression in the condition and in the
final expression so today with the while
loops it's a similar setup not
completely the same but these components
will look familiar and it's pretty
straightforward this is a really short
lesson but I did find something that
gave me the beach ball of death on my
mac and it couldn't please me more
because I max out this little box down
here so if you have a person who likes
to explore while destroying things in a
non-permanent way why follow along
because I think they might enjoy what I
have to offer you okay I'm iterating
with JavaScript while loop let's just go
over this is so short you can run the
same code multiple times using a loop
anybody doing free code camp up to this
point probably knows this another type
of JavaScript loop is called a wild food
because it runs while a specified
condition is true and stops once that
condition is no longer true makes sense
right pretty straightforward I really
want you to explain that let's try
getting a lot of loop to work while
pushing values to an array okay so just
to refresh your memory push
something pushing a value to an array
means that you're adding something at
the end of it conversely as a pop dot
pop would ha boom gallier pop that last
value out of the array but that's why I
think of it was pushing something like
forcing itself on the array weird visual
with numbers not consenting so the
instructions tell us to push the number
0 through 4 we're going to forge the
number 0 through 4 to the variable my
array they set up already up here using
the while loop so basically two
different firms two things they want to
do they want us to push the numbers and
then use a while with all right how
about a little less talk and I'll be one
more coding already setting us up for
success here by declaring the variable
my array in brackets and you want to
change the code below this line alright
and if you get lost at this point simply
refer to the pseudocode and again we've
gone through this little Rico cab have
gone through this in the for loop
sections so a lot of this is going to be
familiar so let's start out by
initializing zharfar I 20 and then
simply working a third counting because
they want us to start counting it's a
zero after we're getting that from and
then we're going to define we're going
to tell the program how they want how we
want this to run and under what
circumstances so under what condition
well we want this to run while I whoa
why I is left
five because I wanted to run at zero
starting at zero and then going all the
way up to four so once it hits files can
stop so that's the best way to express
that while I is less than x and what's
less than five four so that's good in
there and then we're going to open up
with some curly braces you guys know
while I do it I like a lot of room a lot
of stretching and then we're going to
want to start with our pushes statements
which is going to be start off with the
variable you want to use which is my
doing okay we're going to the thought
push like we've been doing with all the
other got pushed up obnoxious want that
on shift exercises and then we're going
to weave this I through the dawn push
and then and only these from is going
and we're going to finish it off by
showing it how we want this to behave so
I plus plus is going to keep going this
I plus plus the best way I think event
mrs. lon fight into the to the I plus
cos just tells it if you go out and do
it again do it again iterate over so
it's going to get so this is this is
this is the king with I plus plus is the
kick in the pants for this code here
it's going to kick it it's going to kick
off the variable in the wall stations
and all of that and make us happy and of
course they're probably a lot of other
people who can explain better than I
plus plus what's up so my convoluted
goldfish brain cells into this so that's
pretty much eat all this does is going
to print out an array 0 through 4 is
going to push it rather let's see what
happens well gut go to the top off 0 1 2
3 4 as we see down here now this is
where gets fun because this is the
instruction given to us like these
coaches but now i'm going to give you my
instruction i want to push the numbers
at 0 through 500 to my array
significances i want to start at zero
and i want to
stop at 500 so I'm going to say while I
is less than 500 one push and keep going
with the I plus plus until you reach
siphon look at this is step one in
quaking the free code camp system I or
your computer I don't know if you can
hear my fans going on right now it's not
the AC it's this computer getting very
upset with me because in my other
browser I'm still doing with a beach
ball of death which I'm very pleased
with well what happens if we say in one
all day we want my array to push or let
this loop rather this wall is to push
five thousand mercy where would it be
4999 because it's been good 0 yeah I
think that's right so there's actually
501 numbers here actually yeah my dad
there's actually going to be so when
this passes through there's going to be
exactly 5001 numbers printed because
they also include 0 if it works this
system will probably jam what toy with
the system actually let's see how long
it takes you to see much confused oh my
god is good 998 oh the deathblow free
code camp are you out there can i get
like a secret badge for this like how to
jam assist if some luscious options here
this is going to be it's going to be the
end of the video because at this number
for my previous videos which I could not
complete because there is just too much
of a jam it's all over people it's all
over oh my god did it it's so much
better behaved in Chrome Safari just
said you know forget it I don't want to
do all this who is pretty for relaxing
9999 number is on this whole thing
snowing with computations
isn't that nice ready let's see how far
we can push it pun intended run Jeff
99,000 i think is where the system says
with chrome sons for free co-champs
doesn't like a cubic sense nope no mas
you guys you saw for his hands you a
while array or a while loop while
breaking this is soon have fun with it
and I hope you enjoyed this little
experimental tutorial we'll see you in
the next video he is here ok
