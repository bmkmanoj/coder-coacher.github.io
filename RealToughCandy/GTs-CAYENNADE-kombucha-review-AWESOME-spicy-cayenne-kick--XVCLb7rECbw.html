sure it looks like a new product
counting on the show before this is
exciting because we just actually
reviewed cayenne cleanse for health aid
and great product this was about a
dollar and twenty cents cheaper though
so we're gonna see if money does make a
difference in the taste of convolution
miss Kay let's pop the top is that
working with nice Toby action look at
all that beautiful again that's what I
love about GTS I said this another GT
cheese videos but their carbonation is
on a point
oh that's good
you can definitely taste some lemon in
there mm-hmm we've got kombucha a lemon
juice ginger cayenne and love so the
lemon is pretty strong in there I like
it
huge fight yeah there than health aids
cayenne cleanse I think I got a lot more
kind of you did so my throat is still a
little oh really oh yeah it's good
though it's a good thing also I want to
note too that this one has a little bit
more sugar than the other ones I think
it's because of the lemon juice total in
this bottle is 20 grams of carbs which
is a pitch higher than normal or
kombuchas but again this was that lemon
juice but I got to say and I throw it on
with health aide I think healthy has a
more robust flavor mm-hmm yeah I prefer
health aid but this is good G T's is a
solid product and they're good to bring
with you anywhere and just kind of drink
it a good alternative to a new soda or a
good drinkin good drinker absolutely and
if I saw this and a gas station there's
nothing else or there's like a ton of
alternatives and the only kombucha I
would get this in a heartbeat this is a
really good product for three dollars
and 80 cents recommended</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
