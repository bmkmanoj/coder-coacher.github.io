Canada come back in the father with you
to tell you for the past three months
I've been doing videos I in an American
action and everyone fell for it I would
I've studied fast mysterious American
cinema to the climax right poured it all
brilliant even had a Midwest accent with
western United States access and people
you can oh my god you know you have a
bloody rule you they're assuming Midwest
accent and it was just a jokes over
just kidding this is real tough candy
being scarce all war hi guys okay that
was a total gimmick I'm actually this is
my real accent but had a real you guys
in somehow right hey wanted to make the
exciting channel announcement that
starting next week next Tuesday's back
may 2nd there's going to be some channel
changes now these are cool channel
changes for number one because I'm going
to be having some more face time with
you guys now the channels that I watch I
noticed that I'm attracted to them that
keeps coming back to them I feel more
part of the channel because that person
shows their face they're not afraid to
hop on in front of a camera and say hey
guys what's up
let's do tutorial X today or let's talk
about this they have that confidence and
that builds trust it's a confidence
builds trust but also just putting their
face in front of the voice builds trust
now I have a lot of helpful videos but
my face isn't in there you know and not
to say that hey I'm here now I'm going
to save the day let me pop on and help
you better but it does build that trust
number two going to be doing some more
not some more but going to start doing
some subscriber giveaway so if you're
not a subscriber definitely hit that
subscribe button because I'm going to be
giving away some educational books um
educational materials to help you on
your journey whether you're learning
info info SEC sach coding or whatever in
the technical world so that's going to
be some cool addition
also too I wanted to let you guys know
that this channel started out as an
informational and educational channel
and it will die as an educational and
informational Channel a lot of these
channels on YouTube they're great but
they're so boring I use my one
effort because my movie is pg-13 these
channels are great with overly bored so
I want to also be a little bit
entertaining maybe you don't appreciate
my sense of humor so it's not going to
be overbearing but you know I am a
little silly I mean I am a creative
person so I want to express that side of
me as well
without commandeering the message I'm
trying to relay to you guys now again
this is a tech channel this is
metamorphosized
from previous endeavors but again the
overarching theme is always overarching
overarching theme has been you know
education and information and at the end
of the day my goal is to help you guys
give you five information so you can
make the right decision I don't want to
make anybody's decision not my job
nothing I'm into it I'm not interested
in controlling anybody I'm interested in
giving people some information some
freedom
adding to the or freedom to help you
choose to make the right decision that
is my goal for this channel thanks guys
for watching next Tuesday again may 2nd
exciting changes coming up we're going
to we're going to notch it up a bit
turn it up not quite to 11 but we're
getting there thanks for watching see in
