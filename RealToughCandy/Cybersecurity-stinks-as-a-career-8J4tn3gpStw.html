tutorial ever published on angel
together we're going to hack and then
we're going to group or some Wi-Fi oh
yeah we're going to keep that one cool
trick for mr. robot that they absolutely
using we all like using a bath bunny for
the housewife law so state-owned it's
all hell it's all in the day on the
little top Dion Dijon everybody back in
the battle with you today
today's topic is hacking aka IT security
aka computer security aka InfoSec aka
cyber security I think of the rest of
this video called cyber security it has
that nice y2k flavor to it sounds just a
little more ominous so we'll go with
that
now for a brief moment for a hot minute
when I first started my tech to read
I've mentioned this in a few videos been
exploring and fumbling and investing
time and resources that didn't pan out
for about a year and a half last year
around this time I found this you guys
see that
I found this innocently perusing the
book magazine aisle in Barnes &amp;amp; Noble in
my grubby little hands is a 2600 zine
now this is the de facto hacking
publication that's been around I think
since the early 80s and I found this and
it was just so curious to me to see it
of Barnes and Noble
you know there's our contents pretty PG
far like what is this and I picked it up
and I started looking through it and you
know being a relative new to all this
it was fascinating like it had that that
that dirty China ominous not ominous but
she felt a little forbidden and I said
I'm gonna buy this thing and I read it
all front to backs I mean when the
moment I got home I couldn't put it down
and it's articles submitted by users or
readers rather about hacking hacking
networks having the internet at large
hacking certain programs the government
the industrial military complex that's
bringing down hacking freedom
I said man this thing is so awesome I
want to get into this hacking thing the
cybersecurity thing how does this work
well I soon thereafter decided to make a
change and I will say this magazine even
though I don't read it regularly now
inspired me to pursue my interest in IT
and networking and so I started working
on my bachelor's in IT three credits
away from that degree I'm not mainly
hurry
the point being I did invest a lot of
time and resources and energy into IT
and cyber security and so on because of
this magazine this manifesto now some of
you may be saying okay that's great real
tough candy thanks for the campfire
story are you going to pull out an
acoustic guitar now well no maybe next
video the point of this video is to
share some of my experiences as a
beginner cybersecurity person working
for actual doe you know getting
compensated to do these services and you
know ethical hacking and whatnot now a
few months after I invested my brain
power in learning these things and you
know doing online labs and so on and so
forth I decide what myself out there and
said forget it let's just a little
actually pay me to do this kind of stuff
you know ethical hacking penetration
testing a vulnerability analysis which
are very powerful tools and services for
small businesses I was doing these
things and they were actually really fun
you know checking to see if your router
was set up properly what does your
firewall look like you have a VPN if so
is it set up right things like that you
don't need nothing to mr. robot okay the
basic stuff that a lot of people normal
people in their day to day business just
don't have time for or don't understand
okay cool that was all well and good but
I quickly realized that the funnest
stuffs in hacking in cybersecurity is
illegal it's very tempting a social
engineer someone when you're a really
good social engineer that's my forte
I am a brilliant social engineer I can
socially engineer most people I'm not
trying to brag I'm just saying that's my
skill set and because I'm good at it I
like doing it I
seeing you know the results of something
that I've manipulated I know that sounds
awful you know to get access to these
digital files or whatever there's a lot
of script kiddies out there there's a
lot of people who you know brute force
whatever and Kiki and giggle about it
and post it on 4chan whatever hey you do
you dude but I'm legit and I have to
stay legal because that's how I make my
money is legally and legally if
someone's hacking you you can't hack
them back and legally you can't just go
into a coffee shop and hack their Wi-Fi
and you know bust into their router and
change other settings and you know even
stuff like Wireshark packet sniffing a
lot of that stuff is in really murky
legal territory which for me and a lot
of people suggs because that's the fun
stuff so that's where I quickly realized
that you know the stuff that I'm doing
is very valuable and it really helps
people but it's also pretty monotonous
and it's very it's very mechanical
there's not a lot of room for creativity
in social engineering there's a lot of
room for creativity in you know getting
this information and stuff but you don't
social engineer in your day-to-day tasks
as a white hat hacker as someone who is
following a law as a black hat hacker
the bad guys yeah you can social
engineer all the live long day and there
are some cases some cases in penetration
testing where if you're a white hat
hacker you can get away with social
engineering so long as the manager or
the CTO or the CEO or whatever gives it
the green light but that's not a
day-to-day tasks under normal normal
circumstances so that kind of bummed me
out you know real tough candy having to
follow the rules and not having fun I
don't know about that dude number two
this thing I realize is that if you're
doing cybersecurity as an independent
contractor or as a freelancer or someone
who doesn't work for a company or
government it is very difficult to
quickly develop your your business
whereas in a web development
if you're having a startup in that
department you can very quickly develop
stuff and push out some apps and
websites and services that they scale
quickly they do everything quickly you
can make really good money as a cyber
security analyst or expert in a
consulting firm but it's going to take a
while because not only are the barriers
to entry a little higher but you also
need to gain more trust with people you
know when I download an app I don't
think about how much I trust that person
who coded it I see it on the iTunes
Store or whatever and I'm like okay it's
on the iTunes Store it must be relic
relatively saved
yeah download whereas if you're trying
to shop for a cybersecurity person to
help you you want to trust that person
you know what if that person is actually
not legit and is going to be busting
your stuff and spilling your stuff you
know your integrity as a cyber security
specialist has to be like way up here as
a web developer that's kind of a
secondary concern yeah it's important to
have integrity of course it's important
to be trustworthy of course but it's not
at the forefront of what we're doing in
web development so that was number two
number three why I kind of floated from
cybersecurity to web development was
that the crowd in cybersecurity they're
really really really smart they're
really really anal retentive there's not
a lot of humor in cybersecurity now I'm
not saying everyone's a stiff zombie
okay but a lot of people they eat
breathe and sleep cybersecurity I don't
I love learning about that kind of stuff
it's fascinating but it's not my soul
you know what I mean and that's really
not meant to brush aside the whole
cybersecurity community because at the
end of the day they're the ones keeping
our stuff safe or at least really trying
hard to do so there are a few people who
I've come into contact with or watch
their output for example hacks or
pancakes
Leslie Carhartt oh my god if you're not
subscribed to Twitter this woman is
Oh prolific she is personable she's
always thinking from an information
security standpoint and really has a lot
of good things to say interesting things
to say and straight out just fascinating
retweet highly recommend her even if
you're not into hacking a lot of her
stuff relates to web development not
directly but if you have been in web
development long enough you'll start to
see the connections the one youtube
channel i highly recommend without
reservation is hack five now these guys
not only create eight hacking products
they have the land turtle the bash bunny
there's a Wi-Fi pineapple a ton of cool
tools that have even been featured in
mr. robots and it's hosted by Darrell
they're in kitchen and what's her nails
are Shannon Morse
I love their channel I've learned so
much and Shannon Morse is a great host
because first of all she's approachable
in her delivery style and she seems
normal
yeah we're all nerds here that's cool
but she's not condescending she seems
socialized and she really talks about
cool topics as far as cyber security is
concerned and hacking you know a lot of
Linux stuff especially - if you're
interested in that a lot of Linux 101
stuff so again to recap the three
reasons I transition from cyber security
to more of a web development mind frame
and focus the web development track
number one it's definitely more creative
in cybersecurity you really set by the
rules and your you have to be proactive
and you also have to be reactive but
following rules there are a lot of rules
and to be honest at the end of the day
all the fun stuffs illegal number two is
a little harder to grow as an
entrepreneur in the cybersecurity field
as far as scaling your business goes and
growing your business because there is a
big trust factor that you have to
develop and that is not come overnight
whereas if you build an app you could be
a millionaire overnight that not that
I'm trying on that success strategy but
you guys know what I mean number three
just a different mindset with the crowd
in each field cybersecurity folks are
very smart
they're
very dedicated and they're very serious
and they have to be I totally understand
that but that's not my normal way of
thinking on a creative thinker I like to
have fun I do take security very
seriously
but there are times where I just want to
create something where it's just a total
goof and in the web development
community there's more people like me
who think like that who you know like to
whoop it up here and there I hope this
video was helpful for you whether you're
in cybersecurity or web development or
not either of those do not let this
video be the end-all be-all video for
you in making a decision this is just my
experience and let this be a little
slice of that pie when you're making a
decision or thinking more about pursuing
cybersecurity guys I hope this video was
helpful again thanks for watching we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
