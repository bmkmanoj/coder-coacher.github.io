together a portfolio that people care
about real tough candy from real chef
Danny calm back online with you today
coming in with gloves off no holds
barred for today's portfolio insight now
the portfolio is one of the main
components you're going to be sending
off to your employers it's the thing
that they're going to be clicking on
looking at investigating and I think now
this is my opinion but I've seen a lot
of portfolios the number one thing that
most developers don't do especially
junior developers they don't give
employers a reason to care they do not
give their projects context they do not
tell how their projects made an impact
they do not explain the thinking behind
the project they don't show what the
developer learned context is key for
your portfolio but instead of putting
people on blast and just being like a
little dink about it like oh look at
this portfolio it doesn't it suck I'm
gonna show you what I do this is the
portfolio that got me hired now the
content is a little different this is a
an older portfolio but this portfolio
got me a full stack web development job
okay so I'm only gonna be using my own
experience now one of the things that I
do with my projects it's go to the dev
spotlight most of you are familiar with
that or at least some of you now what
this is doing is giving each project
context it tells the person reading this
what was the problem the portlets the
challenge is the problem statement
here's my problem statement we have a
tech talent shortage as a common cry
among the media blah blah blah the
challenge for me is that there are so
many people in the media and outside the
media who are running around with their
heads cut off psyche oh my god start
edge like really because I have like six
people right here who are ready to rock
the world with their skills I know that
might not seem like a lot when there's
1.4 million
open dev jobs but it's a start okay so
that was that was my purpose that was
the
challenge that I was faced with like
counter counteracting that narrative
next we have the solution
now with the solution I described some
of the tech that I use such as jQuery
skeleton CSS great thing to use if
you're tired of bootstrap by the way and
then optimizing responsive web design
blah blah blah
accessibility things like Alice blue
instead of white to reduce eyestrain so
on and so forth so emphasizing the tech
that you implemented in your solution
because again you're going for a web
development job and you want to explain
how you develop the web finally the
outcome what was the result of your
proposed solution so after you deployed
your website it can be WordPress it
could be view react whatever it could be
totally from scratching me PHP the sky's
the limit
even if you're a graphic designer
whatever craft you're in state the
outcome what was the result
after you published your creative work
so here's my outcome the dev spotlight
series is an avant-garde take on design
with progressive enhancement for maximum
UX UI these developers now have a home
that is hip interactive and 100%
responsive explore the dev spotlight of
course you want to you want to give a
link to your project and this links to
the project here boom also notice too on
this portfolio site how it's pretty
minimal you're not trying to show you're
not trying to share your life story
you're trying to get people interesting
it's just like any other client or any
other user you want people to stick
around you want people to be curious
about you like oh what else is this
person up to make them go beneath the
fold here and see what all this is about
now notice too I put stuff that is
outside of actual coding and web
development because communication and
tech is very important as well this
piece right here is a little different
because I don't have a problem statement
or a challenge or an outcome rather it's
just kind of a little bonus because
again this isn't really related to
coding or actual web development but it
does highlight my skills that contribute
to web development it's not quite
full-fledged but all of my actual coding
projects web development projects are
full-fledged is a little bone
just a little janky tool that I
developed it's called fat finger and
again challenge solution and outcome in
the challenge was to develop something
visually for people who have large
fingers most portfolios that you see do
not give their projects context and
developers again have to emphasize this
you have to give employers a reason to
care or give them context show them why
you're passionate show them what you did
to overcome the problem and solve the
problem they want to see your thinking
process and they want to see how you
solve problems say it many times in this
channel web development isn't about
coding it's about solving problems show
them how you solve problems thanks for
watching I hope this video was helpful
and we'll see in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
