candy from real tough candy calm back in
the saddle with you today we are using
social engineering techniques to plan an
attack that's right we're getting our
deviant little paws dirty going on the
Internet
theoretically to collect information
about a company so we can destroy them
awesome let me give you a brief
introduction to this part of hacking and
social engineering I have to say is
probably one of the most if not the most
dismissed component of hacking because
people say oh anyone can do it or that
requires no technical skill well it does
require technical skill just not the
hard core you know buffer overflow type
of technical skills we may be used to
talking about in hacking so let me
explain to you the two types there are
two categories rather of attacks
there's the non targeted attack and then
there's the highly targeted attacks so
target attacks they might be an attack
against a class of targets like
hospitals or certain networks protected
by a certain company's firewalls or even
like I don't know Windows 2012 servers a
hacker can also target a single specific
target and that's what we're gonna be
doing today
so these nonspecific attacks on the
other hand they're termed attacks of
convenience just because it's like oh
here's a really big vulnerability let's
just you know let's just go do it I
don't want to say it's lazy obviously
there's a lot of energy put into all of
these attacks but they're still
generally considered attacks of
convenience and we're talking about
nonspecific attacks but the targeted
variety are called targeted attacks
who'd a thunk
a lot of times what hackers are going to
do is use the wide sweeping attack of
convenience they're gonna use that as a
starting point to gather information for
their specific attack and they're gonna
be uncovering vulnerabilities before
targeting that specific subject like I
don't know somebody in the banking
industry or whatever so again we are
targeting
certain company today I'm gonna give you
some more details on that I'm just a
mint but here is our scenario so we are
this this entity I don't know what our
name is new curl up and die 2017 or
something
we're shadowing this hacker we are an
aspiring black hat hacker and we've been
told we need to gather information on
this company in North Georgia we don't
know Georgia United States not the
country we don't know anything about
who's commissioning us to do this it
could be a competitor it could be a
scorned lover I don't know at this point
I'm getting paid big bucks so I don't
really care so let's talk about what
we're gonna be doing in this lab you
know I know these PDFs don't look sexy
but it's not about just rolling through
them and looking at them but we're gonna
be picking out particular pieces how's
that for alliteration of pertinent
information what we can do what what can
we extract from these to create a
specific target and a specific picture
to help us engage in this attack and get
what we want
ooh it's gonna be good so the first part
we're gonna be social engineering we're
not actually again this is simulated I'm
not gonna be calling anybody or breaking
any laws this is all in a virtual
machine totally legal the computer did
consent ooh that sounds dirty so that's
gonna be the first part and the second
part is going to be reverse social
engineering and in that reverse social
engineering we're gonna learn the
importance of open source Intel that's I
mean it's it's pretty cool it's pretty
cool I will say this so enough
blathering and blabbering you know I did
have to go through that just to give
some context to what we're doing
otherwise it's gonna be like well why
are you doing this doesn't make any damn
sense okay so here are our goals by the
time you're finished with this but I
totally wrap it up hopefully we can
recognize some of the key
characteristics of a social engineering
attack ID key signs a reverse social
engineering attack describe the
differences and similarities of an
attack of convenience and a targeted
attack and then finally
if we are of the white hat variety
implement countermeasures to social and
reverse social engineering attacks so
let's get to it Celina the cat is here
purring and very excited to do this lab
as well mmm
even cat so let's go to the first part
we were going to be targeting the social
engineering attack so again like I said
not as sexy as I don't know buffer
overflow as an example I gave in the
last when I was blabbering on before so
anyways we are gonna be shadowing the
cyber criminal guy right who specializes
in social engineering techniques and he
gave us this documentation he's like
here read this do this and burn after
reading I was like alright so again this
is a fictitious company but the
documentation my mentor gave me the
cyber criminal is that the organization
I have to do research on a recon
reconnaissance is global enterprises and
they're located in Dalton Georgia so I
have been hired they're paying me to
collect information just enough to
enable an attack on their email system
so obviously the email server is gonna
be protected by your bio firewall so
right away there's two components I'm
needing to target I need to find out
what type of email server they're using
and I need to find out what kind of
firewall they're using so first of all
the first step in this mission is to
just google this company to make sure
it's the right one they have a pretty
global name no no fancy stuff here
global enterprises huh what do you know
so we are going to click on the PDF here
so they this lab has already compiled
all the pertinent information we have
but you know in the real world
obviously we log on Google and just
Google their name so let's say we just
pop up and said oh here's a global
enterprises
is this the one is this the one we have
a cute
baby I believe he's trying to socially
socially engineer me as we speak because
he's pretty freaking cute oh I'm losing
focus this this was definitely a planned
attack this is a counter-attack on me as
a shadow hacker so we are trying to find
out where this step right here we're
trying to confirm if this global
enterprises is the one I'm trying to
hack cuz global enterprises it's not
like real tough candy on YouTube I mean
there's only one of me global
enterprises there's probably a more than
one so I don't know where this is
located right this home page doesn't
give me much it could be in Singapore I
don't know
so I'm saying man go back let's what is
the contact page on global enterprises
okay all we're trying to do is find the
location global enterprises has been
confirmed let's say we clicked on the
contact and this is what pops up their
contact page here oh why do you know all
their contact information including
where they are located Enterprise Drive
in Dalton Georgia they also have their
sales email and support email there
which is you know in 2017 you'd think
this would be rare and rare to see a
published email or published emails
online I actually see it all the time in
small to mid-sized companies because
here's the thing
these small companies don't think it'll
happen to that happen to them it's
incredible anyways I don't want to get
on a big tangent but just personal
research and personal experience doing
that just not hacking but you know
researching these are a lot more
published than you might anticipate
don't ever think there aren't hundreds
of thousands of juicy targets out there
because they're there so Dalton Georgia
is pretty small global enterprises the
odds of more than one global enterprises
being in Dalton Georgia slim to none
plus their website is like global
enterprises in comms so I mean it's
99.99999%
this is them and again I don't know
who's paying me to do this it could be
competitor and ex maybe they want to
derail this company there might be a
personal motive I don't know the why is
not important the why is interesting I'm
fascinated I want to know who's my sure
daddy but you know what for this it's
not it's not pertinent maybe I can think
about it on my own time what is
important is to learn about this target
so we've confirmed this company Global
enterprises is in Dalton Georgia ok now
we want to find out more we've confirmed
our target exists and you know what
here's a really good idea too if you
guys are doing this because you're gonna
be coming across a lot of websites
create a folder on your local machine
where these screenshots ooh I just love
the sound of that camera where's my
contact page and now these screenshots
oh don't do this to me oh this is
buzzing my harsh please that came out
totally the way I meant it - it is
definitely buzzing my harsh okay well
point being I definitely would take a
screenshot of everything I plan on using
and a later date
unfortunately this virtual machine is
being a pain in my ass okay so I want to
do this well awesome and we are gonna be
going on to the next step so now I have
their screen I have a screenshots of
those and I want to find out more about
these people who work here you know more
importantly what's the server and what's
your firewall because I want to get into
your excuse me pardon the language
but you know what if I'm gonna be
gangster I'm gonna be breaking the law
I gotta be a little rough I gotta play
the part I can't just be like this
limp-dick guy or gal who's just like
yeah you got to be aggressive you got to
get it so we're gonna go over to who is
dotnet now this if this virtual machine
will stop being a Panama but so here is
is the Whois information for global
enterprises now unfortunately there's
not a lot of stuff I can use on here
registrant email who is privacy protect
comm guys you're gonna find this a lot
if you're using who is there maybe the
rare bird where you're gonna find good
information because a lot of it is
masked I know when I registered my
domains it was included in the price it
was like twelve bucks to register the
domain and then to make your Whois
information anonymous it was just
included in the package the twelve
dollar deal however one thing I do want
to screenshot here for further use
perhaps I mean I'm not I'm not it's not
priority but there's a name server here
there's actually two name servers and a
tech email I don't know if I'll ever
need that tech phone who knows but you
never know but overall there's not a lot
of useful information here as far as
getting me the information that I need
to plan this attack so we're gonna keep
going the reason I'm taking a screenshot
oh please stop being an elephant the
reason I took a screenshot oh my god
okay guys what you saw where I took the
screenshot is this even gonna work don't
do this to me so that making me look
like a bigger fool so I took a
screenshot right here right the reason
because in the future I could possibly
once I you know hone in on my skills I
could plan a DNS poisoning or some kind
of DNS attack so you never know if
you're gonna need it the worst case
scenario just delete it you know small
file whatever no bigs but hey if I can
launch a DNS poisoning attack and get
paid for it probably gonna do it on a
black hat so we reached a dead end with
this who is all right so what have we
done so far we went to the global
enterprises website
we got their contact information and
adobe has stopped working and then we
went to who with is okay I'm out of debt
and I'm just like maybe I need a
cigarette break
I'm smoking now in a black hat I can do
these things I feel so empowered so now
oh and now it wants me to abort
where are my rights so now I'm
contacting my mentor my my hacker mentor
friend so now he's telling me to use
social engineering and open-source Intel
tools this way I'm not intruding I mean
if it's online in its open source why
not maximize it so that's what we're
gonna do
they also this documentation this little
manual I was given by agent a is telling
me that publicly traded companies a
great source of open source Intel is to
download the Security and Exchange
Commission's 10k report and annual
report to stockholders right here
because this is a manual and that it
contains valuable documents because
these this this compilation this report
these reports they have information like
officers of the company their financial
state legal settlements short and long
term development plans so this could be
powerful stuff but unfortunately because
global enterprises is small can't access
them through the SEC report
so let's look somewhere else it's the
internet for God's sakes they're gonna
be out there you just have to hone it in
a little more so most of you are
familiar with the website linked in this
is exactly why I don't have a LinkedIn
profile because a lot of times it will
be used to socially engineer you now for
this exercise there's a little knockoff
linked in
website it's called get connected so
what I did I went ahead and logged on to
get connected and I searched for global
enterprises located in Georgia and these
people's names popped up and Lawrence
Steve Burns
Ravi purim Heath Anderson Luanne
Garfinkel the one and only and last but
not least Bryan Smyth is there one more
nope so this is how this is these are
the people I need to focus on because
these people have my information the
question is how do I hone in on the one
of my top picks I want to prioritize I
want to prioritize these people based on
who is the weakest link who has the most
information who likes to talk who is the
blabbermouth and how can I best socially
engineer that person now this is
something they're not gonna tell you in
this lab but for me personally I have a
better time talking to men not because I
wear some low-cut top and 12 inch
stiletto heels although in some
circumstances that might help in some
circumstances that might not help but I
you know for me personally when I'm
trying to do these things in simulated
environments of course but just in
general I mean I'm not talking about a
socially engineering social engineering
thing but getting information
legitimately I have a hard time
connecting with female baby boomers for
some reason I don't know they think I'm
a smartass and they just they look at me
weird whereas with guys they're a lot
more open you know open more open
sources of communication open open lines
of communication is what I meant to say
it's easier for me to communicate with
them and vice versa so that said I would
probably for me it would have to be a
combination of somebody a type I knew I
could get information from where we
could develop a rapport and also
somebody who works on his apartment
who's gonna give me the information what
kind of freaking server do you have and
what's your firewall now I see a few
guys on
but I'm not it's not really doing it for
me now I saw this guy named Heath but my
hacker friend told me that he used to be
a cop at the LAPD I was like to scratch
that do it off the list so the systems
development he's the assistant director
at systems development so my idea and my
my wish of connecting with somebody who
I know I can get along with better than
other people has been vanquished so now
I'm gonna focus on exactly what these
people's positions are and find out who
is the loudmouth there's always at least
one in every company who it's either
their official title or you can find out
some other way but we're gonna find out
since this is non-intrusive we're gonna
find out in some other way and the first
person who pops out is this woman and
Laurence why because she's a recruiter
and recruiters interface with the public
every day their job is to talk and make
the company look good they want to
please potential candidates and also
she's a Training Manager
that means she do she bottom line up
front this woman has a lot to say and a
lot of it is solid information so right
now she's on the top of my list she's
priority one so let's eliminate some
people here we're gonna eliminate Ravi
because he lives in Chicago and he used
to be at global enterprises so see who
else who else Steve burns PMP project
manager pro he seems a little too smart
and a little too up top he seemed a
little too high in the food chain for me
to even access him Heath Andersen is the
guy who used to cop so he's down on the
totem pole Lulu and Garfinkel now here's
the thing about LuAnn she's a director
of global IT at global enterprises she
is in the home goods industry and she
used to be assistant director of IT at
rugs for us I don't know if she's
referring to
pays or actual throw it on the carpet
and don't spill juice not sure don't
care because not only does she have a
unique name
Luanne Garfinkel come on there's
probably only one maybe two maybe she
also has a photo which is gonna make it
easier to to identify her in other
context Bryan smize now that's a really
common name and he's director of
business development at global
enterprises not really I don't know it's
not really in the field I'm looking for
she's a director she has to know what's
going on at all time she's getting paid
six figures and not on the bottom end of
it she's getting paid the big commander
bucks baby that's right
someone bumped Luanne man I'm bumping
Luanne to the top of my list even though
like I said before for some reason baby
boomer women a lot of times they think
I'm a smart ass but I'm just gonna have
to fake it till I make it and be
pleasant if in fact we have the chance
to talk
I might actually you know what this is
my life and I'm the hacker so I might
just actually hire a well-spoken male a
charming charismatic man to talk to
LuAnn Garfinkel in my scheme of things
so we are gonna be taking Luanne for
tops and then the other woman and
Lawrence now whether by coincidence or
not the two women in this list are in
the top two positions are women more
easily socially engineered I don't think
so I think it depends a lot on sexual
politics like I've been explaining for
the past 15 minutes here and there which
is neither here nor there because we're
moving on because I need more
information so I have my people okay I'm
just gonna go like this
and now I am going to go back to this
knockoff LinkedIn site I'm gonna go to
their homepage and I'm gonna see you
know actually I'm gonna cut I'm gonna
try and connect with LuAnn Garfinkel I'm
gonna phone
fire up a fake profile because I know on
LinkedIn you can't look unless you're
registered just it's not that hard just
just whip up a fake one in a few minutes
so where is our profile file where we
can check out Luanne Oh Luanne missus
dire think oh here she is
boom this is the woman identity
confirmed
so she's a top information tech
professional at global enterprises since
2009 this woman knows her stuff
2010 recipient of Top Contributors award
frequent speaker at conferences and user
groups guys do not let this mundane
information escape you if you're getting
paid enough you're gonna be going to one
of her speaking engagements how how
important is it to find out what this
firewall is and what the server is and
even more information for other attacks
how important is it I don't know ask the
guy who's paying you because with this
information you could go to one of her
conferences and strike up a conversation
afterwards or one of many other
combinations she also writes a blog IT
insights we have hid hacking gold
she is currently pursuing an MBA there
is another attack vector what's what's
cool is she going to normally on
LinkedIn people do bless a brag but you
know people list their credentials where
did you learn
that's another vector schools oh my god
they're one of well we won't go there
but he keeps schools a top of your
attack vector list because they are
incredibly easy to find someone who will
give you information everything you need
to know holy crap married with two high
school-aged daughters Oh Lou and come on
you've been in IT for twenty years what
are you doing telling people telling the
world you have two high school-aged
daughters what an idiot so she writes
this blog i t-- insights and you know
what we're not gonna waste any time
let's go right over to IT insights let's
go to her page now this is her blog
musings and
observations from an IT insider guys we
didn't have to do anything invasive we
simply use the power of the search
engine your search engine of choice to
find this woman to disclose everything
we need to know to wage a very serious
attack on her company this is golden
we you are welcome and invited to
comment on my post and to share your own
thoughts insights and observations well
LuAnn I'd hate to call names but you're
acting like a real idiot that's really
harsh but in this day and age I think
look I guess I need to rewind I am being
harsh because a lot of people just don't
know I don't know I don't if she knew
better do you think she'd be doing this
I don't think so dude I I don't know the
woman but I feel like she's been in the
business long enough where she truly
thought she was putting her company into
jeopardy she would not publish this so
I'm going to assume that this is an act
of ignorant not an act of sabotage
because she is effectively giving away
her company's trade secrets I don't know
if it's a trade secret but her company
sensitive information she's telling us
right here she chose a pfSense 2.0
firewall during a live install it stuck
at trying to mount route from UF SWFs
pfSense zero oh my god LuAnn I couldn't
have written it better myself
so you guys know the drill I'm gonna
take a little screenshot of this and
it's gonna go in my little dossier on my
home machine my host well my home
machine rather so let's get out of there
because there's more to come Oh LuAnn is
a very prolific writer in fact she even
talks about her open-source exploits and
I don't mean exploiting I mean her
foibles she's talking about if open
source makes sense in
this entry from November 29th 2013
talking about how she moved from a real
solid name brand firewall to pfSense
migrated to to a BYOD policy that saves
money and have migrated to an open
source mail server Luanne you are money
you are money baby you are money and I
didn't even have to talk to you you are
money thank you and thank you
the problem with people knowing so much
is that they have a real problem keeping
it to themselves I know for me
hell I've almost done 200 videos and a
lot of them are tech related because I'm
so excited to share my knowledge now
fortunately none of that a sensitive
information
however when you've been in the business
for 21 years there's a lot of stuff
that's sensitive that probably maybe
your brain is just scrambled or you
don't I can't believe how can you just
not know any better how can you say
being a veteran I'm hitting my computer
oh my god I'm getting four klimt this is
the jackpot oh my god guys oh yeah
this is this two-pager yep getting
before goes oh my goodness oh my
goodness so there we have it
thanks to LuAnn we have the name of the
email server we have the or excuse me we
have the type of mail server we even
have the exact name of the firewall
pfSense is a pretty good firewall
yes LuAnn knows that too let's exit but
we're not done because now that we have
all of that information we're going to
get some more information on that
pfsense firewall because the odds are
that global enterprises you know they're
an IT firm IT related they probably well
who really knows but let's just assume
they you know do regular updates so
we're gonna do a little update or rather
a Google search on the current version
that they are theoretically using not
gonna do it here but that's what we
would do just to get a little more
information so again going back to that
conference thing probably on her blog
somewhere she's gonna have a conference
schedule check her Twitter check her
social media I don't know baby boomers
really don't do Twitter but you never
know somewhere on the internet probably
on her beloved blog she's mentioning
leaving traces of information behind in
a variety of places never thinking that
someone else would be trying to connect
the pieces together Luanne Garfinkel
okay we are going to move on because
right now you have our information and
we are going to engage in our targeted
reverse social engineering attack now in
regular social engineering the social
engineer approaches the subject and
attempts to extract information or to
get the subject to take some action that
will cause the desired information to be
to be revealed however in our situation
I didn't even have to contact her on the
other hand social engineering is when
you set up circumstances that cause the
subject to approach the social engineer
and revealed reveal the desired
information so excited can't even speak
it happens a lot in the real tough candy
Channel guys let's reverse the social
engineer this woman and I can so many
things I could say right now but this
woman I mean really LuAnn what are you
thinking what think so here's what's
happening my mentor this guy you know
he's been he's been doing the blackhat
thing for some time he's making this
educated guess right because he looked
over her her getconnected profile which
is the knockoff of LinkedIn so he's
guessing that LuAnn probably left her
old job at assist as an assistant
director of IT over at
who pays or us or whatever it was for
her new job which is you know director
of global IT for a promotion it was only
was promotion based so this woman we're
creating a psychological profile this
let's go back to this woman just so I
can show you this woman is a career
woman she's driven she keeps a blog
going on i.t insights on firewalls for
God's sakes she's a nerd and she loves
her job and she's committed she also
likes making money she's crawling she's
climbing up that promotional chain and
she's ready for another promotion she's
been in this current position since 2009
man she's getting some cobwebs on her
it's time to give Luanne what she wants
we are gonna give her the opportunity of
a lifetime because we are gonna place
some ads targeting Luanne you know
Millennials and Gen Xers largely don't
read newspapers anymore but people like
LuAnn and Luann's husband do and the
odds are she's gonna come across the
Help Wanted section I don't mean Help
Wanted
I mean Help Wanted I hope you noticed
the emphasis so let's go to the ad okay
we've created this profile based
exclusively on the information LuAnn has
given us so we're gonna be placing this
in area papers major paper surrounding
Dalton Georgia including the Atlanta
journal-constitution
Chattanooga Times Free Press and the
Northeast Georgian print and online
editions just in case they're reading
the paper online wanted VP of global
information technology for North Georgia
manufacturer great comm skills and the
ability to work with board of directors
middle twenty years experience and
related degree salary commensurate
commensurate with experience is not
going to say that I know how to read it
I just never gonna pronounce it I'm not
qualified to be a hacker just yet
serious inquiries only contact Hollyoaks
there is room number
one thing I would add I mean I'm not the
boss here I have a I have a hacker
mentor in this theoretical situation I
try and do like a targeted ad on the
knockoff LinkedIn account that she's on
all the time because you know she's
always oh I just completed a cost and
now I'm doing whatever so I tried a
social engineer to see where website
with some websites would be where she is
on what what does she access where does
she frequent what does she frequent
online and then place try and get like
an Adsense ad on there or something
advertising this job but that's just me
this might just work like a charm so the
end of this story the social engineering
says this is what happened so LuAnn not
only responded to this ad but she
submitted her resume via email as
requested and went through what seemed
to be a normal hiring process but think
again because my hacker friend was the
guy who set this up the guy paid paid
for this act he put this ad to target to
reverse engineer LuAnn Garfinkel so this
guy my my hacker friend my hacker mentor
interviews LuAnn right and she reveals
all the specific information about the
technology in place at global
enterprises so otherwise this
information be really hard to gather but
she was loving it she loved spilling to
the interviewer who was a hacker and
then the final interview was held at a
downtown hotel that we organized with a
quote-unquote corporate recruiter
because that was that was what LuAnn was
told and the reason that we got away
with that was because the prospective
employer this was a story anyway didn't
want to reveal its identity for reasons
of confidentiality so LuAnn was like
alright cool I understand that we also
assured her that job offers would come
directly from the company and so that's
the other reason we got away with using
an email address that was like you know
the Hollyoaks at gmail.com because we
didn't want to give away we want to keep
his company confidential
and so this is what happened in the end
after we got that information Luanne was
contacted by this recruiter and
basically told that the individual that
she was gonna replace that Luanne was
gonna replace he had decided to put off
retirement for another year but Luanne
left us pretty impressed and expect a
phone call within the year she did not
realize it but we were using burner cell
phones that were discarded after we got
her information the email address was a
burner account was an anonymous account
and she was oh that is the end of this
lab she was pwned
now there is one a final blurb on how to
avoid these things this documentation
said the answer is awareness training
and constant vigilance well no freaking
DAW
they also say something about like
giving rewards if you snitch I don't
know I don't even know if that's I don't
know if I agree with that I don't even
know if that's if that helps anything
one thing I do know is that you should
never trust somebody unless you have a
good reason to and never give
information unless there is a compelling
reason to now poor LuAnn was suckered
into it but going back to do not
disclose information unless you're given
a compelling reason to LuAnn were you
given a compelling reason to disclose
your firewall despite our aside from
getting maybe a few cents from people
clicking on your blog no you weren't
keep this to yourself boy hey I'm
crusing my blood pressure I don't know
if I can guys I can't hack being a black
hacker this is too much anyways I hope
this video was helpful it did go on for
a little bitch but guess what we did
explore a lot of things and guys the
biggest thing through all of this you
see we used many different sources to
weave
and snatch up various information to
construct a profile for Luanne and get
her and construct this this trail of
breadcrumbs so that she would follow us
and contact us and we got all the
information we needed oh did we ever and
we have enough information for further
attacks too I mean this is this could be
a multi-million dollar thing depending
on how good we are so all this goes
hopefully I mean I wish I could go
without saying that this is for
educational purposes only I always love
doing this stuff it's so fun it does
raise my blood pressure just because I
cannot believe people like I said I
can't believe that people still disclose
this information are they truly ignorant
or is it some insider thing or they're
just that confident they won't get
hacked I don't know what do you guys
think
thanks for watching this I hope it was
helpful social engineering techniques to
plan an attack good stuff out there guys
thanks for watching we'll see the next
