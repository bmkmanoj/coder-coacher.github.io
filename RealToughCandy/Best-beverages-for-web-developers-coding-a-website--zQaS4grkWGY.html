come back online for 2018 with you today
taking a look at some of my favorite
drinks while I'm coding now I use pink
soda I used to drink a lot of really
good beer that is to say high in
calories because I love my IPAs but
these drinks are all low calorie low
sugar and just wanted to share a few
with you today if you have a job where
you're sitting down a lot you gotta have
something to keep you entertained you
know what I mean you can't be drinking
coffee all day although we will get to
that one in a minute but I'm gonna start
over here because these are my absolute
favorite go-to beverages some of you may
have heard of them kombucha oh yes at
first you may think they're a little
vinegary or a little funky they're very
fizzy this one you can see pretty much
everywhere across America
maybe overseas to gt's I also like the
raw live sodas on this guy's from Austin
and he does colas he does a dr. pepper
knockoff he does a ginger one which I
don't really care for this one is really
good again kind of an acquired taste it
doesn't taste just like soda but it has
not very many calories I think it has
okay the whole bottle has 35 calories
and not very much sugar either eight
grams of sugar for the whole bottle this
is a gt's one two huge bottle I get
these sometimes because you get halfway
through and it kind of loses on the fizz
factor but every now and then and I love
my ginger
pingzhi a recent one I just found
blackberry very fizzy fizzy er then GTS
I don't know how good they're distros
they're from Colorado I haven't seen
this one out very much but if you see
the big Z this is very good and it's
like I said very fizzy all these
kombucha 's have probiotics enzymes and
electrolytes in them they're very good
for you I could leak out about the
process of how kombucha is made I used
to make it save it for another video
Lucroy look Cola this is another Cola
alternative it tastes really good and it
has zero calories zero sugar nice
cinnamon battle right here
Bragg's I gotta be honest I don't really
care for this but it's really good for
you it's apple cider vinegar vibrant
and he he's the man brag is the man it's
a ginger spice flavor you can see held
like the ginger particles down there
zero calories but it's vinegar so kind
of has a funky taste I used to drink a
lot of flavored smart waters they have a
lot of sugar this one has zero calories
or sugar it's just a sparkling smart
water I love my fizz ease and then
finally we have our coffees over here
cameron's I'm showing this one because
it's organic and I got it for five bucks
it is only 10 ounces but for five
dollars $4.99 you can't go wrong for an
organic coffee and it's very strong very
good if you like your coffee and the can
we have the cadence cold brew these guys
are out of Madison Wisconsin and it's a
nitro so it's really creamy if you
decide to pour it in a glass I'm kind of
a treat and this isn't and this isn't an
everyday beverage for me but every now
and then I'm in the mood for a cold brew
coffee not really much in the winter
months but as it gets warmer and this
has zero sugars and three grams of carbs
how many calories of sap zero
yes 0:17 calories I'd have no idea how I
got those 17 calories all these are low
sugar low carb low calorie drinks and
they're really freakin good so if you're
sitting down all day you don't have to
be a developer necessarily and you like
sodas you like Starbucks and you know
sugary coffee drinks check some of these
out I want to hear what you guys think
of combo just because some people are
like oh I can't stand it I started off
my channel this very channel doing
kombucha reviews before I started doing
web development
alright guys signing off real Jeff candy
real Jeff Kenny calm revamped website so
many new things coming up for the new
year I'm working on a udemy course 25
JavaScript interview questions these are
the most popular questions you see
everywhere and they're explained in
depth so it's not just the surface
solving the problems I think a lot of
you guys are really going to benefit
from this course I'm super excited to
share it
shout out to diversity media shout out
to coding phase two guys who have really
been promoting this channel I really
appreciate it it's a great feeling to
know that people watch the channel
people and not just that people enjoy it
so thanks again
and hopefully doing a collabo soon with
some youtubers got to get back on with
that but details on that coming up code
