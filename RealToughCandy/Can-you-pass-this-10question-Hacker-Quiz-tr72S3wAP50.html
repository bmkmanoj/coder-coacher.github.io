replicates I could've been doing this
the whole time oh my gosh you guys are
like real tough candy you're so dumb

big progress with learning how to use a
computer it's pretty sweet which of the
following terms best describes a person
with very little skill yes best question
of the whole quiz is that a hacker a
script kiddie a cracker or wannabe I
want to take a minute out of this quiz
or maybe just 15 seconds to note they do
include the term cracker in here which
if you read 2,600 i'm pretty sure people
who are hardcore subscribers to that
subculture would probably kill you using
a computer if you called them crackers
because crackers are the real bad guys
hackers are the people who want to know
more about computers man crack your PIN
Jesus okay so the answer who is the
idiot with all of these well cracker is
a good guess but no the answer is Rick
katy b they copy and paste code don't
know what the hell are doing well they
do know what they're doing the problem
