tough candy calm how's it going out
there today we are exploring Metasploit
getting it set up on our Mac machine
ready to rock and roll Metasploit is one
of the most powerful tools in pen
testing and ethical hacking even
unethical hacking if you happen to spray
that way but for all intents and
purposes we're going to be the good guys
in this one so the first step in getting
this set up is you want to navigate over
to rapid 7 comps this is where we're
going to go to get that free addition so
go ahead and just navigate over to free
tools let that go and then we're going
to go down here Metasploit free download
and then they're going to have two
options here Metasploit Pro which is
being $5,000 we don't want to snap we
don't want to do the Community Edition
either we're going to go to view all
editions and then you're going to want
to go to the framework go ahead and
click the free download on framework and
this brings us to rapid 7s and
Metasploit framework to github page and
so there's two options here if you're
comfortable with the command line and
doing all that rigmarole just go ahead
and do your thing right there otherwise
you can go down here and you can do a
manual installation by simply clicking
this and it will lead you through all
the steps for setting it up and getting
it on your machine you know just
defining where you want it to go and all
that good stuff so all once all that is
done we are going to start it up so
first of all let's just find out where
we got here okay where my home base here
so we want to change the directory to
find Metasploit and this is where it is
on my local machine so I simply hit
change directory and now we are going to
Metasploit and now we're not quite
finished I'm going to hit
s to show me what's available and I
actually want to go to the console and
Metasploit framework columns console so
I'm going to type stop / MS console wait
for her to fire off hvar and so you guys
like i said you might be uncomfortable
using a command-line interface but try
and give it a whirl
even if this looks overwhelming right
now it's even if you're just playing
around with a few commands super fun to
explore even tech even if you just want
a new banner very entertaining so cool
but anyways that is neither here nor
there that's just for kicks
so right away we're like okay we've got
this cool funny cow that's lowing
Metasploit but now what so to the finder
option just go ahead and click the
question mark go ahead and hit return
these are the magic words we have job
command module commands core command
let's see what else can we do resource
script command database back-end
commands credentials back-end commands
one thing I want to add - I already have
this installed on my machine but once
you guys change directories and go to
your framework it's going to ask you two
questions about if you want to install
is it a database or something I have
memory of a goldfish but it's going to
ask you two or three questions and if
you want to set up a database or space
for a database or whatever that's
totally up to you it's you simply hit Y
for yes and for no it's pretty
straightforward and self-explanatory but
just wanted to add that so here's our
info let's see how let's let's check out
some excellent so if you want to see all
the exploits available to us now this is
the real top guys this is a real deal
it's going to show us a list of exploits
contributed to Metasploit I think there
are and it did say up here before the
moving
split town so there's currently 1628
exploits and they're updated usually but
that's not how I meant to say that they
are updated regularly so you can find an
exploit to fit your fancy and if this
takes a while don't worry because
there's so many exploits to gather if
this thing is blinking chill out for a
minute because it's going to just
experience things and it will pop up
briefly will briefly pop up Wow my
adjectives are going in all the wrong
places today let's see here ah here we
are
so after we gave that exploit the
command shell exploits these are the
names of the exploit this over a little
bit not really so these are the names of
the exploits this is the date it was
disclosed this is ranking and this
description so we have stuffer and just
preliminarily we can see this stuff for
energized this stuff for Samsung Apple
mobile awesome stuff in all of these
like I said there's sixteen hundred some
as of March 13th 2017 always being added
if ever the skits too overwhelming you
can just pick and clear and that will
it'll keep you in we're still in coups
MS one I just
oops I guess we are on the console my
bad
so anyways what are some other things
that can so let's go back to actually
you know what I was search for specific
exploits I'm going to type in search
gosh
what do I want to search for what about
something with a router I really like
messing with router so let's search for
routers oh look at that guy's mmm real
tech okay that's in the name of Netgear
not that interesting now there's a
command here that you can get info on so
let's copy and paste this Netgear oh
this one that has an excellent rating so
let me go here and copy and paste it I
want to get more information on this I'm
going to type in info and I'm in a
command via paste and then this is the
explanation of the exploit so some
Netgear routers are vulnerable to
authenticated OS command injection this
the vulnerability exists in the web
interface this is clearly the setup that
cgi component when handling the TTL
parameter interesting there's some
references here and also up here there's
usually the name of the person who
discovered this or provided it
so Michael Messner and one Vasquez
discovered this and contributed it to
this database which is pretty cool so
you can see how useful this is for a
white hat hacker a pen tester and also
for the bad guys and also for the guys
who do a little bit of both the gray has
see yeah this is an incredible tool and
there's so much you can do again just
going back to hitting the question mark
and seeing all of these commands and
guys there's this one guy out there his
name's mobic servant move X sorry musics
mo bi X he is on hack 5 but the YouTube
channel check him out he does a little
segment called Metasploit minute and
he's always dropping some jewels so
check out his videos over at hack 5 hak5
can't say enough about that awesome
and he presents them in little
digestible segments so it's not like
okay here's two hours of Metasploit like
c'mon dude you're killing me but there
you know there's five six seven minutes
and he used the focuses on one component
he always focuses on one component of
Metasploit so it's very helpful so
anyways guys this is just getting
started the basics again you want to go
to that oops wrong size go on to that
rapid7 Metasploit framework github page
get the code for terminal or rather the
script or simply click it and go through
the setup and you guys will be good to
go within minutes such a fun program I'm
looking forward to testing more with it
using the command line alright guys
thanks for watching and hope this video
was helpful we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
