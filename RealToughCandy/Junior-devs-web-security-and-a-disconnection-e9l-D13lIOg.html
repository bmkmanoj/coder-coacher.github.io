title of something you might find on an
adult website and if these aspiring
coders aren't careful they might end up
on that website do basic information
security precautions in tech today on
the real tough candy channel not in
service perfect all right guys I might
have been a waste any time with my
fireside chats that I love to do so much
with you I'm going to hop right on my
computer this is the laboratory so we're
on Google right I'm going to go through
exactly why putting out your personal
information is a very bad idea on the
Internet okay let me just tell you
something real quick everything that
goes on the internet stays on the
Internet
that in mind let's explore junior
developer job GIPSA oh look top hit
junior dev jobs comm let's click on it
and see what we get
find your first dev job for bootcamp
grads college special students at OCS
means right the self-taught programmers
okay so for people with a college degree
self-taught and boot camps that pretty
much encompasses everyone we have some
featured jobs here for junior devs oh
this list looking really good for junior
devs who are fresh out the camp fresh
out the self-taught mode or fresh out to
college right so here we have our
featured profiles hello
those HTML CSS JavaScript Samuel we have
Matthew Kyle Aaron blah blah blah okay
that's all well and good right I mean
what kind of risk could that be it's
just their first and last name and
besides they're trying to get their name
out there to get a damn job well here's
where the problem comes in let's go
explore this person's profile hello
there
he is currently searching for an
entry-level position as a front-end web
developer or web designer sounds like a
lot of us in the same situation right
like we're all trying to get a job we
maybe know some front-end
stuff design so here's about him here's
his skills you know some JavaScript
Google Maps Jas etc Ajax of vanilla Jas
all right
trace all of his projects he's been
working on not too shabby
but then we go to the resume and would
you look at that his email his social
media his phone number even his address
now it's not his full address but that's
really not the point right now because I
found two other people who I'm going to
have to blur out but you can easily go
on this website and find them they have
their full address and let's go back to
this guy's profile now he has his
professional experience on here ie
his former employers alright and I'm
seeing companies here I'm seeing a
company that has a lot of competition
now right now you're probably thinking
first of all relative kami why do you
got to be such dick going on to this
website and blowing up these people's
spots let me tell you something because
this is the best video that's ever
happened this junior dev jobs board this
is a security nightmare because
these people will be eventually if it
hasn't already happened socially
engineered and their information will be
used against them don't ever put your
address with your name with your former
employers on the internet without some
sort of security measure this has open
for everybody I'm not even a member of
this website sorry for raising my blood
pressure right there but this is
absolutely unacceptable
like I said did I say this I can't
remember I don't have a short-term
memory on account of what I just
experienced I'm not even a member of
this and I can see all this stuff do you
know what a treasure trove this is for
social engineers do you know how easy
would be to reverse socially engineer
these folks I'm not trying to victim
blame but you junior devs out there who
are putting your information in the open
like this not a good thing it's going to
bite you in the butt and it's not going
to feel very good
I had my social security number stolen
by some guy or gal in Utah who used
to open up a Comcast account
oops there it was the f-word as pissed
off as I am at that guy where did I go
wrong
putting that social security number in
one of these applications or websites
not trying to tell anybody what to do
but this is a really bad idea let's take
this one simple step further and then I
think I've proven my point there's
nothing stopping me from calling any of
these people up posing as a tech
recruiter and the thing is I can get
away with it because I have a really
good accent as in I sound American
because I'm American I'm also a female
which lends to my credibility I have a
soothing voice people trust me I can
easily call these people posing as a
recruiter and probably get their social
security number credit card information
and company details of their former
employers before the phone conversation
is over
don't think I can let's have a chat
bottom line guys like I said I don't
want to tell you what to do but you got
to be careful putting this information
out in the open because there's not a
lot of friendly people on the Internet
you know when you go on the internet you
lock your car doors lock your car doors
when you're on these websites junior dev
Jobs is probably trying to really help
these people but in the end they're
setting them up for disaster
I sent a tweet to junior dev Jobs asking
them what was their motivation for
putting all of this in the open I mean
you don't even have to have an account
to look at their credentials addresses
where they'll is I was on Google Maps
looking at the seagulls like real tough
candy come on you're not 14 I think but
again they probably don't mean any
ill-will they're trying to help people
but there really is no compelling reason
to have these things out in the open
