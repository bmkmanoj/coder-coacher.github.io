my transition I was Facebook's youngest
engineer at age 13 totally kidding I
could do this video getting prepared to
do this video tooling around YouTube and
I see this kid who's making absence he
was 13 and he was Facebook's youngest
engineer at an ungodly young age I mean
he still I don't even think the kid
graduated high school anywhere for
Facebook so you know going from that to
the video about to do today I was
thinking I'm I'm a failure why do I even
try why am I even out of bed real tough
candy just just go back just just go
home nothing you have dialed is not in
service
perfect I'm the smallest little thing
eventually add up into something that is
a cohesive massive application website
or whatever you're trying to build it
doesn't have to do with tech so the
topic today is gradient and you may be
thinking okay gradients that's great I
know how to use them but I just wanted
to show you guys the implementation of
them as compared to a solid background
and if you have no idea what I'm talking
about
that's even better because we are going
to be starting from about 20% not
scratch I did pre code some stuff before
we start the video here but this is
going to be for beginner beginners not
not quite fresh beginners but you know a
few days in to more advanced beginners
and intermediates and maybe if you're an
advanced user of UI UX stuff might be a
good refresher let's stop chatting for a
sec and go to this website now that's
what's the website that kind of turned
me on to gradients and how they really
can make your backgrounds pop and any
other for example you can use gradients
and buttons but we'll get to that in a
minute so UI gradients dot-com this is
the SCOOTER gradient and for those of
you who don't know the gradient takes
one color and transitions it to another
color by the time it's over that's on
cryptic well for example the SCOOTER
scheme the SCOOTER gradient this just do
I just called it scooter it starts here
and we'll twist it up here rotate it so
you guys can see it starts here at this
I don't know turquoise and then segues
into dark powder blue I don't know my
color schemes are not what they used to
be but it's a very comforting effect and
it's not gimmicky and it's not invasive
when you use the right colors so this is
just one gradient on UI gradients so
we're going to go to show all gradients
and again these are gradients this guy I
don't know who he is
I think it's just one dude that he
developed and they're free for the
taking and for the using on any of your
projects so as you can see there I think
guys I'm a color geek I'm not in a color
professional by any means but I just
love looking at these colors and seeing
just how fascinating two or three colors
can interact it's that sentence didn't
make sense but it's fascinating to see
how two or three colors can really
change things for example there's three
colors here you can see the transition
is apparent but it's also soft so we
have a blue darker blue and back to that
turquoise ish and then down to a mauve
pink now some of these are just nothing
I would ever use but something like this
you can barely see this it's a very very
nice effect and again sometimes the
littlest things make all the difference
because eventually you're going to be
building your app or your website to
completion and these colors and these
gradients play a part in that you could
put you a little bit sometimes all you
need is I'll just step up just a little
bit just a little bit to make you stand
out from the pack now probably bootstrap
and all these other frameworks and
libraries have this stuff built in but
you know what
I'm not messing around with bootstrap
right now I'm creating this custom well
aside from stealing these colors from
this guy let's go to visions of grandeur
so you guys get the idea and you can
rotate the gradient right
to fit whatever you want so that's
enough about that let me show you the
difference between a solid background I
have to cost excuse me show you the
difference and just how big of a
difference it makes a solid background
on a webpage to a gradient background
alright so I coated this before I
started the video we have the solid
light blue if you tear up the code here
you know your basic powder blue
background
pardon sloppy coat it was just off the
cuff powder blue background okay fair
enough but some of you might be saying
it doesn't matter because most of this
stuff's going to be having elements and
divs and all that over it well that's
fine but what do you think about this
compare to this now I know this is a
little bit of a distraction but I want
to illustrate the function is not really
functionality I wanted to illustrate the
what the hell is the word I want to
illustrate the comprehensive look of a
gradient so up here we start at a
turquoise then move to a darker blue
almost going to a purple down here
usually the code for that so this is a
solid now this is the gradient again
pardon the sloppy code it was off the
cuff and then on the fly and then so
this is the background or the code
rather for the gradient as you can see
we have different configurations for
different browsers so you think well how
long the heck did you get all those well
on UI gradients calm all you have to do
is hit gets the SS button right there
click to copy go right ahead
go back here save it go back to our
gradient over here boom now look at that
ease of transition from that blue that's
dark sky blue to a medium sky blue to a
light sky blue if
not something your user is going to
notice right away like oh my god
everybody get around the computer if
it's like John Lennon's alive again look
at this gradient people aren't going to
be like that but it's a subtle effect
and more importantly it inspires me to
keep building on it excuse me as opposed
to this this it's fine it's a powder
blue background but it's not really
doing much for me as a coder as a
builder as a creator now this doesn't
have to be used just for backgrounds it
can also be used for buttons and other
widgets and whatnot use your imagination
for gradients so I'm going to show you
guys one of my projects I'm working on
to my portfolio not going to go through
everything it does but I'm going to show
you some of the buttons I have been
using and put a gradient on here now
these four I assumed in this is the this
is the default size so I'm a zoom in
here just to show you guys these are
four buttons that all do things right
and as you can see has a very nice blue
to almost a turquoise again I really
like that color scheme really liked it I
think it has a nice calming effect and
it does so much more than just a plain
color again I'm sure bootstrapping all
these libraries and frameworks and what
have you have these built in and whatnot
but for me as an advanced beginner
knowing how these things work I know is
going to pay off as I'm advancing
because what happens if a bootstrap
break you know code hits the sign
you got to have a plan B at least I do
or at least something solid where you
know you're not relying on a certain
framework you're relying on your own
mind so hopefully I don't get
Alzheimer's anytime soon I won't show
you the code for that because you guys
probably by now are getting the idea
start using these again like I say in
all my videos I don't like telling
people what to do I really don't but for
me using gradients and starting off with
something that looks good to my eyes
doesn't matter if
you can change that gradient at the end
to something a little more palatable for
the masses but for me when I'm coding
and I see a gradient that looks good to
my eyes I want to keep building this app
when these little buttons where one
color I was like yeah they're fine
but then I change it to a gradient I'm
like hey shit this is looking pretty
good so it might help you it might not
but if you're interested in messing
around with gradients I would encourage
you to start at UI gradients calm
because the color codes the hex codes or
whatever you call them sorry I'm not hip
determine ology these guys right here
are already ready and waiting for you so
you don't have to go searching for them
elsewhere that's a nice one Sinnott
alright guys I hope this video was
helpful check out this website these are
all free for the ceiling and pretty sure
that's exactly what this author said
it's just kidding and being sarcastic
but these are for use for your projects
so we'll see in the next video again
thanks for watching
seriously things tell my subscribers and
you guys who are commenting and engaging
in the video really means a lot it
really does so we'll see you around and
thanks for watching stay tuned to
subscribe like comment you know the
drill
keep this channel alive if you like what
you saw you believe in liberating free
information support me on patreon it
really helps even a dollar really helps
a lot thanks a lot guys we'll see you
