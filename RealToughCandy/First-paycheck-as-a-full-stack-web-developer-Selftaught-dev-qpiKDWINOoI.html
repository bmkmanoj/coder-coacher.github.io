drop this thing trying to be cool real
tough candy from real tough candy calm
back online with you guys today I'm
gonna be focusing on this little piece
of paper for a few minutes it's a pretty
symbolic piece of paper I worked really
freaking hard to get to this point and
although it's just a cheque it's an
important one this is the first time
that I've had a job in a career field
that I really really enjoy I have been
in another career field that kind of
came close but this one is something
different now a lot of people are
probably wondering who how much is it
let's just take a look can we can we pan
can we can we zoom in here ah here we go
pay to the order of real tough candy
amount enough to squeeze by I can say
the amount and this little piece of
paper is gonna allow me for one to walk
into a grocery store tonight and grab
the jumbo cart and put whatever the heck
I want into it
and not only that I'm going to different
in coop you know those places are
expensive I'm putting everything I want
in there with this check I'm paying off
my bills this month this little check is
also a testament Aesop hard work there
are so many times when I wanted to quit
web development and to be honest I quit
multiple times the key was I didn't stay
quit and I use that saying a lot with
people just because in this field it's
so easy to want to give up it's so easy
to quit and it's okay I think it's okay
to get frustrated and quit for a bit
just don't lose your passion it's oh
it's okay to come back it's okay to quit
and come back I would love for these
checks to be a regular feature in my
life for work that I'm doing for me that
day is coming soon I'm not rushing it
I'm learning a lot I'm trying to add as
much value as I can to this company as a
newbie and I don't plan on going
anywhere anytime soon with that company
but there is gonna be a time where I am
ready to move on in the freelance world
you do see these things but they're very
inconsistent one month you can make you
know multiple thousands of dollars the
other
months you make bupkis you don't see any
money and that can be fun for a while
but then it gets kind of old I know
something bro like wait you work at a
tech company and you get paper checks I
know right there is some satisfaction to
holding this though and really even
though it's not cash it's not as good
feeling as cash it's something to hold
on to something to look at thanks for
watching this video for any aspiring
developers out there
your self-taught developer you can do
this to this he right here is proof
there's no magic pill there's no voodoo
spell
there's no pixie dust the hard work will
pay off and I got to go deposit this
check and do some grocery shopping
thanks for watching guys we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
