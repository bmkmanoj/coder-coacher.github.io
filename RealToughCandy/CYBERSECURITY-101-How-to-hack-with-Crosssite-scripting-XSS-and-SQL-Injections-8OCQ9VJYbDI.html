candy back in your area today we are
doing some freaking cool stuff the exact
kind of stuff hackers do performing a
website and database attack by
exploiting identified vulnerabilities
translation well shut up oh sorry my
potty mouth we're gonna be doing some
cross-site scripting and performing a
sequel some people call SQL I like the
sequel though a sequel injection attack
using the damn vulnerable web
application aka dvwa so using dvwa we're
gonna mess of stuff up using across the
site scripting and sequel injections
let's get started so I wanted to just
run over real quick I'm not gonna go
over all of this stuff but it's
important to understand exactly what
we're gonna be doing so let's talk about
cross-site scripting basically hackers
use a cross-site scripting or XSS to
execute arbitrary scripts through the
web browser XSS becomes possible when a
web form allows HTML or JavaScript code
as valid input now if you're watching
this video even though it's for like
beginner beginner to moderate beginner
to maybe even advanced beginners you
perhaps have experience with HTML and or
JavaScript so you can see how accessible
this attack is for script kiddies or
maybe not script kiddies but people just
starting out trying to have fun in a
harmful way also sequel injection allows
valid Alby it's odd looking at sequel
commands to run within a webform so
you've probably heard of cross-site
scripting and you've probably heard of
sequel injection but today we're going
to perform these tests to verify the
exploits are possible so let's do it and
a word of just I don't know information
about dvwa this is a tool that's left
intentionally vulnerable so it can help
us learn about web security I'm not
breaking anything this this application
was designed for us in mind
so let's get started we'll go right here
cross-site scripting attacks let's let's
explore a little bit about the
background and flavors of cross-site
scripting so basically like I mentioned
it's the malicious insertion of
scripting code to extract data or modify
a website's code application or content
and there's two kinds there is
persistent stored and non persistent
reflective so in a persistent cross-site
scripting attack the most serious
variety by the way data that can modify
how applications or service operate is
downloaded on to the targeted server so
it's stored on to this server that is
targeted by hackers now the victim is
triggering their intent triggering the
attack on the other hand the non
persistent attack which is the most
common the attacker attempts to use
scripting commands in the URL itself or
through device like a web form to gain
admin or elevated level of user
privileges in an attempt to force the
victim server to display the desired
data on screen whew it's getting good
people God so now in this print aloud
we're gonna use the damn vulnerability
web application to perform an attack
that exploits a cross-site scripting
vulnerability so and we need to set the
security level of dvwa to low which
exposes the vulnerabilities now some of
you may be thinking oh my god cross-site
scripting so late 90s I don't know about
you but there are many websites I
visited I've not just visited but I do
visit to this day twenty seventeen that
are stuck in the 90s that have not been
updated these people from the 90s are
stuck in the 90s I'm kind of one of them
but not when it comes to web design and
keeping my updated gosh I'm just
swearing in this video so much I'm sorry
root tough candy a potty mouth but the
point being don't ever assume that these
vulnerabilities don't exist in 2017
because they do Oh
do you think they so here what we're
gonna do we're gonna hop right on
Firefox and we're going to navigate to
the dvwa using some
secret HTTP magic going to 170 2.30 you
know 0.11 /d v doesn't mean anything
perfect and now admin password password
and then we're gonna set the security
button where is the security button
don't make me look stupid dvwa next to
the security button hmm does it show us
oh cool it does show okay cool so it's
above PHP info no way Oh quite a way i
sticked all away mm-hmm okay security so
we're gonna change this to no because
this will allow us to wage the
cross-site scripting attack and now we
are and as a reminds us in this lab
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are
commonly found in web forms that send
and retrieve data to databases via HTML
they note too that the scripts here are
typing clear text but hackers often use
hexadecimal character strings instead of
clear text to make the scripts even
harder to detect so basically they're
saying if you're a database
administrator monitor your sequel
databases for unauthorized or abnormal
sequel injections and write scripts
that's enough alarms as well as sending
network management alerts additional
safeguards can include encrypting the
data elements that reside in long-term
storage of the sequel database thank you
have a good day in the what's your name
box we're gonna type your name okay wait
what are they trying for us to do where
is the squares accross script did they
even tell us to do this or am I just
losing my mind
I click the cross sign scripted
reflected button reflected okay so they
want us to enter our name my name as you
know is real tough candy call me
anything just not late for dinner
hello real tough candy perfect so
this webform is intended to take the
name you entered and repeat it back to
you in a friendly welcome we've seen
variations of this ad infinitum this is
a standard standard thing so now they
want us to make a screen capture to
prove that we did it no need to so now
you're going to mess with this form by
using he is it'll put this is a test
these by the way our scripting tags do
not forget them otherwise it's all for
nothing so now we're in hit submit now
to the average user this Helen would
just mean Oh
something's broken something is not
working right I'll just find it on
Amazon or whatever this is probably
going to make 99.99% of people hit their
back button on the browser but you my
fine fellow white hat hacker no this
screams vulnerability and you might even
realize that the web server has accepted
the scripting tags Paquette it's mean
it's not spitting anything out shot a
this hope it's the door for inputting
scripts into the web form which can be
confirmed in the next step now watch
this so we're going to open it up with
the scripting tag and we're going to
type script a CRI PT close it open up
with this is and in single quotes we're
going to write to
and now we're gonna click note that the
quote marks are straight single quotes
not curly and opening quotes the web
form process of the script and return a
pop-up alert window well I'm sure it
would have but is there a pop-up blocker
on okay I was so excited
is this lab just totally like totally
blotted out where's the prop I gotta be
propped up with my pop-ups should we try
it again let's just what I'm gonna do I
don't know if I can copy and paste this
right here just to make it quicker I
didn't end the script oh my gosh okay
this is why girls should not be allowed
near computers that's right it's 18 20
get in the kitchen just kidding so rude
real tough candy your sodium rude by the
way I was being totally sarcastic that'd
be funny if I wasn't though so now okay
that's what I did wrong I ended and then
semicolon okay and then we're going to
cut off the script that's right script
okay so this is what the completed
string and script and all of that and
the alert should look like okay now your
submit and ideally get a pop-up yep yep
we sure did vulnerability exposed to
real tough candy and that's pretty much
it we're not breaking anything more in
this just giving you a taste just giving
you a taste of the possibilities and if
your brain and mouth or simultaneously
watering right now number one I get your
brain checked out but if you are indeed
watering at the mouth my friend this
might be the career for you you
understand the possibilities of things
and fun you could have
what's my - equal injection attacks
let's read the note poorly designed or
improperly secured web forms can be
exploited to output passwords credit
card information and other data in the
next steps you will insert a series of
sequel statements into a webform to find
and then exploit a sequel injection of
vulnerability sequel injection attacks
are used to extract privacy data
elements out of a database by inserting
real sequel query commands in two web
forms many of these commands will not
return any errors or produce any results
but determined hackers will continue
probing until they find the data and
think we're seeking perfect let's go to
the sequel injection
doink a user ID box ok again user ID
it's something we interact with every
day
this should not be foreign to anyone
watching this so we're gonna type o
malley just for kicks and we'll see I'm
gonna hit this and you're gonna see
something yep the webform was unable to
handle the special character which was
the apostrophe if we go right back here
this apostrophe in O'Malley the database
was like WTF why is there an apostrophe
and some person's name that doesn't make
any damn sense that's exactly what the
computer is thinking they're they're
engineering them too near brilliant
levels these days so the webform was
unable unable to handle that apostrophe
because this person who programmed it
who programmed the database forgot to
include Script handling for special
characters and data input forms this
type of error can make an application
vulnerable to sequel injection so again
it comes back to that poor soul who was
in charge of designing something who was
paid a forty thousand dollars over a
course of a year and a half to design
something that took ten years out of his
life and he got fired because he forgot
to take care of the script handling for
special characters and data input forms
it ain't right
it's an injustice trust me I don't know
you but I feel you click the browser's
back button return and now we're gonna
be doing some more fun stuff
sequel commits an actual sequel commands
here and if you've taken a database
course some of these might be familiar
so we're gonna do a apostrophe or
capital make sure this make sure this is
verbatim you can't be using like and I
think maybe I use double quotes and like
watch my punctuation it has to be to the
T okay you have to be anal retentive
here otherwise it won't work and your
time is spent trying to do this trying
to crack in and hack in is gonna suck so
we're gonna do 8 ' or single quote X on
some coach equals so basically x equals
eggs semicolon pound sign and we're
gonna submit when I submit this watch
this script right here is gonna return
the first and last names of everyone in
the applications database watch watch
and again you would be thinking there's
no please there's no database out there
online that that does this kind of stuff
oh no maybe not Amazon maybe not eBay
look around that's all that's all I can
say about that look around you'll be
surprised what you can find you'll be
surprised that might even be shocked at
what hasn't been updated and surprise
them maybe even shocked at the level of
indifference of some web masters but you
haven't heard that term in about 15
years so now in the user ID box we are
gonna do another sequel command we're
gonna type a 1 the single quote and then
order capital order by capital one
semicolon pounds on submit and if
there's not an error after I hit submit
we're gonna go to the next step but if
we see an error we're gonna click back
and proceed to step eight it all depends
on how the dvwa is feeling okay so
there's no error this is a good thing
because now
we're going to type in another command
which is almost the same as the last one
but instead of ordered by one we're
gonna go to order by to submit no error
now we're gonna do the same thing this
time with you guessed it okay did I do
that right maybe I quoted it wrong hmm I
don't think I did order by three link
oops
no loops is ellipsis okay so that got me
an error the first two did not
now we're gonna type a or first name is
no semicolon pound sign click Submit and
now we are theoretically theoretically
theoretically going to get an error
message indicating that there is no
field named first name but they know in
the lab this doesn't mean that the
information is not in the database so
persistence is key people there's no
first name okay name first name there's
no field name first name but we're gonna
try it we're gonna persist so we're
gonna start this over
watch this we're just gonna keep doing
variations on a theme here trying to get
to the gold mine this is how hackers do
it okay so you thought I did there hey
our first name is null only with the
first name instead of being at one word
I get an underscore because we'll see
because I didn't get an error that's
because this first name underscore her
first underscore name indicates that the
field name is now smaller so I guessed
about the field name it wasn't first
name it was first oops
so basically you many of you probably
understand but just for those who might
be like what the heck
so first name so when I submit this this
matches in the database with the first
name field there's no such thing over
program the database is like okay we
want their first name so you know when
people are researching in the database
for legitimate reasons they can just you
know whatever sort by first name and
it's not some foreign thing like no
one's gonna do a first name tab that
looks like that so it's gonna be like Oh
first name then it's gonna be doing that
probably just more obfuscated things
then explained it you know what I'm
saying hopefully yeah maybe I don't know
hopefully you do what I'm saying in the
user ID box we're gonna type we're just
gonna keep going on we're gonna keep
persisting just keep watch or follow
along what I'm doing here a or database
remember to spell all this right like
quote D percentage sign quote semicolon
pound sign now this script is a little
queer-looking
it's gobbledygook to the common eye but
this one searches for a possible hit on
the databases characters but the
percentage sign will split the fields
you see what I'm saying
first name admins turning admin ID hack
me oh that's a nice name cool so it
split the fields as in first names admin
and it split it again it's your name or
in America last name admin rap so now
let's just keep going back not a few
more of these to go guys we're almost
done with this we're just experimenting
these are fun I don't know about you I
find these I don't know meditative in a
destructive fashion so now we're gonna
tie a awesome you see a pattern there
with this a apostrophe even if you don't
know what it means
which script kiddies don't they copy and
paste stuff likeness
so it's good to be familiar with what
this stuff looks like table underscores
schema come on table name for um
information schema dot tables pound sign
submit and then ideally we're gonna get
the table and column names in the
database do you see how powerful these
commands are now if you're interested in
exactly why what
when to do these kinds of things learn
sequel commands learn sequel it's pretty
easy actually I really don't like people
who are an IT say it's so easy no it's
not that easy but Rekha I recommend
researching more on SQL or sequel
however you prefer to pronounce it I
like sequel you just get familiar with
the commands and you know what these are
all about it's pretty fascinating and
relative to like something like Java
this is a lot more straightforward at
least on my experience so what I'm
saying it's not some I don't know what I
was trying to say sequel has very little
in common with Java but they're both
pretty abstract is what I'm trying to
say
and this one's a lot more
straightforward relatively rap okay
step 15 in the user ID box type a you
need all select what and how so in this
next one we're gonna learn about the
version of sequel being used on this
server here on the DV dvwa server so
fantasize away about what server this
could be so we're gonna do a union o
select one comma attach version so I
call in pound sign click Submit
what oh so this is what we're using
version first name present version one
five point five point three
I've always Iman Goodwin so now we're
gonna do a few final ones and we're
gonna wrap it up we're gonna take a
union all selected user password for um
my sequel dot user semicolon pound sign
drives semicolon pound sign single quote
and this gives us a hash for the user to
the back-end database even if you don't
know what that means it's pretty awesome
gonna be honest if I was able to figure
this out
find a sites where I could do this kind
of stuff I wouldn't know you know what
to do with this you can easily find out
though that's the thing it's all one
Google search away so for the last one
oh I think that's it
oh wait a minute so we're gonna do one
more so if this last script is
successful and can indicate the data can
be written to a file okay if it's
successful it'll indicate that data can
be written to a file and later
downloaded how do we know if it's
successful if the Falcon per can be
created there will be no error message
and the script will pass with a submit
button and clear the user ID box if the
file cannot be cricket created either
because the file already exists or
because the script was faulty or the
developer prevented it prevented to eat
the script remains in the user ID box
okay let's just take it one step at of a
toast guys I can't talk today holy crap
Union oops we want this in quotes single
quotes Union select little taste-test
in quotes single quotes and then comma
US and quote one two three I'll quote
any two out file quote test
one dot txt okay so this file can be
created I can write data to a file and
later downloaded in this database the
reason I know is because it didn't give
me an error message and the stuff up
here was cleared so let's see what else
they have to say in this blue box click
the browser's refresh button to see what
happens when you try to overwrite the
file together with the information you
gathered in earlier tests you know of a
user with elevated permissions user IDs
passwords and the table structure where
all the static is being held in other
words an injectable database okay file
testing dot one for testing 102 B
already exists okay guys that's how you
start a sequel and that's how you do a
sequel injection how to take it over you
might have to wait for another video and
some deep web stuff right there
Deep Web right yeah all right I'm gonna
sign off let's just go over what we
learned and went through today this is I
it's kind of dry I find it fascinating
maybe you on the other end I think it's
a bore I really think it's cool and just
going through the steps and having
guidance here it's the best kind of
guidance because it's hands-on there's a
lot of backstory here with you know
sequel injections and types of
cross-site scripting and just being able
to use a single web app the dvwa was
it's really helpful again the dvwa is
free and you can play around and set the
security options to whatever and you
know try some sequel injections and just
get a feel for it it's kind of addicting
and it feels good being dark and
destructive without actually being dark
and destructive IRL or at least causing
monetary damage thanks for watching guys
and we'll see you the next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
