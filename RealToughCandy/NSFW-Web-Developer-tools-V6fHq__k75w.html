training materials and technologies
today and the real turf candy Channel
a very explicit show today on the UHF
kandi channel but I feel like these
three creations presentations
obfuscation and obscene permutations
might be able to help you in some way or
another
the first one is oh shit get now this
was created by a woman who was
frustrated with the fact that there's a
lot of ways to mess up when you're using
get on this website she explains some
bad situations and how she got out of
these situations in plain English okay
so this this is especially good if
you're a beginner a great get trainer
especially for people who are just
starting out with get because you're
about to have problems and to be honest
this site beat Stack Overflow by a
longshot
number two fuck off as a service this is
actually a really good restful api to
train on well written fuck off fuck off
as the service provides a modern restful
scalable solution to the common problem
of telling people to fuck off now I
don't know about you but there have been
many at times in my development career
when I really could have used this and
prior to my development career where I
would just love to implement this API
with like 20 different versions of it
doing something I won't risk reading the
examples here I don't want to lose my
youtube account but I highly recommend
this is not for the faint of heart but I
do highly recommend fuck off as a
service if you're interested in seeing a
scalable restful solution for telling
people just piss off it's well written
API I'm just saying finally we have
brain fuck all of you old schoolers are
probably familiar with this the code
that was designed to hurt according to
Daniel Ober house brain fuck is an
esoteric programming language that
champions purposefully over complicated
code he also developed it so that would
have the smallest possible compiler
where's the example of hello world here
it is
so print hello world this of course a
Python and then in brain fuck it looks
like this I just get a thrill out of
this language it's so freakin funny
that's all I got guys it's a lighter
look at the world of programming and
explicitly a lighter look at this side
of programming hope you enjoyed this
video as always come join me on my
ghetto chatroom linked below thank you
for your support of this channel
continuously growing whether you've
bought a udemy course through me use my
Amazon link supported me through patreon
sent me a PayPal donation or even bought
my coding album electric Pomodoro twenty
five minutes of tech music program and
played by me I don't use GarageBand
that's lame that's all I got any of
those things and more I thank you for
your continued support to make videos
like this possible alright guys that's
all I got for now see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
