what clock for morning paper morning
newspaper sorted real tough candy from
world's Afghani calm back in the
full-screen mode with you today doing
one of my favorite things of all time
and that is tearing up other people's
work that's right we're off the hook
today and looking at some of these
design decisions these newspapers have
made the good and the not-so-good we're
gonna be taking a look at four
newspapers the New York Times
ha the Sun Sentinel in Hollywood Florida
the Chicago Tribune and finally the
Washington Post newspapers aren't
interesting anomaly in the 21st century
we're not gonna be taking a look at
content now that's a whole different
video I would love to do a series on
that but that's for a different in the
Tube channel we're gonna be looking at
the design decisions and let's start it
right off I do want to note I'm using an
ad blocker my fan is already working
overtime on this computer just by having
these four sites up trying to block all
the freaking ads so we're gonna do some
ad blocking today with these sites now
this is the New York Times what are your
first impressions of what you see above
the fold that is before you scroll or do
anything what are you guys feeling now
let me go down here I'll show you the
whole front page here I'll shut up
the first thing I really noticed and
then I really liked is this ample white
space on the margins of this landing
page now if we go over like the
Washington Post which all of these sites
refresh automatically whenever I click
on them this is not as ample this is not
as ample and this is not a sample
because we'll find out in a minute that
these are the same freaking templates
there we go with that refresh I do not
ask for these are about double the size
of these of these margins here and if
you look at a lot of websites there's a
lot of white space that white space
suggests that white space in traditional
design is luxury so what they've done
here is kind of wrapped these headlines
in a change of luxury I don't feel
luxurious looking over these headlines
but I don't feel claustrophobic I don't
think I don't feel like they're trying
to manipulate the space here by cramming
everything they can in to this pager so
it's a nice change from content
providers who are just like you know
you're stopping the above-the-fold part
with every bit of text they can it also
does a nice job of kind of leading your
eyes to the top and in leading you from
there you can see here there are these
vertical lines as well as horizontal
lines cutting up the columns I will
point out this is from 1878 I will point
out this is for 2017 I don't see much
difference here except the temple white
space on the side so this is I like this
design decision it does a nice job of
not making me feel claustrophobic when
looking at this above the fold here but
things start going downhill as we scroll
down look at all this stuff guys
you could spend five hours here clicking
on all these probably more so we have
all of these categories right one two
three four five six seven eight
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
23 24 25 26 that's 26 different sections
shown here each section with 3 articles
so just in this spot right here are 78
links probably actually there's more to
because if you click on the heading up
here and then we have recommended for
you and then we have most viewed and
then we have most female this is
information overflow this is too much
this is overwhelming and unless you're a
retiree who reads newspapers all day
every day even retirees who read
newspapers all day every day this is too
much also this is the one fascinating
thing I did notice about this site it's
not responsive can you believe it
the New York Times is not a responsive
website that is it is not changing its
layout as I close this browser and this
is not I use Safari I know it's a dying
breed but it's my browser of choice I've
tested it in chrome and in Firefox and
it's not a safari bug or anything like
that they didn't forget to you've
develop it for Safari
Wow really you have to download the app
to get a cell phone or a smartphone
experience I don't know that's pretty
concerning for a newspaper that has
millions of visitors I don't know why
they have not addressed that issue let's
take a look at Hollywood news in the
Chicago Tribune I'm not gonna spend a
lot of time on either of these sites
because I'm just so put off with the
fact that these are the same freakin
newspapers the only difference there is
is that Chicago Tribune has an emblem or
whatever you want to call it from the
1800s the Sun Sentinel is thoroughly
1981 but we have the same annoying boxes
here telling us to sign up ten cents a
week for the rest 2017 hurry
sale ends October 2nd 10 cents a week
for the rest of 2017 hurry sale ends
October 2nd now this is annoying as it
is this is having to go out of your way
and be like no I'm not interested no I'm
not interested there's an investment
there where I'm going
out of my way to get rid of something
that I don't want my computer is
whizzing away blocking these ads 27 ads
blocked a lot of these sites I know
especially for the Chicago to review an
arch so slow to load which is a huge
ding on the user experience even with my
new Urbana computer with plenty of
memory even with my fiber freaking
connection my computer is having a hard
time with this website this is very not
good let's go to our last one here
though Washington Post now what's this
all about this Auto refresh that I'm not
asking for who does this who's in charge
of this year
notice the trade-off between all of this
information this is a lot of information
this is a lot of information is this
like a New York Times jr. down yeah look
at all of these headlines look at all
these categories etc this is the trade
offs now this site is responsive however
let's say you're on a what do you call
this thing's tablet let's say you're on
a phablet right look at how far down
you're gonna have to you you're gonna
have to go you know that's a lot of
finger swipes that's a lot of finger
swipes just to get to the category like
okay where's the sports section swiping
down all that way just see to the sports
section let's see if they have a yeah
and hamburger menus are also not a very
good UX decision I've used them before
but they're not very good for users
because a lot of people don't see them
they don't indicate what this is what is
this like an equal right sign this could
be just anything and then again swiping
down okay sports sports sports it's not
alphabetic it's not alphabetical where
do I find this okay this is an issue as
well okay fine sports ooh this is an
issue this is a really bad issue here
guys I hope you enjoyed this video
checking out full-screen mode of these
newspapers their design decisions and
maybe how you can incorporate some of
these good design decisions it's your
own designs and how you can certainly
avoid some of these death traps the
hamburger menu
it has never been a good who acts
decision I don't know who invented that
but it's not good for UX responsiveness
need some serious work and we haven't
even gotten to content I'm out of here
thanks for watching guys you can catch
me and the rest of my crew over at the
real tough candy Couture chat room great
stuff going on there's all kinds of
stuff always going on there it's all
tech all the time get out of the madness
and get in to the tech shelter over at
earth my real tough candy chat room and
hope you see you over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
