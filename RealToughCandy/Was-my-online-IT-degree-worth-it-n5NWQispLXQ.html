tough candy back in the saddle with you
today we are talking about education is
an online IT degree specifically a
bachelor's degree worth it well I'm
gonna share my experiences with you and
go through some of the curriculum some
of the stuff I went through as a student
and take it from there
is that even a real degree Kevin Hart it
is a real degree let's get it started so
the college I went through was American
public university it is also known as
American military University they are
essentially the same school ones geared
toward civilians ones geared towards
military members and veterans
however the curriculum is identical and
you can go to a MU American military
University if you're not a veteran but
you know like I said it's all marketing
so like any other Bachelor of Science
degree there are 120 ish credits to the
degree any of your four-year degrees are
gonna be around 120 credits this one in
particular was 122 and I want to point
out the biggest thing with IT degrees is
that they're basically a credential
you're not gonna be able to I mean
inherently program an amazing Android
app I think what my biggest expectation
was was to go through this program and
be able to sit down and just like bang
out an Android app or you know code
something awesome that comes on your own
time with college degrees an IT you
learn a little bit about a lot of things
and it's up to you to take the
initiative to pursue what you like and
early on in that case my case was
internet security cyber security I
absolutely find it fascinating I just
loved learning about hackers about the
bad that they do excuse my language
but it is some bad mamma-jamma that
they're up to and it's just so
fascinating and one of my other videos I
discussed how you know the the good guy
in this this ideally this student is the
person
who has more of a burden because we have
to know just about everything we don't
to master everything whereas a hacker
can just know about one little thing and
really destroy stuff so you know that's
where it's a challenge because all this
stuff you need to have if not you don't
need to have a master of everything like
I said but you need to have an
understanding of a lot of things so in
this program which is similar to other
IT degrees I've looked at whether in
person or brick-and-mortar rather and
online they take you through you know
the different subsets if you will of IT
for example programming fundamentals
that's your Python that's your Java
whatever language they want to throw at
you for a beginner Java it's not a
really good beginners language but
something like Python is one you see a
lot in brick-and-mortar and online IT
programs information systems analysis
and design not my favorite course
object-oriented programming in UML that
was a pretty cool course the UML you get
a design models relational database
concepts such as why don't say here
about like sequel sequel server
different databases information security
local area network tech that was a cool
course this was more than one course
those are cool courses telecom and
network concepts internet and e-commerce
I kind of steered away from internet and
e-commerce just because I have a
background in e-commerce and I could
probably teach a course on e-commerce so
I said hmm I don't know there's other
things I can learn about I would
probably learn some stuff taking
e-commerce courses you always do even if
you think you're a master master actual
masters can probably learn something too
but just wasn't my bag at a web
development including JavaScript in
XHTML and finally enterprise data
exchange using XML so in fact yes we'll
go through the courses here these are
all the courses I did take and will
actually enter a classroom in just a few
moments here but let me finish up by
showing you the program objectives and
showing you the different tracks now
again this is American public university
and aka American military University
again they're the same practically the
same school
so yeah I actually did a video on this
school I will include right now perfect
and here is the catalog for the classes
you will be taking so of course you know
if you don't have any experience or
background in college you have to take a
lot of things that don't relate to what
you want to study you have to know the
basics when you get a bachelor's degree
when you earn a bachelor's degree
general education gotta throw some
history in there some humanities
literature mathematics these are your
liberal arts courses not gonna focus on
these but there's about 60 total credits
I believe it's usually about it's
usually about half of bachelor's degrees
is your liberal arts stuff a few science
courses here Social Sciences and etc so
this is the section which is your core
requirements for the bachelors in IT of
course some introduction to computer
science web development fundamentals
that's going to be your HTML CSS web
analytics advanced web disadvantage
which is your JavaScript in fact let's
click on that and see what actually they
have to say how they use technology to
measure website traffic enhance business
presence and conduct market research so
probably some SEO stuff I don't remember
right offhand this was quite some time
ago when I took this course some
fundamentals of programming analysis and
design of information systems UML
application security net intro to
networking that was a cool class general
concentration requirements I just took
the generals so I took these I took did
I take all of these I must have web
development using JavaScript so you can
say so these are your concert trick
concentrations these of you
concentrations and you can pick one of
them if you find one interesting or just
stick with the generals these are always
going to come in handy ecommerce
concentration we have mobile computing
concentration take some Java and Android
courses they call it the droid here
maybe a little outdated but I actually
did take this course and you use
this program Android studio and learn
some pretty sweet methods for creating
some simple apps programming
concentration enterprise development
using j2ee
I want to take this as an elective but
they weren't offering the course at the
time probably because just it's pretty
advanced for you know an undergrad
degree in my opinion that's Apache
Tomcat are they offering this yeah see
oftentimes amu APU has monthly
registration dates but this is only
every three months or every four months
again whatever one it was at an notice
web development using dotnet no thanks
and man for your final program
requirement now this is the one thing I
personally have left to do which is a
capstone the capstone is actually a 16
week course which is why I've been
dragging my butt to do it because it's
just like man 16 weeks come on actually
okay I totally lied and it's only eight
weeks however this okay now it's all
coming back to me no I promise you guys
I actually am going to this school I
promise it's not my fault I have one
brain cell wait is it don't do drugs
this information technology capstone the
reason I've been holding this off is
because I had to complete all of my
other courses that's right everything in
this degree plan has to be complete
there's probably an exception to it I
haven't researched it that much but if
you want to get crafty there's probably
an exception where you can take it
concurrently but you have to take this
one at least on paper after everything
else is done and once you pass that
they're gonna give you a degree and
you're gonna say yeah you so that's that
let's go let's enter actually in online
classroom again these were the ones that
I've completed all of these and these
classes are eight weeks long which is
awesome but don't think you can slack
because there are forums do where should
we go where should we go let's go to
information security that was a good
class
I love the security classes because I'll
show you in a minute I
doing some of these online labs and
these were only for my security classes
but I've been doing some videos with
these like performing packet capturing
performing a website and database attack
using identified vulnerabilities aka
sequel injection and cross-site
scripting attacks ooh those are fun I'm
telling you this online lab was worth
the cost of admission itself you know
screw the forums yeah they're good
whatever talk with the teacher here blah
blah blah do the tests and quizzes
assignments I don't care but for me
personally these labs were awesome
because the real world definitely worth
it so what do you do each week you check
in and you'd go to the home screen you'd
be like okay what are we working on this
week you know and the announcements are
here
here's your textbook is see certified it
looks like or at least somehow promotes
ISC which is how would you say it
accrediting body that's not accrediting
it's a it's a recognized certification
entity among IT security professionals
did I say that did I say that
articulately so each week you go to the
lessons and see you know week one what
are we doing this week boom us an
overview reading and resources and
there's additional reading some videos
for you to take a peek at week five and
then it just goes a week by week week by
week and then of course the last week is
certifications for example so we learn
about certification school so you go to
the lesson read a little bit about
credentials you know what is it
credential basic stuff that you really
need as a foundation and some of you
might be saying okay that's all well and
good so why am I actually paying for
this when I can go to some place like I
don't know Coursera or you to me or
lynda.com or insert free training
website here well I'll tell you for one
these online labs are not available
because they're proprietary number two
there's this thing that is especially
helpful that people might not be used to
in online training which is an actual
instructor most of these people do have
their doctorates
sure you you can read their BIOS there
from you know accredited universities
it's not a scam these people are highly
educated and like I said I think I've in
my experience I've gone to this school
for a few years and have taken holy crap
a lot of credits I think there was just
like one or two people who had instead
of a PhD like two masters and they were
teaching like intro to college writing
or intro to online learning or something
something very basic but when you come
to these courses people need to have
their PhDs and amu APU recognizes that
that there is some standard so let's go
to weird want to go test and quizzes
so each week I think for this class
Khalil's
i had tests and quizzes yeah so each
week you'd get a quiz so let's take a
peek at what what we're looking at for
the caliber of quizzes here and again
this is an introductory course to let me
refresh your memory information security
this is ISS C 422 refreshing my memory
as well so information security pretty
basic and let's go back to the tests and
quizzes
I'll give you a little peek at what kind
of stuff we're working with and like do
some of these online quizzes in
different videos in case people want to
test their knowledge on the basics so
this is a completed quiz I think I did
pretty good watch it be like a ton of
red X marks down here okay cool I've got
a hundred percent it's a 10 question
quiz questions such as which of the
following best describes the weakest
link in the security of an IT
infrastructure would it be remote access
would it be the user would it be
software or would it be hard work and it
would be the user and because the reason
that is the answer is because the user
is the weakest link even information
systems security practitioners can make
mistakes human errors a major risk so
what I'm saying is that they give you
feedback on why that's the correct
answer
which is really helpful because
sometimes you're just guessing like oh
that sounds like the best answer I don't
know why but but then they give you some
feedback so that's great
now again there might be some people
saying well I can just Google that
answer like I can just probably copy and
paste this and find an answer in Google
on the first page and you're absolutely
right you can do that
is it cheating I don't know it might be
guided learning some people might
consider that guided learning but if you
do consider that cheating yes it's up to
you to have integrity and it's up to you
and this is why online education for a
lot of people I think they blame the
schools rather than themselves because
they sell themselves short they google
the answers or you know just like I'm
gonna brick and mortar they're paying
someone in India to do their IT homework
to code something yes you can pay your
way and Google your way to an a degree
it doesn't matter if it's online or
brick-and-mortar because most brick and
school brick-and-mortar schools nowadays
are using heavily how do I say this a
heavy component of internet learning so
even if you're showing up to class at a
brick-and-mortar you're doing a lot of
this stuff you're taking quizzes online
you're doing online labs so on and so
forth it's up to you to maximize your
learning experience it's kind of like
people who go to school like a coding
boot camp and are like well they didn't
get me a job afterward dude no one can
get you a job you have to work your way
to a job you have to show initiative
showing initiative is all on you if you
show initiative the world could the
world is yours
that's my ranch a true ranch but a rant
nonetheless so and then um no how many I
did have assignments for this course I
don't know I don't want to I think I
might have gotten a bad grade in my
assignments not read read not ready to
expose that but this is your assignment
tab you know final projects yep you do
have assignments you do have projects
papers you can pick usually a nice
leeway in giving you freedom in the
topics you want to explore I think my
final paper was kuribohs how do you
pronounce it let's let's take that in
its care
rebo's never really knew how to
pronounce it
rebo's kerberos I did kerberos is a
network authentication protocol damned
if I know how to pronounce it
but that's what I wrote my paper on so
that is that any questions guys leave me
a comment in the comment section private
message me thanks for watching hope this
was helpful did we talk about money do
we actually talk about how much this was
gonna cost you guys let's just find out
and I believe all of the programs are
the same amount masters might be
different price than bachelors what I'm
saying like all of these programs for
bachelors I believe in the same price
$270 per credit and with the military
grant if you have an affiliation with
military it's $250 they also of course
take the GI Bill funding is beyond the
scope of this video but if your interest
I might do a video on that too alright
guys hope this video was helpful give
you an inside look at the bachelor's
degree in AI T on line thanks for
watching we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
