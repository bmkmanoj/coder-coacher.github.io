new subscribers old subscribers and
intermediate subscribers why are the
intermediates always forgotten about
just like Generation X man no one knows
about you guys haven't forgot about any
of you thanks for watching thanks for
tuning in
gonna be doing another video related to
developer employers you guys seem to
like these videos so why not keep doing
them today I'm going to show you some
best practices for setting up your
github because this is one of the four
key documents four key links whatever
you want to call them that you're gonna
be sending in your employer generally
speaking and those four things are your
resume your cover letter your portfolio
and a link to your github a lot of
people just kind of considered linking
their github this is just like an
afterthought and I'm telling you this is
a critical component when employers are
learning about you looking to see what
you're all about just gonna show you
some basic things about what I do to put
myself ahead of the pack step one if you
don't have a github account go ahead and
sign up for one it's free it's very
useful and it's a great way to practice
get skills which are pretty essential
and most web developer jobs these days
this is the first page that potential
employers see when they come into my
github and they're gonna be noticing a
few things number one my pinned
repositories these are the projects that
I've been working on and number two my
contributions first impressions are
everything and a lot of people do not do
pin repositories I would highly
recommend getting in the habit of doing
pin repositories as opposed to popular
repositories now with popular
repositories these are just Auto
populated to your front page and as you
can see there is a little issue here
because these are all Forks these aren't
original projects this person not gonna
blow up their spot they fork these
projects and because they're popular
they're on his front page the only
original project he has on his front
page is culture light so that does
illustrate to a potential employer oh
this person is interested in size and
Delta flora I have no idea what Delta
flora is
and drop a gem to Adjaye language array
commands but it really doesn't
illustrate what this person is up to you
know a fork in github doesn't take that
much energy it's not really impressive
when you fork stuff pushing original
projects to your github however is kind
of impressive so I'm not going to go
through how to pin them you can read the
documentation figure that out but that's
one thing that is a huge thing I'd
recommend as you can see in this little
panel here I've selected my six to be
featured here so it just gives you a lot
more control over what you want people
to see so that's the first chunk of it
the second chunk that is super important
is getting your contributions up I had
247 in the last year that's not so bad
this probably isn't the best example I
was inactive in January doing I don't
know probably traveling or something but
one trick that I like to use even if I'm
not doing much as far as like building
projects just go in and like tweak some
documentation or refactor your code or
just little small tasks in fact I did
that today and I just edited some simple
documentation and it counted as a
contribution and that's gonna bump up
this number so doesn't have to be a huge
project that you're working on or you
know pushing all this stuff to get hub
just be little stuff little tweaks just
to show people that you are active and
you do take your code seriously and
you're on here doing your thing those
are the two main things um try to use
some sort of photo something like this
maybe not it doesn't have to be of
yourself okay I go back and forth with
putting my personal photo on avatars
people employers shouldn't need to know
what you look like it's usually just
used for discriminatory purposes anyway
but something other than the default
image that looks like this it could be a
cat it could be a map whatever get
creative make sure to fill this stuff
out you just want to give your page a
pride of ownership and show employers
that you're active in coding and web
development I'm gonna be doing more of
these videos like I said I think you
guys I'm gonna be doing more of these
videos like I said you guys seem to
really respond to these kinds of videos
it's kind of a topic not a lot of
developers talk about it's like not
secret so I don't know why it's not more
popular because this kind of stuff is
critical in getting a call back hope
this was helpful we will see
in the next video hope you guys are
having a great day it's not you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
