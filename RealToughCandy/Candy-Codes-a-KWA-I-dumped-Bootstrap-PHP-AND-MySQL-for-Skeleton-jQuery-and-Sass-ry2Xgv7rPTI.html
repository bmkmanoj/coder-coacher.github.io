kicking web app to get you up to speed
this is what I started with with the dev
spotlight series it is basically one
huge page of all these awesome
developers I've met in my internet
travels highlighting all their
achievements and their hopes and dreams
in tech so let me show you what I had
been throwing on the wall to see what
had been sticking I made this little
gallery here kind of a nice little
effect hover over it turns to color and
I also incorporated some modal's we're
gonna go through everything because I
didn't cover these in other episodes but
just to get you up to speed so I painted
myself into a develop mint corner with
this site and these developers deserve
something a little less conventional as
you can see this layout is very boxy
it's very angular angular and it's
pretty square as in it's playing it safe
and also literally square there's too
many squares here so I wanted to loosen
up a little and this is what I have come
up with feast your eyes on this these
developers are web developers were
kicking butt and spend most of their
days on computers what better way to
represent that than to have a navigation
system that used a simulated terminal
now that is all technical mumbo-jumbo of
saying you can type any name that you
see here or that you see here hit enter
and go to their profile look at this
look at this now compare that to this
see I like I like this coral salmony
thing this is a modal and this just
something missing here there's something
missing also too because this is a modal
it's a lot harder to get this to scale
correct
without doing a ton of media queries I
was using bootstrap and still having
some issues so let's take a look at here
quick I'll just point out a few features
firstly the color scheme I like these
colors because they're easy on the eyes
notice this is not a black this is a
darker grey and it looks very nice on
this blue here also if you can believe
it this actually is not a white but a
very very light blue and these colors go
very well together there are two exit
points on this page one up top and one
on bottom of course additionally you
always have your back arrow but I think
that's why I went with the modal in the
first place because just this idea of
using the in browser controls or
backward and forward kind of I don't
know kind of want to try something new
there's also as you can see a Help
section dev choices so here's your
choices and this was done in jQuery it's
a plug-in called terminal emulator and
unfortunately it doesn't work on Safari
trying to find some kind of polyfill or
something that will support this or some
other alternative to make it a truly
progressive application because right
now let me just open it up in Safari as
you can see this is what it looks like
in Safari and not too cool so looking
for something for Safari Firefox looks
great chrome looks almost identical
let's just see what we have for help why
the deaf spotlight type manifesto blah
blah blah let's try and notice what I'm
talking here notice manifesto notice
that this is capital M and this is the
lowercase M but it still works I'll show
you the logic behind that in just a
minute here I'm not gonna go through
everything though I will put this online
students is still just a local dev
environment also I wanted to make it
progressive to for people who aren't
comfortable using the terminal because
obviously most people using the web
aren't developers so you can easily just
hover over these pictures which i think
is an amazing effect this is so unique
and it looks like little
Polaroid's not to Pat myself too hard on
the back here because I did steal this
idea but this I think is a perfect use
case to apply this type of effect let's
see what dr. coming is up to blue let's
try and find someone Elise she has a
nice pink and look at this color scheme
I'm getting kind of ADHD here so we have
a nice coral we have a nice blue and
then there's a seafoam green that looks
absolutely phenomenal look at that it
looks like a freaking magazine
I made these big just to simulate that
that nice luxurious magazine feel and it
really looks like you're reading these
profiles in a in an exclusive
Development magazine let's pop the hood
and see what we're working with on both
these sites so this is the original site
again I'm not running a server right now
so you can't see the full comment
section which obviously in the end would
have been put down here somewhere but
let's take a look at this file here and
because those were modal's I ended up
putting them on the index page now
there's ways around that of course but
when you see this is 700 some lines
yeah granted it's sloppy code but it's
just hundreds upon hundreds upon
hundreds of lines because they're
stories as you can see here this is Casa
Darrow story his story is in the index
because in order for a modal to show
that content it has to be on the index
page so all of that all of this stuff is
on the index conversely the only thing
on the index here are links to these
images and let's just give you a peek
it's less than 60 lines of code and I do
have some breathing room here so
probably all in all it's like 40 lines
of code mostly scripts and mostly the
pictures here I did also put in about
section here in case people aren't
comfortable using that terminal probably
gonna be doing some work here too it's
just a little more creative layout maybe
like a put it at an angle or something
and make it just a little more creative
so let me show you the logic behind this
terminal and the reason I'm able to
fetch profiles by not capitalizing those
so we're gonna go ahead and Jim see that
works very cool let's check that out in
my JavaScript file which is right here
so this code needs to be reform in this
application right now they're just a
bunch of if statements so if I type in
Michael up here in this command line
it's gonna go to his profile right that
is what this command does if my command
is equal to Michael the string Michael
open a window in this in the same tab or
somehow I'm saying it right open a
window in the same tab open the page in
the same tab because window dot open
normally opens in a new window and
that's annoying I wanted to go right to
it so for example it would normally do
something like that this way
it opens in the same tab that's what
this logic does right here or this
rather and then we have or if my command
is equal to lower case and do the same
thing but let me show you where there
could be a problem so if I type Michael
like this it returns if I need to type
Michael like that it returns but if I
tighten Michael like this it doesn't
because Michael with the capital I is
not defined and I'm in normal
circumstances what you would do to solve
this is write a function or some other
block of code that would convert your
input to all capitals or all lowercase
before running the command so if I said
something like this the computer would
actually read it in all uppercase and it
would it would then run it so that it
would be all uniform I'm probably not
explaining that as best as I could but
the point being there is a way to code
it so that no matter where your
punctuation is you have to spell it
right but no matter where your
capitalization is rather and this H you
know that the program would understand
that the
means Michael and not like these weird
capital letters throughout the text
there are so many if statements here and
probably with the first round of
refactoring it's gonna be turned into a
switch statement with different cases
and each Deb is going to have their own
case there might even be a better way to
do it than that but that's the one I
immediately thought of my next step with
this is to implement a comment section I
am NOT going to be coding my own comment
section as much as I would love to keep
the comments in my own database I'm
gonna have to bite the bullet and I
might just go with disgust
some of you di asked you us during seen
it around it's a pretty popular comment
section I just the idea of some company
owning guests posts is kind of a
turn-off but it does seem to be the
optimal solution in this case and it's
free for small apps such as this one so
you could go to Elise's for example and
there'd be a discuss comment section
down here for people to you know give
kudos and whatnot and that would take a
lot of work out of a lot of things as
far as coding the comment section so two
other things I want to add about this
site before I sign off is that number
one I used skeleton for these actual
devs skeleton is boilerplate responsive
CSS it's like bootstrap without smelling
like bootstrap it's very scaled-down and
it's it's beautiful it saved me so many
hours of making this look perfect and I
did spend some time with margins and
padding and stuff and putting things
here and there but you know 80% of my
work was done just by plugging in the
skeleton and putting in a few tweaks the
second thing I want to add about this
site is that because each developer has
their own HTML page they get their own
URL and so on this might end up being a
really nice static site using Jekyll and
I actually just deployed my portfolio
site on Jekyll a few days ago and it's I
really dig it it's pretty cool very very
refreshing getting away from WordPress
and other content management systems so
this might be
a great candidate to convert to Jekyll
or some other static site generator all
in all I am really happy about the way
this layout looks call me crazy but some
people might think this layout is
absolutely hideous but I think it
captures the essence of the Internet and
also these doves too it cleans it up
once you hit these Devas page and makes
it makes it more modern it makes it hip
makes it stylish
and then we go back to the old school
here with the terminal oh one more thing
check this out check this out check this
out yeah what's up so freaking cool all
right guys this is gonna go live maybe
in a few days got a few more cleanups to
do but I hope you find this video
helpful and you will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
