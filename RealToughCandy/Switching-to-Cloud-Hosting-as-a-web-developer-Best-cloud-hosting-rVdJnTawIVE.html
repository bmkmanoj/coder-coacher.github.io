things about Amazon Web Services right
kws you've probably heard a lot of cool
things about digital ocean too right
probably heard a lot of cool things
about Google's cloud service right today
I'm going to show you my choice for
cloud hosting and it's the unblended
array of servers oh it's heavenly today
on the roads of candy gel
for most beginning and aspiring web
developers the cheapest shared web
hosting plan is just fine what does it
mean by shared you share an IP address
with like a lot of other people who may
be bandwidth hogs but that's ok because
your sites aren't getting a lot of
traffic you can spend 10 bucks a year
just maintaining your sites and not have
a problem but once you start getting
freelance clients and working for people
who are paying you you're gonna want to
add that extra layer of security of
speed and trust with these sites that
you deploy now I've done a lot of
research on this because I'm working
with the client right now who expects a
lot of traffic on their website and we
decided to go with a wordpress solution
now Namecheap offers VPS hosting
packages ok this VPS pretty solid
solution but I wanted something a little
edgier I wanted I mean this this is fine
this is fine but what really was out
there so I started exploring cloud
hosting solutions
you know there's AWS Google has one of
course there's digitalocean and a ton of
others and honestly a lot of these
services you spend four or five hours
just getting deep into the rabbit hole
with the specs and like comparison and
stuff so I did find one that allows you
to choose what server you want to use
that's when I found this cloud waste
site now the cool thing about cloud
weighs is that as you can see in this
lovely little gift is that you pick what
server you want to use you decide how
big that you want that server to be you
decide where you want it to be located
and then you also pick your application
from WordPress to Presta in a bunch of
different PHP apps this site right here
is not for my client it's something I'm
playing around with just for personal
entertainment and learning it's a fork
from Presta now a few days ago I did set
up my first server pretty modest in size
there's nothing alive on here these are
just experiments
add a server is simply just click the
button you select what app you want and
this is all PHP stuff custom app
wordpress drupal 30 b's opencart
PrestaShop you probably heard of a lot
of these pick what application you plan
on using select your server select the
size select the location and then you
just create another server so some of
you may be thinking like really this is
all PHP stuff exactly if you would
develop a node or something that's not
PHP I do not recommend using cloud ways
there are so many other platforms that
are great for node applications and just
like non PHP applications but this is
perfectly suited for WordPress so if
you're a wordpress developer definitely
recommend this one and I just love that
you can choose your server you can
choose the size you can choose where you
want it to be located and you get of
course your own IP address so there's
not like people jostling for space or
like threatening to shut down your
websites because they're being greedy
where other websites are awesome because
a lot of people are visiting them this
is normally my life right here the image
on the left side when I'm working for
clients because there's so many things
to consider the security is big the web
app is big the infrastructure you know
how it goes anybody who freelances this
is it can be a nightmare hey Claude ways
just makes it kind of like dev dummy
proof I love doing web master stuff I
think it's fun but that's not really
what I'm getting paid for and I've had
some serious headaches just like
spending hours trying to figure out
SSL's
odd ways so far I had a secure server up
and running in like three minutes it was
pretty awesome so here's how to glance
what they support again all PHP programs
and then their hosting infrastructure
partners some real big names here which
was cool because Amazon Web Services if
you use it if you go directly to AWS
it's overwhelming they have so many
tools this is there a hosting stack I've
heard a lot of great things about the
varnish cache and from my experiment so
far lightning fast even with WordPress
sites WordPress developers who are
watching this video know exactly what
I'm talking about and it's absolutely it
absolutely kills me because there's
gorgeous WordPress themes out there but
you turn off half your audience because
it takes six seconds to load the
get homepage the pricing plans here are
pretty interesting to note there are
serious differences in prices between
like digital ocean and AWS especially
when you get to the smaller size of
servers so you can go through all these
and decide which cloud plan you want to
use that is actually very cool the other
cool thing is that with all of these you
don't need a digital ocean account to
use their data centers as you can see
this includes the digital ocean hosting
charge and you don't need to pay extra
and you don't need an account so that's
a big bonus as well but I definitely
encourage you to check it out if you
plan on getting some freelance clients
you don't want to be doing shared
hosting for your clients bad the minimum
you want to provide for your clients is
VPS hosting and again you can do that on
Namecheap but I like the idea of the
cloud and I like the idea of this like
truly like three click setup and like
four click launch free trial if you love
it let me know if it sucks let me know
let me know your experiences hope this
