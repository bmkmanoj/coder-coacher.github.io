bactericidal your today how are you guys
doing holy buckets there is so much to
announce before I get to the protein of
this video first and foremost shout out
to Michael Kornblum who took it upon
himself to start a gator Lobby chat room
area for the real tough candy Channel
still exploring it still thinking about
kind of the theme I want to go with of
course it's open to anybody to talk
about anything but I'd like to keep it
on topic and first and foremost to help
you guys on your learning journey
whatever your dreams are in tech second
of all this week on the channel is going
to be insane I have my interview
tomorrow with a very talented and
productive web developer based out of
Dallas Texas and they're going to have a
lot of videos you know a lot about
salary negotiation I'm going to be
talking about what he does on day to day
basis so you want to stay tuned for that
and third guys check out my newsletter I
hand kick remote jobs for junior devs
and something might be saying yeah I
know it's called remote jobs
I or whatever website it is but I get
special newsletters from like seven
different organizations that I've signed
up through meetups and gift for
organizations and these are going to be
the top of the top so we won't want to
miss that and also two tutorials from
around the web that will not waste your
time they are protein-packed my
newsletter is the protein bar of the a
junior web development world so check
that out real tough Kenny calm we
already have some subscribers didn't
wait till the 25th subscriber to push
that out that is out of the way guys
without further ado today's topic sex
now if anyone out there is like me
here's what happens when I see these
technologies related to what I'm doing I
see it I panic and then I try learning
it in ten minutes and I fail and watch a
Derek baños video can't keep up and
never go back to it or go back to it a
year later mostly because I don't
understand it from the get-go SAS is
something I was always kind of running
away from but more and more as I'm
exploring bootstrap templates and other
things for development there are the SAS
files and I have no idea what that was
guys SAS is going to be your friend a
lot of these tools
I know I cannot even use right now like
performance tools to make your website
go faster like it'd be cool if I could
just get a website going in the first
place I'll worry about those tools later
but SAS can really help you I'm not
going to go through all the ways it can
help you and I'm going to show you the
interior the guts of how SAS works to
make it painless and make your
transition to SAS a little easier
probably the hardest thing in all of
this is getting SAS because I run it
through the command line here and it
listens for changes in my S SAS CSS file
I'll show you exactly what that means
but let's go over to the s CSS here now
this is a file I have created for my
little index.html here you guys can see
obviously straight up from the 90s but
it's made simple just to illustrate what
I'm doing here to declare a variable in
SAS you simply add the dollar sign SAS
listens again in your command in your
terminal if you're on a Mac or there's
other ways to do it definitely bring the
documentation or watch a quick youtube
video because that might be the biggest
problem you have with this whole SAS
thing once you get past that it's pretty
smooth rolling and it's straightforward
so I have a color here called this blue
Roxanne I declared that variable the
dollar sign so now instead of having to
remind myself in googling what the heck
color this is because I don't know that
off the top of my head I named it
something that's easily memorable for me
when I'm coding so I'm like oh yeah
that's my favorite blue color I'm just
going to throw it in here as color so as
you can see here my paragraph and h1
tags are affected and did a little nav
bar action here and I declared these
variables as colors too so whoo I got
the perps okay I know what that one is
so you hover over there OOP there is my
purse there's another feature SAS offers
called nesting and as you can see I have
some nesting action here one thing I
found most interesting about using SAS
is that when you connect your index.html
or whatever you're using as your index
page for your HTML when you're
connecting to a stylesheet you don't
connect using the S CSS file you created
you connect to a CSS file that SAS
creates so what's a fuzz is takes your F
CSS values it stands for sass CSS which
is this right here
it takes all this information
because the browser doesn't understand
what this is this actually has to be
converted to regular CSS I'm going to
show you what sass does so after it's
all said and done and I save my SPSS
file sass creates this and you can see
here a pretty compact pretty neat
looking but kind of a pain to code not
as intuitive and not a straightforward
to read and there's other things you can
use in sass such as there's mixed in
there's partials I won't even go into
those if you're looking for a
down-and-dirty quick resource that's
free the new Boston is the place to go
he does really user friendly tutorials a
lot of this stuff is really high-quality
one of the very few very few resources
on YouTube where you can learn a
tutorial where you're not doing stupid
and you actually go away learning
something as to as opposed to be like oh
yeah it was a good tutorial I totally
forgot but his style is very accessible
I know udemy offers a few courses on
sass too but try that try the new Boston
he has some pretty pretty high-quality
material the one other kid bit I want to
add before closing out here is that sass
is syntactically different than F CSS
sass itself if you're coding this in
your stylesheet it's more like
hippie-dippie there's not a lot of like
curly braces you know that everything is
kind of like slowing um you know the
compiler will read this as well but me
personally I like something is a little
more structure it helps me read these
little curly braces and stuff all that
punctuation helps me visually is kind of
like stop signs and yield signs and kind
of directs my flow when I'm reading the
the code but that's something else you
will learn if you investigate just
briefly scratch the surface again a
great tool almost mandatory I will say
if you guys are trying to do some
bootstrap stuff or you know look at
other people's code and CSS it's a great
way to efficiently code and have some
fun with it and just those variables are
super fun again but there's also so many
other unique things you can do that may
look more intimidating than they
actually are hope this video is helpful
thank you guys for subscribing and keep
the comments coming love hanging out
with you guys and saying hi want to talk
more about all the stuff going on
Nexxus video there is just so much to
talk about hope this video was helpful
we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
