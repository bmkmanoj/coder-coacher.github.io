let's get to today's topic this week's
focus in the dev mojo newsletter is
interviews and I opened up the
newsletter with a personal experience
about bringing a MacBook Pro to a
graphic design company and the
president's laughed at me I want to
share more about that experience and I
deeper into what I did wrong with that
and why I got laughed at for bringing an
industry-standard product to an
interview and hopefully that can help
you guys avoid some awkward situations
in the interview room when you're going
after web development interviews let me
set the scene for you this was last year
I wanted to make some extra money it was
a part-time job I saw just flipping
through one of those free newspapers
like those really shady newspapers with
kind of weird advertisements in the back
there was a hard time opening for
graphic designers physicians I called
him up everything was great I mean they
sounded normal size good and it's called
the number you know that I saw on that
little three magazine set up an
interview all of my files are on a
Photoshop which of course are also on my
macbook so I have my portfolio you know
I'm dressed pretty smartly feeling good
about it get to the interview I have my
trusty MacBook in my messenger bag like
what more stereotype do you need for
this job right so I'm in the interview
room and there's a woman there who took
my call and set up the interview I don't
know her job position secretary maybe I
really don't know what you did in the in
the business and the company's president
who was also the manager of the entire
operation have you guys ever went to an
interview where you're so nervous you
have an autobody experience and the
person is talking less with you and more
attitude because your eyes are saucers
and we're starting to get a little
swirly eyed is that just me well I was
at a point of like a 10 out of a 10 for
being nervous almost to the point of a
panic where I was sweating and I just
had a focus on something so the guys
like sitting right here and his
bookshelves right here so I'm like
listening to what he's talking about
with his company you know how I kind of
developed from the 90s and I'm seeing
these titles give me something focus on
a call my nerves and I see all these
text title from technologies that are
really popular in the 90s and a lot of
windows-based text book and at this
point it's like almost up to 11 because
I have this MacBook right this thing I'm
super proud of describes max he's
talking more about his company it turns
out he started his company and he made
his claim to fame via developing for
Karrie software for the windows platform
for the PC I said okay this could be
like a little friendly to take it here
you know army versus Navy one team one
fight right yes no army wants to kill
Navy in the situation because this guy
saw my MacBook and he was incredulous
you know I had a sneaking suspicion it
had something to do i computer but at
the same time like the response wasn't
quite in line with what was happening
you know maybe a mosquitoes tweeter was
in his ear or something I don't know he
looked at me wild-eyed and incredulous
he said I don't want to see that MacBook
and he was kind of joking but kind of
not she was a little like a
passive-aggressive thing and I was just
like yeah sure okay no problem let me
tell you about some of the projects I've
worked on face to face benefit we ended
the interview on a positive note with
another crack about the MacBook and I
was being totally self-deprecating at
that time about my foolish ways for
using a Mac let's just say the whole
experience kind of stuff because my
development environment is based on a
Mac am I totally tied to it to the rest
of my life no but for the time being and
at that time I was comfortable and I was
really productive and I still am on a
MacBook so that is one of my
requirements for a fruitful production
session whether I'm doing coding graphic
design video editing doesn't matter this
this little box right here is is mine
and it's something I succeeded probably
wanting to play not good fit because
their programs are on Windows computers
yeah I know for graphic designers
watching this right now you're probably
like you're better off not even working
for that company I know I should have
done my research and that was the
purpose of telling that whole story
because I didn't do my research and
because I didn't do my research
thoroughly on this company I potentially
burned a bridge I mean this guy thinks
I'm an idiot
and also I wasted my time when I could
have when I could have been applying my
skills to other places that appreciate
my workflow and my work ethic and my
productions on my various platforms this
mandatory homework also of course
especially applies to you guys who
are about to be doing some web
development interviews or any kind of
tech interview pulled up this really
embarrassing article this guy Roach not
for the faint of heart because there are
some things or like oh wow I do that
stuff sometimes in interviews and he did
not get the job at Google a lot of you
guys are hoping one day to work at
Google I know you can do it guys
remember in the interview that's where
most of the hiring decision is made if
they're calling you in they already have
a good indication that you're probably a
good candidate but so you're already up
here but there's like the ceiling right
here where gaps at shoes before you hit
the top of the suing you know what I
mean how you respond how you present
yourself
you're finessing of your communication
skills all come together in this
interview let's take a look at this
Matthew Foutz article I'm not focusing
in the comment box below if you guys
take a look at it's a pretty fun read in
a schadenfreude a type of way but here's
the things he did wrong when he
interviewed with Google he overdressed
he was too nervous now this other thing
like what does he suggest like just
start popping xanax
he used curse words which to me to me is
a no brainer I mean that's strictly
verboten even if your interviewer is a
little relaxed and like drop an f-bomb
and he did not have the technical
competence this is the one thing I will
add that Matthew Foutz did not add on
here spends 30 minutes not five not ten
but a good quality deep dive into this
company you will potentially work for
you've worked too hard for it to just
waste your time to go to an interview
take a quick example here
I quickly googled web developers in
America this is the top hit for some
reason if I was going to go to an
interview with this company the first
thing I see is that there are some
really big-time corporate people here
okay
NFL Toys R Us NFL billion-dollar
industry
NASA huge government contracts hng P&amp;amp;G
billion-dollar company this is a place
where I wouldn't wear jeans in a smart
t-shirt I'd wear smart slacks may be a
sensible skirt not sexy ladies sensible
and this is just something I'm picking
up 10 seconds on their homepage here
check out the about us get some names if
they have a blog
read their blog and see who wrote that
article for the company and said you
know I read Jeff's article about website
hosting and the importance of having a
VPS it was very well-written article and
looking forward to reading more or
something like that
tell your interviewers that you care
about their company and you're
interested if you're just there for the
money because I've been on the other
side I've interviewed people I don't
want somebody working for me who's just
in it for the money
yes I know it's easy to get dollar signs
for pupils but if you're sitting across
from me
and all I see are those dollars time
you're going to get the hell out of my
office and I'm not going to call you
back and no legitimate company is
because they want your sweat is wealth
and lots of passion so take my silly
lesson as an example of what not to do I
didn't research the company if I would
have gone to this company's website and
research more about this company
president and I would have known what
these of big wyndam-pryce doesn't have a
light from macbook guys I said in my
last video if you work so hard to
gaining skills I mean this stuff takes a
long time even if you've only been at it
two or three months that's a long time
and you don't want to be throwing these
opportunities away this Lakers games
this isn't an interview for a fast food
restaurant no I respect my fast-food
workers because one of the hardest
freaking jobs in America but it's a
completely different bosses guys I hope
this video was helpful again bumpin
bumpin bumpin here at the RTC channel
you guys are doing great stuff I'm doing
some cool things I'm excited to show you
guys the electric Pomodoro album is
coming out soon I'm working on udemy

incredible place to just stop by say hi
and I'm working on my time management so

description box because I'm going to
