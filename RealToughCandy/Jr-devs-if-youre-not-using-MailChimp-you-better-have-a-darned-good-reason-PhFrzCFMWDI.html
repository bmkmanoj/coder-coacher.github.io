koat.com back in business with you today
Oh back in the saddle how you guys doing
some cool announcement I have to make
real quick and then on to the protein of
this video first of all thanks to my
newest subscribers troops too much Clint
and Ryan you three are my most recent
and thank you for coming along to check
out channel number two there are some
pretty food stuff going on as far as
interviews well next week I'm having a
special guest or going have multiple
videos from the special guests because
we're going to be talking about so much
this guy's a web developer he's been
doing it for a bit and he's a mentor he
is an expert on salary negotiation and
he's going to talk about what he does on
a day to day basis how much he does
actual coding how much time he spends in
meetings and so on and so forth so you
won't want to miss that again it's going
to be a series next week I interview him
on Tuesday and then Wednesday we're
going to start pumping out the videos
for you guys so that's very exciting
today's topic is MailChimp and why you
should have a good excuse if you're not
using it because MailChimp as I've
realized is a huge boost to any sort of
e-commerce site or any type of sales
site whether you're selling a physical
good a service or just an idea as they
explain that it is a marketing
automation service and as long as you're
not big-time you can use this for free
so I decided to use this for my website
and I show you guys some features and
kind of behind the scenes if you haven't
taken the plunge in particular I wanted
a modal which is a pop-up a fancy way of
saying pop-up which you will see in
about 3 seconds hopefully there we go
this is a modal aka pop-up on topic side
note if you are interested in junior dev
opportunities tech articles and
tutorials and stuff like that in a
newsletter directly to your inbox so
we're on my website and sign up it is
going to be hot it is going to be hot I
don't mess around it can't pick curated
eficient for you guys I hate newsletters
I hate things in general exists like
things in general that waste time and I
will tell you guys right now this
newsletter will not be a waste of your
time if you're looking
the kind of stuff so now push up that
newsletter ouch for the first once I hit
my 25th subscribers so get over there
they're interested in sign up anyway
back to this this is a pop up for that
in my school what's the best way to do
this because even the newest of noobs
can code a pop-up poem Moodle it's like
six lines of code it's that you can find
it easily on w3schools calm but I don't
have a database and I'm not at the point
yet where I can maintain a big list or
even a small list of subscribers and
people who are using my services so I
googled it and I came up with MailChimp
and this looks pretty darn good now what
I like about MailChimp is if we go back
here the templates are on point
templates excuse me I would say
templates
Tim guy the templates are on point so to
start with the modal you would go to
list and I've experiment in here but it
literally takes about five seconds
sometimes seconds you have to confirm it
in your email that you want to make this
um so once you get wrong it's very very
fast now once you get that pop-up going
and you get that deployed you probably
want to work on your actual newsletter
or your announcement that again digging
by email and again a very
straightforward process this is the
campaign's page right here let's go edit
this one this is the actual newsletter
the demo Jose and litter I'm working on
and you can see here just it's a
drag-and-drop interface
no it doesn't require any coding this is
not necessarily a bad thing because
while many web developers could code
these templates it would take a lot and
as many people have noted before notably
at coding days people aren't looking
Agricola tokay they want to see if what
you create work and if it's effective
for users and if they stick around and
use your product that's all they care
about because all those things mean
dollar signs your code doesn't
necessarily have to have dollar signs on
it the way it worked
does so this is where I have been
getting started on this desin newsletter
this week effective mojo it's all about
the Benjamin you know you throw this one
end let's see what happens to do this
look at that you see how easy that is
and getting this in an inbox this looks
like
Realtree as I do save myself from the
spirit of that as you can see very easy
to undo Singh so that's the content
design you have all the functionality
there are some things that you don't
have control over for example going back
to that pop-up that modal example that I
showed you on my website the only thing
they let you add as a free user with
email first name and last name one thing
I can see being a potential fold up once
you get more advanced in your skills is
that the database is on MailChimp so you
know the control you have over your
subscribers is limited you can see there
is PS detailed information like that is
not available I'm not sure if that's
available on paid programs paid
subscriptions but either way no matter
what description you choose the free or
otherwise that information goes to their
server so if you want to get your list
you want to get updates and stuff and
have to go to the MailChimp website
which is not a bad thing again this
isn't about coding this is about adding
functionality to the sites that you're
working on get a critique I have heard
people say about these pop-ups
is that they're annoying my response is
most marketing is annoying but some very
effective I hope this video was helpful
giving a little behind the scenes look
at how it worked all right guys thanks
for watching don't forget to tune in
next week is going to be a huge week on
the RTC channel thanks for stopping by
will see the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
