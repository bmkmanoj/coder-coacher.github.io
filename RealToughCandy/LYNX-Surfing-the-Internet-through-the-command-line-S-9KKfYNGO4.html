tough candy calm back in the saddle with
you today I want to show you something
so cool
last night rather this morning at about
4:00 in the morning in a fit of
curiosity I got a little curious with
this links text web browser it's text
only no gizmos no doodads no gadgets and
I want to just take a few minutes to
show you guys what it's all about and
what you can really explore using a text
only browser because it really opened my
eyes now granted I've only been using it
for a few hours but it's been opening my
eyes and giving me a kind of a different
perspective on the structure of webpages
and just different perspective all
together so let's take a look at what
we're working with again this is called
links and it was developed in the early
90s to be a browser for the Gopher
protocol if you guys you know know your
history even mildly like I do which I
kind of just discovered so by no means
am i authority but the Gopher protocol
was developed in an academic setting and
then was eventually supplanted replaced
by the World Wide Web gopher is still
used here and there mostly by
enthusiasts links is used today mostly
though for visually impaired people
because it's a great browser to be used
for text-to-speech and also Braille so
as far as people who are not visually
impaired it's not it's kind of a kind of
a curiosity but let's just fire it up
and I'll show you exactly what I'm
talking about so I downloaded it from
links Tut invisible - island net I'll
include that in the description box in
this video in case you're interested in
but let's just go like this let's let's
fire it up here I'm just simply going to
type in links and again we're in the
terminal on a Mac book here and we're
gonna log on to the browser here we go
it's just it's a little more visible for
you guys okay
so this is the homepage of the links
browser this is the top-level page and
this is where we always start and at
first I was like okay what do I do but
as you can see oh the little thing works
okay cool
so there are a lot of options here
actually we can go over these in another
video perhaps but mostly what I've been
using is the up and down arrows and the
left and right and that's pretty much
what all everything you need to just get
started including the g4 go so I'm gonna
press G here because I want to I want to
log on to this web dude I want to get I
want to get crackin let's go to oh I
don't know let's go to ebay comm so
again to get this prompt here I just hit
G on my keyboard and then ebay comm and
I'm gonna hit enter and you guys will
see I gotta accept these cookies just
click yeah click why I'm clicking why
here why here why here why here and also
to another neat thing is that aside from
seeing a different perspective as far as
the anatomy of a web page goes you can
also you also have to manually accept
these cookies so it brings attention to
these cookies and other things that are
going on in this browser whereas you
know a traditional browser it's just an
automatic you know if your settings are
set to accept cookies it's just an
automatic thing you don't think about so
kind of opens your mind to everything
that's going on on a web page so here we
are here at the home page of ebay calm
again all in text and another thing guys
you don't with links you don't have to
download an ad blocker because none of
that stuff is ever going to show up in
links no pictures no ads no videos and
that's the other thing too is you start
noticing how excessive the modern-day
web really is I love this kind of thing
when I use it as a day-to-day go to
browser
no but when I'm tired and beat and I
kind of have web fatigue from all these
ads even with a bad blocker you know
they still they still sneak in here and
there with excuse me pictures and videos
and just this excess this is a nice
alternative to just go and relax and
have some fun exploring certain things
so let's explore here we're gonna type
in candy because that's part of my name
so I simply typed in candy and I'm gonna
just use my arrow key to go down to
search I'm gonna hit enter probably have
to accept another cookie for this to
work and then we can go down here using
me okay and look at all these related
results we have chocolate bulk candy
Japanese candy Wonka candy chocolate
candy gum skittles wholesale candy
Mexican candy kit kit kit kat sour candy
cotton candy machine
crazy hamburger poppin cookin kit DIY
candy that's really not doing it for me
on the other hand we got to put this
into perspective because there's fifty
nine thousand three hundred forty two
results for candy well well it's a boy
bubblegum cigars candy 36 count no
Monica Lewinski up in this links today
we'll keep browsing Albanese candy
atomic fireballs Whitman's giant sampler
ooh
airheads so I'm just using my arrow keys
and now as you can see airheads into the
top of the screen is highlighted I'm
gonna hit enter and it's gonna go to the
airheads grape 36 count candy ball
candies listing probably after annex to
accept another cookie and another so and
again I'm using the basic up-and-down
arrows for this but you see all this
alternate stuff these are like different
languages and whatnot I'm not gonna go
to them because I'll probably end up at
some spiral but I know there's a command
there's a combination of commands where
you can like quickly go to where you
want to go on the page rather than using
these arrow keys and giving yourself
carpal tunnel so let's go down here
because this is the page with listing so
Oh
who details about airheads grape 36
count candy ball candies taffy chew
airhead airhead 5.0 average based on two
priorities people this gets a 5 star
rating I'm out to get some air heads
okay so then we have a seller
information whose names fascist fascist
2014 he has 99 point sent ninety nine
point four percent positive feedback his
store is called Michele's pantry and he
doesn't have any other items for sale
that's kind of queer he's only selling
airheads on eBay and he's already sold
36 and this is just again guys this is
text only of what you would see a mirror
image of what you would see on a Google
Chrome a safari and Internet Explorer
insert your browser here ebay item
number it has a condition all that store
categories race soup base hmm and so on
and so on so if I wanted to go back like
I don't know airheads I was feeling it
but now not so much so I'm just gonna
hit the left arrow key and it goes back
look how quick that happened loading
times well with the exception of the
cookies which do take a little bit but
as far as loading it's nearly
instantaneous sugar daddy caramel pops
okay let's get out of here you guys see
how that works and then you can go to
like this is what gift carton I don't
really like gift cards daily deals mama
needs new shoes what do we got for daily
deals 70% off spring into savings up to

we've had our fun on eBay let's try like
you wanna try a social media site
so I press
you forego and now at the bottom here
it's waiting for me to input where I
want to go let's go to facebook.com and
originally like I said links use the
Gopher protocol but it also to you know
catch up with the 21st century is using
HTTP and HTTPS using some plug-in or
platform a camera when it's called but
so it does it does conform to you know
modern-day protocols
oh you're using a web browser that isn't
supported by Facebook there's a mill
there's 1 billion active users on
Facebook but what about people who need
a streamlined text-to-speech they can't
use Facebook is that what they're saying
accessibility issues let's go oh it
still lets me guys honestly I can't even
log in I'm gonna try and just like give
a goober password
I can't log in because I got kicked off
of Facebook because I said I wasn't real
so we're gonna try and log in that
number 1 make sure I just press number 1
or sure press ENTER I press ENTER and
see what happens
ok not so much okay
log in mmm okay that's a refresh that's
not compute I don't know guys maybe if
you're feeling adventurous you could try
this one but I'm not gonna be able to
get in anyway because like I said I got
kicked off let's try one more just for
kicks let's go to let's go to google.com
let's see what happens there except some
cookies how wouldn't I'm feeling lucky
not even a Google search I'm feeling
lucky so I'm just use my arrow key press
Enter
allowing some cookies here oops oh here
we go
Holi festival hol iers more doodle
details Chinese New Year okay so a lot
of this is image based Bram Stoker's one
hundred and sixty fifth birthday
are these all doodles that's not really
gonna be helpful for us is it let's try
and see what this brown sugar is one
65th birthday is all about bad HTML use
trace to diagnose and guys this is one
thing that bad HTML I haven't really
discovered yet but look at this I hit
enter on this and this is all about Bram
Stoker's a hundred Stoker's 165th
birthday he's a legendary villain when
he penned his 19th century story Darach
jana and here you go everything you
wanted to know about Bram Stoker but
never cared to ask too embarrassed and
then Herman Aurora is 129 daddies though
this old so we're gonna go ahead click
left and that is the gist of it guys
this links browser have some fun with
the internet if you need a break from
your traditional browser give it a whirl
it took me it it's obviously very light
on memory and storage as far as
downloading it to your computer so no
worries about that again I'll put the
link in the description box if you're
interested in messing with links lots of
stuff to learn let's go to options real
quick and as you can see very
customizable here as far as document
appearance different commands
whatnot and then there's also a robust
help section
oops so help with HTML ww3 documents or
w3 documents rather validation services
and search engines that work with links
as of 2010 so not quite updated I love
the old school feel of this and being
able to browse in terminal is pretty
freakin cool all right guys I'm gonna
exit out of here thanks
for watching and we will see you the
next video if I can spell see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
