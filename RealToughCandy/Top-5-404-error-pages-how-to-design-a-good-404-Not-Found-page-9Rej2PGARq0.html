the Internet we're gonna explore this
one and more today after I die on the
real tough candies you real tough candy
for real tough candy calm back online
it's you today
404 pages you fell through the cracks
and now we have to convince you to stay
on our website button we're gonna be
looking at 5 404 pages that each have a
little certain something that add value
to an unpleasant situation for your
users this 404 page on github you see a
lot because people are continuously
tweaking their code and change in
location of things but github does a few
cool things here to make sure that you
stay on the site number one they have
the github icon dude doing his thing in
a CSS animation number two the 404 I go
back and forth with I mean do most
people care that you put 404 on here but
we're web developers so if you're on
github you know what a 404 means and if
you don't they tell you what it means
then they add a search box which is a
great added value for the 404 page
because it allows you and allows the
users to take control of a negative
situation
let's why not get all tough candy let's
see that tells the user yeah I'm on the
right track the next one that's really
cool is MongoDB s
404 and if you develop in MongoDB or
have any experience with MongoDB then
this has special meaning for you and you
recognize it it's a very clever creative
404 and kind of mirroring the github
page they say okay let's try it again
but if you don't even know what you're
looking for how about some links here's
one that's not particularly useful but
does have that hipster fundus to it 404
coming out of a pipe this is not a page
now the reason this isn't particularly
useful is because there's no option for
me to select I either have to hit my
back button or just get out of the
site completely so if this page were to
really be optimal have a search bar that
searches your site redirect it to your
home page after a few seconds or put a
few links there are many options to
getting your user on the right track
with your site
this one's from bit leave a lot of
people are familiar with this site if
you have a massive link this site
shortens it very convenient and this is
their 404 page something's wrong here
this is a really funny one there's just
like this poor bird this kind of
creature should never be seen in a body
of water it's a three-eyed something and
this poor seagull flapping around very
confused probably scared for its life
and the message is uh-oh bitly couldn't
find a link for the bitly URL you
clicked most bit links are four to six
characters and only include letters and
numbers and are case sensitive so I
really like this one because although
there's not a search bar there's not a
redirect it gives you more information
on the most common reason why you can't
find the link because they're four to
six characters they only include letters
and numbers and their case sensitive so
they're giving you additional
information on that and they also put
four nicely spaced links on your
actually it's three plus a copy rate
very nicely done and it has that
animation where it's just it's a fun
little thing to look at finally we have
the mother lode of 404 page if this is
koala and very highly engaging now at
first this one kind of turned me off
because it's like well what does this
have to do with the 404 and it's a total
time waster okay I lost with 45 invaders
destroyed score over a thousand to win a
discount on our hosting this is
brilliant because it's a game that you
want to play it's fun and you should
continue to engage they're gonna offer
you a discount on their hosting so you
can try again or have forget the game
let me just see your hosting this is
definitely the most creative 404 page I
have ever encountered I've never seen
anything like it this is my 404 page in
real tough candy calm it matches my
style it's fun it's a little dorky
anybody who surfs the web in the 90s
knows that this is a pretty accurate
representation of what we were working
with back then I think I might weaken a
little more just
a little bit but I also included the
search bar if you enjoyed this video
