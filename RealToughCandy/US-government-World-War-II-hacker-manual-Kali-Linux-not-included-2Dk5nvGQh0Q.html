candy from real tough candy calm back in
the saddle with you today not going to
lie I just totally scrapped a video I
was working on it was involving Group
Policy objects in windows server 2012
and it was so freaking boring I can't do
this man i'm going to systemadmin i'm
going back to my roots sabotage oh yeah
I want to share this freaking
fascinating manual I was going to say
awesome i'm not quite sure if it's at
that level yet but it's really
fascinating and if you are the type of
person that I am you can really glean a
lot of information from this thing and
kind of apply it to a hacking a computer
hacking severe I will get to that in one
moment let me give you some backstory to
this now this is published in nineteen
eighty-four it has since been
unclassified and you will note this is
straight from the mouth of babes over at
the CIA published in nineteen eighty
nineteen forty 40 1984 did that slip
1944 by the Office of Strategic Services
which was the eminent spy agencies
before the CIA and FBI came along I'm
not sure what the FBI but for the CIA
for sure see you mention 40 40 published
for the information and guidance of all
concerned and will be used as a basic
doctrine for Strategic Services training
for the subject so that I'm going to I'm
going to go a little move up the script
a little to sum up this document it
basically shows you how to break
pardon my language that's the best and
most efficient way I can explain this
thing so as they pretty much use the
same language only in 1944 terms the
purpose of this paper is to characterize
simple sabotage to outline the possible
effects and to present suggestions for
inciting and executing it again this is
like
if you apply this to a hacking with a
puter hacking environment you can really
learn things from a different
perspective I don't want maybe not even
learn things which is perceive things
from a different perspective let me see
if I can illustrate my point here so I
talked about the saboteur basically the
person who is going to be committing
these acts it was safety measures here
we go it should not be difficult to
prepare leafless another media for this
on a tour about the choice of weapons
time and targets which will ensure the
saboteur is detection or retaliation
including trying to commit acts for
which large numbers of people could be
responsible for instance with you blow
the wiring in a factory and essential
firebox so if anyone could have done it
on the street sabotage after dark such
as you might be able to carry out
against the military card truck is
another example of an act for which it
would be impossible to blame you now me
being a little deviant now legally and
might add always legal always get seize
illegal but you know committing acts for
which large numbers of people can
responsible to be responsible I'm
thinking about my security options here
VPNs tours and other onion Network the
darknet just various and will go on and
on you guys know what I'm saying and
then we talk about communication
facilities suggestions for simple
sabotage they say warehouses barracks
offices hotels in factory buildings are
outstanding targets for simple sabotage
now again applying this to a hacking
atmosphere just replace these mounds
with things you can focus on using a
network if may or may not involve the
internet so here's a good one water and
miscellaneous forget to provide paper
and toilets oh god that's the worst put
tightly rolled paper hair and other
obstructions in the toilet the WC water
closet since it that's
that's a good one that's a after off put
a coin beneath the bulb in a public
where we're going to cover its public in
a public building during the daytime so
that fuses will blow out when lights are
turned on at night the fuses themselves
and be rendered ineffective by putting a
coin behind them are loading them with
Kobe wire and it just goes on I mean
it's not a huge read electric motors
including dynamos guys this is the og
Anarchist Cookbook okay don't sleep on
this it's little over 32 pages it's not
even 32 pages 32 full pages this is the
simple sabotage feel Matt field of
manual highly recommended available
through who else the Central
Intelligence Agency hope this video was
helpful definitely recommend this
available of course for free access is
this some sort of honey pods the CIA is
offering I don't know Mensch P's and Q's
thanks for watching guys see in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
