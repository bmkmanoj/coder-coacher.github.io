come back online with you today new
article alerts my interview to the
Silicon Valley startup this is what
happened in other news today I'm going
to show you my development computer what
I use to code test my code develop my
code admire my code and a cry about my
code and we're gonna start with the
basics so I am on a 2015 Mac let me go
open this up and show you guys the specs
here I got this computer before I was
really heavy into coding and the reason
I got a Mac was originally for my video
editing I was doing a lot of video
editing for clients graphic design and
whatnot so I needed something that could
run Final Cut Pro along with Photoshop
along with GarageBand sometimes all
three of those programs open at once and
let me tell you something about video
editing it is a memory hog so I needed
to get as much as possible here without
going too overboard I thought 16 gigs
will be fine for RAM and everything else
was negotiable I did want that 15 inch
screen prior to this I had a I think
like a 13 point something screen MacBook
and it just wasn't cutting it it would
always crash not because of the screen
size but it was a 13 inch and it has
like I don't know 4 gigs of ram
definitely wasn't cutting it this
computer has served me so well I love it
and it's so easy to develop I keep my
editors here I have sublime text and
Adam these two programs are always open
I never have to worry about them firing
up because they're always waiting for me
to code work always working on something
in both of these I haven't crossed over
to visual studio yet but once I do it's
gonna go right here I'm always in the
terminal doing something so that's
always open that's running a script
right now it's running a Python script
these are the browsers I test in I test
in Safari Chrome and Firefox
I have tor browser for personal uses
rather than development uses just a nice
little private browser to have when
you're not wanting to give your business
to these guys Mozilla is pretty fine to
give business to but these two I'm good
so these are my best my browser area
this is my note-taking area and this is
my creative area here I used these Final
Cut Pro this is what this looks like
doing a physic video on Carlos Santana's
website right now so this is my creative
area this is why your shark it's a
packet sniffing program and this is just
like miscellaneous stuff this Activity
Monitor is really helpful to see what
program is eating up the most of my
memory let's see right now uh-oh finders
not responding so you can see the energy
impact and average energy impact it's
really a little helpful program these
are the apps I have behind the scene my
sequel workbench it's a GUI for
databases for sequel databases
I prefer PHP admin but I do have the
workbench here just in case postman you
use that for developing api's this is a
really cool program for testing api's
and the interface is really cool
we won't open that today VirtualBox this
is another great thing to have on your
machine takes up a lot of energy a lot
of power but great for testing stuff
great for playing around right now I
having a bunch of as you can see here
and you set up all your specifics it's
totally fun you don't have to worry
about breaking stuff it's a totally safe
environment in the VirtualBox especially
if you want to experiment I also have a
machine here customized to run Python
scripts for data scraping that I was
experimenting with with Ubuntu as well
Ubuntu Ubuntu potato potato Wireshark is
that packet sniffing application I use
to hack a coding bootcamp website the
other day analyst goes on I won't bore
you with all this stuff but FileZilla is
another web development tool when you're
ready to transfer your files to your web
host what else what else what else what
else
OBS a great tool for live broadcasting
and making videos that's what I'm using
right now to record my YouTube videos
and this very video is on OBS love it
that is essentially my development
machine I don't have a desktop right now
would love to get one with multiple
monitors that is one thing that kind of
stinks about having a laptop is that you
know it is very portable clearly but you
can only use one monitor at a time and
when you're developing you know you
generally want to have a few windows up
so you can compare and contrast it'll
come I'm not too concerned about it but
it would be a nice addition shout-out to
Raven who wanted to see this video hope
you enjoyed it
know what you guys are working with as
far as development tools I'd love to
hear about your guys's different setups
and maybe some suggestions to
incorporate into this what I'm using
right now by and large I'm happy with
what I have but I would love to explore
some more stuff and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
