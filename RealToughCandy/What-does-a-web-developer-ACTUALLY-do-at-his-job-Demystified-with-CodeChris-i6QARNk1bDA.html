gentlemen this is my first live hangout
I'm not quite sure if it's working or
not let me go check the chat room if
anybody is there we're gonna start in
just a few minutes here if this is
working let's go over here let's see
thank you for your patience let's see we
are alive okay all right yep I see you
cool okay
it's 657 we got a few minutes so we'll
just wait for a few people to file in if
we're gonna have any live viewers I hope
we do have some tonight I am gonna go on
my second computer here excuse me one
moment and just make sure things are
working that's Missy okay cool there's
about like a 10 second delay okay cool
all right and we will start in just one
moment here oh yeah I'm on the screen -
okay awesome awesome great what's that I
said I love all the toys and stuff in
the background no big bang bang bang
okay I think well two minutes let's
let's give it the real the real the real
time woman here how was your day Chris
just oh it's it's been a crazy what we
been doing just you know normal Saturday
stuff running around getting uh getting
stuff ready for the holidays you know we
basically were taking our family photos
we got my wife saw parents coming in so
we're taking a big family photo and so
we're trying to get my little one a
outfit that matches and yeah kids man
keeps clothes it's like it's like a
whole nother realm I did not imagine
well you're pretty involved because I
remember
I saw a video of yours and there is like
this it looked like sweet grass or
lemongrass in the background it was like
a baby drying rack I'm like oh I feel
dumb but no I mean unless you have kids
like why would you why would you know
what that is
exactly that's cool yeah I forget like
Thanksgivings next weekend like oh my
god it's the holidays are here this is
crazy yeah yeah pretty much starts where
it's like that it's like the thing is
like once November starts you've got
this just like okay I've got you know
birthdays and holidays and just
Christmas and then you got you know all
this stuff and that's the busy time of
the year you know yeah it is for like a
month and a half man all right so we're
gonna de-stress now no more thinking
about the holidays we're gonna start
this live stream ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls thanks for tuning in
tonight I am real chef Candi and I am
joined tonight by Chris Marlow he is a
web developer on Chicago area and I
reached out to him because you know as a
beginning developer and as an aspiring
developer there are just so many freakin
resources like you don't know where to
start sometimes they do sometimes you
don't but there's such a disconnect
being a self-taught developer that
compared to the work space so tonight
Chris is gonna talk about some awesome
stuff he's gonna I'm gonna go through
the list he sent me about things he's
gonna talk about finding your direction
as a learner the realities of being a
self-taught developer practical
knowledge versus all knowledge work
reality versus imagined expectations
tools like gulp version control freedom
versus micromanagement working as a team
and then working by yourself you know
this other thing too is that when you're
learning and just starting you're kind
of in like this tutorial heaven where
you're not really challenged like you
are in the work space so he's gonna be
talking about that you crazy algorithms
and how he handles his stinks so that's
a lot to talk about and I'm gonna hand
it over to Chris right now I hope
everyone can you hear me again is my
first live stream so hopefully we will
avoid any technical difficulties but I'm
gonna throw it over to Chris and Chris
can take it away cool thanks to a tough
candy so just to do them quick Mic Check
can everybody hear me can I get a thumbs
up or like or something so I know this
is 10 second delay so okay
start talking and hopefully there's a
text reaction anyways
so in regards to this uh Celia let's go
ahead and begin so Who am I first of all
my name is Chris Krista Marlowe I'm also
on code Chris on YouTube and we hear you
that's good and so anyways so I'm a
self-taught web developer and my
background is actually not web
development I didn't go to school for
this or anything like that everything
I've learned is 100% either through
books or through online resources and
I'll kind of run through that a little
bit and I you know started my YouTube
channel and I figured I'd do this talk
because especially in the beginning or
just in general there's a lot of
questions about not only like you know
getting into the industry but more so
like what's actually important what's
not important all that stuff so let's go
ahead and get started cuz I'm sure
there's a lot of questions out there if
you do have any questions please feel
free just go ahead and just type it in
there
and real tough candy if you can just let
me know because I won't be watching it
as much as you will for sure and then
just will go ahead and just pop them in
as they come also so yeah let's go ahead
and get started so hmm so let's talk
about the very first thing so when you
start this process of whether you're
you're going to go to a boot camp or
you're and you teach yourself or you're
going to college whatever the case is
self taught the reality is is that when
you start looking at code and you use
like hey I'm gonna take this serious
what am I going to do the first thing
that I'd only recommend is find your
direction whether it's it's c-sharp or
JavaScript or whatever the case is
figure out exactly what it is you want
to do as a destination because that's
really gonna dictate everything you
learn in the beginning for me like when
I was trying to learn like I learned a
little bit of Python and I was like okay
maybe I should learn C and then I had a
buddy who's like really involved in like
c-sharp and I was you know I was mess
with all these things without fully
grasping anything and then that didn't
give me a clear direction so what I'm
gonna go ahead and do is just suggest
you find out what you want to do so if
you want to do for example mobile app
development you're like hey
I want to design for Android and and iOS
then then make that your focus and then
you already know what you what you want
to do and you can find the the
information you need okay need swift you
need Java you need Android all that
stuff if it's full stack if its front
end if it's back end even if it's AI or
Virtual Reality
internet of all things those are all
kind of specific paths and fields that
will really sort of like you know
eliminate a lot of all the extra noise
there's a ton of noise especially when
you get into this because you don't you
don't know what what you're what
direction you're trying to get into so
um kind of figure out where you want to
end up and then once you you do know
that eventually what's gonna dip
happening is you're gonna have the first
real question of like alright well you
know I want to get into mobile
development or I want to get into web
development and when you start applying
for jobs the reality is one of the first
questions are gonna be asked during all
the interviews during the entire process
is how much are you looking to to make
and salary is never comfortable idea for
a lot of people get comfortable with it
it's just a number and regardless of the
field that you're in just be comfortable
with with a number and more importantly
find out what your actual worth is this
is something i really suggest especially
if you're coming in you don't want to
under charge yourself and basically say
like oh like i'll do it for free you
know find out what the the competition
is in your area and the reason why i say
like oh don't ask for this much money is
because depending on where you live and
the jobs that are available to you in
your area is really going to dictate how
much you request right so if you live in
San Diego New York Chicago or you live
in the suburbs or if you live in like
Nebraska those are all very different
cost of living and what I would suggest
doing is doing two things like Glassdoor
go to indeed look at all the
applications and you'll start to see
things like
tree-level developer regular web
developer channel developer whatever it
is that you're looking for and you'll
get a sense for how much they're there
they're willing to pay and this is gonna
help you in your negotiation stage and
once again I know not everybody's
country with negotiations but it's an
important step even if you are just
trying to get your foot in the door
there is like a minimum threshold you
want to make sure that you meet and
that's just for your benefit because you
know you're doing this for a reason it's
it's I'm sure you're trying to do better
yourself better you're providing for
your family or you just you know want a
really nice car I don't I don't know
what the reason is but so so sort of
know your worth and don't be shy about
talking about it the next thing is you
know what my note here is lower the
temperature oh yeah if you are asking
for something lower just make sure
that's it's a temporary thing cuz in the
beginning the most important thing is
obviously giving your foot in the door
once you're in the door cuz let me tell
you the first job and and my expense
might be different from others but for
me it's being self-taught I don't have I
didn't have anything and I'll show you
how but I didn't have anything on paper
to show like experience I mean I I found
ways of showing code experience but at
the end of the day like I hadn't worked
for a company doing web development yet
so basically what you know you get to be
willing to sort of you can make some
adjustments for something that you know
it's gonna be more temporary because
once you get your foot in the door now
you have a year of experience now you
have two years experience three
experience whatever the case is and it's
much easier for you to move around and
shortly before this interview actually I
actually started my second job in web
development so I got my foot in the door
at one company got my experience under
my belt and my second job has been much
easier to get so much so that I will
have a little bit more of a flexibility
of like okay this is what I'm looking
for this is what I'm looking for and um
and I think that's kind of something
it's important okay so let's talk about
the reality is once you get the job
all right the realities of being
self-taught and going into the workforce
what's something you should expect
expect well if you are self-taught there
are some things right off the bat you
should expect first of all because you
don't have any like actual working
experience as far as they're concerned
they're gonna they're gonna test you and
I don't know if it's anymore or or or as
much as any other developer but you
definitely are going to be tested
because they need to value what your
skillset and verify okay
does this guy know how to you know make
tables does he know how to do this basic
algorithm does he know how to you know
make a request does he know how to do
some of these things because at the end
of the day that's what the job entails
there is going to be this sort of idea
that you have to like know everything
perfectly during your interviews that
you have to be like you know I want to
see Mark Zuckerberg but we'll just go
with that cuz that's a well known name
but you don't have to be like that guy
to go ahead and get the job actually I
bet the legend is kind of distracting so
I'm going to lower that I see myself
talking in a delay anyways but what I
wanted to yeah so during the interview
what's not gonna happen is you get these
questions right and like I said there's
gonna be some some simple questions and
regardless of whether or not you get the
job because don't feel bad if you don't
get the job I went to many interviews
that I did not get the job for and
that's that's totally totally fine but
what you will start to see is you will
see the same questions kind of being
repeated over and over and over now for
me I was doing web development so I
started seeing a lot of similar
questions about CSS and JavaScript over
and over and over right so for example
like the one of my first interviews I
was super excited because it was AT&amp;amp;T
and all this stuff and I didn't get it
obviously but the point is is at the
time looking back on it now I was like
ah I totally know this now
I remember one of the questions they
asked was well in regards to CSS can you
tell us the difference between you know
visibility:hidden and display:none and
my chops weren't quite right I wasn't
you know like and they they say like you
know hey don't don't worry if you don't
know well I did worry and I didn't
really know and but I afterwards I I
made a note of that and afterwards when
I got home I researched and figured it
out and found out like oh you know the
big difference is like whether it's just
gone entirely or it's it's hidden but
the space is still there that's like the
big thing and it's like that's stuck
with me and turns out it happened at
another another interview had this exact
same question or a common one for
JavaScript is the triple equals right
what's the difference between two equal
signs and three equal signs can you
explain the difference and so you'll
start to see a lot of similarities over
and over and over and so every interview
is really just a practice session and it
gets your chops up and really just make
note of them if you have a online test
some companies will give you an online
test or an online question there what I
did is I screen screen recorded or took
a snapshot of those questions that were
asked all of them even if I knew them
because at the end I would be told which
ones were right which ones were wrong
and how I scored but then I have a
record and it's you know how I kind of
learned more about you know I remember
like like immutable objects for
something that like I'm not quite sure
and then you know I got the answer wrong
and then basically afterwards I looked
it up and found out what's going on so
so take something away from all these
experiences it's there's nothing wrong
with like I said not getting the job and
every time you kind of like build your
armor you get a little better you get a
little stronger and you really start
doing much better and much more
confident each one of these things now
the real question is like well Chris
Chris I'm self-taught or there's other
people who have been you know Chris I'm
self-taught but there's other people who
have been to college right or there's
other people have been into boot camps
and I feel yeah cuz I had that exact
same sort of uncomfortableness like I
competed with people who have been
mentored by professionals in the field I
am competing which is true like you are
competing with people who have paid good
money for their education and and they
definitely have a skill set and they
know definitely should know their stuff
but if you're worried that you know
where you go to school or how you
learned makes a difference that the only
way I can get this job is if I go to
boot camp or is if I go to this school
or if I go to this location that's not
true most companies that all but most
companies don't care where you learned
what you learned and that's also a
reason for these tests because at the
end of the day what you're doing is it's
similar to the to the artist at the
artistic world in the artistic world you
are based solely off your portfolio they
don't care where you went to school they
don't care if Leonardo da Vinci was your
teacher at the end of the day all they
care about is how good is your work look
and and that's what you're being hired
off of that's what you're being that's
what you're competing off of and the
point of these tests is is to verify
that you have that skill set that you
know that skill set that's what their
that's what they're paying you money for
and your portfolio it doesn't have to be
rockin it doesn't have to be like the
best thing ever the point is your
portfolio is going to demonstrate your
skill set enough that you can get to the
interview really a lot of that thing
like the portfolio and and building all
these additional things on the side
projects they're all about getting into
that face to face interview because once
you're at that face to face interview
the reality is that you are one of the
top contenders they they have seen your
work and they they believe that you are
a serious enough candidate to warrant
the time of HR the lead developer of
whatever
and you know maybe the boss and another
guy right like there's gonna be multiple
people whose time is being pulled away
to discuss with you and talk with you
and challenge you to verify if you're
the best person I've been the best
candidate for the position and so if you
get the face-to-face interview it's a
good thing and you know you you once
again your portfolio just needs to get
you that far because once it's gotten
you that far your foots in the door
that's when you really prove yourself
and that's when you're really going to
discuss what it is about whatever
questions they throw at you and and and
do all that alright like I said they do
have the similar questions Chris I'm
sorry to totally rekt you I said I
wasn't going to but you great brought up
a great point that I wanted to address
before I forgot it because I have the
memory of a goldfish but you said that
if you're in the interview they already
want you I mean you're already one of
the top candidates so I think that's
especially important for people to keep
that confidence if you're going to that
interview they just want to confirm that
you're the right person for the job I
mean you're you're almost in the door at
that point am i right yeah I was one
percent correct like the reality is is
that I try to think of everything from a
business standpoint whether it's whether
it's salary benefits or where the case
is you're bringing a value to a company
and as long as you're providing them a
higher value than what you're asking for
they want you that that's what they they
want and if you are seriously being
considered it's because I'm sorry if
you're going to face to face interview
it's because you are being seriously
considered and they think you can bring
value to the company and they need that
verification and they certainly make
that file determination okay we've got
these candidates we've narrowed it down
to these candidates you've already
passed the fish'll filters you've proven
your ability to some extent and and now
it's like not just are you good are you
right for the company awesome so what
the other question too is like alright
man but okay let's let's get into like
there's all these things to learn right
you mentioned earlier that hey there's
there's a million in one places to learn
stuff there's there's all this stuff
that's going on all these languages for
works everything under the Sun so what
what do you actually need on the job so
like all practical knowledge versus this
idea of like all knowledge and there's a
couple things I need to immediately
address on the job the reality is a
portion of your job is to do research
and development you are going to do some
rnd time you do not know and there is no
way on earth you will know everything
coming in it is impossible there is just
too much stuff and it can be little
stuff too like it can be like you think
that oh well everybody knows how to you
know how to do I don't know before and
after CSS yet that might be true but
maybe they're not using it all the time
or whatever the case is right and
sometimes you need to do silly stuff
like okay what's what's that that
attribute that I can pull up what's the
property that I can and you just google
it it takes 10 seconds and you find the
answer and you use it you're constantly
going to be using Google they're
constantly to be using Stack Overflow
you're constantly going to be looking up
bugs because your codes not working this
doesn't matter if you're in mobile
development or web development or
whatever it's just it comes with the job
a portion of this job and the reason why
it's it's more abstract is because it
isn't straightforward it's it's not
straightforward when I give you a a
rendering from an artist and Photoshop
and say make this a website that that
that doesn't mean anything like you need
to know how to abstractly kind of put
pieces together and understand how this
would work functionally how it's going
to be responsive how are you going to
bring more life to it all those all
those things are really really important
and a portion of your job is going to be
googling researching around you're not
you're not wasting time and I think
that's an important thing to note is
that your job will understand that you
don't know everything and
any job if if they don't give you access
to the internet it's probably not
somewhere you want to work because
they're expecting you to know something
that's just just not possible but this
comes into an idea I have it's called a
difference between like programming and
syntax it's very very easy to learn to
learn a framework to learn a language
and to get started up and running like
all you need is basic documentation and
you can get up and running pretty quick
even if it's something brand-new to you
you can get started and the reality is
there's a difference between programming
and just knowing how to code the syntax
the syntax is really just you know what
is a for loop right what is a div what
is um you know an attribute what is a
property what is prototype right what
are those things that's just that's just
the coding part of stuff the programming
is I know all these tools in my toolbox
what's the smartest best way for me to
use this right because you can hammer a
nail with a wrench but it's it's not
really the best way of doing things and
that's where you can start being
creative and understanding okay this is
how stuff goes together this is maybe a
good approach and here's may be a way I
can future-proof this there's gonna be a
way that I can make this thinner faster
smaller whoo here's a way to make this
you know cleaner right and all that
comes with just just time but it's the
difference between just knowing you know
how to how to build something versus how
to build it correctly and the reality is
one of the awesome things about code is
there is you can build anything right
like you can there there is no
limitation as far as what your skill set
is on what you you can't build you may
not know the best way of doing it but if
you know the basics you can build
something
and as you get better that's kind of the
one of the important things is really
knowing how to program when the best
window best utilize certain practices
and all that stuff okay so all of that
out of the way well what's what's the
reality man like when I actually get the
job like I've got this that this crazy
vision that I'm just like you know just
bring it away on the keyboard all day
and then I see like Google where they're
just like you know sit in their chairs
and thinking like how what's the balance
what's what's going on what's what's the
actual reality of what I'm going to be
doing okay so I'm a web developer and
actually am I so at my previous job I
was a web developer and I got to do was
mostly front-end but I got through a
little bit of back and um at my new job
it's a much larger company and they have
a split into specialties and so my
specialty is front-end development so I
focused purely on front-end development
for the most part not to say that's not
important to know all the different
parts that are all going to be talking
to each other because you do work as a
team and talk with each other but my
focus at least for this for this company
is in front-end development so what is
what should I expect well the reality is
you're gonna be doing one of two things
you're going to eat either building
projects or you're working on tickets
and tickets sound really boring but I'll
explain so building projects building
projects are super straightforward for
me what happens is I get a Photoshop
piece from the excuse me designers and
it's been approved the clients talk to
them all this stuff and boom go ahead
and get started make make this a website
right and depending on the website and
from the two different jobs depending on
which Java is working yet the amount of
information on given is is different so
my first job was a much smaller company
and so I got to wear a lot more hats
with that the information I was given
was much less so it might be the layout
of the homepage and the basic feel for
like you know one column two column
layout and all the other pages with
content I would have to sort of like you
know get a vibe for and figure out what
would work best and I would ask the lead
developer and designer for their input
and you know what what's kind of been
approved and agreed upon smaller company
so it was a little bit faster to get
some of that stuff a bigger company it's
a little more straightforward like hey
here's here's the cut for for this this
layout here's a cut for this layout and
make it happen and still some
flexibility especially once you start
usually you get a mobile layout and you
get a desktop layout they say make make
it happen and the in-between which
you'll which you hate is the tablet size
the tablet size is like at your
discretion figure it out find that
balance because the tablets are just a
terrible weird size anyways so that's
that's if you're working on a project
you'll be getting your feedback from
your project manager or the the lead on
the project and it can be everything
from reviewing your code to be like hey
here's a more effective way of doing
this or hey yeah like what you did there
can you tell us about that why did you
do it this way here's a more effective
way whatever the case is so there's
there's some collaboration and peer
programming that you do and that's on
the project side of things and we think
about projects no I think projects
appreciate forward if I say like I think
it's been much what everybody imagines
they're doing all day the reality about
projects though once again depends on
the company there is this when you're
learning you're learning how to build a
lot of stuff from scratch like you're
giving you're given like a blank text
editor or IDE right and it's just empty
and you've got to build everything from
scratch or 100% the reality is when you
get into a product
that is not very cost-effective right
you were doing a lot of redundant code
over and over whenever every every
client has the same opening and closing
brackets for numerous pieces and soon
similar at some of their parts so what
you would end up having is sort of these
pre-built not templates but sort of
starting points right boylar templates
and it can be anything from a site that
you're actually duplicating over and
using that sort of as a base switching
out content manipulating the layout a
little bit and going from there or it
could be very much like a bare-bones
skeleton or their boiler template and
from there you're kind of building some
modules that insert it but these are
previous modules that you use before so
you've saved that code somewhere and you
can pull it from a repo and whatever the
case is so it just kind of depends on
what the situation is but don't don't
think that you're going to be building
everything from scratch that's just not
the case but you will build plenty of
things
brand-new particularly like modules it's
a common thing which kind of segues
directly into tickets so tickets I
thought that's that's basically just you
working usually on a live ticket live
ticket a live website this is a website
that has already been released out into
the open world it's running amongst the
internet animals and it's it's free to
roam around right everybody has access
to it so you'll get these live tickets
and big companies smoke company doesn't
matter what will happen is you will end
up getting a a wider range quite a range
a wide array of issues that could happen
right and the issues could be something
as simple as hey by the way the text on
this button should really say this okay
I'm not a big deal right or the issue
could be hey by the way the text on this
button that button shouldn't be there
in fact we change this whole layout so
it does this this and that and also like
I needed to make a duplicate copy and be
sent to this email address and when you
submit I want this crazy landing page to
appear and then redirect them in here
it's a wider range it's a wide range as
far as what it could be it could be a
quick you know five minute job or it
could be like you know a three-day job
it just really ranges the important part
is that you're working on your change is
going to be committed to a live site
when you're when you're done and versus
when you're in the project stage when
you're building a project you use you
are still kind of working with it before
it's been released to the public so if
you you know mess up nobody sees
anything not yet
so um but this side you once again oh we
got a topic sensitive to a question here
from Michael Kornblum when you're
talking about your template solutions
are these Michael Kornblum wants to know
are these solutions off-the-shelf like
bootstrap or are they developed in-house
good question it depends so there's so
let me tell you a little bit it kind of
pens so alright so I had two places to
pull from so the first company I worked
at like I said smaller company we worked
on WordPress websites as far as the
templates go is when we were building a
brand new project we were doing one of a
few things that at the time when I was
there either a we had built a theme
ourselves that we were continuously
updating and and tweaking to better
future projects and future iterations
and we would do like the code and on the
back end of that and make it work better
and that would sort of be like our
starting template right or we would have
a website that we had already completed
and finished and we kind of use that as
a starting template or we in some rare
cases were actually starting from
scratch in regards to using bootstrap or
like a theme that's already existing on
WordPress
it kind of pens so with bootstrap no
website that I've worked on with either
company works exclusively the entire
thing 100% in bootstrap however it is a
tool they use in their toolbox and a lot
of these these these frameworks and a
lot of these frameworks and libraries
they're just tools so you don't really
want to do like like the commit yourself
to like everything in its gonna be done
this way so in some cases we have
modules where the the way it's being set
up in the grid and just the expectations
it's just way faster and easier to set
the bootstrap classes and be like okay
cool this is this is a three and so
three and three done boom it's off it
just kind of depends on a lot of things
it could also depend on the budget of
the client depending on their budget we
can give more time and resources to them
and we can do some additional
flexibility things or if it's on a
faster time table because of a smaller
budget absolutely like we're using
bootstrap hardcore okay cool let's get
this set up its get this layout set cool
cool
great Mobile's done desktops done let's
move on the next page and it just really
depends on a number of things what I
would say is if you are going into
front-end development it is going to be
a necessity that you know bootstrap and
even even if you're the company you work
at doesn't use bootstrap they they will
use some sort of grid based system that
is similar to bootstrap and it made by
the way not even be like the newest
version of bootstrap so for example funk
the one company I was working at they
they had the styling setup from
bootstrap but there were certain things
that would end up getting in conflict
between the theme and bootstrap and our
own internal styling that was just
clashing so end up happening is we kind
of took pieces of the grid that we
and worked and and we would call those
but we would omit others bootstrap for
for example right now like you can build
everything with it like it's you can you
can change the display from it you can
display type from it you can change not
only the grid but the type of grid you
are using so it's a flex or it's a block
or whatever but at different sizes like
it's it's got a lot more stuff than
before and I I don't know how far
they've gone into it because at that
point other than my transition phase at
the company I work at now because there
are a lot of there's a lot of code going
on we want to really avoid conflicts so
in regards to bootstrap specifically
they love the grid system it's great and
everybody knows the classes they
understand the classes so what they've
done is they basically stripped out just
the classes for the grid system and use
it accordingly where they need it and
but they have emitted a lot of other
features in other classes that bootstrap
has to avoid any conflicts and also just
because they they don't they don't need
them or they didn't use them because of
the way our CMS works because we're not
using WordPress at the other company so
it just really depends but if you are in
front of development definitely
bootstraps important and the boiler
templates it's not so much that it's an
off-the-shelf we have done off-the-shelf
templates but in most cases you're still
not going to be like oh cool I got the
theme such I'll content I'm done because
for the company there there's usually an
association that what we don't want to
be that company that just takes stock
themes and switches out content there's
other companies that do that so usually
you might take that theme and create a
child theme and you know start changing
things up a little bit and then on top
of that you're changing some layouts and
and you have using it like as a starting
point you build out when you're done it
should resemble some of the styling from
the initial theme but
definitely doesn't look like you're like
the one you just you know bought off the
office shelf because you want to avoid
that that aesthetic awesome sorry like
the answer no that was a great answer
thanks Michael France on that question
anyways yeah which which actually does
bring up a good thing so in regards to
the general tools you should be
expecting right at this point uh you
know with Afghani you've mentioned
there's there's a ton of things going on
there is there's WordPress there's no J
yes there's just regular front-end
JavaScript there's there's all these
stuff and the question is is what what
should you expect and you you've learned
a certain way right like hey man I know
you know I know the I know lamp right
that's that's my stack that's how I
asked how I roll
let me tell you both places where I'm
working I did not know what on what they
were using the first company I worked at
they used predominately wordpress and
wordpress is built on PHP when I got the
job I did not know PHP and I did not
know WordPress
I knew WordPress to the extent that it
existed and I I made a blog entry for a
blog I don't update nearly enough so but
with that you know I got the job because
they could see that I was you know
willing to learn stuff and the reality
is is that on the job you're gonna learn
stuff
the company I work at right now they use
a CMS that I'm not familiar with at all
at the other company actually both
companies have some websites that are on
their own
custom CSS CMS so you can actually can't
find it anywhere you can't practice for
that and in some cases the documentation
may not be as simple to get to or it
might be some word-of-mouth of like hey
how does it do this thing
Oh Astley developer he built the thing
so it just kind of depends but you're
going to need to learn to adapt to the
workflow the software the
whether it's phpstorm
or its visual code or Visual Studio or
you know whatever the case is there's
going to be different tools you're using
and for example you might have learned
on adam or sublime text and you're like
that's my go-to man like i'm control
with it i know it inside and out and
that's that's great
but if everybody else of the company is
using visual code which the company i
work at it's visual code is the popular
beast it's it's better for you to get
used to adapting to things adapt to the
culture because when you have those peer
reviews when you have somebody's taking
a look at your stuff you kind of want to
all be on the same page like coding is
complicated enough it's legacy code or
dealing with somebody else's code who
you don't know figuring stuff out it's
already a task in itself don't make the
simplicity of knowing how to navigate
what they're working on more difficult
so that's kind of been my thing I know
some people are very passionate about
whatever IDE or text editor but or even
languages I try to distance myself from
that that passion like this is the only
way to do things this is the best way of
doing things because who really cares at
the end of the day you're working on it
as a team and you know be flexible adapt
and that's that's where this gonna be
important so whether it's it's go are
you not familiar with cope okay that's
fine
if the company uses gulp and they have
tasks set up you're gonna start learning
and that's that's fine that's good
that's what you want to have happen
you're not gonna know everything going
in the door and it's not expected that
you know everything going in the door
once again it's just impossible
the important thing is are you willing
to learn if they show you things are you
going to pretend like you know
everything like oh yeah
gulp I know that's that's a thing I've
made mini gulp tests before no it's fine
like it's okay and developing the
development of the actual workflow it
will also change from company to company
whether it's using bitbucket or it's
using github or it's using smart get
yeah or it's using a totally different
system where you just push directly to
internal server I mean everybody's
company workflow is different and it's
okay just prepare to adapt and I would
say that's one of the most important
thing is that you're willing to adapt to
workflows but I just work flows software
and the setup the way you have things
set up it might be different than the
way you do things at home and and that's
okay and I might get some some backlash
for that but for me I would just say
that's that's important in the team
environment let's see here different
CMS's obviously you like I know
WordPress inside and out great company
work out use a site Finity not mad at
all anything anything like WordPress not
at all so here code standards different
companies are different coding standards
a smaller company you your your clients
are smaller you know you might not be
thinking as much about screen readers
you may not be thinking as much about
how things look on you know even be like
iPhone 4 you know maybe it's a little
bit less of an importance to you bigger
companies you're thinking about those
things you're thinking about the fact
that hey you know not everybody has
access to 3G you really need to be
really selective with your requests you
really need to be selective with that
page size yeah it's not big for anybody
who has 3G but what if you're in the
middle of nowhere and what if you know
as things change we're getting more and
more mostly mobile try
so it does make a difference not
necessarily on size but even the number
of requests you're making so it's little
stuff like that
one of the coolest examples I can show
of that is set my new job during this
training period they've been trying to
like tweak the way I think about the web
and they've been try to take the way I
think about the web and so one of the
things is basically something simple
like the difference between loading and
image first is loading a background
image and take occupying the same amount
of space because the user doesn't notice
the difference but how does the request
change if you're lazy loading it in how
does that change the speed all those
kinds of things factored in one of the
most interesting things to me that I
didn't really think about was something
as simple as like the search icon okay
a search icon right and we have like my
old job use font awesome all the time so
we would you know okay cool well there's
like an icon for that is an icon for
this hamburger menu you know whatever
and the reality is you're making a
request to a library and you're making a
request for something and if you're only
using one piece of it you're still
requesting the whole the whole thing
well if it's something like a search
icon or if a hamburger menu why don't
you just do all that in straight CSS and
more so if you do it with like just one
div in CSS and use before and after and
utilize them and you can get some crazy
stuff once you start seeking in that
that idea approach I saw something where
somebody built a Facebook icon using
straight-up CSS before an actor and it's
it's it's crazy and what does that do
makes no requests and it loads faster
it's all these little things that you
start thinking about so yeah that's just
coding standards what will will differ
and that's kind of important and you can
stop me any point if I'm rambling no
definitely Chris you are
awesome gems I'm gonna hop on um let's
wrap it up in like ten more minutes and
oh boy alright every faster no no no
that's totally fine totally cool but um
I'll hop on like a few minutes before
and let you know if it's time to wrap up
or you finished wrapping up or whatever
but yeah yeah you're doing awesome thank
you so much we got in plus we have a lot
of great questions too so I'm super
excited for that so I'll let you do your
thing and I'll pop on in about 10 more
minutes okay all right all right cool
all right so I'll shrink a little faster
here so kind of mention that kind of
mentioned that kinda mentioned that okay
cool
real quick so that you should expect
once again Kobe's work a little
different there's different coding
practices one company uses sass another
company used less didn't know less
coming in you learn it on the job you
learn whatever their practices and how
they're utilizing the tools for example
les has certain abilities for nesting
just like sass does and the company I
worked at initially they did not use
less in that way they really only used
it for its variables and they they liked
the CSS to be styled a specific a
specific way so they could run through
it a certain way best practice or not
just be aware there are some habits you
might have to break depending on you
know who's in charge and who's kind of
leading the the thing there which brings
me to management okay guys the
difference I have here is between two
different companies and there's there's
a difference between being micromanaged
and not be just being totally free so in
regards to the micromanagement I think
that the cons are pretty obvious right
you feel a lot of pressure they're just
just always like oh man am i doing this
fast enough am i doing this smart you
know and it does weigh on you quayle
quite extensively and so that kind of
micromanagement can really kind of be on
backward productive there are some pros
being in the sense that you have
immediate access to answers you have
immediate access to the manager who's
basically going to be approving
everything right
I'm gonna get feedback that yet constant
communication back and forth and
communication is super super super
important in the field however there's
nothing like freedom when you are
trusted to to be like all right man
well here's the thing if you got any
questions let me know and just left to
do your own bidding for me at least I
found you you work far more effectively
you don't besides not feeling just extra
stress and pressure I think your
creativity starts triggering right you
start thinking more there's an
under-pressure
people tend to work better when they're
not under pressure and just be like oh
you know be a cool idea I can make this
thing kind of enemy because you know
it's not really doing anything and it's
over here
you kind of start this creative juices
flowing you're not as stressed about the
time and the thing is is that when
you're given that freedom it's because
the company really trusts the employee
and they basically like hey man you know
we know you know how to do the job if
you need us
you'll let us know and so my new job I
am given true freedom to very very much
a lot of our communication with my team
is via Skype
or a slack and really that's that's kind
of a different change for me being at a
bigger company versus a smaller company
but yeah man that freedom it's it's gold
depending on what your first job is you
may not have that luxury of choosing
exactly how you kind of land or what you
kind of land and you may not know until
you actually start the job regardless
though try and make the most of it and
you know once you start proving yourself
you'll see that you'll be given more
slack if you are being more micromanage
you will be given more slack over time
and that's just kind of something to
think about
meetings so you're you're in a job every
jobs a little bit different the meetings
can range you can have a daily morning
meeting
you could have a weekly morning meeting
or lunchtime meeting depends on where
you work or a biweekly meeting you know
and these meetings really aren't
anything crazy they have to put you on
the spot they're really just because you
you have a project manager who's going
to be in charge of managing not only you
but other projects that are being done
other tickets other developers and they
just want to just check in with you like
hey man what do you have going on today
what do you have going on this week
do you need any help what's what's going
on hey here's this new website that's
coming up what can we what challenges do
you guys see before we get started with
this what should I ask the client on
your behalf you being the developer you
aren't necessarily always going to have
direct access to the client all the time
and really you may not want to the job
with people above you is to really do a
lot of the nitty-gritty you know all the
figuring out you tell them like hey man
I need to know how does this react how
does this move what's happens when I
click this button this is this a:hover
thing like our last last project we did
this is that similar on this project you
don't want to be working on code without
having a clear full understanding of
what it is on earth you're doing or
building because the reality is is that
you can spend four or five hours on
something and turns out you did it wrong
and when that happens because it will
happen don't freak out about it people
are usually pretty cool about it and
just like ah yeah man wish wish you had
let me know it's ya know it's you just
need to do this you know you can also
very easily over over complicate things
so getting that communication back and
forth that clarity is going to be key if
you're not sure about something ask
about it there's nothing wrong with
asking questions nobody thinks you're
dumb or stupid and if you don't know how
to do something in code ask your peers
ask your fellow developers they don't
know you can you can ask the next step
up and if they don't know like I mean
you should be researching simultaneously
all this stuff so there's nothing wrong
with with not
and asking around and getting clarity on
on the topic I'm just a president guess
who's great oh cool hey Chris can I ask
you to touch upon mistakes you make in
the workforce and then I think we'll
wrap it up and ask some questions
cool alright so in regards to mistakes
are gonna make about those things I've
made so mistakes I've made so 1% I've
definitely made the mistake of pulling
down a a website or pushing to a repo
that was incorrect I thought I was on
one repo and I ended up pushing the
wrong code to a different site or
something like that and then you just
kind of like have that confusion and you
like oh wait no let's back this up let's
undo this you're going like I said that
make the mistake of you're given what
sounds like a simple task and maybe you
don't ask a question or maybe it's maybe
you misunderstand at the task and you
end up spending far more time on it and
you're supposed to and then you find out
that you were totally wrong that's going
to happen you're also going to make the
mistake of let's see here I mean the
most most comments taken go to make is
end up spending too much time on
something because you didn't really
understand it you didn't know it or it's
just more important most likely it just
wasn't communicated clearly to you or
you missed an are you misunderstood
that's but short of the mistakes so end
up making but like I said you know don't
be afraid to ask for clarification like
you emphasize it's there's no shame in
asking for hope yeah absolutely and the
thing is is for example I know there
have been for example other developers
who have accidentally brought down a
site that was life right and like that's
like a oh my gosh everything's on fire
because a website is down and it happens
we have redundancies that in place
because of you know hackers or malicious
code that just comes from wherever
so stuff like that happens sometimes
it'll be big sometimes it'll be small
sometimes it'll be something only you
know happened right you'll come to a
website a month later doing a totally
different ticket and realizing that the
changes you made totally break on mobile
and nobody's noticed yet and so you just
notice don't don't try and hide it don't
be like okay nobody's noticed that I
accidentally broke it and that was like
a month ago so it's probably fine not to
say anything
I'll wait does of it just go ahead and
notify them and say hey by the way like
while I was there I noticed this thing
wrong with the site or I noticed that
this was done and it was our bad and
just own up to it and most okay cool can
you go ahead and address it and you know
it might be something where it's like oh
can you address it yeah that's good take
a couple hours I mean what you got to do
so those kind of accents are gonna
happen and it's not that big of a deal
once again the company it's not just you
there are other people who are doing
these things all the time it's the same
kind of accidents the same kind of
errors the thing is you just may not
know about them but you know have lunch
discuss you'll you'll definitely find
out those people have done plenty worse
than you have and and they are still a
ok awesome
all right Chris I'm gonna jump on here
and I have a question for you this was
you just spent 53 minutes
dropping absolute jewels it was so
awesome I hope maybe we'll come back for
another one of these because it was just
so informational and coming from a guy I
mean you come across just a normal dude
who's you know working the programming
circuit and working your way through
life programming and it's awesome and I
really appreciate you coming on the show
and or the channel and doing this my one
question because we have so many great
questions here yeah well as you can see
my background here is highly cluttered
with like Star Wars paraphernalia and
stuff like that let me let me go over
here so people can see so this is like
one of my part-time jobs right like I
list stuff on the internet collectibles
and
Alania Stay Puft Marshmallow Man you can
see like a really horrifying person from
a horror movie over there but the
question is a lot of people are
transitioning from jobs that I have
nothing to do with web development right
like there's no end point what is your
advice or what can you say about that
transition do you have any tips for
making it easier or how can we
incorporate things we do outside of web
development into our learning routine
and into web development or is this just
this just almost a waste of time you
know what I mean yeah for sure
well um I can't speak for myself so one
thing that I could say is so in regards
to the Star Wars ghostbusters in the
background all that kind of stuff um
there's a lot of developers who are
really into that kind of stuff
right like you know I love comics and
superheroes and stuff and that segues
indirectly with with some of the other
developers I've met you know first
question I usually ask is like so what's
the dress code here because like can I
wear a graphic tee or is it like a full
button-down or like like how do I got to
do this and you know it seems like it's
casual or it depends of where you work
right but um as far as kind of a
different background so my background
has nothing to do with what development
I did character animation before this
and I I don't I mean the reason I got
into it was because the industry that I
had been in was starting to morph and
change and I was seeing things on the
horizon and I got into web development
and saw the creativity and the artistry
that that it could be um but I've also
seen people who are like yeah I used to
do accounting so now I'm doing no
development I mean that the real the
real thing is like if you're switching
careers which is totally fine and it's
actually pretty common right now I know
a few people who have switched careers
the thing is is that you're switching
into this career for a certain reason
and either a you hate where you're
coming from to begin with so you hate
accounting it was boring
so you like goat development it's fun
it's exciting or you're like well listen
I eat for example me I loved my job like
I loved my field that I was in but I was
thinking about the future thinking about
my family and thinking about just our
situation and stuff and I saw a web
development and I explored it and I'm
like you know I like this too
this is cool and eventually I like more
recently I'm now getting to the point
where I understand code I know how to
code I can figure things out I know how
to figure out a new tool that I'm given
that I can take things from my past from
my past knowledge of animation from my
past knowledge of of how overflow and
overlap and transitions all that stuff
works and start to pull and Nestle it
over into what I'm currently going to
start developing right and it just kinda
depends on what your background is if
it's more of an artistic field even if
you think it's not relevant you will
find a way to start incorporating that
into your code 100% so the Star Wars
trinket can have relevance in web
development yes it can go on your desk
[Laughter]
yeah I mean it just depends and once
again I mean no I don't know about I
don't know about that specifically but I
guess the thing the reason why I say
that is if you're into like you know
sci-fi and all that kind of stuff you
you like you're you're you're probably
creative and and I like tinkering with
things and ultimately what elements
gonna provide you opportunity you can
build you know if you're learning a new
skill by all means like find a way to
incorporate like little Star Wars like
lasers into you know a game you're
trying to design or you're trying to
learn I don't know like right now I
missing with like three j/s right and
that's like a a 3d javascript thing
all right well build a star warship with
it right you can still make those
passions translate over into this field
and it just kind of depends on what
those passions were if you're really
passionate about accounting I assure you
there is def
plenty of banks and crayons you name it
tons of companies who like you you know
accounting and you know programming come
work for us because those are algorithms
those are things that they they want to
mess with right if if you knew if you
used to sell right like force of Isis
sell windows for a period when I kind of
web development um and I was messing
with like mobile development actually I
was like you know when I was in sales
there was this thing that I wish that we
had had started making like a basic app
I know I can make this app and I could
sell it to companies I could totally
sell to companies so there's a need in
the market and I know that market I
understand that market and so whatever
that background is whether its sales
accounting you build light bulbs I don't
know there's a way to incorporate code
to make that transfer to a market and
and those niches exist you just gotta
know sort of where to look for them and
if they don't I mean you can build your
own that's a great answer
I am clanking my other keyboard here I'm
gonna come on the camera for just one
sec para doodly-doo is asking regarding
asserting what you're worth in
negotiations how do you recommend
projecting confidence and self-worth to
those you're selling your value to this
is a heavy question para doodly-doo how
do you set yourself apart from others
Chris for sure first of all pair
dilly-doo that's a great name
I love saying that okay so here's the
thing um if you're gonna throw out a
number right
forty thousand sixty thousand eighty
thousand a hundred thousand get used to
saying that number over and over and
over and over and over just just say it
over and over state with confidence in
the mirror and whatever the case is but
Chris that's a lot of money you says the
little voice in my head what is a lot of
money to you it might seem like a lot of
money to a company that makes
multi-million dollars you know a week
what's 100k that's drop in the bucket if
you make them four hundred thousand
dollars a year no it's it's again you
are bringing value to the company so if
you are asking
for a lot of money it's totally
justified provided you bring more value
to the company so if you ask for you
know a hundred thousand dollars a year
that's totally fine but you better feel
confident that the company when they
hire you they're going to be getting
more than a hundred thousand dollars out
of you and if that translates to you
know you need to tell them like well hey
you know here's my experience I know
your websites cost between this range
and your average website does this so
which means that your typical turnaround
is within you know two months so
theoretically my asking price you should
be able to pay off within four four
months but I know they were obviously
working on more than just one one
project so we have multiple projects
going on so in reality my ears salaries
honestly paid off in about a year a year
in about a month so I think I definitely
worth that much money you know and some
that comes in to figuring out the
specifics of the company they really
aren't gonna grill you that hard on it
honestly the reality is you need to be
confident in it if you believe it and
you should believe it don't don't try
and lie to yourself you're not gonna you
can't lie to yourself right if you don't
once again this way I brought up looking
at looking at your area right so if in
your area you know you're applying for
an entry-level and in your area an
entry-level is you know fifty thousand
dollars then you should be like well man
I'm not comfortable asking for that no
you should be comfortable asking for
that because in your area that is a
reasonable expectation do you have the
value of an entry-level I do okay then
so why should you feel that you need to
ask for less that's a good point great
point and then how you might have
touched on this but how do you set
yourself apart from others
Shapira doodly-doo is asking because I
know earlier in the talk you mentioned
that you don't have to be a ninja I mean
you don't have to be this superpower
coder like you can be normal you don't
have to be you know the top point zero
zero one percent but at the same time
how do you set yourself
apart from others okay so before before
doing web development like I said I did
character animation and for a while I
was working for myself and sometimes I
would I hire people on board here's
here's what I've noticed that has
translated over in the hiring process
and it seems to be pretty consistent um
couple things I you are going here's the
reality right when you send a cover
letter
here's what's happening scanning
scanning scanning scanning scanning oh
there's the keywords I was looking for
right in in uh in in web development
right I was looking for somebody who
knows you know a lamp stack all right
yada yada yada yada ya Oh lamp stack
okay cool
he's in the maybe pile that's that's how
it is I don't care about like Oh a mess
I'm a self driven really hardworking guy
and yet everybody is nobody cares right
we're looking for those strong keywords
then as far as sticking out you can you
can get creative with it for me
one thing I try to do is try and build a
brand association of some kind and
consistency so for me when I decided
that I was like gonna be doing this web
thing initially when you looked me up
online I would show up very quickly for
Chicago animation all right well that
that's that's a different thing now so
now I've kind of made it so that when I
send them information I'm like oh well
by the way like I I do YouTube videos I
talk about code here's my website that
has a similar name here's a link to my
portfolio and just having these
repetition things I am interested in
this blog I'm interested in these videos
just things that reiterate that you do
that you are involved in either the
community or you where you're learning
how you're learning you know if you say
it's there's interesting thing I heard
before it's don't tell them show them so
it's very much like don't say you're a
hard worker right everybody is show them
you're a hard worker so like on your
resume instead of saying like a hard
worker you could say like
you know part of team that did this many
hours worked on personal project built
this thing those are what they're
looking for you know active words like
built this dedicated this deployed this
responsible for this those are our
active words that we look for right then
as far as setting yourself apart for me
I I did a video resume and actually for
this job I'm currently yet they sent me
a test this actually good example so
this they sent me a test just a common
test like I said it's a mock-up make the
website happen and I was given the
inside of don't use bootstrap because a
lot of other people do so okay so I
hard-coded in everything and did this
this this thing and anyways I end up
getting the interview and they were
discussing it with me and they basically
what I did because I was like I was not
feeling one percent hot on it so what I
decided to do is I sent him a video
alongside it saying like hey you know
nice thank you for the opportunity yadda
yadda yadda here was my thinking process
as I built this here's why I did what I
did and this is what I was going for
here's the problems I faced and they
said during the interview one of the
reasons why I was there is because they
didn't have anybody else do that
and they really enjoyed it and they for
them it solved a lot of the initial
questions they were gonna ask me during
the interview because they're like well
we're gonna ask you how you did this but
you kind of answered this already sure
and at least for me in my head what I'm
thinking is okay cool now they know I
have a YouTube channel the probably
looking about the other other videos
which they did and but subliminally
what's happening is they're they know my
name they know my name they have like
100 candidates they don't member a ton
of names but they see their a petition
over and over and over and over and you
just kind of like get in there and it
just comes up in conversation and so
yeah if you can name drop anybody who's
at the company that that helps whether
you don't necessarily have to know them
but if through you know social
engineering you find out that so-and-so
has a blog at the company follow the
blog learn
about it and then during conversation
you can always bring up like oh yeah you
know yeah Bob's Bob's blog on you know
this the forth but that was really
interesting and I like what he talks
about with this and that and it's it's
that false association but you can start
to stick out because like Bob I know Bob
you you you know who Bob is and and
you'll see almost always when you
mention a name or they say do you know
anybody who works here or do you know of
anybody they usually write it down as
soon as you say something and when
everything write something down it's
like Oh brownie point so series your
image on that person's brain through
brownie points I mean yeah I mean stuff
like that
mmm-hmm great great answers great tips
let's move else we got Chinatown bus
asks do you have any thoughts on using a
free code camp for a beginner this is
always a hot topic free code camp is
always guaranteed to get some people
riled up on that Chris so for me all
right so when I was trying to teach
myself how to code I of course came
across free code camp because I was like
I need a boot camp that that seems like
the great thing to do right now and then
I was like I don't have any money for a
boot camp
free free code camp okay yeah that's
what I'm looking for and there's
actually another one if you're
interested called
the Odin project you can check that out
where they basically built a actual boot
camp with projects files and stuff and
but it was all Ruby based anyways the
point is as far as free code camps
specifically I personally didn't do very
much with free code camp for me what I
did is I actually got started on code
Kadim II I my first thing was JavaScript
on code Academy I was like alright let's
let's see if I even like this thing I
said messing with then I was like oh
that's cool send us with it some more
and then from there I was started
researching on YouTube cuz I'm like once
again free right so Coke added me was
free YouTube was free and then I started
seeing all these links and I started
you know reading stuff and I'm like
alright this this might be a thing and
at the time I was working at a job too I
was working at a job at a health
insurance call call center place but
whether the perks was there was a lot of
downtime in between calls you could read
a book so I'm like you know what a lot
of other developers taught themselves
reading back in like the 80s there's no
reason that with the internet like I
can't do with the book
so um winded up happening and they
didn't let me use the Internet that's
not the reason why so what I did is I
went to the library my local library and
I got this big thick book of JavaScript
and was basically a manual and I just
I'm like you know what screw it I'm
gonna read this just page one to the end
and I I did and what I would do is I
would read it and then I didn't know
where like a text editor existed I
didn't know any that stuff I brought up
like notepad and I brought the inspector
window and I was just typing everything
in the council cop and get it on notepad
emailing it to myself and then at home I
would copy and paste that into into
codecademy because then I could actually
like see what syntax is incorrect and
and all this stuff like this is what I
was doing but the point is is that um
you know you can just read and and make
that happen so that was yeah yeah I
serve the free code count to like I
think I feel like every self-taught
developer one time or another comes
across free code camp and it does have
its usages but for me as a beginner I
you think doesn't really teach you much
it tells you to find the answer and then
come back and do the projects yeah I
think the problem for me with free code
camp is like I would just feel stuck
like I didn't I didn't know and there
really wasn't like hints so I was just
like this this is great but I need I
need some instruction of some kind so
that's where the books and the YouTube
came in and eventually you know some
udemy stuff okay awesome Chinatown bus I
hope that answer your question
let's go on Michael Karim Lube asked
Chris have you ever run across a
situation where your code quality had to
be compromised due to deadlines yeah
tell us about it here's the thing the
Internet is held together by popsicle
sticks I don't know if you know this
where it is down the the reality is is
um the internet or just websites in
general you have deadlines you have
serious deadlines it is at the other day
you are working for a business and in
order to make profit you have to meet
deadlines and sometimes there's a budget
for a task or a project and it can very
much be that there's two ways of doing
things I've had much in this earlier
which is you know the fast way and just
get it done let's go and then there's
like mmm this is some good quality code
it's clean it's simple it's short but
sometimes it's it really is brute force
absolutely you definitely do compromise
sometimes you try not to and it is a
little bit of a balancing act because
the reality is is if you are too sloppy
and you are too inconsistent or yet to
Incans are too consistent about always
having you know bad code in there
because you're trying to meet deadlines
the irony is your deadlines for for
future changes also get longer because
majority of your time isn't actually
like you know on the keyboard typing
it's reading it's like following things
okay that's why and then you're changing
things you know we see the movies like
with like the hackers and they're just
going nuts but you know once you start
building the stuff you realize like oh
no it's it's not like that at all it's a
lot more like you know like that's
that's so much more of a realistic way
of when you actually start coding so
yeah you're gonna compromise sometimes
you try not to and your peers will kind
of give you that back and forth or they
sometimes say like dude who cares like
like we've got 10 minutes let's just do
this
let's go nobody cares about this it's a
very unimportant feature or very
unimportant thing it's not going to
affect anything else the turn and burn
crank it out let's go
push let's get it live kind of thing and
that's and that's why the internet
something about popsicle sticks because
there is large portions of code that are
just legacy in there that what you think
this is the reality
you always think I'll do that now and
later I'll come back to that and I'll
make it better I'm getting better later
later never comes
it just doesn't and that's true for
beginners to doing projects I know for
me just like on personal projects like
yeah this code sucks uh but it works I
guess I'll come back and change it never
do I mean you you get distracted life
goes on there's like other things and
you just never get back to it so reality
well and like when you're doing like
these personal projects to like you know
the code isn't pretty like a lot of my
personal code like just um but the
reality is is like you're doing this
stuff to learn so it doesn't matter that
looks pretty because what you've gained
from it is like hey I know how to do
this now
next time when I'm actually applying it
I'll do it better mm-hmm I don't need to
fix it on this one I don't need to prove
it to anybody else for this one but I've
acquired its it solved the the mission
of giving me this knowledge so right Oh
awesome answer again let's go to Gerald
gem serve pronounce that wrong 83 I
arrived if it alive what kind of
JavaScript for a junior okay let's see
what kind of JavaScript a junior
front-end devs normally it must be ready
to deal with so for example what are you
doing for loops with your JavaScript at
work like tell us in concrete examples
what you're working was okay
so uh those are the companies right so
if you're going in there's two things
you're gonna definitely want to know
yeah you're definitely gonna need to
know jQuery because regardless of
anything it makes just some processing
faster we just talked about deadlines so
you got to get the stuff done
jQuery is a way to get stuff done and to
make changes later faster so you
definitely need to know jQuery and
you're also going to just need to really
know how JavaScript works and when I say
that
let's back it up es five okay there's a
lot of syntax changes and es6 the
reality though is that majority of your
des is gonna be working with legacy code
code that's written by others our code
that's already been done and all that
code is not at es6 standards yet so
you're often going to want to understand
just the basics if you know you're for
loops and you know you can you know run
through an array it doesn't require
anything super-heavy and once again if
you don't know how to do something
you'll be able to look online there
there is this idea that you need to know
all these crazy like JavaScript crazy
algorithm patterns and all that depends
on where you work the reality is I've
never really had to use anything super
drastically complex that's in like I
don't know it's like like that like the
fizzbuzz situations really haven't
needed to use something like that
specifically but I definitely have had
to go through loops and if I had to have
certain things triggered based on like
click events so it it just kind of
depends if you're if your junior coming
in feel comfortable with JavaScript you
don't even know it
perfect 200% but you should be able to
understand the basic syntax and know
your jQuery be familiar with like the
very basics of nodejs because the
reality is is that you may not know jus
heavily but you probably will have some
basic things that'll be that'll be
required whether it's even like a sass
compiler or they're using gulp for
something like brow sync whatever the
case is so just just the very basics and
it you're not really gonna be challenged
too much on it you really are gonna be
the questions like I said you're gonna
have are going to be about what's your
basic conditionals and setting up some
basic jQuery right I think a lot of
times - like for beginners we want to
know it all like we talked about like oh
my god I have to know all these
algorithms but that's not really the
case at all no it's not and and once
even if you do need an algorithm the
reality is is you're gonna find you like
on Stack Overflow at some point
great Stack Overflow is your friend
let's go to the next question here
let's see you hey Chiquita Oz ago and
thanks for joining us and Rosario he's
asking a great question here great job
Chris thanks for the info in your
department or team have you noticed
diversity is forged as far as age is
concerned good question mmm-hmm
so the first company I worked at smaller
company there was a two-year difference
between so I'm almost 30 there's about a
two year difference between me and the
other guy and then there was about a
fourteen year difference between me and
another developer and there was a yeah
we were all within 20 years I would say
most of the team was about within that
that age range the new company I work at
um yeah it's it's a larger company I
would say the scale is very diverse as
far as ages go backgrounds go people
coming from all over different
backgrounds different ages
you know there's it just goes with the
company too it's a bigger company and
you gotta come from all over and so
you'll definitely find a diversity so if
you are worried that you know I'm too
young or I'm too old it they're not
gonna care it's it's really doesn't come
down to that once again it generally
comes down to you know your skillset and
there's a lot of horror stories coming
out specifically of Silicon Valley like
you know if you're over 25 forget it
like your career is over but that that
may be true in some places but I read a
recent like 90% of all development jobs
are outside Silicon Valley and the truth
is there aren't enough developers
talented developers as it is so the age
discrimination in issue definitely an
issue especially in the tech field but
you're an example Chris you said in your
company its larger there's all kinds of
Ages represented whereas with like a
small
Vesey or you know startup somewhere in
Silicon Valley maybe maybe not the case
like more bean bag culture bean bag and
foosball type thing yeah I mean
definitely so I I visited my friend
works down downtown and that culture is
very for the most part very young right
it's got that that like hipster vibe
right and that's that company but I also
know somebody else who works for Oracle
and it definitely isn't like necessarily
like only young people they're like
there's definitely people who have been
with the company for quite a number of
years and they're definite akin people
who you know aren't young because they
need people who you know once again have
the skillset and I don't know I think
depending on where you work there's
different attributes that can be are
that are given to you I think when
you're older there can be the
association that you're you're you're
wiser but when you're younger there's
also the perception that like oh we can
pay them less they're more naive so
there's this kind of it depends on where
you where you go honestly but like I
said especially in the burbs if you are
outside of the city the reality is in
the burbs there's much more struggling
to find people because you know were
they coming they're all going to the
city so in the burbs the you'll have a
lot more pull weight regardless of what
you are just because the reality is I
need a developer I don't care how you
got here
right well as says his he's 52 years old
and he's a newbie start coding
definitely and keep on coding there's
yeah there's a place for ED for sure I
mean yeah like we've been talking there
are so many opening so many jobs and if
you can do it a lot of companies don't
have the option of caring of how old you
are you know what I mean mmm one percent
and like I said once again if you can so
if you are like worried about your age
or anything you know there's a thing
right on the internet nobody knows if
you're a dog so um so nobody has to know
your age online and when you're going
through these filter systems you don't
have to broadcast your age
right if your point if you're trying to
give the perception once again its to
get to that face-to-face interview if
you're trying to get that perception
that maybe you're newer to code but you
don't have like 40 years of experience
of something else you know cut back just
bring out like the last couple a couple
of years of you know work that you think
is relevant you know like the last you
know 10 years and just pull what's
relevant and then say I'm learning code
now yadda yadda yadda and when you get
to that face-to-face interview you can
basically like I said at that point
you're contending and they're not really
going to discriminate you just because
of your age maybe like well you know
what like this guy he meets our
standards so awesome all right ed thanks
for the question and thanks for joining
us anybody else have any questions for
Chris tonight if not give it guys
another couple minutes or so but I think
we're gonna wrap it up here Chris is
there anything you'd like to add or
missed or want to throw out I think I
covered a lot of stuff guys if you do
have questions that you weren't able to
think of or just joining us hopefully
Chris will be nice enough to come back
and join us on the channel it was great
having you Chris and I really appreciate
you taking time out to share all this
knowledge just invaluable information
tonight and it looks like from the chat
room there are a lot of people who are
really digging what you had to say so
thanks for coming on thanks for having
me it's it's been awesome I've really
enjoyed this and it's it's yeah it's
been good awesome one more question if
people want to follow you are you a
social media guy or so so mainly
predominantly most the stuff I'm doing
is on YouTube so you can follow me my
youtube channel is code chris co de CHR
is and you guys can follow me on youtube
I try to post videos all the time from
motivational stuff to just similar
questions to what I've kind of talked
about today and I do have all the other
social media stuff which I don't post
too enough but if you want to follow
it's a usually code Chris M and the
reason for that is because Chris turns
out to be very common after I chose
cool and I'll put that in the in the
video box after we wrap this up here
okay all right all right Chris and
YouTube thanks for joining us and we'll
see you in the somewhere online Chris
yeah absolutely thanks for having me and
I'd love to come back it's it's been
awesome awesome right on all right we'll
see you guys later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
