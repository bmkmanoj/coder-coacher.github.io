to the above the question and yes
hey everybody about to go in real tough
candy forest and accomm back in the
saddle with you today how are you doing
today is a beautiful day in the
neighborhood I hope it's going good for
you want to give it through shut up
first and foremost to the real cast of
arrow who hosted a really cool live
session last night working on project
and answering some questions it was
awesome getting to interact with you I
was terrified otherwise as a guest like
typing things like oh my god affection
reading you say you've been talking
about me on camera also one of my
subscribers deserves a special shot up
this week because he's been absolutely
blown up the comic section some very
insightful and high-quality comments
Michael Kay you know who you are thank
you for your insights on a different
shelves and accessibility issues really
appreciate all your comments and all
your guys's comments I mean I have said
it before in another video but I have
one of the best comment boards on
YouTube and even if you guys just want
to say hi or give the video a thumbs up
that's cool to just let me know you were
here I love saying hi to you guys and
you know seeing that you guys stopped in
so it's all good I've been noticing a
lot of training materials online coding
boot camps syllabi even some YouTube
videos and just websites that teach web
development that HTML and CSS are kind
of just like okay here's two weeks go
learn of goodbye like they get rushed to
the side and that's really unfortunate
because if you have a nice looking
website your consumer is not going to
stay there you can have the best logic
the best database the best jquery
structure in the world but if people
aren't attracted to your web app or your
website they're not going to stick to it
that stickiness is lost and in HTML and
CSS that's where the stickiness is
coated so these two concepts because
they're not programming languages are
very critical if you want to create
something that people are going to use
now granted if you have a crap logic
system with your JavaScript and PHP you
have a broken website no one wants to
stay there either but if you have a
website that
like it's stuck in 1997 people are going
to think you're outdated and people get
ideas about that and it's just not
modern and it's just not something that
people want to stick around and use
number two you're probably wondering why
I'm on this angularjs page a lot of
these frameworks are based on the notion
of HTML being front and center as well
as CSS for example why angularjs so this
is JavaScript jus JavaScript one of the
webinar HTML again let me read the
official word from babes HTML is great
for declaring aesthetic documents but it
falters when you try to use it for
declaring dynamic views and web apps
angularjs lets you extend HTML
vocabulary for your application
guys angularjs is huge right now it will
continue to be I think that's just my
opinion
pay is great etc etc the point being
that this angularjs is huge it's in
demand and it's concept it's basic
reason for existence is extending HTML
vocabulary now it's a lot more difficult
than that because I tried taking an h2
arrow angularjs course on udemy
I got 33% through and I just like what
am I doing with this I did a video about
it check it out also a lot of other
frameworks incorporate HTML in some way
react just wanted to pull this up real
quick but really it just goes on and on
and again I see a lot of coding bootcamp
syllabi where it's just like okay you
don't even have to come to our campus
because we're going to give you these
two weeks go learn on your own and then
come back when you learn HTML and CSS
but I don't really think it's that
simple yeah there's not a lot of logical
program there is no programming going on
but again if you don't have the
essentials and basic standard HTML CSS
you're going to be creating things that
you either don't understand such as
using bootstrap or you're going to be
making things from scratch that look
like they're stuck in the 90s or worse
bootstrap is a beautiful front-end
framework I just discovered I'm so late
to the game but boot shop really has
some beautiful stuff but you know what
the problem with bootstrap is is that a
lot of these bootstrap websites they all
look the same they have
three info cons or font awesomes or
hieroglyphics whatever you want to call
them in the middle of the page there's
single page apps they have the footer
they all here we go oh here we go yep
here here they are the reason that all
look the same is because that designer
or that full stack developer or that
front-end whatever whatever you want to
call them you don't understand HTML and
CSS and with a ten-minute tweak or two
they can transform the look of this
bootstrap and keep all this awesome
functionality because let's admit it
coating a bootstrap theme from scratch
would dig I couldn't do it I couldn't do
it but knowing the basics of HTML and
CSS I'm able to look inside there and
admittedly with the help of sass and
less CSS preprocessors they also look
inside there and say whoo I want to
change this actually want to get rid of
this and put a video there instead
instead of just hitting my head against
a brick wall which let's admit I
normally do I have more confidence in
able being able to tweak that and making
it look less bootstrapping you see what
I'm saying using these tools to your
advantage when you know HTML and CSS and
for full spec developers it's not even a
question happy notes HTML and CSS you're
trying to do bootstrap and you say oh I
guess I'm not really good at CSS or HTML
come on dude you got to have at least
you got to have that foundation as far
as learning more about HTML or CSS or
maybe you are beginning a web developer
aspiring developer of some sort I always
go to this site w3schools calm now this
is good for all the cart items for
example look at all this stuff I don't
even know what a table where are the
tables here HTML basic HTML colors you
want to learn how to do a color they
have RGB values here that's probably not
a good example HTML classes all the
basic stuff depending upon HTML links
that's a pretty straight board one of
the basics basic basics they give you
examples you can try yourself
this is a great resource and very
thorough and for CSS they would do this
to me on the one day I'm doing this
video CSS - tricks calm is in in
it'll resource on CSS please don't visit
it today I don't know what the heck's
going on on this you know stuck in the
90s is this intentional like without a
JavaScript eh okay here we go
getting a little better but they talk
about stuff and CSS that's like up here
you can start up down here you can go up
here and talking about like animations
and minimax
what's the heck is that so the book I
used to our HTML and CSS the basics and
intermediate was called a smarter way to
learn HTML and CSS it is this book yes
it might look familiar because the
JavaScript book I'm always talking about
and help me learn JavaScript this was
like my little phone book here where I
can rip out a page willing scribble on
it and post it somewhere but a smarter
way to learn HTML and CSS by Mark Myers
Mark Myers understands beginning
learners that's why I love his books his
books are relatively inexpensive too
less than 20 dollars also he has online
exercises so you don't have to fool
yourself into thinking you know this
stuff you can challenge your brain I
want to mention one more thing about CSS
and I'm out of your CSS does things that
are up here and like all the other
competition is found here for example
animations CSS animations are lightning
fast the code is like four lines you can
get something going with keyframes
beautiful transitions fading oh my gosh
like in font phases beautiful fonts on
CSS it's also also great for wireframes
instead of this big bulky Photoshop
document you can crank out a wireframe
and CSS and make it look beautiful that
your clients are going to love
so again HTML and CSS I think sometimes
get some poo-pooed because it's not a
programming language they're not
programming languages but they are part
and parcel of web development and
anybody who says that HTML and CSS is
not as important as a programming
language PHP JavaScript even Ruby Java
in terms of web development it's a bunch
of baloney like I said if you have a
website that doesn't look good a web app
that isn't appealing to users no one's
going to stick around and then what good
is it so props and shoutouts to the web
developers front-end web developer or
full stack developers and web designers
watching this Isaak F I know you're out
there watching this
perhaps a lot of you other guys too at
the front end web development so I'm
here for you I feel you guys and
hopefully this video will open some eyes
to the importance of HTML and CSS guys I
hope you enjoyed this video hey I just
reviewed a coding board game on my
website real tough candy calm check it
out I got stuck on level 10 it was like
oh this game is broken spinner to go
back and fix this guy who is the quality
control it turns out I'm just an idiot
who'da thought anyways thanks for
watching guys we'll see you in the next
