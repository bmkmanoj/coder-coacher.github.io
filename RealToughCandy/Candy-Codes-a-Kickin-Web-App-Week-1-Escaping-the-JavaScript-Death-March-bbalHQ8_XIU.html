calm in the subtle with you today
welcome back to episode 2 in this series
of candy codes a kickin web app the past
couple of days I've been working on my
PHP and database skills just getting
totally immersed in coding a comment
section for this dev spotlight page from
scratch that was very important to me to
do it by hand as opposed to copying and
pasting because I really want to
understand what the heck it is I'm doing
if I am putting this in some kind of
portfolio I need to explain what the
heck this does what my decisions my
rationale behind choosing PHP and this
kind of code here this layout of this
comment section these colors these
buttons a hundred percent not worth
going to look like at the end this was
just for my purposes of learning how the
functions work in how to code PHP and
you know getting used to that syntax so
I've been following this dude on YouTube
I think he's from Denmark mmm toots and
he has a series on messages for comment
systems are actually creating a common
system based on PHP has a mom like the
fourth video of that so what I've been
learning following those videos is first
of all creating a comment like every
freshness cultures food creating a
comment no awesome create a comment and
then editing a comment so let's go back
what the heck what the heck there goes
so all of these functions the set can
set comments the get comments and then
the edit comments I'll pretty much have
the same structure they all go back to
the database where this stuff is
currently being held and you can
manipulate it from there so let's take a
look at that database right now I'm
using PHP my admin' which is an
interface for people like us to manage
our data
so can we refresh this and we'll see
what's in my comments I just need so I
just posted post this so we're going to
refresh this and down
I'm gonna refresh and it said close this
so this is cool little interface that
I'm using I really like my PHP myadmin
I like that you don't have to know the
sequel commands you can just hit edit
and go from there but I haven't taken up
some sequel commands from a crash course
courtesy of traversing media it has some
awesome videos over there so this is my
database this is my table my database is
called dev comments actual if we can
illustrate this now this file provides
information for connecting to the
database so this is the name of my this
is the localhost of my username password
and the name of the flat abate and if
that doesn't work it will say connection
got jacked up please try again so that's
how we know we are indeed connected to
the database here on this page because I
didn't get near a message so which I
gotta be honest guys coding PHP and
using my sequel this week is so much
more rewarding and abusing javascript
javascript is so abused and I just I'm
so happy to just get out of that bubble
for a little bit the other thing I like
to is that there's not this madness with
PHP there's not a framework for
everything you have laravel and that's
pretty much eat and I haven't been using
laravel I don't know anything about
laravel but I have been using PHP and I
gotta say guys if you're trying to take
a break but still want to code I highly
recommend checking out some PHP now as
you can see there are many functional
issues even with what I have done here
for one thing to edit it I have to go to
a different page that's not something I
want to do even after i style this to
the t's ID i do it right guys okay this
is like I said this is just a little
prototype this is a blueprint proving
that the functionality works proof of
concept I don't have a delete button
here yet haven't gotten that far or a
delete function for that matter but I
cannot keep this functionality because
how obsolete is it to hit an edit button
to go to a different page click Edit and
then no matter what kind of
authentication I put on here you still
have to go to a different page and then
go back and refresh that not going to
work
so there
many solutions for this Ajax subview has
a beautiful some dude over at medium has
a beautiful example of a view based
comment section it's absolutely gorgeous
but the most important thing for me this
week is to understand the functionality
look behind the curtain and see okay
where is it actually correspond this
edit button where is that in my actual
code oh here it is this PHP this block
with beautiful code nestled in my HTML
is responsible for what is going on when
I click that do that mom takeaways PHP
is a workhorse PHP doesn't get a lot of
love I don't know why but it needs to
it's reliable and I really enjoy it and
it's also important to just experiment
guys it doesn't matter what it looks
like right away now if you're like me a
lot of times you need to have an
environment that makes you feel good if
you don't feel good what you're looking
at and what you're coding is kind of
discouraging but for this I know what I
wanted to look like at the end so just
messing around with the functionality
with a big step in my growth as a
developer and getting familiar with some
of this backend technology nodejs can
wait I'm so glad to be out of the JS
bubble for just a little bit and working
on this but I'm probably going to be
going back to the JavaScript very soon
either to find that view solution which
was like I said just gorgeous or
something with Ajax and jQuery alright
guys my time is up I'm outta here don't
forget tomorrow Tuesday August 22nd of
mojo is going to be hot off the presses
you haven't signed up for that
newsletter been getting some great
feedback it's for aspiring up-and-coming
and beginning developers who want to
improve their life and improve their
careers will include the link in the
comment box thanks guys we'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
