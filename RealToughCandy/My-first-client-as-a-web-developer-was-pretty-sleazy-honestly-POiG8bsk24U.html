there's a little bit of vomit in your
mouth when you get out of a meeting with
a client probably not food poisoning
story time here on the real tough dandy
Channel last year first web client did a
phone call this person owned the small
business has a business partner and has
a product they've developed a
proprietary product they want to sell on
the Internet
awesome ecommerce is uh you know
something I do ever since I was a wee
last cell in the beanie babies online in
the 90s it's a different story so we're
on the faller
talk for about an hour all right get to
know about the product I take some notes
take some mental notes and we agree to
set up a meeting about a week later we
meet at a cafe this person called Jill
Jill brings Jack her business partner
now I didn't know jack was really in the
picture I mean I kind of did I didn't
know his role but by the end of this
meeting at the cafe it was glaringly
clear who did what in this small
business operation so Jack was kind of
the Mafia Don he took care of business
he set the rules and filled in where
there were a little logistical cracks by
the end of that meeting which was an
hour and 15 minutes I still had not
snagged their commitment to work on this
project so what they wanted with this
proprietary product again was to sell it
online in e-commerce platform a
customized e-commerce platform where
people could log on buy some product and
get out and they would get paid perfect
but they would also need excellent
photos video promos probably some
graphic design work so the whole package
I mean this was you know pretty this
could be pretty lucrative because it's
not just okay I'm going to log on to
wordpress.com find something cool not to
knock WordPress it's awesome it's really
awesome but you know was a little cut
above just the basic web work so we get
out of that meeting and that meeting
consisted of mostly Jack and Jill
talking about their product again
reiterating what I had heard on the
phone during the first
you know the introductory phase and I
took some notes and so did they and you
know I told them that I could do this
you know I had some great ideas I
basically told them I didn't tell them
how I could do it but I told them that I
could do it so then week goes by get
another phone call Jack calls me up hey
what's up Danny we want to meet with you
again come on down to our business here
and their business was an hour away from
where I lived and me being the sprightly
newcomer I said okay I'll be there ha
granted not granted granted granted this
is the wrong way of thinking this is not
granted now keep in mind I already
dedicated to ish hours to this potential
customer haven't gotten paid yet no talk
of any money no talk of any financial
thing they wanted me so for the third
time I would be meeting with them the
first time was a telecommute the second
time was in person at a cafe and now
this time I'm driving about an hour to
meet with these business owners at their
operation so I said no problem when do
you want me to be there not thinking in
the mindset right now I'm having is this
is my first client I can't mess this up
I have to make myself look good because
this is where I'm going to establish my
baseline you know I establish the
standard here and if I'm a jackass no
one's going to hire me so of course I
want to accommodate all these requests
for little to no compensation so we have
the meeting a third meeting there drive
there there for an hour again I
reiterate what I can do for them and we
go over somebody they knew had done a
website for them and look like crap so I
said okay these are the things I can
improve upon so I'm actually this is
kind of going into the consultation
field you know they have they have
something already and I'm saying okay
this is wrong this is wrong this is
wrong this is why this is how I can fix
it meet for an hour and we get out of
that meeting and I was feeling pretty
good I was feeling groovy I'm like okay
I think
this contracts in the bag drive home an
hour sleep well at night get a call week
later a real tough candidates Jack here
yeah we have the another stakeholder
here new to me new to me I thought it
was just Jack and Jill another
stakeholder telling me how I'm going to
be doing things okay okay okay one is a
good question
and we got this stakeholder here says
says II know somebody who can do
everything you detailed in your report
so they can do it for free and the
stakeholder wants to meet with you what
the fuck did you you say you have
somebody who can do everything I told
you I can do for a very good price
because again I want to impress them a
very good price right and you want to
meet with me to get my trade secrets
okey-dokey so at this point I'm in my
car my parked car extincted we pull on
the handbrake because I might just be
tempted to put the car and drive and
drive into a brick wall at this point
you want to do what so me being the
compliant helpful newbie web developer I
say you know I do put my foot down a
little bit and say I can meet with you
and I will meet with this person I don't
know I never met them I don't know who
they are but I'll meet with you but I
have to start charging a consultation
fee I've invested over how many hours
was it about five hours five or six
hours and I haven't seen a dime I didn't
say it like that of course I said it a
lot more docile but basically I need to
get paid and Jack's did not like that he
told me basically he didn't think that
was right because this has the potential
to be a very big project and then he
said he needed to think about it for a
few days I said okay and he hung up the
phone I got an email the next day saying
don't even worry about it
so as much as I'd like to place a
hundred and twenty five percent blame on
this client for wasting my time
this could have been prevented I want to
discuss the three things I could have
done to avoid the situation number one
after that first phone call during that
first phone call okay the first contact
I should have taken control of that
phone call and immediately introduce
myself and explain what I do the phone
call control was given to my client
because Jill of Jack and Jill was
talking about their proprietary product
for an hour and I could hardly get a
word in now there are ways I know there
are ways to cut that off and break
control back into my world but because I
was me like well if I take control I
might look like an asshole that's not
true when people have control it's their
game that's not how it is though when
you're running a business it can't be
like that so I would have introduced
myself and told this client what I could
have done how I'm going to get there and
at the end of the conversation after an
hour because I do offer a one-hour
consultation and a free estimate that
would have been our consultation after
that when I'm wrapping up the phone call
I would have said I will email you a
link to my website I would have also
emailed a policies link for them to read
over so there's there's no ambiguity you
know after that first hour I'm starting
to charge consultation fees because my
time is worth money it also would have
reiterated in that email what we talked
about
it opens would be a novel know a few
sentences so at that point they can
decide because I've set the tone and
they can get back to me and it's either
going to be a yes we want to proceed and
we're going to pay you for it or no we
think this is a bunch of baloney and
we'll find somebody else who can do it
for free okay number two during all of
these meetings whether I got obviously
didn't pay for them but even if I did
get paid for them I would have taken
control I would have used techniques to
bring back the conversation steer the
conversation and bring it back to a more
equitable equitable point because 80%
90% of the time the conversation was in
their Court
and when conversations are in someone
else's court it's a monologue and
monologues are wasting your time and
they're not helping you produce anything
and they're not helping you get paid and
when control is out of your own business
you don't have a business I'm not
running a non-profit and I'm not doing
this for fun I'm doing this to pay bills
and I didn't act like it
I you know I'm not a hard-ass I might
talk like hey if you don't pay me you
can go fuck yourself
like I'm not like that in real life I'm
I have to continuously tell myself to
not be a pushover because people will
take advantage of that people don't
understand how valuable your time is and
we don't communicate that in assertive
way they will take advantage of it
so at every meeting with them assuming
let's just say we get past that phase
one conversation where they maybe read
over my policies and I expressed that
you know after the hour gotta start
paying me I would continue to take the
conversation back they heart a deal with
customers your calls you want to deal
with them but just keep coming back and
steering it towards your goals what are
your goals for this project your the
conversation towards those goals and how
you're going to do it and how much it
cost and also progress as you're working
on the project that's number two that I
should have done taking back control
number three why didn't I listen to my
gut instinct when I was clenching my ass
I'm about to puke all over the cafe as I
was walking out not because of food
poisoning because I've got a bad feeling
I got a really bad feeling about this
client it was a bad match I'm not here
to crap on clients like if it wasn't for
them I wouldn't ever get paid but when
you get a bad feeling about somebody or
an organization or it's just something
doesn't seem right you don't have to
immediately make a decision sleep on it
and if it still feels like crap the next
day if it still feels like you drank a
fifth of Tanqueray mmm you might want to
back out of it after that first phone
conversation to be honest I didn't like
the way well I was an idiot I still kind
of em they were just
things that weren't adding up or we're
adding up in ways that kind of seemed a
little suspicious you know talking about
former graphic designers and web
developers these people had tried but
didn't work
for reasons I found strange various
signs various hints that maybe it's just
not a good match if a client is going to
steamroll you throughout the process
remember you might get steamrolled
during a two-hour or consultation or
whatever and you get out of that you're
like oh that sucked but time to work on
the project look they're going to waste
your time for two hours they're going to
waste your time for 20 hours 40 hours
100 hours during that project it's up to
you to decide if you want to take that
on so the three things I would have done
differently in this situation is number
one set definitions and explain Who I am
in that first meeting set the tone
number two when the conversation gets
out of my court or is not equitable it
gets in their court I would have gone
like this and taken it back using
various methods remember the goal here
is to focus on the project and how
you're going to get there who what when
where why and how
finally number three I would listen to
my gut not all clients are good matches
for you as a small business owner as a
micro business not for me personally
it's just me sometimes I get some help
you know here and there when I need help
with a special project but the core of
my small business is me so there's no
one you don't have a business partner
telling you hey dude this is really wack
you might want to bail you have to
review all these things so there's a
bigger responsibility on your ownself
listen to yourself you're not stupid if
you're unsure give it a day don't roll
the eight-ball
