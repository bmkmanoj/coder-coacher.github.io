tough can be back in the cell with you
today over at Final Cut Pro up in the
business of final cut pro I'm a little
peevish today I just upgraded to what
version is pneus 10.3 point2 on the
urging of Apple said okay I'll do it and
so I'm doing my saying go mobile tech
videos whatnot and I go to do my
thumbnail I always do a little title
like you see right here you know and I'm
going over here for my texts I'm like
okay first of all where's my text
where's my generators and with a hex my
music and my still photos like it's got
to be here somewhere show me the goods
so I like frantically clicking just like
hitting the button harder and harder
thinking that somehow something
different will pop up it's not over here
at all let me just give you a little
spoiler alert the text or the title and
a generator tab is up here now little
icon up here so you're simply going to
press that and boom here are your titles
and then beneath it your generators
press the arrows and you can get a
little more specific and even cooler if
you press this again a little graphic
right here this icon it expands so
that's helpful when I was searching for
my basic title there but why is it doing
that to me okay let's not do anything
advanced you're real tough candy don't
confuse yourself and then so those are
the title regenerators right here oh
that's what I was doing that now if I do
that all the title show up so directed
to its left is a little like iTunes
eighth note singing and a camera this is
where your iTunes and you're still
photos sound effects and GarageBand are
all being held hostage so it's again
click this icon again to expand whatever
can be found gosh man expanded itunes
extent i have a lot of music in itunes
that i use for my library that's all
there is like okay that's easy enough fo
well good blood pressure being lowered
now
the heck is my footage so I was like
open is a certain ugly half hour thing
mercifully it's right to the left here
so this little director clapper thingy
just click that and then you're back to
your library's everything is accounted
for and again press it again and you can
get a different angle on your footage
their projects hope this was helpful
guys selena is wondering if we manage
the cat by the way there she fell as i
initialize know what was going on
checking in she supplied to the internet
and hope this was helpful we'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
