engineering opportunity and I told them
in no uncertain terms to guff just
kidding we talk to each other zero for
an hour
real sick candy from real tough candy
calm back in the back morning with you
guys
exploring the wilderness not so
wilderness shout-out to my new
subscribers hello old subscribers and a
special thanks again to Chiquito who
bought me another bagel inspiring these
videos and propelling them forward
because I am now able to car bomb - my
heart's delight even more so thanks
taquito for sponsoring the show in that
way a lot of subscribers have asked how
that phone call went with Netflix
considering I just started a full-stack
9 to 5 web development job the other
week I mean it couldn't have been worse
timing but the engineering manager now
this is the person who is in charge of
this unit that is doing some crazy stuff
in terms of software engineering and web
development with Netflix and taking the
company in a direction that I think is
gonna just really change the way
consumers consume video the things this
woman was telling me about in her
department were mind-blowing but before
we get into the meat of that
conversation let me give you a little
context so I can share with you where
I'm coming from Netflix is based in the
San Francisco Bay Area it's in Los Gatos
which is south of San Jose which is
outside of San Francisco it's in the Bay
Area this little little horseshoe tech
area right I would rather work at the
steel yard here
before moving to Silicon Valley here is
why San Francisco sucks the Bay Area
sucks Silicon Valley sucks there are the
rudest people you will ever meet in your
life they're the hive mindset is very
disturbing and the cost of living is
impossible it's impossible to negotiate
you know there's a problem when a public
school teacher making $75,000 a year has
to have seven roommates or you work at
uber in downtown San Francisco and you
walk outside for some fresh air and
instead of getting that night
with the baby that's salty that salty
smell you know it just kind of gets up
in your nostrils you smell a big fresh
fat pile because there's a big homeless
population there because people can't
afford to live there so they live
outside and there's no toilets except
for the streets if that isn't a dystopia
I don't know what is but I still wanted
to talk because getting called by
Netflix for an engineering position is a
pretty big freakin deal and I was
curious I wanted to know how they do
things like is there a Netflix way how
did they code things how do they flush
things out how do they architect things
how do they communicate so the engineer
gives me a buzz I tell her about my
light she tells me about her life and
what she does and we are talking about
these features that this team is working
on really freaking cool stuff the team
is expanding the company is expanding
and they're adding all of these
different features I did have a concern
as she was telling me about all this
cool stuff I said you do realize that
what you're working on is facilitating
even more binge-watching from people
right
she said yeah we know we're just trying
to make it easier okay maybe I should
just lighten up here Binger is gonna
binge you know what I mean because and I
know it probably this video makes me
sound like a real square like real tough
candy lighten up it's just Netflix it's
just entertainment but it all comes down
to where you see yourself in this
industry and I don't see myself working
for a company that produces videos and
mindless entertainment and I do get that
there is a place for that I love
mindless entertainment at times but
there are just so many other
opportunities out there I almost got hit
by a branch to impact people in a more
positive way what I did love about our
conversation though was that it was
equal it wasn't just the senior engineer
talking about her life and her team but
me asking questions and her asking
questions about me and it was a very
natural conversation and we got on
really well and there were points in the
conversation we're getting really amped
up about tech and almost yelling on the
phone what you're talking about and she
shared a little bit about working in
Silicon Valley because like most people
in Silicon Valley they're not native
Californians and just the lifestyle and
different cultural things going on with
that all in all it was a prestigious
phone call and I learned a lot but I
will never work for Netflix and my
ultimate goal is to not work for anyone
except myself because the only way you
can ever be 100% successful in my
opinion is by having your own company
one thing I will say despite my personal
reservations of working for them they're
doing some really cool stuff Netflix and
chill people who are watching this get
ready because in a few months maybe next
year there's gonna be some real freaking
sweet stuff going on with that company I
will give them that seven days a week
they're doing some really exciting stuff
if you enjoyed this video smash that
like button leave a comment one of my
favorite parts about doing these videos
actually by far is reading your guys's
comments much appreciated and everyone
else thanks for watching and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
