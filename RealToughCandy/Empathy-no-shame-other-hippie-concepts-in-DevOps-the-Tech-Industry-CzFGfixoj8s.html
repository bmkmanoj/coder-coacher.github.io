or I care more five I care mom
apparently it's a cultural thing in dev
up looks like here more
I can't reward eighteen I care more real
club candy from real Canada back in the
saddle with you today how you guys do on
today you're talking about empathy in
DevOps as many of you know I spent the
last couple of days like getting
educated about the world of DevOps at
DevOps day of 2017 850 attendees it was
wild
the food was great the speakers were
great the swag was impeccable and a lot
of opportunities to network and just
learn things but for those of you who
aren't familiar with DevOps it is
largely consisting of six admin to the
90s who have been around the block and
seen a lot of things go wrong and
they're interested in making IT
departments more efficient whether your
web developer a manager CEO whoever
everyone working together to ship
product and make money a lot of people
who were speaking of that era you know
Generation Xers who started their IT
journey when the friends was still on or
just getting started and they emphasize
that DevOps is not only trying to make
things more efficient and better for
people but it's more of a culture thing
unfortunately I can't recommend any good
book or any good definitive resource
because still kind of working out the
kinks and working out the movement
working out the nuances of this movement
even people who are speaking at the
conference one guy mentioned a book but
he didn't really endorse it he just said
yeah this exists if you don't know how
to do things another thing that a lot of
speakers were harping on was the
importance of empathy in the workplace
in the IT room in the software
development room wherever whether on a
startup or enterprise level embassy is
kind of at the core kind of but actually
as a core of dev ah and so being a
newbie of being a web developer there
weren't a lot of web developers there
especially new being you know just
absorbing everything and hearing this
Kemba stealin oh goody so I get so what
you're saying is I get to go into the
workplace and tell my male co-workers
you know what kind of bad hair day I'm
having and they can empathize get a job
like committee that works in San
Francisco and other special smells like
hub but in most places that's not
happening so just like okay reduce blood
pressure reduce blood pressure chill out
drink a kombucha whatever I need to do
is I'm listening and this person this
speaker is talking about empathy as a
method for efficiency emphasis what
exactly do they mean by empathy
basically what they meant by empathy
wasn't by going to work listening to
people about you know their dogs
meningitis or whatever issue of the day
they have at home that's important but
that's not what they were getting at so
what they were getting at in this kind
of embassy was emphasizing other people
outside of your immediate sphere so if
you're a web developer you understand
web developers whether they are doing
JavaScript CSS so whatever framework
view whatever Betty Boop framework have
to have decoding phase you're using you
get them you understand where they're
coming from even if you don't understand
that framework that technology you can
kind of empathize with their plight or
their struggle when they're trying to
figure out a problem can you emphasize
with middle management can you emphasize
with sysadmin as a web developer you
know I can't because I've never worked
with a team of segments I've never
worked with a middle management team I
worked for them but I've never worked
with them what they were getting at is
empathizing with understanding these
people's jobs how hard their jobs that
can be and how we can better work with
these other people in these different
categories I believe the term used is
silo ization we're not perfect if I'm
wrong DevOps people or anybody who's
familiar with this term but for my
understanding stylization is just
putting these people in different clumps
and then having a little tiny
communication so empathy is interested
in getting rid of these silos of thought
these silos of production throwing
things over the set taking these
barriers out so there could be better
communication that our teamwork and more
efficiency and at the end of the day
better product and more money whether
for you or for the boss either way if
you're making money you're probably
going to be keeping your job I just
found this article over at medium it's a
few years old but I still kind of
embodies what they were talking about
this DevOps conference 22:17 about
empathy and how even says right here
defin obsolete to empathize with each
other and with design teams others they
design teams marketing teams because
they're cooperating agents within a
larger software as a service system and
they also need to empathize with the
users so I'm kind of digging this now
now that I understand where this empathy
element is coming from because if you
can't empathize with your users guys you
all have like terrible customer service
experiences when I have a bad customer
service experience like a really bad one
I just won't go back
I might spread a letter to the manager
but usually there's so many other
options out there I'll just say screw it
you know I want to go to a place where
people understand me where I can give
them an order for an out of state of the
nut latte and get the right drink now if
you screw it up once fine the other
thing that they emphasized at these
talks of DevOps spaces that it's okay to
screw up once but it's not okay to screw
up twice when you're making the same
mistake you cannot make the famous big
twice the other kind of hippyish is
saying concept they mentioned which is
ostensibly hippyish and Kylie in the
food lab with a hole at half ostensibly
it looks like that is having a work
culture where it's okay and encouraged
to admit mistakes a shame free culture
is what they called it and what that
means is that guys we're all going to
make mistakes in coding okay how many
times have you hit the backspace button
like a thousand times working on a
coding project I backspace probably a
25% of the time when I'm coding it's
okay to make mistakes and to talk about
them openly in a work
environment it's not a common thing like
we feel afraid we feel ashamed because
like people are going to make fun of us
but you know what in the end that's
going to reduce the bottom line for the
company perhaps for your personal
paycheck and it's going to make things
more in fiction because someone's going
to have to go back and discover that
mistake and fix it or a user god forbid
and user notifies the company and is
like yo dude this thing's broken
or I can't get this input form to work
what the heck when a shame free
workplace is created we can talk about
issues that we're having in text we can
talk about things maybe were not quite
as strong as other people we can improve
teamwork that way we can improve
relationships or co-workers increase
efficiency because we're to send it out
hey dude I have no idea how to code and
immediately invoked function expression
imagine that one a lot for some reason
it really bothers me that concept or you
know closures are just way above me can
you help me out you know some of that
stuff admitting that stuff can be really
frank because the default for a lot of
people is like well why are you working
here you should know what an AC is you
should know how to use a closure you've
been working here how long taking that
burning shame away or diminishing it as
much as possible it's going to improve a
lot of things in the workplace empathy
creating a shame free workplace these
types of hippie concepts they actually
have my carry value and they have
technical value which to me was a relief
because going to tech conferences
watching videos reading books where it's
just like everybody is going to hold
hands and sing Kumbaya we can all learn
JavaScript even the CEO who is never
here we can all learn together like just
just save the Yogananda stuff do it I
can do that on my own time and to see
empathy in the workplace removing shame
in the workplace these are all things
that can be used strategically that's
why I got out of DevOps today's 2017 I
want to go to work do awesome of things
live in the moment
no a lot of you guys are interested in
that too I'm going to link to this
article take what you can it just
expresses more about what I was saying
at the Embassy things guys thanks for
watching hope this video was helpful and
now time for announcement as you may or
may not know I'm releasing an album for
text types called electric Pomodoro it's
coming out August 13th that's the summit
