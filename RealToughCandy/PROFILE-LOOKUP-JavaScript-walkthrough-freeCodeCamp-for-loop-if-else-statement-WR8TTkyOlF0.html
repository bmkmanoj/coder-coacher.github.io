the saddle today we are over again at
three code camp doing that basic
JavaScript profile lookup this is the
most frustrating the most intense the
most hair-pulling li OMG problem in the
entire basic JavaScript section of this
curriculum over at free code camp that's
just my opinion
I have even posted a video I'm going to
be taking down because I screwed it up
so badly and I said you know what screw
it works and all we're just going to
publish the video but it's a fresh start
today so I'm going to redo the video and
the other thing too I noticed that on
YouTube there are a few videos that
already do kind of do a walk-through of
this problem but I'm going to show you
my perspective and how I work through it
maybe give you an additional you know
set or perspective on how to do this so
let's read through there's so much to
read through this is a thoroughly
overwhelming problem there's a lot of
code fortunately this variable contact
is pretty contained and it's pretty
segmented so you know you see that these
OD working with an array of objects
representing different people in our
contacts list for example Acura Lane and
a little phone number or ID number for
like Harry Potter's or caroling is that
guy don't know Harry Potter Sherlock
Holmes number and legs and then
Christian boses number and links so
these are these array this is an array
of objects and now they mentioned a
lookup profile function that takes first
name and a property is as arguments has
been pre-written for you it's right here
okay they're setting us up mildly for
success here because they set up that
function and then they say the function
should check if first name is an actual
contacts first name and the given
property known as prop right here is a
property of that contact if both are
true then return then return the value
of that property if first name does not
correspond to any contacts and return at
no such contact
if prop is not correspond to any valid
properties and return no such property
holy crap were to restart okay
so just doing it with a preliminary
glance at these instructions because let
me admit to you I didn't really absorb
all of what they are talking about when
I first read it just right now I'm kind
of getting an idea but I'm not truly
absorbing what should be going where
what's going on but one thing I did
notice is that there are a lot of it so
as we know from our previous problems if
there isn't like if in the instructions
or explanation not like but if there are
tips that usually means it's going to be
some if-else action going on around here
in the coding segment also where was it
working me the hint that it probably
should be looping okay basically that it
needs to go through this section all of
these segments and pick out first name
and prop and to see if it actually
exists so as you see here in the lookup
profile they put in a kira and i believe
it's called the parameter as the per
hour Akira
or is it yeah I don't know what it's
called someone let me know so they found
Acura and that's true okay but in order
for both we need both okay so like pizza
of coding brownie points so then we're
going to run it will it even print no it
won't okay
let's coat it first of course it will
opinionated code it does that's why
we're here today okay
how about a little less talking a little
more coding you guys know I like a lot
of room so we need to set something up
so that whatever we're coding can go
through here and see if it exists so we
need this we needed code something so
that these two thing can can file
through the ring and be like oh there's
a match so that's probably going to be a
loop statement so
you know something tells me we're going
to have to use a for-loop so let's set
up our and as you know from previous
lessons there's three components to a
for-loop the first is initialization so
I'm going to use oops my define variable
eyes I just like using eye for numbers
and this is how they've been teaching us
using eye or for initialization using
eye rather so we're going to initialize
I was zero and then we're going to say
as long as I is less than variable
content the length of contacts that is
our accession and then we're going to
throw in a final expression the I plus
plus which increments okay so we've
already got our for loop and I'm feeling
pretty good let's just put some curly
brace action up there get that out of
the way clean it up in a bit okay so
this loop is theoretically going to take
care of us as far as looping through so
long as this condition is met and then
we are going to go on to the next thing
right about here the function should
check if a first name is an actual
contacts first name
okay so there's actually two if we're
going to have to code here because as
you see we want to check a first name is
an actual contact first name and they
didn't put it here but there should be a
little if right there is the given
property prop is a property of that
content okay so for the first if
statement we're going to say if and
we're going to say actual con tags which
is oh what do you know how convenient
variable contacts so in this little
parentheses here we're going to say
contacts and then we're going to put in
that's going to be a bracket we're going
to put in our variable i40 and then we
are going to do dot notation for first
and as you see in here there's an is as
you remember probably a from grade
school or maybe junior high or even high
school math is in a sentence when you're
doing an algebraic word problem is means
equal but not equal not just one equal
sign in JavaScript actual equal equal is
not one in JavaScript but three without
conversion so if context bracket a dot
first name actually equals is actually
equals first name so we have that actual
Cantus is the javascript equivalent of
this right here okay so we have that if
statement but now we have this so let's
code that we put in another bracket
clean it up in a bit
a little messy with that I do admit I
just like a lot of room and I'm a novice
I'm still learning on proper proper
technique for that so we're going to do
another if it and if which I said should
be like right here the giving property
use a property of that contact of that
contact okay so again using the context
clues so we're going to go back to our
contacts we're going to set up the look
of it just like we did with the one
above we're going to go to contacts I
and if you remember from a previous
lesson I don't remember which lesson it
was but it wasn't a basic JavaScript
there is this little thing where you can
see if something exists if property
exists using has own property and if it
has its own property so we're going to
use dot notation on with camel case over
Talon cases first first letter of the
word is lowercase and the corresponding
letter corresponding first letters of
the words are capitalized that's a long
way of saying has has a lowercase H in
Oh own is upper and P of property is
also upper if context bracket has on
property and then instead of the equal
sign we're going to be doing
simply prop in parentheses okay then
we're going to add our bracket and now
you're going to do our return statements
because if both of these are true if
this is true and this is true we're
going to return the value of that
property what is the translation of that
in Java well let me show you return we
return the contacts and then we're going
to do in bracket I and then in bracket
prop bracket notation and then we're
going to finish that off not with a
curly brace just fine but with a
semicolon and now it gets interesting
because now we're going to have our L
statements we're going to do a bracket
right here and we're going to do a
bracket right here then this is where I
get confused I just have too many curly
braces oops I meant curly braces can I
just read something
okay well deal with cleaning up these
curly braces in just one moment probably
bad practice
I apologize for that but this is the way
I'm doing it for now because in the
newbie else okay else it's going to
return what are we returning okay if
property does not correspond to any
valid properties return no such property
else return owns much profit aid okay
perfect and then we're going to go down
here we're going to escape out of these
all these curly braces which it looks
like I probably have one too many
we're going to do oops we're gonna do a
return and we're going to return no such
contact if first name does not
correspond any contacts then return null
with such contact okay what is that
is there too many of these there is a
possibility okay
there were too many so let's tighten it
up and see what we are working with
first of all let's see if it passes up
passes us because if it did we are good
to go
nope it certainly did not it passed -
okay so what are we doing wrong so Bob
and numbers return no such contact
accurate address should return no such
properties but Sherlock and likes
Christian lastname and hearing lunch
returned things so what are we doing
let's see is this
please okay let's let's start at the top
let's just systematically go through for
variable I equals zero eyes listen
context of length I plus plus that looks
legit if context I dot first name equals
first name its context Ida has a
property property return contact I
cropped else return no such property we
need to want to hear how about when down
here I don't think that's true either
no okay where are we going wrong guys do
I need return contacts I property else
returns which properties no such
contacts
mmm okay I made it this far and I don't
know what I'm different let's count our
bracket our curly braces rather and see
if we have anything going on here so
this line matches this one this one
okay Oh
boom okay I didn't kick the returned no
such calm contact out of the curly brace
here so let's just clean this up again
this is these are ugly curly braces and
they should I'm pretty sure they should
look a certain way still working on that
but we got a pass here so this is the
correct code and I do want to add like
you can put you don't have to use I for
this variable you can use X let me just
well we don't have to go through it you
can experiment let's put in a name like
let's put in Sherlock and like and
ideally this will spit out Sherlock's
likes which are intriguing chases
environment boom okay and then why not
let's try Cristian Cristian Cristian
like JavaScript gaming and foxes
what a babe perfect okay so this code
ran this is a correct code hope this
video helps you guys sorry for the
hiccups then I will check out what's
those other guys on YouTube and gals I
believe a female also posted a video to
females at five males and one
african-american and three Asian people
like it's not important to me so I'm
gonna check out what those guys and gals
have been working on and their
methodology for solving this hope this
video was helpful if you liked it stay
tuned because there's more coming more
than just free code cam 2 I'm going to
be exploring different coin boot camps
the application process and all kinds of
foibles
oh and hey one more thing I wanted to
add check out my new blog it's over at
real tough candy calm I'm blogging about
everything about tech coding babes and
nerds and I think you might enjoy it
lots of gifs gifts for the hip
and yeah we'll see you later okay enough
blabbering I'm out of here
