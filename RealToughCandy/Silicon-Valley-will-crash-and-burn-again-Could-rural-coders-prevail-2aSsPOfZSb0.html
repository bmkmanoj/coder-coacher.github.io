battle in bringing the total American
Famicom back in the saddle in the back
40 with you today how are you guys doing
on a special country bumpkin edition on
Google Jeff Danny Channel
now I'm not saying that in a derogatory
way I myself and from a rural area spent
a lot of time in very big cities
moderate cities and rural I mean like no
stoplight no stop signs I know there's a
lot of diversity in where people live
who watch this channel so I want to hear
your guys thoughts on this topic always
want to hear guys's thoughts but
especially on this one because I think
there's a lot to talk about that's not
really getting address there's always
this focus this micro hyper focus on
like five tech cities all in the United
States I kind of want to discuss the
possibility of vacuuming Zac this talent
to place in these rural areas if you
want to go I had an opportunity to buy
in a turn-of-the-century if possible or
about as much money as was in my pocket
I mean it was it was a ridiculously
cheap amount of money the building that
he can clean up a beautiful brickwork it
was like I don't know I think with 8,000
square feet a few floors its last usage
was as an old folks home and they're
going basic for some years probably in
about 40 to 50 thousand dollars in
renovations to be up to snuff for what I
wanted to do with it but basically I
could have the building for free the
bones were very solid it's a beautiful
building but the reason it could be
cheap is because it was in a rural area
an area that's dying cuz I got me just
thinking I'm like you know I really want
to try and do this the property taxes
are like $2,000 a year these hipsters
can convince people to buy $30 crap
radishes in Williamsburg Brooklyn this
marketing has gotten so out of control
these these these movement of Gotham
ridiculous that you know it's not that
outlandish to envision a new kind of
tech city that's in a rural area that
are there of a micro level if you have
five hundred to a thousand people in a
town and a quarter of them work in tech
you know a couple a key core of a
hundred people working on a tech project
the problem with that is I see it as two
things number one rural internet speed
getting the highest speed internet to a
lot of these rural areas is a work in
progress you know it takes a long time a
lot of places do have them but if you're
looking for you know the Google fiber
optics networks on the Cheyenne River
Reservation it's not happening probably
not anytime soon so I think we do have
to be picky if this idea is going to
take off on you know where these pockets
of tech challenge and up because there's
no internet there's no faster internet
it's not happening the number two issue
is convincing tech talent to relocate to
places that don't have marketing team
every large city it has a very powerful
Chamber of Commerce and other
organizations that print very attractive
newsletters and websites and talking
heads who say very good things about our
city whereas if you go to Dougherty
Oklahoma there's not an identity there
so convincing developers convincing
people with tech talent to go to these
places it's going to be a really big
challenge and I think in order to have
this idea take off of people coming into
rural areas in coding and doing things
and continuing to support the digital
infrastructure there has to be some sort
of marketing pain whether it has to be a
core group of people who just don't give
a crap and and make it attractive by
word-of-mouth because a marketing team
isn't going to lure anybody to flyover
country it has to be something bigger
than that and you know for a lot of
people moving to a rural area it's a
non-negotiable
there is a Wild West element to this new
tech paradigm but people like their
high-speed Internet
people like their Chinese takeout and
people like going to their clubs Gorge
bars you got to make your own fun in a
lot of these rural areas so those two
thing is the broadband issue and just
you know suctioning these tech people
engines into a rural area that I was
looking at said I don't think this is
going to work better for me to do
shelter in place and talk to people who
do love the rural area there's a
lifestyle change guys knocking a lot and
I totally understand people who are
hesitant to make that change because
there is no Chinese takeout a lot of
places on the other hand your blood
pressure if you have a high blood
pressure and you're interested I highly
recommend checking out on maybe not
rural areas but smaller cities I rent a
really cool article about moving to the
Pacific Ocean on a boat totally kidding
it was this Fast Company article that
was recently published they published
the next top ten cities for tech jobs
now these lists I take with a big grain
of salt usually a brick of salt but some
of these cities think some of these are
obviously Provo Utah not a huge city
Fort Collins Colorado
Colorado is a beautiful state or Collins
is also beautiful any place in Colorado
is beautiful Indianapolis Boise Boise is
like what less than a quarter million
people the entire the entire city not
just the core Manchester New Hampshire a
lot of Eugene Oregon Eugene heed not
rule I mean these places are cities
they're not way out in the back for you
but they're not Los Angeles they're not
Boston we're not New York City
so it's articles like these that are
pointing at smaller cities that tell me
you know the trend of what's not camping
is the Pacific Ocean the trend of basing
your company in San Francisco in Silicon
Valley I think it's bubble in the bubble
the tech bubble the startup bubble is
definitely going to pop again a lot of
these companies are startups there are
massive amounts of money being pumped
into these companies guys uber isn't
even returning a profit and billions of
dollars are invested into it and are
like companies are going to burst and
they're going to go through the cycle
again like we did in 2000 hey don't call
me Baba Vanga
maybe I'm totally full of hot air here
but there are a lot of other people who
are also
saying there is like this mushrooming
effect right now and all it takes is a
little pin poke to make this stuff
crumble if you're in a smaller area and
you're doing things to service a local
populace small businesses individuals
who are just starting out on a micro
business venture so on and so forth
where you're supporting actual people
who are giving you actual money not not
payday loans not big money there's just
so much to talk about this topic but I
think there are a lot of pros about
going to these smaller cities in rural
areas because people can see the value
of your service it's not just blindly
betting on the next startup there aren't
billion dollar startup in Tulsa there
are a billion dollar startup in Rockford
Illinois
if this shift from San Francisco to Fort
Collins Colorado permanent I hope so
because people in San Francisco are
miserable and also it's called the
Internet people can live wherever they
want it just takes the right management
team I know very glib of me to SiC
remote teams are becoming more and more
popular there is less and less of a
compelling reason to live in any given
tech city so a lot to think about I want
to hear what you guys think do you think
the actual world coding movement to ever
take off or actually even be a movement
or will just be pockets of weirdos and
practice the fan individuals we're
living in a clunker and somehow have
internet service who are dialing into a
larger tech company in Austin personally
I would love to see smaller digital
pocket that service at these state you
know small tech pockets in a static
Kazakhstan is that possible shouldn't
that be an ideal are we better off
sticking to the tech hub with the
Internet and the way it works I see that
hub a concept as being more and more
outmoded as a business life we'd love to
hear your thoughts on this meanwhile I
am catching a one-way flight to Pavel
adore comments then I'll see you in the
next day
