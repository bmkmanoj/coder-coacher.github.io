think I've interviewed 20 different
companies that set this point time every
interview brief it was a very first
phone phone screen interview they asked
about salary requirements and this is
question is something on lines of either
glass what we make now what you expect
may what your range they're gonna add
something along those lines it just
depends on for your faculties and allow
their project from within every single
instance I actually can single one where
I didn't expressions on the first
first-run cream they're going to the
reason why they're acting what I think
realize that I want to profit if they're
trying to gain if you're either under
under shooting what they're looking for
for your over shooting was there was
four so they're really looking for kind
of a range if you fall within a range
and then they think that position will
be as it's fifty years the problem is
they don't know you don't know them so
they don't know what you don't know what
your skill set is all they have is a
piece of paper that says here's you know
your background right so there's the
resume it's one of the worst things
that's really determined someone fit for
position especially within our industry
so it's very hard for they the resume
might think their interest it might get
you that first call but really they're
gonna use their their skills as an
interviewer right off the bat so suss
out who are you what is your expectation
what's why would you want to sock a few
I would want to suck yourself so far the
negotiations start from the beginning so
that's something to keep in mind your
negotiations begin from the first time
we've ever interact with them
it begins really anything defense them
anything you're showing them so you you
want to put off that I'm very valuable
you should believe that so it shouldn't
just be that you're making up but you
should know you're very valuable and
that you should have some idea of what
that value is in the industry so I would
say the first thing difference in
negotiations you have to know what the
value is for that position and that's
going to vary company or something so
some something's on you
proper developing for the mother and so
if you want to work for I'm trying to
think about sponsorship
I'm going to go as out as not that I've
ever interviewed with them tours offer
solution but just an example something
like that staple so tables I feel like
at this one time right sever they're not
there growth has shrunk as well so right
some staples will exist they're still a
function company but soon super on
substantially they probably have if I
have a need for shopping laws pretty
much every company does but in that
particular field because they're kind of
a smaller they kind of strong they're
they're calorie range for a software
developer is going to be much much
smaller than a Google or a Pinterest for
ASD or even like a large things like a
chase right so they're they're you have
to know that and basically look like
your resources physics I think it's
absorb sighs okay sir
if you google like software developer
salary and foot in my snow wherever
you're at it'll give you like a
breakdown based on something there's a
couple really cool working resource that
I think I can send you to kind of houses
show notes like essentially know what is
that they value and why what they're
willing to pay and in that kind of your
start so then when you get on the phone
and they ask you the question for one I
they never answer the question what do
you make now that's a silly question i
would just say i would say well i would
just redirect i feel like well actually
here's what I'm looking for and give
them a range or a number if you're going
to give them an a number just so like
whatever number you had a 20% to it if
you're going to give them a rings just
give that and whatever number you saw
whatever number you know figure 20%
bigger essentially that's the first step
in negotiation because every position
that I was attended a few offers from
they basically took the lowest number I
gave them and that's what they first
offered so just keep in mind that
whatever number you give them in that
conversation that's the numbers are
going to say when they go to make you
the first offer and that's just that's
just shrewdness on their part right
because they know bam all the
information like what you don't have so
they know how much you save flat ten
people environment were she ated for
further known okay I'm going to give him
the least amount that he won't be upset
in kind of feel offended fraeno life it
starts
beginning know if that says something to
keep in mind okay sir I think I'll for
me - I forget like these organizations
are charity organizations like there
ought to watch their backs - it's not
going to give you some fantasy numbers
they're gonna cannot accommodate your
lowest standard so so what you're saying
is you - from talking to friends kind of
it because again I was went to the
season I would assume a lot to get a lot
of feedback there is certain
organizations where they don't they
don't negotiate which it's really that
there's a rarity though there's that I
think most people as it's understanding
that like oh I'm afraid to try to
negotiate because what if I don't gets
like what if they turn me down but in
all honesty 90% of 99% of any company
for any position they're in you stand
people negotiating there is that unique
percentage there's a couple companies
that I've heard of that are kind of
that's and gets the top engineering
companies where they actually just say
instead of doing what I just said where
they give you the lowest of your reign
they basically just give you a highest
that they're willing to say you and then
that's what your offers and so on but
you wouldn't know that like if you were
in that scenario again you did your
research you would have seen like
constantly in the feedback on slack or
the perfectly solicitous like hey these
they don't really negotiate here's what
they're gonna offer here's a salary and
it might even say it and I've heard of
some putting it right in like the actual
JavaScript if fish shop a sack from out
and like it that that's just see that's
the exception so that's something to
keep in mind but that is the exception
to the rule that's not the rule so to
emphasize mulish positions in this
industry they want you are expected to
negotiate these numbers are far
negotiable
I think that's a lot of you know they
don't necessarily like to negotiate a
negotiation is normative okay so they
want you to not negotiate so I read an
article during this kind of period I
wanna say a couple months ago it was
saying that there's a dream for
recruiters this is what they trained for
the dream for recruiters is for them the
same number so they say 75 stops was it
the first offer housing 75,000 one think
of that third dream is for you to go
could you do 80 that's rightfully the
dream of a recruiter is because that
position like if they're offering you 75
Moses
the top was like 100 use angels if
you're saying if you a housekeeper maybe
they're like doing happy dances I just
save the company and budget like 30
grand you're saying she's like that's
that's really what they're seeing that
you're not seeing is that they're going
you asked for 5,000 more when you had
40,000 for Claire right so I think
however most people with negotiating
don't understand they're just they're
setting kind of like I don't wanna be
greedy I don't want to offend people but
we have to bigger it's all psychology is
all it goes back to like certainly
nature of people and interpersonal
interaction if this person if this
person wants you and I tell people this
all the time and I've read a bunch
articles about this which totally make
sense once you think about it by the
time you get to an offer like we're any
company you can hear if you're going to
offer from a company you minimally been
interviewed three times over the course
of generally seeing it's almost a month
of time we're talking you weren't the
only person a costume so there was at
least five or six other people that they
talked to that they sin and make an
offer to so think of all the hours they
spent it gets to you into one piece so I
feel like the more you think about how
much money has a sense at me sources
offer me this job then I feel like the
more confidence that you should grow in
like hey wait a second I'm valuable not
only am i value books but like I'm they
want me more than other people and I
feel like that's really something hard
for people to wrap their heads around
it's like they want me and I've thought
again it's not because you're like again
you're you're suckers and figured like
so amazing it's more that reveries in
your particular you know interpersonal
skills your technical skills your
background whatever right there's a
whole bunch of things to look at you met
the bar that they want it and they don't
desire nobody hires people that minimum
who needs a bar they hire people that
exceed what they want so I feel like we
keep that in mind
that's what you're negotiating from that
you're not negotiate your weakness
you're negotiating from they want you
select if they want you like what do
they want to pay for that desire do you
think and then the psychology goes in
Reverse let's again think of anything
you've ever wanted
like once you decided you wanted it
like you are willing for like I do some
things to get it is like you willing to
make some sacrifices so and that's where
you have to determine like what it's
like for me one of my ago she airing
things was like so some people that make
seem really silly or like ridiculous but
for me is a big deal like the last
company had worked for Wi-Fi works
remotely and I had like a siphon so like
equipment but it didn't cover some of
the equipment I just assumed was
expected and so for me but that last
time I worked for I did they didn't give
me like a second for a really nice
office chair so I had an office chair
but he was replace it and I wanted like
a real nice one like a really really
expensive one and I just assumed that
it's something towards that maybe not a
slight favor whole thing but they
actually didn't end up using me anything
for it and so it was one of those like
kind of in the background online like I
felt like I was less valuable because
they weren't willing to give me
something that in my mind like five in
an office right I would just assume I
get a debt I'd have a chair I'd have
monitors right always think this
computer only things that you take for
granted set as a remote first and
they're not standard let me beg right
they're all negotiable they're all in
different companies are different write
books predominantly if you get a remote
position there's a lot of things that
you just don't really process fast for
negotiate for kind of including your
package and so I one of the things I was
negotiating with one of the some things
always follows in the process was hey
will you give me the chair I want and I
realize that that might not be something
that agreement do i but for me it
mattered that it is important so and
again a good chair and that's for
anybody else to who has a home office a
really nice chair like the one that most
of those high-level engineer come please
we're talking like almost two grand for
for one of your stairs so I mean this
isn't a small act if you you know what
you're asking for
so I think it's really just you have to
know what it is that you want what it is
that you can negotiate with and get
create and because I said in my instance
asking for something that's kind of
outside the norm might actually make you
seem really interesting because they're
like you care about something that most
people didn't even putting this on into
and so again it creates like sometimes
if you may not have some flexibility I
know a lot of companies they go flex on
like a time off or they might not
opportunity we have kiddos or some
like that but maybe you can ask for more
salary or maybe it's not for a signing
bonus or like you got to get creative or
in some instances for like in you know
startup you might be last for actually
or no stock options new thing to that so
you just gotta get really creative like
think of it holistically I don't think
it's just a salary number think of the
entire package it is a succeed health
benefits today pay for the health is
trips like a lot of big engineering come
we know straight up just savory elves
and currently for old families won't you
pay zero so I mean a lot of the things
you have to see in mind like fatzke
seems you know 10 grand a year nuts you
know keep that number in your head or
going okay so that way when I'm
concerning as offered okay the one
company is not colluding health
insurance so that really just drop even
if they're offering you one hundred and
ten thousand for your salary they offer
no health benefit that's basically like
taking off 20 grand from your salary so
you got to really keep those things in
mind when you're kind of processing out
association and get creative and just be
aware of it really knowledge is power
when it comes to the share thing
actually isn't silly if you're sending
me nothing for eight twelve hours a day
I mean you want it my Cadillac like it
share it like anything that's it I was
just one of those random silly me
personally but I'm particularly about so
those kind of things so I would use that
as part of my eight if not you won't
give me the chair once can I get it and
would you give me a siphon three on
whatever those creative strategies are
just be there actually be very overt
handed with negotiation so like have a
list of priorities and then kind of this
works backwards so if they're like we
sent to that or what about this or you
know always have something else you can
ask of them since then believe it or not
at the end of this kind of full process
if they don't think if they said yes to
these things they don't see you as
greedy they don't see you as like
somehow like you got one over them it's
the opposite something actions the more
you can go she ate effectively and do it
graciously incredibly you actually see
much more about cursing like this way if
I had to plan to buy something and I was
willing to pay twenty thousand more
force than I initially planned for do I
feel like did I feel like I was just
going to excel like wow I must have got
something really
label because I was able to get it very
great I got what I wanted so I think
that's the part where it's actually
opposite the people who negotiate the
artists people see them again this is a
colony Singh has more valuable because
look at what they were able to do that
most people could not sue few things
that most people didn't have the ability
to kind of get creative and kind of jump
out of their comfort zone and kind of
ask for something that that they could
get and I think that's something was
when it comes to negotiating again it
and I don't think is a software
developer think this is applies to any
job any type of situation was with
values to your position and the worth of
that position there's always there's
always a bility to leadership and
everything in life it's just a matter of
knowing again knowledge of how much
we're going to keep if the company like
I said I think of the example staples
again going back earth it's this is a
dead okay the most we could say someone
is 80 you might going to be able to
negotiate for 90 maybe 100 but if you
strip if you should up one in they are
they offer you're in you're like no I
want 150 that is not because I think
you're greedy they're just going to go I
don't think it's going to work because I
don't think you understand listen we
don't have the ability to say you want
this and it's not like because therefore
is more that even no matter your
creative negotiation skills they will
just say you probably should take the
job that would pay 150 to use a break so
we'll have that and their capabilities
to sue and I think that's different than
before or they think you're unvalued I
face really knowledge knowing their
range is 80 to 100 if you try to ask for
50 more than that
it's just not going to go well not
because you're bad negotiator just
because that's not going to work
