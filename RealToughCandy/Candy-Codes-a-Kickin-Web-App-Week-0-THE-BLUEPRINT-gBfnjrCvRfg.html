compaq in the saddle with you guys today
how are you guys doing
has she actually finally uploaded
herself to the Internet I wish I'm going
to be off-camera for this series because
we're going to take a full-screen look
at the building of a web app I'm working
on for the dev spotlight
before we get into that quickly I want
to thank everybody who showed up for the
live stream and was jamming out to my
album I just released a couple days ago
electric Pomodoro now available on
Bandcamp thank you guys for the support
I appreciate the music lovers out there
and people who just like to jam out
while they're doing whatever they do so
thank you guys so much I wanted to start
this series because there's not a lot of
material out there that actually starts
from Ground Zero and explains the
methodology and the thinking behind
building a website or a web app the why
exception I can think of as Michael
Thomas he has an upload for quite a
while Michael Thomas are you ok where
are you he had some good videos on that
his videos are awesome and he does more
of a retrospective you know what things
he could have done differently for
clients on why he made decisions but
this series is going to be a little bit
different because I'm going to be doing
videos as I build and plans that I have
and sharing some successes and sharing
things that didn't work so great now the
biggest difference here is that I'm
doing this all for me so a lot of things
you would normally do when developing a
website I'm not doing you know I'm not
writing down required because I already
know what my basic information
architecture is going to be like how I
want it to function so as we look at the
code I'm coding also remember this is an
under-construction
page and all of these are under
construction so yes it is a disgusting
mess of code please do not close social
services or the Humane Society I do love
my cats I do not live in squalor
but this is this is also an experiment
that I'm doing on your because like I
said a lot of the requirements I don't
have to write down and I have the
freedom as someone who is working on a
website for me to you know take the time
to just messed around look at all this
this is disgusting
this is how I formulate ideas and play
with ideas and we all you know annotate
something here and come back to it I
have a lot of stuff here that's not even
implemented I just put it on here as as
a note code notes I'm going to give an
example I have some jQuery on here I
just snip it I save for later there are
somewhere in here I'll find the corner
so this episode is week zero throwing
crap on a wall and speed what I'm
totally experimenting right now and let
me show you why many of you know that I
do as a dev spotlight series for example
highlighting all the cool things that
you guys are doing on your journey and
it is one page and that was intentional
but now that I have a lot of developers
it's getting pretty obnoxious to try and
find the actual person you're looking
for
there aren't any unique URLs for each
person featured and it just goes on and
on and on it's one of those things I
know I've been on those websites where
you scroll and throw my does this thing
ever end you know I find myself on
websites like these like going to the
end just to see what I'm in for
instead of going naturally from top to
bottom so this is the old dev spotlight
series and once it I wanted to make it
more interesting and to be honest guys
you all remember in grade school we had
to give those silly grades for reports
my name is candy my reports on the state
of Idaho in 1872 there is a great battle
on the mountain then at 1902 at games
independents like this is information
and I want to give you guys dynamic
justice I want to make it really
interesting I have a subscriber named
Raven who gave me a incredibly creative
idea of doing season so the first season
features the original deaths all you
guys are freaking awesome you may notice
there is an actual extra death here Casa
Darrow many of you may recognize them
musical s1 and season one and we're
going to lose a lot of season two and
there is a scene behind each
this season's title is joy and CRT
monitors and if you guys inverter oh you
old schoolers have ever dropped a CRT
monitor you know the significance behind
this glitching title bar right here but
the single page application is important
to me because like I said clicking on
things and going to different pages I
just don't like that model and if you
just keep going into the weeds as you
navigate in a lot of these web apps so I
really like the idea of Moto's and as
you can see this is one single page
however Who am I going to pick for my
victim look like a cigar oh so as you
can see you hover over turns to life and
oh there's a modal with Cassidy Rose
story and these are all modeled after
this cafeteria template here as you can
see all of these we will go through all
on but let's go to Mirza see seems basic
saying hover over a picture down here oh
it's a guess of Kermit the Frog link to
github so on and so forth now this is
cool I really like this idea as a
consumer and as a coder this is fun to
code all these modal's the biggest issue
that I'm facing that it was facing I've
since found a solution to it is that
every time you click on one of these
modal's the URL doesn't change and that
was a big it's a mandatory thing for
this web app that I'm building because I
want people to be able to take this
profile and actually link it to the
actual person also to respond to totally
responsive here the search box is
fricking off and watch it doesn't what I
haven't hooked it up to any logic it but
it's just for looks you guys can see
populism one of the things I want to do
also is add a comment section down here
there is a way to add a comment section
in modal's but those are my other two
things that I'm going to work on this
week as I get out of the throwing the
crap on the wall and three lipsticks a
lot of the stuff is sticking a lot of
the stuff is probably going to go I mean
some of the spots probably is I like the
monochromatic look to this
for season 1 season 2 might be
completely different you know vs the
color palette or neons or something on
the question you're going to change that
was the other thing too is that all
these questions are the same so there's
a theme as you can see the photo appears
the left photo appear to the right check
them out and that consistency for each
season is also important these are my
wire this is my blueprint right now this
is normally not how you would do things
this is an alternative way of doing
things because I have the freedom to do
it however I want so this week throwing
stuff on a wall seeing what sticks
and also identifying issues as they pop
up and documenting them so I can go back
and say okay how can I fix it for
example this single page I am digging
but there are some costs to it that I
have to work around for example all the
information in these modal's is located
in my index.html file that's not a good
thing this is a little too heavy for my
preference and once we get dozens of
Deb's on here
you can't navigate through that I mean
even if you just want to add like a link
or something
we take forever to find it and it's just
not good design so I'm trying to explore
also this week about solutions for that
using web components for some other
solutions where it's more
compartmentalized and modularized now if
I was doing static websites that is
websites no database this would be much
easier because I could make purchase
Michael Carmelo tell me if that's
correct or not the correct word as far
as compartmentalizing you know these
guys and their information so here is
Jim's profile so ideally I would like to
have all of this stuff starting up there
and ending right here been doing great
here in a different file and then just I
like one line of code right here that
import that file and displays it as a
modal and keeps this keeps the integrity
of this information
in this way oh alright guys hope you
enjoyed this next week's episode I'm
going to be having some more stuff up
like I said looking for solutions this
week and just architecting and seeing
what I like and seeing how to solve
problems that I create alright guys take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
