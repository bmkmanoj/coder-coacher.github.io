you
cold steel this isn't cold steel real
safe candy from real Jeff can you come
back online with you today cold Steel's
first web developer boot camp is an
absolute classic and a must an absolute
must for anybody wanting to get into web
development he's so personable he
explains things so nicely his pacing is
on point he's funny he's a little corny
with his joke so reminding you not to
take it so seriously all the time and
it's a fun time it was a it's a fun fun
course a couple months ago he came out
with his second course the advanced web
developer boot camp I'll let him take it
away
welcome so this course is quite a bit
different from other courses in its
scope its complexity and its structure
so I want to first talk about how it
came to be and what makes it special
I'll keep it brief though first I'll
keep it even briefer Colt steal only
participates in like 30 percent maybe 40
but that's pushing it of this course he
has other instructors fill in in a lot
of other components throughout this
course the thing is that people buy Colt
Steel's courses because it's cold steel
they're not buying it just for the
information because let's face it how
many more es6 and you know d3 and that
work and the dom tutorials do we need
the world doesn't need any more of those
the world needs more instructors who can
explain these concepts
sadly the people he has tasked to do
these lectures just don't have this
stage presence for example section 25
introduction to react let's go ahead and
just let's jump right into the front-end
framework introduction and see the name
of the file will be bundle chance so we
make a get request for that bundle yes
these server returns that bundle js2 us
so now once we have bundle j/s the
browser runs that file and inside of
there will have all of our JavaScript
code that we need to run the application
which includes
reacts react DOM and the JavaScript that
we write as well where's the crazy cat
photos where's the bacon button where's
the cold steel these sections just
unfortunately turn into the standard
filler tutorial the one part where I
feel I did get my money's worth and I do
not regret buying this course is the
colt steel parts where he talks about
Ajax he talks about api's CSS with
flexbox and the animations
it's classic colt he explains it so well
I have read a lot of documentation in
various places done you know different
projects and stuff but the way he
explains it is so plain English and so
concise the pacing is great that my
brain just kind of fit the pieces
together really masterfully explained
you can tell someone is really good at
what they do when they take complex
things and make them sound simple
without dumbing them down and that's
what colt steel does and that's why
people love him
now again unfortunately a lot of these
sections are just your standard filler
lectures total snooze not adding much of
value there however if you stick to the
first twenty-five or thirty percent of
this course I don't think you're gonna
be disappointed because stuff like
transforms and transitions with CSS if
you read the documentation you will fall
asleep I did anyway I woke up and
there's like a little bit of drool on my
mouth Oh Mike oh my god CSS animation
look very unflattering but cold steel
keeps you awake and you're building
stuff throughout these different modules
and testing your knowledge as well all
in all like a lot of people who took
this course or have at least previewed
it disappointed that colds you know
passed off his knowledge to other people
who just don't have that stage presence
but I really loved that section seven
with Ajax and fetch and asynchronous
stuff there so would recommend not Colts
best work but you're always gonna have
this course and the way he explains this
kind of stuff here is classic cold steel
thanks for watching hope this video was
helpful
we'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
