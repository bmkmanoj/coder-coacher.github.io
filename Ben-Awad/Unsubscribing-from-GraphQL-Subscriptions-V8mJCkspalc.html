graph QL subscriptions that we're gonna
be fixing so here I have application up
and to Windows and I'm logged in as two
different users so Bob 16 and Bob 15 and
they're both in the hash tag random
channel so as expected it works
I see the socket update or the graphical
solution called and we see the message
pop up here but what goes wrong is if we
switch to a new channel so I'm currently
in random if I go to general and I type
a B we don't see anything pop up here
and then also if I type a B here or
let's do C it's gonna pop up over here I
think and we shouldn't be getting this
because run the random channel that
shouldn't update hashtag general so
let's fix these problems so the first
one I'm gonna saw fix is when I change
to a different channel I should still
have subscriptions working and the
reason why it's not I'll show you
so we have this component will mount
this is where we're subscribing and if I
just do a console dot log subscribing
and we can see what channel we are
subscribing to so let this refresh
alright so here we're gonna subscribe to
channel 12 and channel 8 and notice when
I moved to random we're not subscribing
again I spelled that wrong but we're not
subscribing it again and the reason for
that is we're not mounting again so we
need to put this in component will
receive props so component will receive
props will receive props
and here are new props and in the new
props we're past a channel ID okay so if
you don't know how this function works
this is a lifecycle function that react
gives us and it's called every time the
component receives new props so for
example we can just do a console log Q
and console dot log the props and then
channel ID so you'll notice that first I
believe let's see what the value of it
is all right so the props is 12 and then
I change to general we get 8 a we get 13
C 14 so you notice every time I click we
get the new channel so really we'd like
to subscribe to the new channel which
we're getting the props right here but
we don't want to subscribe to the same
channel we've already subscribe to so
we're just gonna do an if statement and
say this dot props dot channel ID is not
equal to the new channel ID that we get
any and if it isn't we want to call this
subscribe to more but we don't want to
you know call the same function in past
basically the same I want to just copy
and paste this here I want to make a
function that way we don't call the same
thing twice basically so refactor it out
so subscribe
and we're just gonna pass in the channel
ID and let's copy this and put in there
so now instead of using this stuff props
the channel ID or just use the past in
here and then call this dot subscribe
passing in this dot props channel ID so
now I can use the same function here so
this props thought date or sorry this
dots subscribe passing in the new
channel ID that we're given perfect and
just return that as well okay okay so
we're subscribing when we mount and when
we receive props so let's see what that
changes so notice how I am in channel C
we'll say hello and then we'll change
the channel a say hello again and now
we're still grabbing that which is cool
but we actually just got a new problem
and that new problem is I've just
changed to channel a I'm going to change
back to the channel C and change back to
channel a again so I've joined channel a
two times so I'm gonna say hallo twice
we get this little thing that says two
children with the same key 122 message
so what does that mean well react we're
passing keys for the list of messages so
it's saying we have two and we can see
them right here hello - it should only
pop up once but because we subscribe to
it twice it's popping up twice so if I
were to come here again this I believe
this would say hello three three times
yep because we subscribe to it three
times so we're never unsubscribing when
we called this dot subscribe it's
stacking so we need to unsubscribe too
so the way we do that is it actually
gives us an unsubscribe function pass
back
so this guy right here subscribe to more
what's returned the turn value for it is
an unsubscribe function so I'm gonna say
this dot unsub subscribed is equal to
that I'm gonna say this dot unsubscribe
is equal to that so now every time we
want to subscribe to a new one
I'm gonna unsubscribe to the one we had
before but I'm just gonna make sure that
we are subscribed to something so I
check if there is an unsubscribe
function if there is we're gonna
unsubscribe and then I'm also gonna just
do this when component will mount so
component will unmount this I'm not sure
if graph QL automatically unsubscribes
so I'm gonna call this just to be safe
area notch okay so I just need to put
this above area all right so now we'll
let this refresh or maybe a refresh
already so now we shouldn't get this
problem so I'm in hashtag a I'm gonna
switch back and forth a couple times so
we should have subscribed to a a bunch
by now so I'm going to say hello for and
notice we see how low for only wants
awesome now there's one last bug I want
to cover and that's with caching so the
way graph QL or Apollo works is it
automatically caches your request so
we're requesting the data for the
messages for a channel so right now I
have requested the hashtag a messages
and it's cached so when I go to see and
I come back to a these values are cached
in it's not making a request because I
have it in the cache but what that means
is if someone over here so if I'm in C
so I'm not listening for subscriptions
on a because I'm in C but some were to
come in day and say hello v we see a pop
up here but if I come back to a hey it
doesn't show up here and the reason why
is because we just read this
from cash because we can because it's
there so we need to tell our application
we can't really read from cash every
time because our application updates a
lot based on other users all over the
place so down here and our this is
basically our options for our graph
query there you can pass in a options
property and in there there's called
what's called a fetch policy now there's
multiple different fetch policies you
can do but one of them is called Network
only and what that means is it will not
cache this particular query so we won't
get the problem that I was just
describing where the cache will read and
be invalid so Amon see right now so I
fetched a already now I'm in C and if I
come over here to a and they say hello
six we see it pops up here and we can
see hello six is there as well because
or making a request to the network every
single time alright so that is it for
this video guys
I believe our application or at least
our messaging of it is pretty sound now
let me know if you guys find any other
bugs with just messaging in the channels
in the next video what we're gonna
tackle is authentication for subscribing
because right now any anyone can
subscribe to our messages and we want to
lock that down so that's what we'll be
working that on in the next video
so thanks for watching and I'll be
putting this code up on github if you
wanna check it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
