debugger for Visual Studio code with a
node.js application and some really
weird stuff was happening and I'm not
sure what the heck I'm doing wrong or if
this is the expected behavior of this
but it's acting differently than any
other debugger that I've used before so
I'm not sure what's going on if it's
just airing out and it's acting weird or
if this is how it's supposed to work so
how I have this set up here so I just
came over here and click on this little
spider guy I clicked on the COG and
clicked on nodejs and which created this
little guy right here and then since I'm
using Babel I added this runtime
executable right here so that it would
go into my node modules in the bin
folder to actually call Babel node and
run that because I'm using import
statements and stuff because by default
just uses the regular node hex cuticle
which you don't want for this I'm gonna
get rid of that break point but so I was
trying to debug this add user middleware
that I have and just trying it out and
the server starts up well so my washout
JSON is working well but I'll show you
what's happening so go ahead and hit run
and the server will take a second and
it'll start up it starts up like I would
expect and we see the same kind of
debugger window here that you'd normally
see on a debugger where you can pause
and play it and then you can step over
step into all that stuff restart stop
I'm used to using debuggers like this
first off you notice how it killed my
breakpoint which was odd and this was
something else I was happening to me
would be like greyed out and be
unverified and then I get set
breakpoints request timeout I'm not sure
what that's about
so this is me trying to set another one
like that happened to me a couple times
I was like I don't know what's going on
so I stopped the server I recreated it
and then I restart the server and then
sometimes it'll
sometimes a year of apparently this
breakpoint just popped up out of nowhere
I didn't have this breakpoint before
let's take this one out so go ahead and
play get rid of this one get rid of this
one okay so I have all the breakpoints
out of my code right now I'm gonna try
adding a breakpoint right here
cool we're able to add it so you just
saw how difficult it was me for me to
actually just add a breakpoint here for
whatever reason you saw a lot time out
here below and it would just pop out
breakpoints randomly throughout the code
which I did not set but anyway
next when I actually finally got this to
work I then just tried running a piece
of the code so this is a react
application that interacts with my node
to server so when I click login it makes
a request to my server and it hits this
breakpoint and so the next thing I
wanted to do is step through the code
and watch the logic one thing I thought
that was very odd is I have this rec res
and next variable here but I don't see
them in local for whatever reason but
hey that's fine I'm not complaining too
much and I click on this and I think
step over normally why you step over
it'll you know step over this line go to
this one so I click on that what the
heck I jump up to add user for some
reason I don't know how that works I
don't know if it's just like the same
thing as clicking the Run button it ran
all the way through and came up here I'm
not sure if Visual Studio code is just
there debugger happened it's not working
I assume it's you know usually your
codes but now for awhile assume it's not
the debugger itself but I must be doing
something odd or doing something wrong
so I don't know what's going on here but
like I click step over and I just kind
of like then I go to the runtime j/s and
I try catch things so I don't I don't
know if there's an error happening in my
physical code like the code is causing
an error it's like I do have a try catch
and there is no token when I'm logging
in so it should go to this catch I'm not
sure if it's doing that so I thought
alright let's restart it again and I'll
try doing this one the step into maybe
that'll work like
I expected to to go to the next line
you'll notice a wipe to my brake point
again we can set it and weird okay so
you saw me click that once right
look it added a breakpoint on line 41 in
86 here's actually where the breakpoint
was created so I have I don't know
what's going on right now let's try this
again I'm gonna restart the server I'm
gonna disable that breakpoint put this
breakpoint back cool looks like it was a
it went okay it added this prank point
baddack I don't want it I just want line
88 cool now we can see if we can trigger
that breakpoint again and we're on it
nice so I click step in - same thing
happens so I have no idea if you guys
have used the node.js debugger for
Visual Studio code please let me know if
I'm doing something wrong here if you've
gotten it to work I have no idea what's
happening but yeah that's it for this
video guys I probably just show you
what's going on I wanted to try this and
give it a go but now working quite as
well the the reactant one worked much
better than this one but he was used as
poor please let me know if you know how
to get this to work because I'd love to
debug my node.js applications because
this is really nice but for now I will
just do console.log statements until I
figure this guy out
well it's it for this video guys thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
