pretty big react application and the way
I've been setting up my folder and
structuring the files and where I'm
putting all my components is just not
working out anymore I'm not liking how
I'm doing it so I want to kind of show
you what I'm doing and some thoughts on
some new ways I'm thinking about trying
out try now here's pretty much how I've
been structuring a lot of my react
applications similar to this now this is
just like a dummy blog react application
nothing these are all blank files but
this is kind of the structured work
where I would have an index file here
which would import routes each route and
I would have like all the routes and
index yes and each route is a page on
the website so for this blog I would
have three pages about contacting home
and then any components these guys would
use I would put in a just a big
components folder up here so maybe
comments footer nav
sidebar any kind of components that are
shared between these guys I would put up
here and then import in and use them now
the problem that I'm having is this
components folder itself is just getting
basically huge and not very organized
and what's happening is I have a lot of
one-off components that are not being
used with different things and I don't
know what that components being used for
it's not very helpful so basically this
folder is getting huge with one-off
components so I need to somehow add more
folders into this to organize it and I
was thinking something like this so for
example here's something that would come
up so let's say I have like a main
layout and my main layout component here
would maybe use the footer the
navigation in the sidebar now maybe the
about in the contact page in the home
page all used the main layout
but they're not using post or not post
but nav sidebar and the footer for
example
directly there using it through main
layout so doing something like this
where I create a main layout folder um
and then I move this guy in here and
move my sidebar in there my nav in there
and my footer in there because I'm not
using these components anywhere except
for this main layout then renaming this
index GS so something like that so now
my components I can see I have a main
layout component a comments component
and post component so now my main layout
here might be composed of a lot of
little components but I can kind of see
it as a big level what my main
components are and then I can dive in if
I wanna know more how a single component
is being basically implemented and then
also instead of having these just J's
files doing a similar thing maybe my for
example my home page is using post but
no other page is all I can do is create
a home folder put my home in here put my
posts in here and then create maybe an
inner components and these are just the
components that the home page is using
so I put all my shared components in the
components up here and anything that's
just specific to this route so for
example posts I just put that in that
components folder there and then rename
that to index and then again that's a
little easier to see so now I can see my
routes and I can see my components up
here that are shared and then when I am
curious how my home is done I can see
the components right here and then any
other components that are shared are up
here as well so let's go I'm thinking
about trying out and seeing how I like
this folder structure compared to the
old one basically adding in more folders
and inner components but I'm curious how
you guys do your folder structure as
your react application grows to huge
lots of files all over the place and
many pages a lot of components shared
across how are you keeping things
organized
I'd be curious to know so leave me a
comment below if you have a big reactor
application what you're doing because
I'd love to know so thanks for watching
guys and I'll see in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
