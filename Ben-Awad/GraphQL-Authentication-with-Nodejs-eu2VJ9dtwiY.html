video very important because we are
doing authentication and graph QL now I
really want to do this because it's not
a lot of people have done this and shown
a good way to do this so that's what I'm
about to show you so to help me out with
this on beings like three different
libraries the first is JSON web token
this guy is going to help me out with
creating JSON web tokens and then the
second one is beat ripped bcrypt allows
us to hash passwords and then compare if
they entered the right password
and lastly we're going to be using low -
this is not required for authentication
by any means but it's just going to I'm
going to use a utility function out of
this to help us out all right so let's
install all these libraries so I'm gonna
head over here to the command line here
just going to clear up MD yarn add low -
bcrypt
and JSON web token tin Solly's now I
already have a graphical server setup
nodejs and that's what I'm going to be
running this on if you don't have one
set up and you'd like to follow along
then I'm going to put the link in
description below you can clone my graph
GL server templates and that way you can
follow along alright so we can solve
those libraries what's the first thing
we want to do is actually set up a
proper user model so I set this up in C
equalize because we're running on
Postgres database and we have a username
field here but it's not unique so we
need to fix that so type and then unique
unique is true so I'm just going to
properly setup this user model now that
we're going to be using this for a lots
of different things and for some reason
Visual Studio code is just popping these
up all over the place
no trailing space no trailing space okay
and we can copy this
the same things can be for email and the
same thing it's going to be for password
but it's not going to be unique okay so
reason we want unique is because you
know you can't have unique username or
email that's kind of how we're
identifying you and then password
restore to the string all right that's
cool pulling you for that before I
forget I'm going to pop over to P sequel
and just do drop database test so I
forget I forget we'll attack I name my
database up and then it might be tested
yep and I'm going to recreate it test
crash QLD B and the reason I'm doing
that is because I create some columns
and don't forget backslash Q to get out
of P sequel so I just destroyed the
database recreated it that this is going
to be using reason for because I add
fields and sequel wise does not migrate
things well alright let's get into the
meat of this so the first thing I'm
going to be doing is going to the cute
resolvers
so we're not resolvers for somebody
schema and I want to add a sign up and a
login mutation so we'll call it register
actually do register and to register you
need to have a user name which is a
string you have to have a email which is
a required string as well and a password
how you create a user account and out
pops out a user that we have up here and
now user will also have an email
attached to it along with all this other
stuff and I'm just going to get rid of
create user we don't need that resolver
anymore and now I'm going to create a
login which you need to be passing also
you have to pass in your email but it
actually doesn't matter we could say
your username as well
do password and then out pops out a
string so whenever you log in we're
going to if you pass in the correct
email and password we're going to pass
back a string which will be a
authentication token a JSON web token
and that will be what you can use to
basically authenticate thing all right
so this is all we need here I'm going to
head up to my resolvers over here we
have create user we don't need that
anymore we're going to call this
register and call this login and I am
just going to start up my server to make
sure I don't have any syntax errors
which I commonly do make when creating
the schema and looks like everything is
looking nice so we can finish up these
resolvers so there's a few things let's
start out with the register function
that is going to be happening so we're
going to actually make this an async
function here because we're going to be
doing some async things so right here
we're going to call args user because
the arguments that are going to be
passed is username email and password
and now the only thing we need to do to
create a user is we need to hash their
password so we use a user dot password
is equal to the hash version of the
password now bcrypt is actually the
library we're going to use hash it so
I'm going to come up to the top of my
file here I'm just going to say import
bcrypt from the trip alright and save
that come back down here and we're just
going to head over to the beat crypt
documentation so I can show you guys the
options so here we go we want to hash a
password we're going to be using just
the technique to the auto Jena salt and
hash and we pass in the plain password
that we want
and then we pass and how many salt
rounds and then a callback function
we're not going to use the callback
function because we're using async/await
this is new syntax from JavaScript and
we're just going to in a wait and then
we're going to pass in the password that
the user gives us and I'm going to put
12 salt rounds that seems to be a
standard how many salt round close to
like the minimum you probably could go
more if you want to I'm not expert on
how many salt round is needed so I would
recommend that if you want more
information on how many salt rounds you
should use but anyway so we're going to
wait decrypt dot hash and then I'm going
to pass in the password that the user
gave us and then 12 the number of salt
counts all right so we are basically
replacing the password that they had the
hashed version this is an async function
so we are waiting for it to finish and
get the value back and then we're
creating the user so we're just going to
say models dot create user dot create
and then passing in is your dot user and
this is going to get returned all right
so you put a comma here and this looks
pretty good so we replace the passwords
and we just create this either so that's
all it's happening with register and you
notice we don't even have to worry about
you know filtering out the password here
because I mean that's making you sense
it from a hash password back in our
schema we said users don't even have a
password field for them to grab so they
won't actually see it so now we can
actually just come over here and test
that so I'm going to create a mutation
and I'm going to say register
and doesn't look like it's Auto
completing so something's wrong this
looks fine I'm just going to refresh my
graph iql if yours is not Auto
completing just refresh use pictures
being slow so use your name I'm going to
say Bob seven email Bob seven at
yahoo.com and password I am Bob seven
all right and I like to get the ID being
email and the user name for this user
all right cool
so we see it here and now let's go back
to the database real quick I'm just
going to open up a new tab at my
terminal launch P sequel I'm going to go
ahead and connect to the test DB
database just to show you guys that we
hash the password so select all from
users you can see this is the password
field right here and I could even just
select the password you can see it's a
hash now so that's exactly what we want
so now we're going to work on the login
page so this is going to be an async
function as well and for this we're
actually going to need to pass in a
secret and now I'm going to actually
create the secret in our index page
because we're going to need it here as
well which you'll see you later so a
secret is just used to create the hat or
the JSON web token and this is just a
random string of things I'm just going
to create one like this if you go online
there's ways to create secret I think
you I'm not actually sure exactly what
the best way is to create a secret but
the most important part is don't let
anyone else see what your secret is I'm
just going use a ran
Jarboe love letters for now to show you
this I recommend googling what is the
best way to create a secret what I've
done the past is just used like a secret
generator and then I add a couple
letters at the end all right so we have
the secret I'm going to pass it in as
context here so that way we can access
it in our resolvers all right tabs guy
over
sakru okay cool
so now I can actually use it in my login
and I know if I mentioned this and
making this function async and I
actually don't know if I need to make it
a pink or not I might get rid of a think
I camera or if we do any async stuff in
this all right so the user is going to
give us a two things here and email and
actually yes we do need a sink I just
thought of well I need it so we need
we're going to get an email and a
password so the first thing is we're
going to see if we can find a user that
contains this email so comps user and
we're going to do models dot user dot
find one and we're going to be looking
for an email so we're the email is equal
to the email passed here and we just say
if not user so if we didn't get a user
back it's no lure something it's empty
that's bad we didn't find a user with
this email so we're going to say throw
new air no user with that email all
right so now we know we found a user we
got their email now
we also need the hashed password of this
user we want to check it against this
password and make sure they gave us the
right password so if we
come back to bcrypt documentation we can
see they have this check a password
function that we can do so we're going
to compare so we do the password that
they gave us and then the hash so this
is the password we're going to take from
the login and in the hash that we got
from the database and we're going to
compare them and very important this is
an async function here so we need to
await it and so is this comparison so
we're going to wait this one as well so
Const valid and we're just going to say
decrypt dot compare and again we're
going to do a wipe and here again we're
getting the plaintext password which is
this and then the hash password which is
user dot password alright and we check
if it's valid and we really only care if
it's not valid right it's not valid if
we're going to throw in your air and
we'll say incorrect password all right
and now if we've got this point in the
code they put in a correct email and
they put in the correct password for
that email so we're good to go now we
just need to create a JSON web token for
them so let's come over to the JSON web
token documentation and I'll show you
the function that we're going to be
using and it is sine so this is just
creates a token for us and as you can
see we pass in the data our secret and
then we'd like it to expire now the only
thing that might be confusing here is
data which I'll explain over here so
first let's import to see from JSON web
token and we are going to say cons to
Okin is equal to dot sign and remember
there is three things this was the data
field oops which we're going to have an
object this can be the secret the secret
we're getting from the context right
here and then lastly when we want to
expire and we'd like to expire in 365
days so I think I think that's how you
do days one hour I'm thinking this is
how you do days map changes later the
syntax is wrong it looks like they're
using come back over here real quick
I think yeah here we go this is how they
do the expires in so if you want to know
what the other ones you can do they're
all right here so we're going to put one
year that's actually what we want so our
tokens going to expire in a year so we
only that so yeah you can come look at
this if you want to know what other
values to put here so I'm put one year
and do to do okay so what is the JSON
web token why am I putting data here
what should go here and why am i passing
a secret and expires it so when I run
this jwq sign what's going to happen is
we're going to get a string like this so
token is going to be equal to something
like well all dot ball all off some
garbage ball off I think I think there's
two dots in it the periods are
significant the stuff in between is like
from hash garbage so this this string
can be decoded and you do not need to
know the secret to decode it so that's
very important and you can when you
decode it all you get is whatever I put
here so for example what we're going to
do is I could say I don't know my name
you know whatever you want like I put
Bob here so now we have like the data
that we're passing in my name Bob so
anyone can decode this token and what
would they would get is an object called
this object right here called my name
Bob that's not very useful we're going
to put different stuff in here but let's
just to show you that whatever you put
here so one can anyone can decode it and
know it so you don't want to put
sensitive information here you just want
to put information that your client
needs and then the expires them it tells
you how long this token is good for
because what we're going to do is we're
going to actually use this to do
authentication so if it's been passed
the year you actually can't authenticate
and this will make more sense the
expires in and the secret while we need
the secret when we actually check out
syndication but just know and we do this
sign we're getting this long token which
has this data in it and it's signed with
this secret and you need the secret to
verify the validity so there's two
things there's verify and there's decode
verify needs secret and this tells you
whether this is a correct token and this
is what you use for authentication so
use me for authentication so this will
do on the server side this does not know
it doesn't need a secret and use me on
the client side so we'll actually do
this in a react act this will actually
decode the token on that and then we
verify the token here so we're going to
in a little bit we're going to be
verifying tokens but here what we
actually want to put is a user and if we
pop back to the lodash documentation
this is actually what we want to why I
want to use lodash to use this pick so
what pick does is you take an object and
you pass the object as a parameter and
tell it which properties you would like
and those are the only ones you get so a
and C
you get a and C back as I was saying
it's just a utility function so we're
going to be using that oops so here I
want to do u dot tick on the user object
which we got here and the only thing I
want to return is the ID and the
username this is important because then
we now have the ID of the user
this never changed the user name
possibly can change so this is
susceptible but the ID never changes
ever or shouldn't ever change so we can
use this for when we're creating things
we can have this ID and we could verify
and this will make more sense when we
use it later but for now we're returning
token all right so let's test this out
so I'm going to head over here we create
our user Bob 7 Bob 7 at yahoo.com I want
to copy him and then I'm going to use I
in Bob 7 so I can actually log in here
email password I am Bob 7 and then we
should get a string back which is the
token BAM
all right here's this token and now we
can actually decode this token so I'm
going to go to JWT i/o and we can
actually just decode what the heck is in
this thing so they have this little
thing in here I can put in my token here
and hey this is random website knows
that it has an idea of one and if you
user name is Bob that's crazy right so
anyone can decode these things but
that's just to show you what it looks
like decoded and we're actually using
this authentic 8 now so we have this
token so our client if we all react to
application they're going to get that
token and they're going to save that
token and they're going to use this toss
indicate later and we're actually going
to add something right here to do
authentication
so I'm going to add the middleware so
I'm gonna say Const add user this is
going to be a function that gets a
request and that's actually all we need
actually no we don't we also need the
request and the response and then in
here and this is going to be an async
function as well I'm going to do try
it's gonna be a try catch here catch
catch an air and we're gonna console
without log there if we in there and
we're going to import JWT from JSON web
token and we're going to do Jo Jo cannot
verify so this is what I'm about
verifying we're actually going to get
the authentication comp token going to
be a reply spot header it might be
headers what we might have to change
this I might be heterozygous I'm gonna
get authentication this might need to be
capitalized to I always forget spot ran
dot notation that's fine token so okay
so we're going to pass the token in as a
header to every request we're going to
get the token here and then we're going
to verify that the token exists and we
get an error if it's not and so we'll
just come over here and I'll show you
what verify so the verify you want to
get the token and then see how we need
the secret here that's important there
is just like I'm pretty sure there's
like a decode here somewhere
I'm not going to look for it right now
but there we're verifying some give the
secret to verify this is actually
correct so we pass in the token we pass
in the secret and then we're going to do
Const we can get the user back so the
response is going to be whatever data
passed here which is an object which has
the user so we're going to get the user
out of it
and I'm going to do it wait and then
with the user here I'm due request dot
user is equal to user and then at the
bottom here come and do response next
oops did not mean to pop back over there
okay so we have added this nowhere so
every request to their graphic yo server
now we'll run this middleware because do
app dot use at either okay now it is so
on each request we're going to grab the
authentication header we're going to get
the token which they suppose we should
pass here and then we're going to try
verifying the token fit to legitimate
token we get the user back we pass it in
here and the reason why we're putting in
the request here is so down here we
actually can get the oops we can
actually say request and we can pass
this into our context so we have user
dot request I user so and our graph QL
Express route here so this guy right
here we had our seeker in our models we
can take a request we already passed the
user so this is run before this is so it
grabs the goes here adds the user and so
we can actually get the same user here
and pass it in here so now our resolvers
have access to the user so just to show
you that when we can do is and one of
these let's say get user
I'm going to get the user here and we're
just going to console.log user and of
course keep this the same by returning
that okay now the index over here it's
important though if we don't pass it as
authentication in the header the user
will be null so that's how you know
whether the user is logged in or not is
you can check this user here and say if
user if user the day they are logged in
else it's like a not logged end user so
you can do like a little check like this
if you want to okay so we got this let's
actually run this and see what the heck
actually happens now I'm going to grab
this token so we can use this one
because we have it now unfortunately
with this you cannot pass and headers so
we're actually going to be for this I'm
going to be using this graph graphical
application which is what you see right
here it's basically just a desktop
application that allows you to graphical
things and also lets you add a header so
put this in like description below if
you'd like to download as well so you
can follow along and this one looks like
it's for Mac but I believe if you click
on releases looks like there are some
Windows and Linux binaries I think you
can get it set up okay so I'm going to
edit the headers here and I add a header
and also it should be called
authorization I don't know why I called
authentication over here authorization
and cool and this should be pointed at
3000 I believe and now I'm going to get
user and
let me just make sure it is on three
thousand right yep usually you'll see
this load so something is wrong let me
just come over here okay old Christmas
servers good unhandled promise are
depreciated that's fine okay this is not
working so I'm just going to relaunch it
and that's unfortunate it looks like
it's just not working okay it's having
trouble making requests so I'm just
going to do inaudible real quick so I
was expecting this guy at work but one
thing if this does happen to you is you
can actually use postman and just do a
regular post request so let's do that
and so I'm just going to get out of here
and real quick to just show you what an
error looks like oh also two things one
let's show an error looks like so I
penned a bat wrong password for login oh
shoot
it's actually our server is messed up
it's not it's not that thing it's
actually messed up the third I'm
assuming I this this guy is wrong so
what we're going to do unhealth on this
rejection and the future promise
rejections must be provided okay so this
is wrong I think it might be a request
about next maybe not response
okay yes that's what what okay so here
you can see this is what an incorrect
password looks like so sorry guys this
is supposed to be just request donated
response my fault and this might
actually be working so just so you know
though you can also use postman or any
client that lets you do a post request
to access graph QL - so but you saw we
have an incorrect password here let's do
show you incorrect email - so notice it
also checks its email - okay cool but
let's continue on with showing you how
this guy's working this add user so over
here you should you can see we're
getting some JSON web token errors that
we expect that right because we're
console logging it here because there's
not an authorization token but anyway so
we have the headers here we added the
header we pointed here now I'm going to
say get user pass in the username I
don't even know what the user this guy
is it doesn't matter we don't need it so
I'm going to run it get users no which
is fine because this is not a right
username what we wanted to see though if
we come over here is we compro logged we
see our user here awesome so what this
will let us to do is over here in our
schema just get user we're going to
change that to me so this will get your
own user and you don't have to pass any
parameters because we actually know who
you are based on the token and this
could possibly be null so our resolvers
over here we can check if your user is
logged in or not so
we'll keep them there so we're going to
call this me pop that over and yeah
actually this works fine we don't even
need an elf so if a user exists we're
going to find a user so args here
because we don't we're not passing
arguments email or we can just find it
by ID now because we have the users ID
that's the best way and the ID never
changes return value return null so we
check if the user exists for me the user
we're getting from the token we have the
ID of that user which we can then find
that user in the database and get all
the details so show you how this is
works can come over here and run me and
I just refresh it and don't pass any
parameters can just run it and this
thing is in my way okay username email
so cool notice how it knows all these
things about me even though I didn't
pass any parameters to it I didn't tell
him I was Bob seven it knows I'm Bob
seven because I have this token if I
delete this token and I run this oops we
get no we're no longer logged in that's
how it knows who we are okay guys this
was a long video but I think that about
wraps it up that is how authentication
one way to do authentication in Brack QL
on that I quite enjoy there are one kind
just one flaw with it which is the
username so with login again real quick
this token
so from the client side if I were to
decrypt this token like I telling you we
would we would get this username right
username Bob seven but what if I go and
change my user name in the database this
token never changes and it's good for a
year so until the year is up Bob seven
is going to stay here so we're going to
think the username is boss so it's you
really just use it for the ID here for
things that are not going to change you
want to pass in the token or what you
can do is refreshing tokens which I'll
talk about is a whole different subject
which I'll talk about a different video
because I actually do do refreshing
tokens and one of my projects because I
need constant good information in my
tokens but this is just wool that's a
whole different topic we'll talk about
in another video yeah this is how you do
JSON web token authentication there's
this is one of the simplest ways I'll
put all these links in the description
below
all these ones I have up here so that
you guys can take a look at this and get
to setup yourself and take a look at how
this works I'll put all the code on
github as always I'll be linked in the
description below so you guys can get
this useless play with it try it out and
I think that's it I'm going to be doing
some more videos with this because now
that we know this you know I know if the
users logged in or not I don't want to
check if the users logged in here you
know I want some permission separate
there's certain resolvers here that I
basically want to give permissions to
like user boards and user suggestions I
only want to grab those maybe if I'm
logged in or if I'm the owner you know
that sort of thing so I'll show you some
cool ways that you can do permissions at
those in future videos but I'm sure if
you guys have any questions or comments
or different ways to do authentication
and graphical I'd love to hear them if
you had any trouble setting this up
please let me know in the console
because I love to help you get set up
I know this is very important to get
