you through the progress that we've made
with the to-do list app so here it is
right here and this is the one that's
built with react native and it's using a
feathers jeaious back-end and graph QL
now when you first come into the app
it'll basically check to see if you're
logged in or not and if you're not it'll
take you to this login page and but
before we do that I want to as you can
see we have this sliding menu bar here
will take us to the signup page and
create a user so right now when you
create a user on there's no error
checking and there's no like screen
transition on success but to check if we
correctly create a user you can come
back over here and try logging in with
it so as we can see we were able to log
in okay and then it takes us up into
basically this is the main page so we're
able to create - duze here and share -
duze the first thing you can do is
create different lists so we can have
multiple to-do lists so we'll just
create one and then we can add items to
this so item 1 item 2 and you can see it
doesn't clear yet I mean let's say I
wanted to share this with another user I
could I could just type in their
username and then they'd be able to
update edit this to-do list and see it
and they would also be able to as they
make changes in the app it'll update
real time because is using subscriptions
with graph QL now we can also make
multiple lists so I can create a second
list and then I could create more items
and I can of course cross them out I
want to and I can hop back to my first
list I can remove items everything you
are familiar with with the to-do list so
this is kind of the state of where the
app is that is very it's missing a lot
of things it's not very pretty right now
there's no air logging at all pretty
much and if it breaks it just breaks
it's not going to print a pretty message
to the user there's kind of a lot of
debugging code in here and a lot of
buttons but I I made this app live
streaming and I showed you guys the
whole process of how I did this and I
also have this app on github right now
if you'd like to see the source code for
it and I also have the server and I'll
put links in the description below
showing you all that stuff if you want
to take a look at it now I was gonna
continue just doing the to-do list
making it better and just keep
reiterating on it and smoothing out
basically it's bad points but I want to
do instead is I want to just keep
live-streaming and doing random features
and things what I want to do instead is
do instead of like a long live stream
where I'm just doing things what I'd
like to do is break it up into like
features so I want to like have this be
useful to you guys
so whatever feature you would like to
see this app have or you'd like an error
to be fixed leave a comment below or
anywhere pretty much on my YouTube and I
will add this feature and I'll
livestream how I add the feature so kind
of I do shorter videos of adding
features to this so if there's something
you want to know how to do with graph QL
or react native and you want to see it
integrated into this app let me know
below and I'd be happy to make a video
adding that feature to the app so this
is the current state of it on if you
guys I recommend downloading the code
running it and if you want maybe adding
some features yourself to play around
the code and I hope this is helpful to
see kind of a react native application
using graph QL so thank you guys and
I'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
