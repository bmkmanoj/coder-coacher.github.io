over what graticule subscriptions are
and why you might actually want to use
them and i'm going to do this with a
little example to demonstrate how these
guys work so I have a little application
here that's using optimistic UI and it
does a mutation so I can create a new
user here we have some user names that
we see here I can add another one on and
he just pops up here right that's fine
and dandy but what happens if I go in to
say it another client and I want to
create a user so I create my new user
hello from graphical if I come over here
I don't see my user so if i refresh the
page oh hey look our guys right here and
that is where subscriptions come in
notice how I had to refresh the page to
see this but with subscriptions what you
can do is you can be listening for other
clients so other you know browsers other
people that are making calls so you can
update your UI based on that so just to
show you a little example of how that
works I'm going to go ahead and comment
out my optimistic UI she's going to
straight up lead it and I'm going to
uncomment my subscription to show you
guys how this works and now we're using
subscriptions now subscriptions I can
just like do the same thing I was doing
here before hi again and I create this
user we see it here and just to show you
there's nothing pending I'll refresh the
page nothing here so now if I come over
here and let's say we do it twice and I
send I come back to my application a
notice it pops up here and I didn't even
refresh the page and it works the same I
can create users on this page but now
whenever I'm doing stuff from here I
don't even have to and I can do multiple
right like let's do like five up to five
here they all populate so it's really
cool and that's why graph kill
subscriptions are really handy because
you can show real-time data to the user
and it doesn't really matter how many
people are adding stuff you're listening
for all of them
so you can have like ten people at
creating users like this all across
there it doesn't matter where they are
different apps different browsers doing
this and you're all going to get updates
here so that's super cool that's I just
want to give a little demo how it works
and why you might want to use it I'm
going to be doing a video tomorrow on
how to set up the server and then I'm
going to be able to do this and then I'm
going to show you how to set it up on
the client this is using react QL I'm
going to also show how to do it with the
other with next yes and the other react
starter kits so that's it for this video
guys thanks for watching and I'll see
you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
