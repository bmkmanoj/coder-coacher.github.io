authenticating our graph QL
subscriptions because right now it's not
working totally how we want it to and
the reason for that is how Apollo client
works now I first want to show you how
we're currently doing subscriptions at
least the authentication part and then
why there's a problem with that so right
now what we're doing is an hour creating
a WebSocket link and then we're using
this option called connection params
where we're passing in a token and a
refresh token and here you can see I'm
just console logging so I can see when
this function is called and what tokens
I'm passing in so every time we connect
we're gonna grab our tokens that we're
gonna pass it to our server which seems
fine and well and good right but there's
actually a problem with that so right
now I am logged in as this user so I'm
gonna come over here to login now I'm
gonna remove my tokens here some should
never go to application and then remove
token another one so this is what a user
that's never come to this site would
look like so if I reset the page you'll
notice connection params
prints out token and our token and
they're both null which makes sense but
why did we just connect the reason why
we did is because how how Apollo client
works is it tries to connect as soon as
you load the page so it's passing in old
tokens and it doesn't reconnect after
you login so if I'm logging in with Bob
at Bob calm and I paste this in we get a
not authenticated and the reason for
that is connection params is never
printed out again so I think Hornet we
don't have any tokens cuz we didn't
update that basically so we had not
entik ated so when I say hey guys
nothing shows up because we're not
authenticated but if i refresh it
reconnects and it passes the tokens
because we do have tokens in so we're
all good it's not I can chat away and
we're good to go so how do we fix this
and I was looking at the Apollo
subscriptions options because I really
wanted to fix this problem and I saw a
variable called lazy and I thought that
looks like exactly what we want and how
it works is if you pass the lazy as a
parameter
it connects only when we subscribe to
more so right now we're only subscribing
on this page so it was kind of weird
when we are on the login page over here
and the connection that we tried to
connect so we can pass as an option lazy
and said to true so now hopefully when I
login it'll wait to evaluate my tokens
after I login so notice you don't see
null printed out here or my tokens or
you'd see tokens right now because I
have them but if I remove them refresh
we don't make a connection so that's
good that's what we want you want to
wait till we login so I login I get
token from the login this is I'm just
printing when we log in what the token
values are to compare those but uh
connection params and we see our token
get passed in and then I'm going to try
chatting and sure enough I can chat
perfect so that works for that use case
awesome
but there's one small problem with that
guy - so connection params has been
called um it was you know waited to be
called but if I were to go back and I
login with a different user so Bob - at
Bob calm it doesn't get reevaluated see
how connection params never gets called
again and that's a problem even though
we're logged in as Bob - the
subscriptions thinkwe're Bob won and so
that's gonna mess things up so lazy by
itself is not gonna fix anything and so
I was looking through issues and what
people have been doing is actually just
manually reconnecting after logging in
so that's what we're gonna do as well
basically their export their WebSocket
link and then we're gonna call WebSocket
link
that subscription not try connect and
there's a long issue about people
struggling with this so we're gonna try
this try connect and what it will do is
just will reconnect basically when we
log in so I'm fine making it not lazy
anymore because we're just gonna
reconnect in our login and before we can
do that we have to actually export this
guy so x4 WebSocket link and then up
here I'm just gonna import from Apollo
and let's go up 1 and WebSocket link so
we're gonna get the WebSocket link there
and then right after we log in here so
we're gonna set the token and the
Refresh token oops and we're just gonna
call WebSocket link and then we're gonna
reconnect and I'm gonna get rid of the
console logs here I don't think we
really need them anymore so let's see
this in action so this is a normal hey
works as usual right we that that should
work now if I go to login
notice how we connect with the tokens
automatically I'm gonna get rid of my
tokens so refresh this is a totally new
user we connect as null like we did
before but now when I login I should
reconnect so we get not authenticated
but notice how we then reconnect here
because we try to reconnect right there
and now I can be
what's up and okay that did not work at
all like I expected and the reason for
that is we got rid of lazy if we
compound these two together with lazy it
works out better I think what's
happening is we connect to soon before
the reconnect happens
all right so clear my tokens Bob at Bob
calm so we haven't connected yet because
we said lazy we go here we reconnect
good we passing our tokens looks like
that works not to go back and log in as
a different user and we should reconnect
three Bob calm and we see the connection
params here getting passed in again and
now you can still chat good Bob threes
there perfect and the right tokens are
sent now notice how this is the token we
sent for Bob this is the token we sent
for about three so it looks like that
was the mix I was thinking we might be
able to get away with just reconnecting
without lazy but looks like the
combination of passing lazy in our
WebSocket link and then reconnecting
after we login so this is in the
onsubmit of login right after I set the
tokens and right before I pushed a view
team I reconnect cool and then I'm just
gonna get rid of these console logs
because I think we're good with that now
but now our authentication for
subscriptions is good all the messaging
capability we had before should still
work we're now just protected when
people log out or when we're logging in
for the first time
subscriptions should work right away and
you don't have to refresh the page so
that's all for this video guys thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
