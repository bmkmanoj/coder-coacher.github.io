series with type warm and how to set it
up with a graph QL server
but I realized I haven't showed you guys
how to set up a typescript server yet
and so what I wanted to do was show you
how I like to set up my typescript
server now and basically create a
boilerplate that I'll use for future
projects and just something I can add on
to and gradually be my base that I start
on for all these things so we're gonna
hold off on type arm and we're come back
to it so I have a blank project right
here in Visual Studio code and the first
thing I'm going to do is just NPM in it
to set this guy up and then we're gonna
install some packages so I really am
enjoying graph QL yoga so I tried this
out with Prisma and you don't even have
to use it with Prisma if you don't want
to and that's what we're gonna do so you
can set this up yourself it uses as it
talks about here express an Apollo
server underneath you can setup yourself
but I like the way graphical yoga does
it so I'm gonna just go ahead and use
this and I want to use typescript so
we're gonna install TS lunt and I really
enjoy using this one right here because
it works well with a plug-in I use
called prettier so TS lint config
prettier and then we're gonna set up our
project kind of how the typescript node
starter does and this is from Microsoft
so yeah we'll start installing stuff so
for dev dependencies I'll install those
first this is a pretty much what I want
except for not not TS Lunt react and
alright that was fast
I'm gonna go ahead and run MPX TS
lengthen it to set up our file for
linting
and I'm just gonna copy Wow
so I want latest and then prettier oops
okay so now we're good on TS lint let's
go ahead and install graph QL yoga so
yarn graph QL yoga and before I can
actually run this we can create a my
create a directory called source and
that's where all our codes gonna go and
I'll create index dot typescript and we
need to set up a typescript config so
that we can actually run this so to do
that I'm gonna copy the one that they
use over here and I liked some of the
settings I have on this library that I
created so I'm going to basically merge
these together so I'm gonna copy this
and then remove some things and add some
things to it okay oops this is index we
want to create a type script file so TS
config got JSON
paste it in there it is called TS config
right yeah so the things that we want to
remove and let's remove this from index
okay so I'm gonna call this dist
instead of Lib because we're not using a
library I'm not removing comments is
fine I'm not sure how many of these
checks I'm gonna keep there I basically
try to make it as strict as possible and
I might remove the ones I don't like
declaration I'm gonna remove because I
don't plan on making this into a library
at least not yet
we're not gonna be using JSX oh we don't
eat that and then we're gonna be running
this with node so no can support es6 so
that's what I want my module actually
module is going to be
I think node module know they use common
they use common js2 okay I was thinking
I needed to set that to JSX but they're
not JSX es6 but no we're actually fine
and then the module resolution I wanted
to be a node that's the only other thing
I wanted to change source maps are fine
oh and I want to change what we have for
lip so take a look at graph kill yoga
they also use typescript if we look at
their typescript config you'll notice
they're using these things here we're
going to copy them and we need this yes
next async iterable for graph QL stuff
Apollo server I think needs it okay so
we should be able to compile typescript
good now I'm gonna go ahead and copy
this example here with graph QL yoga and
we're gonna paste it into index SAS so
using a require okay we don't worry
about that and let's see what some of
these warnings has type of any
implicitly alright so we have implicit
type of any so that means we have to
we'll say any and it doesn't like
console.log I assume oh yeah and
mightiest lint I'm gonna remove some of
the rules that I have I liked some of
the rules that I got rid of over here
has to do with like ordering and like I
think I kept console logs and because I
won't didn't want those going through
but for this I'm gonna keep console logs
so let's turn that rule off and I did
not copy it correctly no console okay
alright now we don't have any errors so
now I should be able to start this up
and we should be able to compile this
okay now I could what I could do is I
could every time run
TSC and compile this and this will go
ahead and generate a dist and oh do we
frit install something could not find
declaration file for WS try installing
types okay and I'm gonna install this as
a dev dependency at types
oops
and I'm not sure if graph kill yoga was
supposed to install that for us but
we're good now so now it converted our
code to JavaScript code and then I could
just run node dist index and now it's
running a local closed 4000 so I should
be able to come over here and type hello
because that's the one we have so hello
and we don't need any headers for this
so I'll get rid of that and cool so it
executed the graph QL for us
so we're good to go but that was kind of
annoying right so our configuration
files are all good but I don't want to
type typescript and then note every time
so there's this package called TS note
which is kind of like babel note which
will go ahead and compile it the
typescript and then run note on it so
what we're gonna do is install that so
yarn ad and this is a dev dependency and
the other thing so now I can run MPX
TS note and I can say source index
typescript
so now I don't even have to worry about
compiling it it's just good to go
and it's up and running now what I want
also is when I make changes so let's say
I want to say hello with a lowercase H I
want this to recompile if you've watched
on my other videos you know I like to
use no demon or I always forget how to
pronounce it but that's how I like to
say it and this will go ahead and
restart the server for us every time we
make changes in our code
and I'm going to go ahead and change our
package a JSON create a start so we're
gonna say node demon and we need to tell
it to run TS node on floors slash index
off type script
all right so npm start so now when i
make any changes hopefully it'll go
ahead and restart for us so i should see
a lowercase h here i do now if I add
that another H in front notice how it
restarts it and we should be good to go
now and we got two H's so perfect so
this is a very simple setup but we got
typescript TS lint and graph QL yoga set
up so now from this base we can start
adding things to it so this is a good
beginner boilerplate and I'm gonna add
more things on to this the next thing I
want to start doing is type worm so it's
stay tuned for that that's all for this
video guys see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
