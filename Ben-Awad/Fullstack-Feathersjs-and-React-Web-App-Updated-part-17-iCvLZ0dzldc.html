implementing this view so let's continue
with that so main that's something
that's not really going to be a page is
just like a little wrapper that we have
that we're going to come back to index
we no longer or we need it still Amon
okay this tells us our actual pages we
don't need an app page anymore so
require authentication is something
we're going to have to do from off we
did my recipes that's here good add
recipe you haven't done sign up login
single gives you a home and add recipe
are the ones left so let's do home first
rename that to view grab one for index
for example close all the extras and
okay recipe list actually doesn't need
anything
looks like he's passing the recipes in
here though recipe list so look like for
recipe list what you need is the actual
recipes oh and you're actually calling
that so what will do is will actually
make home home actually doesn't look
like it needs so like it doesn't
actually look like it needs to be
connected to the redux tour this because
it doesn't look like it needs anything
the way they have it set up right now
which is actually kind of bad is recipe
list here actually I don't like how I'm
doing this at all am I just using recipe
list at two places that could be it
that's maybe why I'm doing it like this
and then recipe card okay anyway but
this is a presentational element and yet
with this I'm I'm doing a call to the
API like this which is bad
because this should just be
presentational so I'm going to fix that
and there's a shame you need a lot of
fixing and go on here because there's a
lot of stuff that's messed up so what we
should be passing these props we
shouldn't be getting from like fetching
data like this how we should be getting
it is when I am in this home thing I
should fetch the data in home and then
in this component here I pass it to the
props so recent recipes that's something
I actually want to get from here so I
should not that so crispy interaction I
made this very confusing action names I
might come in and fix these soon so
recent requests recent recipes request
recent recipes so we'll do and then here
we'll get recent recipes I believe is
what it was called we can double check
we come here look like it's just called
recipes not recent recipes so now we'll
make this call here so component will
mount this is where you should be
fetching data and not the constructor
also so we'll be fetching data here and
then we'll request recent recipes and
again we're on validating that's okay
what's not liking oh yeah so this should
go here recipe list we'll fix this it's
eventually going to actually I guess I
could fix this now we're going to
eventually put recipe list into
components so it's going to be up one
folder up another folder and we're going
to put it here
so slash components and our recipe list
is going to be a export default it's
going to be a peer function because it
does not need to have a constructor all
it needs is this basic structure here
and now there's no this function
there's no this in a peer function like
this you're actually passed the props
and that to that right there so I'll
just do rest that's how you grab it I
can get the recipes from the props and
then right here I can do that okay can
route that into a pure function now we
don't need that here card and awesome
that looks good and we're not validating
which is fine we'll do it later
and I'll enter and okay this is a pure
function so that's good
home is good now so add recipes what
we'll do next and recipe rename is to
view I think it this one will be like
maybe this one okay so add recipe has a
bunch of stuff here should be like a
submit that's we call this so trap that
description ingredients image URL
address opee so we'll do that from here
for example and if we come to the
actions it will be I actually don't know
what our create one is let's go to our
saga so we listen for add recipe
requested when address Speer
did we have the recipe add recipe
requested so okay so we didn't do that
one so we can just create another one
request add recipe request once Oh
actually I don't even see that I didn't
add that one today I need to add add
recipe requested up just kidding I see
right here address be requested add RSP
requested it there so now I call request
add recipe request add recipe and the
submit function so we add that there we
don't need anything from the state it
looks like and I think that's all it
needed for this so this guy's good for
years and hours it's fine
okie dokie so the rest of these app we
don't actually need anymore
auth will work on at a later time index
is good the rest of these can come up
here folks these are going to be
components I speak up now bar main off
okay so now we have our pages we have
index we have the index here we have the
store here we have our components here
so this is how everything should be laid
out and I'm sure there's lots of errors
actually in this now because changing
names we just did a huge refactor
so I think the best thing to do is
actually haven't run the app is we have
everything basically in the right
organizational place now is it just like
start running the app and just do a huge
debug session where I get each one
incrementally working and I step through
and get all this stuff working and go
through each err so I think that's it
for this video and the next video we'll
do is we'll just go through I'll just
run the server just go through each
error fixing each one going through it
rather than trying to figure out going
through just like this I think will be
easier that way from this point on so
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
