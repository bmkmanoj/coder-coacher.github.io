to be writing a ton of boilerplate code
and getting this app all set up so we
can basically start coding our different
pages and our different views so I'm
just going to go based off of my
template that i use for standing up a
react Redux application with a redox
saga and then go from there so I'm
basically just going to be copy and
pasting because a lot of this stuff is
very just set up code and not very
interesting so the first thing I'm gonna
do is create a story is in our source
folder and I'm literally just going to
copy paste okay and I'll just real quick
go through what each one of these guys
does so we're getting this from Redux
which just we're creating the Redux
store where you not don't need that
don't need that we're going to be
hooking it up with redux saga which we
will need so basically connecting Redux
saga and Redux with this and then we're
getting our sagas which we're getting
from modules did a little different
naming schema I'm going to use in this
application than in this one and then we
have our route reducer which we're also
going to get four modules so we're going
to get root Sava and root reducer both
from modules and these this is for redux
and then saw gamila where we're just
creating and then we're creating this
store and we're applying our saga
middleware and we're adding our route
reducer and then we just run route saga
I would not routes age route to the saga
area folks
the real all right and we don't need
history so we just export the store and
this looks good for setting up our store
see the next what's up our route reducer
so when i create a modules folder and
inside of modules and index of GS and
this is we're going to add more than
just this but for now we don't need
router and we're going to export not
default because we're not just going to
export the reduce here we're also going
to export the route saga so to do that
and copy this import we don't need this
we're going to need fork I think that's
about it copy that route saga and then
from here we're going to fork all the
saugus for now there's no salgo as we
need to fork but as we get them we will
be forking them off so here we are
setting up Redux with this combined
reducer is we're going to add our
reducers and right here's where we're
going to add our sagas when we actually
create them okay and then just so I
remember how this boilerplate stuff
works when we actually add this later
i'm just going to create a dummy module
i'll call it user which we actually will
be creating later and then they're put
saugus so just to show you kind of how
this would work you paste it and down
here
so this is we don't need fork so right
here is sagas stuff and we will export
this function so i have this user sagas
side of modules which will have like
some sagas that the user will relate to
the user and then what we'll do is we'll
import them here and then we will what's
it called fork them off okay and now
we're going to be connecting to a
feathers jf server so we need to set up
the feathers J's client which looks
something like this and I'm actually
going to do this inside here as well
because basically are redox all guys are
going to use them so we can copied this
stuff a lot of the stuff we're not going
to use though I'm just going to get out
here for a second cuz we're going to be
in here for a little bit so stuff we're
not going to use we're not using socket
i/o for this well I guess were
eventually going to use socket i/o so I
guess I should keep it for now then we
have we're going to be using my feathers
clients we're going to use hooks
feathers socket i/o that's fine I guess
local storage we all need authentication
that looks good and then we're in
buttons we're also going to be using a
rest so need to import that so import to
rest so as you can see a lot of
boilerplate that we're doing here and
let's spoil you super agent for our
making restful quests don't need any of
those app authenticate stuff right now
so we have feathers we're using socket
i/o get rid of you
and then copy that
and then the URL to our feathers TS
server is low host 3030 so now we have
socket i/o set up losing rest hooks and
authentication so that sets up feathers
j us nicely and then lastly i want to
set up some routes for the I application
so routes so this is basically the
different pages in my application and we
can just copy this and for this we're
going to be using the react native
router flux library this is a really
nice one I really like using it and so
you are just going to import those just
going to be routes export and we don't
actually don't even export default we
can just make it a function delete ever
turn and then for now we'll just create
one component import will call it login
from I want to put that right here so
we'll create this component next and
we'll just create a dummy one Sookie
login component login and hide nav bar I
don't like the little title bar that it
adds so we can hide it and that looks
good and I can close that cuz going to
need this anymore
and so will create login dodge is and
for now just import react actually we're
going to move close that so my current
index ljs I'm going to move that to to
be my login is so routes / logon so now
my login copy may overwrite just
continue yes and okay hold on I kind of
mess stuff up because I was cat it yeah
okay didn't work said my current window
open so copy route / login cool oh yeah
why is this not working because I think
it's because I really have a login and
it's getting my stub okay okay so I no
longer have a login so now we can copy
you to be route / login okay there we go
now this is going to be like our main
application and so and we don't need any
of this stuff we just need to react
we'll say export default and import
store from store and import provider
from react redux
now in our application here we can wrap
the whole thing in provider store so
that connects our react application with
three ducks and then was the last thing
that we need to do oh yeah my routes
from routes okay so this is basically
all the boilerplate code we need for now
this is looking good we just need to now
install all of these packages that we
just added so react Redux was one of
them so yarn add react redux Redux is
another duck saga super agent or to it
else and react native router flux act
native router flux every ducks socket
i/o client um feathers and install
feathers greediness all feathers or
feathers client I think we just on soft
feathers and feathers rest fed their
socket i/o and feathers authentication
client so feathers
feathers authentication client feathers
rest there another one feathers rest
there's a dedication client feather
socket i/o feathers sluggard are okay
install all those let those finish
installing Oh feathers hooks too huh
forgot one ok so when that's done we'll
also install feathers hooks and then I'm
just gonna refresh my yarn add feathers
hooks hooks or hooks yeah hooks oops and
then I'm just going to refresh this
application see if it just works or if
we get any errors because we might get
some errors for what's it called from
forgetting to install library or
something and lots actually cons toast
distract that out real quick post post
because the socket i/o and the rest will
be the same alright that's done refresh
let that build and when that builds
hopefully we should see the same view
because we just copy that ok then I
expected token and routes index I should
just be a print this area app / NC only
one default client provider can be
configured only one default client
provider can be configured I wonder what
it's talking about
I'm assuming it isn't Oh yarn add react
Redux don't think I owe you install that
one I might have but I don't think I did
duck finish refresh we'll see if that
works nope so we must have installed it
providers store and routes um I mean I
assume if i get rid of that it work i'm
thinking that maybe oh let's didn't do
anything okay so it's not this provider
that's messing stuff up I could totally
hear that it's fine okay let's hunt down
this air this looks okay to me oh yeah i
was gonna oops i was going to export
that not default and then I was gonna
yeah we don't have to export those right
now is that it nope so could be in our
store let's just export default
default state okay let's just we don't
need all these variables here from
modules that looks good your duck saga
it looks good climb middleware this is
pretty simple I'm guessing it doesn't
maybe it doesn't like this saw goes boo
Gaz just for the heck of it let's try
importing it and see if this changes
anything so export something saga and
pour it something saga from users /
sagas and now we're going to fork saugus
now sorry with something socks syntax
error and modules index line 17 which
not have a semicolon when one default
store could be provided still giving me
there all right oh
but here that stores not valid reduce
here make sure that argument passed to
mine and objects whose values are
reducers yeah okay so the problem was is
that we had to socket i/o and dressed at
the same time it's only liking having a
one of them so for now we will do is we
will just oh I remember what I did last
time as I did socket i/o app and then I
also did a rest app ok so we do rest
here we do socket i/o here and so we
hear it all that jazz and then when we
do that we now get a new air with
combined reducers and I think it's just
because we have no reducers so I can put
a dummy one in and you can return state
see if that does anything can't find
variable react that's fun so that could
be a oh that could be a weird problem so
knowing that it was import provider from
jack'd redux knowing it was that we can
add the provider back
all right I have no idea why would we be
getting that oh I think does it give us
anything over here nope
my only thought is to kill it do react
native run iOS and just restart it okay
let me start up my server you should
have that just running in the background
the whole time okay should have import
react from ok act here maybe that was it
because we're doing so whenever you have
j sx oops sorry which is these react tax
you need to have react up here ok so we
have sagas this is just garbage sagas
we're going to replace the other stuff
we got a route a login page or store we
have an index one that wraps the whole
application in our routes then we have
our index route which we're going to add
basically all our pages to know bundle
URL present make sure your ring include
in your application book oops looks like
it should be here under if I can try it
my android emulator real quick so for
that i use genymotion i just want to
make sure this is actually working sorry
this is not working getting some weird
errors now so g motions start my
emulator let that boot up and then i can
do jack native run android
that startup okay so after after this
all gets sort sorted out and resolved I
think we're going to work on a login /
signup page and then after that you can
authorize it'll let you log in and
basically contest against authorized
users which will be nice and then we can
start actually creating auctions you an
auction page after that let's see how
our compile is doing though we'll click
is compiling ok so far are getting any
airs the packagers been acting kind of
weird the packager doesn't work also a
trick that I've done sometimes as if
this is getting problems you can
actually just in your terminal do npm
start you'll see i opened up another tab
in terminal thats lagging right here
dude you tubed i want to show you i was
going to show you guys I'll here we all
just in your package at jay sean you'll
see if you do mpm start it'll actually
start up this is the packager right here
in your terminal so that's another way
you can do it and that's what i'll try
next if building on android doesn't do
anything looks like it's just about done
it was at ninety-seven percent hold that
finish up and got our server running
there so we can connect I'm curious why
we can't have both a socket i/o and rest
connection though ok now it's building
that's nice I also don't think we need
authentication on socket i/o so I'm
going to
that because you're really only going to
authorize using the rest app not socket
i/o okay fifty two percent you can also
do you guys aren't aware app genymotion
I just find it's a faster android
emulator but you can also use android
studios emulator to do android or a lot
of times i actually have an android
device iphone and i'll actually just
plug in my USB to test my react native
apps okay finally alright so we got this
looks like it's compiling looks like
it's working okay not sure what was
wrong with the iOS version it could be
just the packager was being funky
because we installed a bunch of stuff
but it looks like everything's good so
i'm going to call it quits on this video
and the next one will go ahead and
continue working on the application and
like i said start making a sign up in a
login page so i'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
