but we were unable to connect to Redis
and it was causing it to crash so that's
what we're going to do in this video is
get Redis and Postgres equal running so
that way our docker container can access
it and the way we're going to do this is
actually through using docker compose
which allows you to compose multiple
docker containers at once it just makes
it an easy way alternatively we could
just create three docker files one for
our server
Postgres and Redis and then start up
each and since individually but it's a
lot easier to use something like docker
compose to do this for us now if you
don't have docker compose already this
is a separate install from docker so
just come on over here to this URL and
download it so we're gonna be copying
this docker compose file right here this
is a good starter one and this is just
from the getting started from the docker
Docs and I highly recommend going to
this if you haven't already because it's
very good ok so I'm gonna create a new
file in our slack server and it's called
docker compose animal and we're gonna
paste this guy in so right here this is
the name of the service so each service
is a container so this is one container
and in this case it can be multiple
because we can replicate it as you see
this is replicas 5 and then you can
actually allocate limits for the
resources and whatnot we're not going to
worry about any of that because we're
just gonna keep it simple so we can
remove that here you notice it tells you
which ports are being exposed similar to
when we were doing docker run and we
could expose ports and then here our
image so our image is called slack clone
server and the port that I want to open
up is 8081
8081 and then you'll see how it says the
word networks here we're calling this
web net this is just creating a network
that we can our services can interact
with each other okay so next thing we
want to do is add Postgres so we're
gonna be using the Postgres image from
docker to do this and we're just going
to be using the latest one and if we
look at the documentation for this will
notice we can actually come in down here
and set environment variables and we can
set the password user and the database
as well to match what we have in our
over here what we're connecting to so
I'm going to create a new service you
can write here the name of it can be
anything so I'm just gonna call it DB
you could call it Postgres whatever you
like and the image here I'm gonna call
it Postgres and that I'll just go ahead
and grab the latest version of Postgres
and then here it's important to make
sure you add it to the web net network
so networks and we'll say web net and
then here all I'm going to do is say
environment and we're gonna set some
environment variables so they have
special environment variables that they
talk about here where we can set the
password and I'm gonna set that to
Postgres we can set the username and
I'll set that to Postgres as well and we
can even set the name of our database
view and I'll call it slack and I just
matched these up with what I have over
here
and my index of sequel is connecting to
a database called slack with a username
as Postgres and a password as Postgres
so you want to make sure those match up
in your docker file or you can change
them if you like okay so now we can
access our docker file or our Postgres
DB but there's one thing that's
different so by default sequel eyes will
try to connect to localhost
so we're gonna say host and we're gonna
pass in the host so we're gonna say DB
host or local host so if we didn't even
add this host variable it would by
default look for local host but inside
docker we need to change what the host
is oops so the host is actually gonna be
called DB so we're gonna inset a
environment variable down here in our
web so Postgres are not Postgres DB host
and I'm gonna call this DB so DB is the
host and the reason why it's called DB
is because the names match up like that
so if I call this Postgres I would put
Postgres here and so this environment
variable is gonna be passed to our
sequel eyes here and it's gonna be an
environment variable that automatically
docker adds for us so now we're gonna
get that host but if we run it locally
we'll just use localhost all right so
that's good and I'm gonna say that over
here
and so our Postgres database is all set
up now we want to add a Redis image so
there's not really any special
configuration we need to do here we're
just gonna use the Redis image so I'm
come over here say Redis image it's
gonna be Redis and really I just want to
make sure it's on the same network and
there's not really any change I need to
make to it besides that so that web net
and then like this if we go into pub/sub
bjs you'll notice how we have the host
so I'm just gonna say process that m dot
Redis host
or this so this is what we're gonna run
if we're just in development mode
otherwise we'll use Redis host so we'll
come over here and set right as host and
again the hostname is equal to the name
that we have there okay
it can close those so because I just
changed pub/sub and I just change index
yes we're gonna have to rebuild our
docker image but this should this looks
pretty good to me so let's go ahead and
do NPM run build that we'll build out
our source code and then we're just
gonna say docker build and we're gonna
be building slack clone server and it's
in this folder and then when that's done
building we're gonna be calling a
command called docker compose and up and
what that I'll do is I'll actually run
all these and build the images now I
already have Postgres and Redis on my
computer but if you don't have these
images docker will automatically fetch
them for you so I'm gonna run docker
docker compose up and what will happen
is it'll go ahead and start up all this
stuff and here we see the logs for
what's going on ok so we can see here's
what's going on with our database
it's called DB 1 we can look at the logs
for that here's our web what the logs
for that and then here's Redis we can
see the logs for that container so
there's I believe 3 containers running
right now if we look at the very top we
can see yep one two three and you'll
notice we're getting a sequel eyes
connection refused error now
and which is quite odd notice how we
don't get ready so Redis connected okay
but we are unable to connect to our
database or Postgres database and it's
for a different reason than you may
think
so it's not because we put the wrong
host here but it's because our database
is not up before our website our web
container ran so basically this
container started up and tried to
connect to the database before the
database container was up so there is a
little documentation about this on
docker and basically you just want to
get the order of what your containers
start now you can just say depends on so
that means DB container would start
before the web container starts but
sometimes it takes longer for the
database to actually get running even if
the container starts then this so what
they recommend doing is using a script
called wait for it
which just does not run your application
until your database is up it waits for
it so we're actually going to install
this wait for it script and use this so
I'm just going to click on wait for it
here and I'll provide a link in
description below to get to this and I'm
gonna string click on raw and we're just
going to say save as and download that
and so I'm just going to ctrl C out of
this and it's gracefully stopping this
and then when that's done I'm gonna move
wait for it over and we're gonna be
using this this command
so if we provide a command to our web
this overrides the default command in
our slack clone server so instead of
running node index it's gonna run wait
for it
DB - - so this is the correct thing
because we call ours DB but if you use a
different name here you want to make
sure that matches up because that's what
we're gonna wait for and then we're
gonna - - and for us we're doing node
and we're running index GS now this wait
for it needs to actually be in our
container now to run it
so in our docker file we're gonna have
to copy it over
so we're have to copy wait for it Sh
into our container that way we can
actually run it okay so that stopped
running and you can run docker compose
down and that will for sure remove these
containers from running all right so I'm
just gonna move from my downloads folder
wait for it to here and we just have to
change mod it so it's executable so wait
for it and because we edited our docker
file over here we're gonna have to
rebuild so doctor build our slack clone
and then once we do that we can run
docker compose up and I believe if we
didn't if I didn't make any mistakes it
should wait for the DB to start up and
then once the DB started up it should
run alright so we're done with that I'll
do docker compose up and we can see it
run alright so we see some DB logs and
we can see our web we see the usual
output that we get where it spits out
all this junk
now I notice how we have it open a port
8081
like how our front end expects so we can
actually come over here and I'm just
gonna give this a refresh and we can
actually register user here Bob calm
save Bob is a username can submit so we
just create a user and we can create a
team and you know you can do all the
lovely things so hey how are you and
what not you can do check things out so
it's working as usual the only
difference is our back-end is now
running in a docker container our whole
entire back end our Postgres database
Redis and our Express server are all
running in a docker container which is
pretty sweet
now there's one small thing that is not
working how we like and that's if I
control see now also you might be
annoyed that this is running in the
foreground and basically taking the
command line away there is a way to run
this in the background so I'm just gonna
say dr. can pose down to get rid of that
and say docker compose up and you just
do dash D and I'll run it in the
background like so and then I can run
docker container LS I can see my
containers running and hey I want to see
the logs for my slack server I can do
doctor container and I just copied the
ID for that docker container logs and
you post the ID and you can get the logs
and so you could do that for any
containers ID so I can get the logs for
Postgres or the other one and now I
still have my command line back but I
can go look at the logs if I want to but
when I restart and when I call compose
up the data is not saved so we're gonna
crash because our Postgres database did
not save the data in between a shutting
down docker right we destroyed the
contain
we created a new container and when we
created the new container a new totally
new Postgres database started up which
is not how we want it we wanted to
persist the Postgres data no matter what
even if we destroy the container and
restart it so that's what we're gonna
look at in the next video and making
sure our Postgres database data persists
but you should have a good idea of how
to set up docker and using Redis and we
got Postgres sequel running and you can
add limitations on the resources I saw
earlier and there's plenty of other
settings that we can play with tune and
change but this gives you a basic idea
of how to set this up and you can
further customize for the needs of what
you want well that's it for this video
