image picker and react native now we're
going to be doing the other part of that
which is handling the image on the
server side so to do this we're in
create a product to mutation that's all
gonna allow us to create products so I'm
right now in schema graph QL on the
server and we're just gonna stay create
product so this is gonna have three
fields to it the name of the product
which is a string the price which is a
float and then a picture which is some
kind of data type right so what is the
data type of a picture we're going to
talk about that in a second and then the
response type we're gonna return a
product so product we don't have this
type anywhere here but if we were to
check out our database we know that's
our type product here and I'm assuming
I'm gonna have to add a comment out
import statement to get that to work
because that's how they do it with post
but how are we gonna handle pictures so
our server that we're using is graph QL
yoga so one of the features of graph QL
yoga is that it can handle file uploads
which is pretty cool but unfortunately
on the readme they don't really have a
good extra Nation of how this works but
they do have an example buried on how to
upload so this is the code that they
give and I looked at their type deaths
and they add a scaler called upload and
that is the type of files so we're gonna
use that so at the top here I'm just
gonna say scaler upload and then my
picture is going to be uploaded
all right so now let's add something to
our RL to add this mutations resolver so
I'm going to create a new type script
file product type script and we're just
going to copy what we have and post a
sit here and I'm going to just I'm gonna
keep create draft because this is
basically what we want to do but except
creating a post or sorry not a post but
a product this will call this product
and how they're doing importing is an
index dot typescript they're doing dot
dot dot product and they're importing it
so let's do that as well
all right so here so we're going to say
create product and then for us there's
gonna be three things named price and
picture so here we haven't gone over how
to grab oh so this is an error expect to
two arguments if we look at in utils
that's are using this and it's because I
just forgot to set a default of an empty
string okay so we haven't actually gone
over how to set the header with the JWT
token and we're gonna do that in a later
video so for now we're gonna hard code
what the user value user ID is and then
we're gonna come back and grab the user
ID from the token okay so we're not
going to actually run create post we're
gonna run create product but you notice
this is not a thing for some reason and
this is actually a little bit of bug now
I do have you guys have seen in my
Prisma graph QL or my data model we do
indeed have product so it should trade a
this function automatically for me and
in fact it is created but the type isn't
there so if we look at prismo typescript
this is where all the Taipings by the
way this is only a problem with
typescript if you're following along
there is no product so there's no typing
for product for whatever reason so I
looked up this issue and it turns out
you have to install oops not this NPM I
this graph QL COI
if you don't have this installed it will
not update the typescript or the
Taipings for you so i went ahead and
installed that and then after you do
that you have to redeploy but you also
have to make a change to our data model
so for example I'm gonna get rid of the
name and then run and see I'll show you
why first let me show you why we have to
make a change if you don't make a change
Prisma is like hey nothing has changed
in your data model I don't need to do
anything
it's basically what's gonna tell us see
how nothing happens but if I get rid of
name it'll go ahead and detect we've
changed something we've changed the name
and this is what we want to happen this
thing called graph QL prepare that's
actually what creates the type script
and so I'm gonna add the name back and
run to play again so every time we
deploy it's gonna update this Prisma
type script file so now if I search this
I see the word product is actually there
and now and I product a type script I no
longer get a problem all right so now in
our data file we should be expecting a
few things I imagine see I'm guessing
the seller connect and then the ID is
user ID
I guess I'm we're gonna do it in the
same format not quite sure to be honest
about name and then the price and then
we should have something for the picture
URL right
because we actually don't just pass a
picture object we pass a string
oopss on our there alright we have a
string to the URL the picture alright
yeah we're gonna set this to a string so
for now I'm gonna set it to an empty
string and we get we're in luck
how we actually flying this all up okay
oh this is not actually lined up area
we're gonna stop discuss how we actually
get the URL for this picture so what's
past this is some sort of picture object
I'm not quite sure but if we followed
the logic of how this example works they
have this thing called process upload so
they passed that file which is an upload
type to their resolver and they call
this function called process upload so
we want to process an upload - so I'm
gonna copy him and so you'll notice it
stores the upload and it records it we
don't really care about recording the
file we really just want to grab the
path that's the important bit so we're
gonna return path from this we actually
don't really care about the ID so we
also need this store upload so store
upload is this function right here and
they're using a library called short ID
and I actually took a look at it looks
pretty nice it creates a URL URL
friendly ID which is important because
we're gonna be accessing it through the
path so I thought why not let's go ahead
and download this as well to generate
our IDs so I'm just gonna say yarn add
short ID and we'll go ahead and import
him
all right so I have shore ID now I
should be able to generate keys don't
know why it doesn't like it I see it
right here so upload directory I'm gonna
call mine images so ecommerce we're
gonna say images I want to make a folder
called images and I just want to make
sure how are they okay so they are
ensuring the upload directory exists so
I Rea just created the upload directory
called images so we're good but if you
wanted to you could install this library
and make sure the outer folder exists
okay so next thing they are getting this
create write file that's from this guy
and this is a node module FS so we don't
need to do anything so let's take a look
exactly what this is doing
I'm actually not too familiar with how a
file uploads work but it looks like they
are awaiting upload so this must be some
kind of a synchronous file and then
they're getting this data from it then
they're passing it to store upload and
then store upload takes this stream and
the file name generating an ID now for
us we don't really care about the file
name of the user I'm just going to use
the short ID that they gave us and then
we're gonna return a promise and here
we're returning or resolving an ID in a
path again I didn't care about the ID so
we're just gonna return the path all
right so this looks pretty good and for
the ID here we can do
get rid of an intermediate variable
enjoy a thigh D right there alright this
looks pretty good
so what's the returned is the path which
should be slash images and what I want
to just append to that and I'm assuming
that's async this is all asynchronous
yep so we're gonna call that missed a
Const picture URL it's equal to and
actually we can do it inside here this
is kind of interesting way to do it I'm
gonna just hard code what this is for
now so our servers at localhost 4000 and
then we're gonna get the directory or
the path and that's gonna be our
pictures URL actually for now I'm not
gonna worry about this part let's
actually just return processing the file
we'll worry about that we could add that
to the front end if we wanted to if we
need to all right so a wait and we're
gonna call process upload and our upload
is our picture I have no idea if this
will actually work but we're following
along the example pretty well so we can
try it out so we're basically just
taking our picture whatever it is some
kind of object that graph QL yoga gives
us we are processing it which really
just means saving it to a folder called
images and then from that we're giving a
the path so that way we can save this
and retrieve this picture later and then
we're just creating the product and here
I'm hard coding this will change it out
later we might want to come up with a
better name increate an ID for it okay
this looks pretty good on the server
side now we have to actually how do I
send the picture to the server because
now the server can retrieve it ok but
how do I send it right so to send it
we're gonna be using Apollo upload
client and this is what Prisma
recommends so this is something we need
to install on our react native side area
so I'm just gonna start up my server
before I switch over and I'm just gonna
go ahead and yarn add and install a
called client all right so on the front
end now I'm going to go over here and we
actually need to change what we're doing
here so we're just creating an Apollo
client instead of using an Apollo on
client we now use this upload link and
the reason for that is that needs to do
a special thing it can't just upload
files itself and I don't know what we
need to pass - this looks like just a
URI and that's that now do I need to
pass it now for this one I need to pass
it a cache I don't know if we need to
pass the cache to this it doesn't
mention anything about caching now when
it doesn't say anything for example a
setting like this what we can do is we
can actually look at the package.json
for this library and just see for
ourselves so we can look at the pendants
ease okay they have like no dependencies
here the peer dependencies doesn't look
like they're even using cash very
interesting we'll see if we run into a
problem later or maybe I'm just missing
something but we're not seemingly
passing and memory cache to this we can
also look at the code but let's not
worry about it
so so doing that I'm gonna just say
create upload link oh you know why I
know it is I'm just being newb we
actually are creating a Apollo client
but instead of using an HTTP link we are
using this this guy alright that makes
more sense so create upload link like
that so we're really just replacing the
HP link
and oops so that's good I think we're
ready to just create the mutation and
we're good we can go ahead and run it
and don't think there's any other
options we passed in the URI we can go
ahead and build it over here so gonna be
running a mutation let's make sure we
can see it over here so refresh ok so
create product so we're gonna have three
things from this a name variable name
which is a string picture
let's do price for sexually price which
is gonna be a float and a picture and
this is going to be upload yep
so we're gonna call create product and
just pass in our variables like we would
any other mutation price price picture
picture and I don't really need anything
back let's just grab the ID for kicks
make it pretty and then over on our new
product page now we can say Const create
product mutation and we can now use gql
a set in oops and we're getting that
from graphical tag and let's import
graph QL now so we can actually add it
to our component so graph QL pass in our
mutation oops we don't need to add an
emoji there we go so now I should be
able to add this and we're just gonna do
it in our submit so now our submit
function we're gonna do some stuff so
back to Apollo upload link actually we
can't just like put the file in there we
need to create a react native file so
when we're submitting we'll create the
picture so I'm gonna say Tom's picture
is equal to this state values that
picture URL new react native file so
that's gonna be the location and there's
two other fields we need to supply type
and name I don't really know the type of
this I'm just going to say image / PNG
and I don't know the name so just gonna
say
and we're discarding the name of it too
so I'm just gonna say name
or I am a name there you go all right so
we have our picture so now this we don't
want just passing the values like we
were doing that we want to get the name
and actually let's just be construct or
D structure the state so this does state
values and then here I'm gonna grab
picture your L name price so here we're
knees picture URL we're gonna use the
name price and picture oops
picture so those are our variables that
are expected and yeah let's just console
dot log there and console dot log the
response we're about to find out if this
works I think we connected everything we
need to connect I'm going to go ahead
and open up the log so you can see
whether we get an error response what
happens so create a product name is
gonna be product one this is gonna be
one dollar and let's pick our image
choose it and add all right so we get
undefined and we get it cannot read
property generate a bun defined no idea
what this air is coming from
so my first intuition is check the
server see what the server says all
right so we can't proc type script can
tree proper generative undefined all
right so we're calling generate on
something then which we can't call
generate on so I'm guessing it's process
upload one of these things is broken
I'm guessing it's like awaiting the
upload I kind of want to console what I
should on this console dot log picture
so we can see what picture actually is I
think that's what it is it says line 7
of 36
yeah well it's console log this and I'm
gonna move this statement up here so I'm
gonna say Kant's picture URL and that
way we can see console a log picture URL
see if this is causing the problem I
imagine this is what we're getting the
problem with I can't see anything else
doing causing a problem all right so I'm
going to run call add product again I
don't think it'll let me click it though
because set submitting we didn't change
so let's set set submitting to false at
the end also I don't know I'm assuming
we got an air from that well it just
console.log
error happened so we know we did be in
here or we didn't cuz undefined I don't
know if the response is undefined or if
the air is I'm assuming we did get an
error though cuz it said air okay so
again p1 praises a dollar at product
okay so it's a promise so I think they
are correctly awaiting it since it is a
promise
so I'm guessing that for whatever reason
we're just not handling the product
correctly here oops not the product the
image I mean so it's either our process
upload or store upload cuz now does this
line 36 which is this line 7 oh that's
the problem
short ID is undefined okay that's it
I was reading this wrong this is the
line number not this one so line number
7 this this is generates undefined
can I read property generate of
undefined
okay so short ID is undefined so it our
images could be fine I think it's just
short ID is for whatever reason
undefined
I'm guessing cuz its typescript let's
take a look they were using it over here
tab the short ID try detaching and you
know what let's just remove this for now
I'm gonna comment and not and did I need
to I didn't know if I need to do curly
braces around this oops I mean to click
him okay so to test just to make sure
this does indeed work
we can always come back and fix our ID
generator later tests dot if we're gonna
call them tests all right so a lot
respond ad product okay let's check
images cuz I saw some stuff that kind of
look successful looks like we had a
problem creating it though nice so image
doesn't let me display it cuz in this
but I think the image did go through I
don't think it likes it because of the
idea of our use it though okay I think
what we're gonna I think we got this
working I think I'm gonna end the video
here and then we'll just clean up all
these airs and fix the rest of this and
clean up in the next video that's it for
this thanks for watching guys
