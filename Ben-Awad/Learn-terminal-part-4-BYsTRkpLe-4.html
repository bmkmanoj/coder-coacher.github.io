show you how to use wildcards and a cool
little trip with CD now real quick i
just want to show you what happens if
you type CD with no arguments so let's
say I go to downloads and in my
downloads folder maybe i'll make another
directory dog and then i see the doc
okay so i'm currently in the folder
downloads and dog now let's say I want
to get back to my home directory I can
see D tilde and I'll bring you back
there or I came to CD with nope with
nothing after it and it'll take me back
to my home so that's pretty cool but
yeah let's go back to downloads the
other thing i want to show you was
what's known as wild card expansion so
there's this thing that you might have
seen before it's when people use the
star and command line and what that does
is it matches any number of characters
it's a wild card now that might not make
sense but here's a little example so for
example let's say I make a couple files
a folder wha let's say file1 file2 touch
file two and then touch file 3 and let's
say I want to move all these files into
dog dog is the directory we just made so
to do that one way I could do it as i
could say move file one move file to
move file 3 into dog like that you're
doing LS LS dog it moves everything in
there another way to do this is by wild
card expansion so if i do move dog /
file star what that does is it moves all
files um remove it up the director to
this directory so the dot dot signifies
the current directory which is
loads or the current folder so what this
does is it moves all files to the
current directory of that meet this kind
of basically string and the string
starts with file and then any letters or
words in go after it so if i do that now
we can see fatwa to file to file three
now this can be anything so i could do
file file touch file a touch file zebra
or whatever like anything now i have a
bunch of these weird file things if i do
move star or file star into dog noon LS
and loops all of them into dog now what
else i can do is for example i could
just move some of them so for example
let's say in file I want to do say I
only want to move star and then I don't
know an a so what would happen is it
will look 40 or more i believe so i
think this should move file a if i'm not
wrong let's see what it does okay it
does move file a so what this is looking
for is it's looking for any number of
letters in between file and a it found 0
so match this so basically wildstar or
the the star expands luna is expanding
and it puts any number of characters
that you can think of as a pattern and
you're trying to see if a string meets
this pattern if it does it does this
command on it and to meet the command
you can fill in any number of characters
where the star is placed so in this
example it did nothing but I could also
have done dog i could do file star Z a
star and notice
this meets that pattern I'll do a better
example let's get rid of okay so that
this meets this example because it's you
see the letter K P characters fi and
then there's these characters which are
matched by this first star here and then
coz a then all these are matched by this
star when I move it here this can be a
little tricky this is something you want
to play around with and try to get used
to it you're not going to get your first
try try moving stuff around start
playing with that you'll get used to it
um I find this super helpful when i'm
working with a kind of python files or
c++ files or C files and I just want to
do touch everything that has that
extension so for example let's say I
have a dot CBC maybe CCB F or maybe
it'll just do d dot C so now I have all
these C++ files potentially and let's
say I want to move them all um that will
match any characters that ends in a see
extension and then I can then move it
wherever I want for example talk and
it's not just the move command this is
any command you can type and do this for
example I can remove all those files
let's do an LS on dog we see all these
C++ flaw or all these see files but I
could remove them I can do dog star dot
C and now we do an LS on dog they're all
gone they're all dead another thing if
you do just star it'll match everything
so if I for example did remove our f
star it would kill everything it's all
gone a zombie is gone dog what happened
is it ran remove RF on every single file
here and it killed everything so that's
the really cool part you can
put it you know anywhere with any
command it'll expand and it makes a
generic for generic number of files so
wild cards are super powerful super cool
make sure play around with this get used
to it because it's very handy when doing
different commands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
