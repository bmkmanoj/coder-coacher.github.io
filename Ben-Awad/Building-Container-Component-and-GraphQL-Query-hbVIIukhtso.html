the last video and now we want to add
actual data from our server in here
instead of just static stuff so what
we're gonna do is add a graphical query
that will access our server and then our
database and put in the data here so
we're going to be doing is creating that
query now I'm gonna group these guys
into like a sidebar component and we're
gonna grab the data you can feed it into
these two components so first we're
gonna start with the server stuff and
add the query that we want to run but
before I jump into that I wanted to
address real quick there's a sequel eyes
depreciated a little message I'm getting
you can get rid of that by adding
operator aliases equalised up here and
the the constructor of the sequel eyes
object and if we come down to the bottom
we no longer get it the depreciation
warning so if that was bugging you you
can get rid of it that way okay so we're
done with that now we want to start with
our type query so this is our team
schema and we're gonna create a all
team's query which returns an array of
teams so we have our team object here
and from our team's who would like to
select the channels and get all the
channels for the teams now I'm not sure
how we're gonna do this users quite yet
so we're gonna right now just fetch
these guys and username I'm going to add
to the JWT token which we'll see in a
second
okay so for our query we have all teams
we're returning array of teams let's
create the resolver for that so I'm
gonna create a query type
and we're just gonna copy this because
it's basically the same thing but not
really here we're going to say all teams
to match our schema we're gonna keep the
requires off because we would like to
prevent users that are not logged in to
get the teams now notice I'm not passing
in a user ID here same thing we want to
get the user from the context so instead
of all this chunk we don't need it we're
just going to fetch the team so miles
that team doc find all and here we are
going to grab the owner with lot that's
the idea and we're just gonna make this
a trawl query so we don't fetch extra
junk we don't need and put a comma there
there we go it's that good um looks like
reading a little red line not sure why
did I not have all this looks good
except up I see why I need an extra
quote Marquis yeah error parentheses so
now we're going to fetch all the teams
or the user ID is the owner which we're
getting from the context so our query is
gonna look something like this
oh we need over just refresh real quick
there we go
all teams and then from here we're gonna
select the idea of the team which oh I
don't have that so come back over here
we're gonna may say ID which is gonna be
an int because we want to use ID to
reference the team in different ways so
gonna give a quick refresh we want the
ID we don't care so much about the owner
is there anything else we want you have
channels we also want the names so we
can display it oh do I have not have
name nope name which is a string I just
forgot to put the attributes for that
for the team here so we're grabbing the
name and then we don't care about owner
or members quite yet but we care about
channels so refresh name is there and
her channels we're gonna get ID
well there's public a name and that's
pretty much all we care about well
actually we need to know its members too
we actually don't care if a mmm we do
care I was gonna say we only want to we
need to think of a nice cool way worried
about this later but what we want to do
is think of a nice cool way to select
the channels members only if the channel
is private maybe we'll do some kind of
query later we'll do something fancy
with it that'll come up soon but right
now this query does not work and the
reason for that is we're doing find all
on teams and teams doesn't just give us
channels by default so there's a couple
ways we can handle this we could just
fetch channels by default in our thing
here so the way you do that and see
equalize as you say you want to include
the channel model and it'll
automatically make a query for you but
for us we don't want to fetch it every
time because what if I want to get the
team's but I don't care about the
channels right I don't want to fetch the
channels every time and waste my query
so the way you get around that one way
and this is not the ideal way so I'm
going to show you the wrong way and then
we're gonna go over how you can improve
this so here's the team
notice how I'm matching up the type name
here with this so we want to override
the default how you resolve the channel
so here I'm going to say channels and
we're gonna have a little function here
so basically this gun is going to take
some information like a regular resolver
and return how we should resolve this
field of that type so we're going to say
parent args models user so we do not
have any arcs for this guy our parent
object is actually going to be a team
object so you only really use the parent
if they're if you're using like a child
property like this so we're gonna have
an ID a name and owner members to look
at so here I can say parent and I can
actually if I want to I can say the ID
which is all we really care about
because now I can say models dot find
all and I can find all of channel oops
so if we come to the channel over here
we can fetch all of them that have a
team ID all right equal to this ID here
so I can say team ID is equal to ID to
fetch the ID that we want and we don't
care about this user object so this is a
nice easy way to do it but it is not
this way and I'll explain that why when
we actually make the query cuz it'll
make a lot of sense so when we actually
actually keep the query you'll
understand so we have this little guy
and what we want to do is we want to
make this run this query right here and
feed the data into these components so
right now I have what I call dumb
components which is in my components
folder I'm gonna create a new folder
called containers this is gonna be where
I put the smart container like smart
components I'm gonna call this sidebar
and these guys what they do is they have
your logic your state and they feed it
into the dumb components and the reason
for this is you don't muddy your logic
in your view so this is just a nice way
to organize things now one quick note
about the file structure I'm splitting
things up by what they are so routes
containers components and let me
lowercase this but ideally in a larger
application it's better to group things
by context and what I mean by that is
view team uses sidebar and all of these
components so it's better to make like a
view team folder and put everything in
here so you know what goes with what
because right now we could think the
register uses all these some of these
components when it really doesn't but
anyway let's create this sidebar
component so react from react and really
it does not gonna take any props from
our view team at least not for now we
might take some later but we're not
we're not sure yet so I'm gonna say
class size
I'm making this a class because I
expected to have some kind of state
react dot component and the state is
really just the current team right and
I'm gonna say the current team is zero
team zero so I don't we can say this is
ID or we could say this is an index I
think it makes sense to make it an ID
this is something we'll probably change
later but I just want to have a state in
there for now actually you know what I'm
thinking for a little guy that this will
actually be more tied to the URL then
through the props so change my mind
we're not gonna have the state here
we're gonna pass the state of this end
so instead I'm gonna make this a just a
sidebar we're not gonna have any state
for this this guy is just gonna be
making graph QL query so I'm going to
import gql and graph QL that way we can
do graph QL stuff from reactor Paulo and
we're gonna export default sidebar and
we're gonna wrap it with a graph QL
higher-order component and here's where
we're gonna make our Const all teams
query and then in this we're going to
just copy over the career you made
and then we're gonna say oops we're
going to say all teams query and then in
here we are now gonna have a data
component or data prop passed in to us
and here we're gonna have all teams and
we're also gonna have a loading and
while we're loading I'm just gonna
render false or rendered null so loading
will put no otherwise we render our
component all right so now we have our
all teams we can render our two
components here so I'm gonna copy this
this is going to be a teams in a channel
component and we are gonna render them
over here now so I'm gonna delete them
from our view team put them here and now
instead I'm gonna copy this and say
sidebar components now containers and
I'm gonna render a sidebar
and to my sidebar I think I will say
current team and we'll say ID is equal
to 1 this is hard-coded but we'll change
that later doesn't like it it goes up
one container / sidebar that looks good
I think I probably just need to save
this guy so here we're gonna render
teams and channels so now you're able to
actually return an array and react 16 so
what we can do is we can actually just
pass an array just like this oops there
we go
the only thing is when you pass an array
of components now you need to pass in
keys so I'm gonna say sidebar team
sidebar team sidebar wow this is just
started lagging super hard ok and then
also the key for this is going to be
channels sidebar and now here is our all
teams so for this I'm going to map it in
here
and I'm gonna say all teams
dot map and we'll notice what we want to
feed into this is an ID and not the name
but the first letter so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna say for every team and
we're going to return an object and
we're gonna say we want the ID from the
team but just Teta ID and then the
letter is gonna be equal to t dot name
and char at character zero and we're
gonna say to uppercase that way it's
capitalized so you notice how I'm
putting all the logic here
that's how container Punk container
components are supposed to work and
really just this is gonna be what it
looks like our team component okay and
so here we're gonna grab our channels
and put them in there's nothing I really
have to do here special I'm just saying
T dot channels or all teams and here we
actually need to find the current team
right so past as a prop is current team
ID and I'm gonna use lodash to help us
here I don't know if I have installed
low - nope I haven't installed low - for
this yet so here I am
I'm on the slack clone server so I'm
gonna pop on over to the client and say
yarn add
and here instead of returning a just the
component we're gonna like compute
something first so put this up here
we're gonna say if loading then return
null otherwise we do our regular return
here and we need to get rid of that area
so now we're doing our same thing but up
here I want to compute current basically
the current team that's open so to do
this we're gonna find the index so we're
gonna save team ID X is equal to lo - we
could find solo - has a find index so
what this will do is it'll give us the
index of the the team that we want or we
could just do a for loop there's tons of
different ways to do this we're gonna
say our array is this guy all teams and
then what we can do is we can pass an
array and the first value is I believe
the first value is what you want to look
at so the property I want to look at is
the ID and we're gonna compare it
against the current team ID so what's
going to do is it's going to find the
index of this array or the ID is equal
to the current team ID and now we can
just say all teams team ID X so now we
have the current team that we want so
now down here in channels instead of all
teams say team dot channels and just
pass that in team name this is just
gonna be team name and for a username
this is where I want to actually grab
from the JWT token so I'm gonna say
local storage kit item I'm gonna get a
oops I'm gonna get the regular token and
I actually need to decode this so I'm
gonna import decode from our JWT decode
and we're actually gonna have to put up
here Kant's will put a try-catch so
we're gonna say let username is equal to
an empty string
and we'll pass the I was thinking I can
just use the local storage here but
we're not gonna be able to surpass the
username in I'm gonna do a try/catch and
we don't care if we air out we'll just
keep the username as an empty string and
so here we're gonna say Const oaken is
equal to local storage dot get item
token and then here we're gonna say
decode token and then back we should be
able to get a user and from our user we
should be able to get a username and I'm
not going to decode the username because
we need to set that this is equal to
user dot username now you may be
wondering oh that should be a lot it
ought to change that for me object D
structuring so I think it wants me to do
this but then I also get an excellent
warning about it here saying it doesn't
like it so I'm just gonna say is lint
disabled next line prefer object
disabling disabled next line
that way we don't see out here alright
and now you may be wondering but then
we're not saving the username in the
token well we can so we just need to
change our over here and our token we're
only saving the ID oops
so now what we can do is also grab the
username easy as that so now we're
passing in we can look at what we're
doing we're passing in a username our
team name or channels to our component
so pretty interesting so let's see this
in action see if we have any errors when
I first check our server server it looks
like it's doing ok and let's come over
here to the browser okay dang so we have
a lot of teams for this user you notice
how the first name is not popping up
here we do D we do see my first team
which I believe is correct but I'm just
gonna relog in I actually have no idea
who I'm logged in as right now and
actually forgot the users I think this
guy I can just copy the username
oops any login
and the reason why I need a login is
because we change what values we're
storing in the JWT token so we need to
give a new one so cool now we see our
username which I just shambled and now
we see our different teams gang fetch
which we see more than one so what I can
do is I can inspect this and I can just
make sure we're getting the right values
for this as we would expect so I'm using
the Apollo dev tools which if you
haven't heard of it are really nice I'll
put a link in description below what
allows you to do is see different
queries that are run it doesn't look
like it worked right now and it's blank
what it's supposed to do though is when
I run this it's supposed to see if I run
any graph QL queries and I can see what
the values and stuff are of them which
is really handy for this sort of thing
so here queries one here we go so here's
our sidebar query we can see it so
notice how it tells us what we run we
can run it in graphical if we want to
get the different values we're not gonna
do that but we can see what the output
no that was so we can see my first team
that's why we have an M here my first at
the very bottom what do we have the name
is a DF we have an 8 here so that all
looks good you'll notice I have one one
channel for all these guys call it
hashtag c1 I don't know how that got
there that seems like an error
notice we don't have a general channel
either so that's something we need to
add but I think this is good for this
video we just did a lot of stuff we'll
continue that in the next video pulling
the data and working on our sidebar
container there's a lot of different
things we needed to do with it one of
them is to actually pull in well we need
to be able to create channels too so we
can add them but actually this channel
here there should be a general channel
here as well so we need to actually
create the new neural Channel every time
we create a team and some different
stuff so that's it for this video guys
thanks for watching as always the code
is up on github if you want to check it
out
