a little bit so if you want to follow
along what I did is I got rid of bold
and then I made the Fox size 40 to bump
it up and then I'm gonna use this blue
color here to accent now I'm gonna still
use white for default I'm just showing
you guys the blue that we're gonna be
adding so now like I was talking about
the last video I want to change the
color of this depending on what the
current input state is so our three
states are pinned push and what was it
replace so I'm gonna do a new style for
each one or the color changes so for
replace I'm gonna make it blue for push
I'm gonna make it green in for a pen I'm
gonna make it white so FFF and then for
pushing I'm gonna use the same green
we're using for our button which I have
on the special
and then what I'm gonna do is create a
base Kant's base number and it's gonna
have these styles that we gonna have
shared across all of them save and now
I'm just gonna pin two styles to each
one
base number so now down here these guys
are gonna just use the append style
whereas this one is gonna depend on what
the input state is so input state so
when the input state is let's say that's
a pops up so the current input state is
replace so we see it being blue there
and then as I push eight we're now at a
pinned mode and we don't ever get to
push mode so we don't see the green pop
up but we're gonna be seeing that in
this video because we're gonna be
implementing these guys right here
Division X minus plus Oh before we do
that I want to just add this little dot
I'm gonna make him an on press as well
so now we can press him and I think I'm
gonna take the air handling strategy
that these guys do as well where if you
like mess yourself up and put a bunch of
dots there and you try to do addition
and you just show not a number I like
that if the user shoots themselves in a
foot that's just fine we don't care
about that so like if someone does this
for example it's not gonna be a number
and when they do operations it's gonna
get messed up okay so I want to create a
new action for when we do an operation
at least a minus X and that sort of
thing so new action I'm gonna call this
operation
and create the new action operation and
operation is gonna be the type and then
we want to call that over here so again
we're gonna follow the same strap we did
with the other actions we're gonna
import it from our modules so operation
tasty operations are operated okay
operation she want to make sure that
make it plural and down here I'm going
to call this operation action and
operation and then we're gonna grab that
from our props operation action and then
that's gonna be called for our on press
for our X and for our division so
operation action oops
and we're gonna do this for our X our
division multiplication subtraction +
and power as well
because that is an operation as well
okay clear swap we're gonna be different
things we'll worry about then at a later
date okay so we're gonna make a new case
and let's make it at the top why not we
did that for that so case operation so
here we're really just gonna look at the
top two numbers and if you take a look
at how this is working we're gonna do it
the same way so if I put eight enter two
and I hit division it's not 2 divided by
8 it's 8 divided by 2 right so we should
get 4 so we're gonna say Const we can
call them X is equal to state dot stack
0 and we're gonna stay kawaii is equal
to state got stack 1 and it's gonna be Y
divided by X or Y plus X and now we need
to parse these things into floats so I
say parsefloat
parsefloat so now cuz we're storing the
mass strings so now we're gonna grab the
two values make sure they're floats and
then we're gonna say if payload and for
this one we actually do need a payload I
didn't pass one in here needs to be the
operation that we're doing so op pass
that as our payload so now if the
payload is pal we're gonna return and
we're gonna return this as a string so
I'm just going to wrap it in a string
template here and we're gonna keep the
rest of the stack so state dot stack and
we're going to slice the two guys off
the end there and because we're doing an
operation we're gonna go into our push
mode so and here we need to say what our
result is as well okay so we're gonna
put the result here and we're gonna put
them in both places right he's gonna be
in two places he's also gonna be up here
so really we should say create the
result here but this is gonna be the
stack that we're changing and then our
input state we go into push I believe
let's double check seven eight if I add
them okay so we're gonna slice
everything off the end and then we're
gonna append eight two at the bottom so
whatever the result is so actually we're
gonna have one result I was wrong oops
so for PAL we're gonna call math this is
a function from JavaScript dot pal and
here we're gonna use our base value is
gonna be the top value so our top value
is y
this is gonna be X you've gotta save and
I think it's barking because I don't
have a break because we're using if
statement so break
what else is it Matt out no case
declaration expected Oh cuz im using
Const it doesn't like that I forgot
about that you can't do you can't have
conscience on the upper case of this
case statement so math lap how is
restricted from being used used exponent
notation oh okay I didn't know that I
didn't even know JavaScript had an
exponent notation so it looks like you
can do star star for two pal stuff now I
just want to see if this works so if I
put and let's double check our results
so eight enter two if I power that
should be what 64 and now if I do eight
enter to pal we see 64 here and here we
see the green color because we're gonna
be pushing if we add a seven but notice
we don't actually we actually don't have
the code for that right now
so let's add that real quick so elsif
state that input state is equal to push
we we don't replacing but it's very
close to replace we keep puts on the
stack and we just put ours at the very
bottom here so 8 enter to power and then
a four moves up there and then we're
appending nice and then we can pal that
and write Efendi huh so we are using it
doesn't like us putting const up here my
plan was to put const and then just suit
much of else ifs and do different
operations per which now I don't like
because now we're gonna have a bunch of
bloke code so I'm gonna write a function
up here I'm gonna say Const do operation
where it's gonna take the stack now I
should take the stack it should take x
and y and then it should do in the
operation and should do the operation
yeah let's do it let's put it statement
there so then really what we're just
going to return is right here do
operation passing in X and pow
passing and then our state dot stack
zero and state dot stack one so now this
code is gonna come up here okay so now
whatever operation that we're doing it
doesn't really matter
we're gonna do the operation with the
first two values and then we're gonna
chop them off so now up here in our code
here let's make this a valid function so
we're gonna just check what the
operation is and do operations we need
to pass in the payload is what our type
is and what doesn't it like does not do
operations operation okay so here we're
going to say Const X Y is gonna be equal
to X Y so we need to call this something
else a B so here we're gonna return the
star star a so let's make sure this
still works eight enter to pal 64 we're
good so now we're gonna say else if op
is equal to a plus sign we're gonna
return B plus a else if op is equal to
negative sign we're going to return bu-
a else if operation is equal to X and we
capitalize the X I believe so then we
say return B times a and we need
division as well so copy that
okay otherwise we're just gonna return
returns zero if we don't meet any of
these operations we can just return zero
that seems fine okay so let's check the
our division make sure we did in the
right order so if I do ten enter two
divided should be five so ten enter to
the version five cool times 98 add how
we do subtraction
let's do 132 minus three two one 98
times let's see what happens when we do
division by zero we get infinity that
seems fine
multiply seven divide Colette's that we
don't crash plus we now have not a
number cool
so our calculator seems to be handling
that pretty well so we can do operations
and this whole half of our calculator is
done there's only two buttons we have
left clear and swap we'll do those in
the next video
let me know if you guys find any bugs
with this I'll test it out as well and
see if I find anything but yeah next
video we'll do these two buttons and
we're getting close to the end of our
calculator already it's pretty fast to
get this up and running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
