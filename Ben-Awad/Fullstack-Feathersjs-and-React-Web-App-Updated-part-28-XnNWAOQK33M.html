just like tear about part the actions
and clean that way up like it's going to
look much nicer we have a bunch of them
I don't think that are needed on and we
can clean up much a lot and there's a
basically a kind of a pattern I like to
do that we're going to use so here's how
it's going to go so I'm going to start
with this so sign up requested that's
fine request sign up okay so the syntax
or the name convention we use is for a
API call on to true it's going to be a
request and then the command that they
want that's what the action is going to
look like and then the type so the
action is going to look like that and
then the type will be request and
whatever it is request sign up request
and then when you receive information
will be received whatever you're
received and then it'll be received for
each one so it'll be export Const
request sign up equal to request sign up
and now I'm just going to look in the
sagas so do I actually do anything
though when after we sign up um try sign
up put sign up succeeded so we're not I
can actually just check the reducer
login succeeded actually with a sign up
why am i doing a let's login not I'll do
it
okay so I actually don't do anything
when I sign up is received so I only
need those three now you can copy this
and do request login request login
so now I'll do the same thing do we do
anything for receive for login we can
check our do sir
login succeeded and are we calling login
succeeded
it's no we're not here you login login
succeeded we pass in the user so we try
to login but then we actually are not
getting a user when we login that's
quite interesting we that's doing
nothing so go to reducers put this out
logout done that's good that's a good
one because the check off I'm are a
calling so request login request logout
and request off and then receive off
because that is something you actually
do and same with the logout let's see
log app ok so now here we request sign
up for class sign up your request log in
we're going to request off we're going
to want to spawn because you're not
always you're not always going to
succeed basically is the request part
and you're doing an API call for most of
these so that's why I use that so
request login request where is the
autocomplete why is this loading so hard
um request off um
request login why is there to request
logins should be a quest log out okay
and then I think we're going to need to
receive off receive what oh I don't know
why I did that lower case okay so now we
basically need to clean up everything to
use these so now if I go to my sagas now
instead of this I'll have requests
alright we don't even need any of those
only that receive off will use or
request all through min here request
login request logout request signup
request off okay so those are the four
we'll be using and I did do requests
line up yep cool so don't need this
don't need this we don't really need
anything when we log in because we're
saving it automatically and then
redirecting cool this will be your
request login you'll need this every
place we don't need to do anything on
successful sign up this will be your
request out logout done receive logout
receive log out
set the direction see logout just see
logout back to the sagas logout
requested quest log out that's fine call
call logout try sign up
let's do switch this to the same things
in step try sign up will do call sign up
and then instead of try log in try log
in I will do call logging that just
matches what I'm eating for all the
other ones so instead of auth good
though we're going to be we receive off
awesome so that is good here now just
our sign up and our login page I believe
needs to change and possibly this page
so yeah request log out let's just go
one by one so this page now is request
log out
and then down here request lockout
oops request log up and then off should
stay the same if we're doing requests
off that's good
get user we're requesting off reducers
ounce of off good it's received off
receive login and now this makes a lot
more sense instead of this good bad
stuff that I was using before and I can
see reading we got the auth information
where you see the login and actually
it's not logging that we're receiving
that to receive log out see you log out
okay so now here request login oh shoot
own okay I thought I did login here
I thought the duplicating we were we're
good so request login request login and
then here it's going to be request log
in and then sign a page it's going to be
request sign up
okay and then after we do this we just
made a lot of changes so I'm just going
to go through and make sure that we
weren't missing anything so let this
refresh and I'm just going to basically
go through all the stuff okay so it
looks like a grab ten rate will log out
okay awesome let's see if we can sign up
I'll do Jo Jo Jo awesome looks like that
looks good
refresh there's no recipe for jail oh
yeah okay that's good for this one I
think I'll pause it here so the things
don't get too long and then we'll do the
same thing for the recipe actions we'll
clean up all this junk plus it for this
video and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
