set up a react project with your very
own web pack configuration file from
scratch from an empty project now this
is something I actually don't recommend
doing if you want to start a new project
I actually recommend using something
like create react app or one of those
really good templates out there this one
is my favorite and they already have
configured the web pack file for you and
they have optimized it and it's really
good so why am I making this video then
there's two reasons the first is you
can't always use create react app or the
sorts stuff comes up for example I
wanted to make a Chrome extension and
this just does not work if you want to
set up a Chrome extension you kind of
have to set up yourself this was really
just made to create react websites and
secondly there is a new competitor web
pack out called parcel so I want to
compare and contrast those two together
and show you guys what it's like to
start a project with web pack and to
make your own configuration file with
the parcel and compare the two okay with
that said let's get started so first
things first we need to install react
and initialize NPM enter project and
we're just going to be doing hello world
here where we render hello world on a
react element so here I have an empty
folder an empty project I'm just going
to do NPM an it
- why - go ahead and initialize the
project and then we are gonna create a
new file here index table yes and this
is gonna be my react file is and in
there I'm just going to copy this
and we're going to import react from
react and import react Tom from react
Tom alright so here we are just
rendering hello world this h1 tag and
we're getting an element the root
element and rendering our react
application there so to be able to do
this we need to install react and react
Dom so we're going to say yarn add react
and react Dom and now this needs to be
associated with an HTML file right so
our Java Script is going to be running
on an HTML file so index.html and here
we're just gonna say HTML gonna create a
body tag and then we have a div and I'm
gonna give it the ID of root and down
here we'll have our script source and
I'm just going to specify what
JavaScript file we want to be running
now I don't want to get the index.js
file because this is the code that we
write we want the code to be for example
the web browsers cannot load this they
don't know what this import from stuff
is this is new JavaScript syntax and it
doesn't know how to deal with it
so we have to point it to this thing
called a bundle dot JS file and this is
what we'll be creating and we'll be
using webpack for is to create this
bundle GS and we need to take this code
and compile it to code that the web
browser will understand alright and I
don't see my okay here's package of JSON
file so we have our react code that we
want to run and we have our index.html
set up now this is super bare-bones
I'll be it but that'll work
next thing is to start up with web pack
so we're just gonna walk through to
getting started and then adding what we
need to config this thing so first off
we need to install what
of course I'm gonna go ahead and use
yarn for this yarn ad dev webpack - D is
shortcut for saving and development
dependency and then I'm gonna create a
new file called web pack doc config yes
and this is just going to be the
configuration file for what pack and I'm
gonna go ahead and just grab so this is
their getting started I think they have
a web pack they should have a starter
what pack here somewhere that we were
just going to steal where they require
the paths and by default you actually
and here we go
by default you don't need a web pack
config web pack and try to figure out
stuff on its own but it's not very good
at it so you need to configure some
stuff so here we don't have to worry
about file and path right now we're
gonna keep this super simple so module
is exports that's just saying here's our
object and our objects gonna be
configuration for what pack here we say
where's the basically the file we want
to turn into this bundle dot GS and it's
right here so index is is right here and
we want to output a bundle dot JS file
so super simple right we're gonna take
this and turn it into bundle j s now we
could try running web pack right now but
it won't work because it doesn't
understand what code we have here so MPX
and if you don't know MPX does you can
just use that to do this you can use
that to run things so enter no modules
we have web pack and web pack sources so
in web pack there is a binary that we
want to run so we can use this MPX which
comes with node now to run this if you
don't have MPX you can install it
I believe you can buy install it with
that or download latest node it comes
with it now let's run MPX
web pack to see you what that does so
it's just running web pack for us and it
says unable to parse it maybe we need a
loader which is right we need a loader
and the loader that we need is the Babel
loader so we are gonna add a Babel
loader here and the first thing that the
loader tells us to do is to download
these things right here and it's
actually not quite correct query have
installed web pack and it tells us to
install this preset in now it doesn't
know that we want to be installing react
so we want to install a different and/or
preset and that is the react preset and
now I'm gonna be using the latest
version Babel which is currently in beta
which it may not be in beta when you're
watching this so you can just grab
pretty much whatever Babel loader and
Babel core is the latest so over here
I'm gonna say yarn add those two files
and then instead of adding these two
which we really have what pack so using
that em we're gonna use the babel preset
in and now babel has a lot of presets
these are just basically plugins they
bundle for you that have functionality
so you basically would want these
plugins if you wanted to do react so
they bundle them all together and call
it a preset react so you don't have to
install six different five different
plugins every time you want to do react
you just grab this
all right so we'll let those install and
now we're gonna come back to you to
Babel loader how do we add these things
so we need to create a module so we're
gonna add our module and we had a comma
now our module we have some rules this
should be pretty self-explanatory test
we're looking for just JavaScript files
make sense index such is the JavaScript
file and we're excluding node modules
and Bower components because they don't
need it we can remove this since we're
not using Bower we're only using node
modules so we can just say exclude node
modules from what we are loading or
parsing so here they're using babel
loader which we are using as well and
here they have specified the presets
that they want and we're using preset
react so we're gonna change that alright
so cool if finish loading and now I can
run MPX web pack again and see what
happens
cool so it finished loading but nothing
happened right let's see if our bundle
jeaious happens yep and we can see take
a look at her bundle this is what it
turned our index top jeaious over here
into pretty cool but usually if you're
using something you want to view this as
a website right and by default
I don't believe web pack serves a
website for you I could be wrong but
there's this nice dependency here called
web pack dev server and what you do is
you can we're going to install this so
yarn ad this is a development a
dependency - and I think I accidentally
installed yeah Babel should be a
development dependency not a regular
dependency I actually don't know the
fast way to move this to here I'm just
gonna leave it there for now but if you
are following along and
want to use this make sure you do
install these three as dev dependencies
I can probably just remove them and then
re-add them as dev dependencies after
this video okay so we just add the
developer server so now I can just run
web pack dev server and what that will
do is a listen for code changes compiles
the web pack every time and serves our
code here so I can now go to localhost
8080 1 and it doesn't look like it
opened there we go
and I can see hello world alright so we
finally got our react project rendered
on a website cool and then as we make
changes over here alright let's get rid
of that it listens for it recompiles and
then we see it over here without the
bang sign so cool that's this basically
bare-bones simplest web pack set up for
react and let's just walk through again
what we had to do to get this set up so
first we installed react and set up our
react project right with Korean
index.html file which we point at this
bundle J s instead of in next yes bundle
is what web pack creates for us and then
index J s this is our code here where we
our react project lives and then in a
web pack config we install it web pack
and set it up and we pointed it towards
the file we wanted to transform which is
index.js then we gave it what we wanted
to turn into we call it bundle a s and
then we told it we are using react so we
need to use babel loader to understand
react and compile it down to where the
browser can actually use it so a couple
steps to get this set up but we have a
web pack and then we have to install web
pack server to get a server running now
to extend this you pretty much just add
on any plugins you want to Babel loader
or you know if you want to add web pack
plugins you can
as well so that is it for this video
what I'm gonna be doing tomorrow is
comparing this verse parcel so we're
gonna set up the same project using
parcel and seeing what it's like to set
up a project from scratch using parcel
which you'll find is actually a little
bit simpler than setting up a web pack
project and on doing the same thing and
it's supposed to be faster so that is
really cool that's it for this video
guys thanks for watching
