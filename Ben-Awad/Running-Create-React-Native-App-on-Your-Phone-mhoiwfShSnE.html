right here and this is how it's gonna
look for the rest of the tutorials I'm
gonna have Visual Studio code on the
left over here and then on the right
I'll have in iOS or an iPhone emulator
to show you as we're coding what it
looks like now I would recommend for you
guys to if you're following along to
have this actually running on your
actual device and doesn't matter if you
have an iOS or an Android phone you can
get this working but if you do want to
run this on emulator what you're gonna
want to do is in terminal make sure
you're in the folder where your project
is just do NPM run iOS or NPM run
Android now to get that working you need
to have the emulator installed on your
computer either iOS or the Android
studio one
so NPM run iOS will do the iOS simulator
and NPM run Android will start the
Android one now for the rest of you guys
that gonna run on your phone this is
what I would recommend is you're just
gonna type NPM start now when you type
NPM start it's gonna look a lot like
this so you're gonna see a big little QR
code like so and it's gonna say it
started so what you're gonna want to do
is on your phone and solve the app
called expo client or expo on android
and i'll link these in description below
so install this on your phone and then
what you're gonna do is you're gonna add
a new project and you're gonna scan the
QR code that pops up here in your
terminal and you can use the terminal
and visual studio code if using visual
studio code or just i term or any
terminal the Windows command prompt
works as well and scan this and then you
should see the app pop up on your phone
now it's important to note that you need
to have the your phone and your computer
need to be on the same network for this
particular one to work if they're not or
can't be on the same network could do
set up an emulator over here like I have
okay so this is how you can see the app
and now I just wanted to go over quickly
what are all these files we
on the left and what they're doing now a
lot of these you're never ever gonna
even need to touch and you don't need to
worry about so the first thing you
should see is this dot Expo folder now
you probably won't see this until you
actually start up the application and
it's just what Expo uses I believe it
caches some stuff and you really don't
even have to worry about this dot Expo
folder this is something that this uses
and not really us and all of these
things you won't even have to worry
about as a beginner dot babble RC is one
of them this is something is used to
transform your code when compiling and
again this is something we're never
gonna need a touch especially as a
beginner and I've never needed to tweak
this at least with react native the
presets are pretty good and they're
gonna see a folder called dot flow
config if you've never heard of flow
maybe you've heard of typescript
basically what those projects are is for
adding types to JavaScript so by default
you use Const or let or var instead of
for example int or a double like in Java
but with flow what you can do is
actually what's called typing the
programming language and when you type
it basically you say you want this to be
an integer you want this to be a boolean
and this is just the config for one of
the systems do that called flow so I'm
gonna go ahead and delete this because
we're not gonna be using flow for this
project but flow can be used and it's
pretty nice dot get ignore this just
ignores this is a default config that
they gave us this is if we're using git
and it's what files take nor for example
it's ignoring node modules which can get
very big in this dot Expo folder which
it doesn't need and then Watchmen config
this is for when you're typing and your
computer automatically will update the
app over here again don't have to touch
the config for that at all you'll see
app dot j s we'll be talking more in
depth about this this is the application
the code that's having run over here app
dot JSON is a settings file for expo and
we'll be using this when we want to for
example deploy our expo app it's pretty
much a settings in config file for
putting on the expo store
here is a test this is for testing our
app they call it app dot test we're
gonna delete this because we're not
gonna need it right now we'll use it
later package.json over here this should
be normal to you guys you shouldn't see
this before this is just basically the
manifest file for a Java Script where
all your packages are so when I was
running MPM run a start or NPM start or
MPN run Android this is what it was
actually running right here these
scripts so I was running react native
scripts start iOS and here we can see
the dependencies via react react native
and expo and some other stuff here and
then here's the readme this is the
readme from create react native you can
get rid of that too and then here's a
yarn lock if you're using yarn you don't
have to worry about that at all okay so
let's look at app dot J's real quick if
you've never seen react native before or
react this might look a little for and
up here we have imports and this is
basically the start of your application
so this is what it starts to read here's
the main class app any notice it's
export by default this is how it knows
which class so you can have multiple
classes in a file export defaults
telling us this is the class that we
want to actually render you'll notice
how there's a stylesheet here and
there's a view and a text so instead of
using HTML tags so if you've ever used
react before what you do is use divs or
H ones or paragraph tags now our three
act native there is these tags that you
actually get from react native view is
similar to a div text is just text and
we can see the text here is actually
displaying here and this is a nice thing
when I was talking about a nice
developer experience with Expo and with
create react neater at create react
native app so just notice how it says
the word open here I can change this to
close and I hit save and as soon as I
hit save you'll notice it has a loading
indicator it bundles it and now it says
the word close so these you can see how
fast it just updates and the same thing
should be happening on your phone when
you're changing this you should see a
live update and what you can do as its
here you can shake your phone and that
will bring up a menu to do different
things but again we're here we were
importing react so whenever you see this
right here this is called JSX that's the
name of these tags on the language for
it so whenever using JSX you have to
import react and we're also extending a
react component that's why we imported
react here and then here we're importing
react native and this should look pretty
self-explanatory
we need a style sheet text and view
components so each one of these tags is
called a component this is a view
component a text component and notice
how we are created three text components
at one view component and then we passed
in a style so this is how you pass
parameters to components so to this view
component we passed a style they call
them style props so we passed the style
prop and what we passed this style stock
container so Styles is down here and
this is how you create styles for react
native so this is the recommended way to
do it is to create a style sheet and
using dot create now that's if you want
to do regular there's also other
libraries like styled components and
different third-party libraries that you
can use to make styling look a little
bit different and almost similar to see
a set CSS if you've ever heard of that
but you notice this actually looks
pretty much like CSS here as well but
things are camel cased so that's an
important difference and it's an object
but so this is us styling this so you
know you can change the background color
I could change this to red for example
and now it's all red so that's changing
the style and I believe let's let's show
you guys what an error message looks
like so so when you get an error and you
for example you save it you'll get a red
screen and it'll tell you syntax error
or whatever is going wrong so what you
do is you can just fix the air save it
and it doesn't always restart here
you're gonna have to click this reload
and it'll go ahead and reload active
so that's kind of the setup in the
layout of app GS so what we're gonna be
doing in the next video is expanding on
this app and adding more components so
basically all we're ever going to do in
the rest of this video is adding more
components to this application until it
looks and functions the way we want it
to but that's it for this video guys
thanks for watching and we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
