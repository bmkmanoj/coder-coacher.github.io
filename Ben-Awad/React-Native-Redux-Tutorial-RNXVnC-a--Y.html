show you how to use Redux with react
native right now I have a react native
project open and I'm just going to first
install the libraries that we need first
is redux
and the second is react redux which lets
you basically connect redux and your
react app okay so I have basic react
native app open here if you like to know
how I set up this application I'll put a
link in the description below but the
first thing I want to do is I'm going to
create a store yes and I'm going to
import create store from redux and then
I am going to import the route reducer
from reducers so you need creative
reducers we haven't created in yet and
I'm just going to export default create
store and then pass in the reducer and
then my index what I'm going to do is
I'm an import provider on react Redux
and then I'm just going to wrap my route
and the provider and now we just have to
pass it a store which let's move this
down here I can get from the store a s
folder let me import that in and we can
pass the store to our provider so this
is the route of the react native app and
I'm just wrapping the whole thing in a
provider passing in the store that we
just created and in the middle here we
have routes and this is just a relative
just a using react native router flux
and we got our page one two and three
okay so we have those set up now let's
say for example I want to set up page 1
so I can click a button and we basically
just increment the counter so to do this
what I'm going to do is I'm first going
to create new folder called
page 1 and then
to page 1 and side of page 1 and I'm
going to call it you and then I'm going
to create a new folder here called index
is not folder but class now here is how
we connect a component so it can see via
Redux tour I just pop right over here
alright now I have in web browser open
is the react Redux um basically
documentation showing you how to do it
so I'm just going to copy straight from
the documentation how to set up and
connect your component so I'm going to
copy this over here and you can see lots
I'll just go line by line and I'll
explain what's going on and they're also
importing import connect from the Act
review box
ok so connect is what says connect the
store or redux to my component find
action creators allows you to dispatch
actions from your component here we're
importing all our actions what we'll do
is we'll create a folder called
actions so if we go up to will create
that next and we can import all our
actions and then here what we're doing
is we're saying you have stuff in the
state we now and add that to the prop so
we can access it from our component
right now we don't have anything so I'm
just going to get rid of that and then
right here we're dispatching some
actions we have no actions but when we
do have actions
it'll add it here so I can now call
these actions for my component and then
right here we're going to save you and
connect is where all the magic happens
we say add the these props or add this
stuff to the props right now we're going
to add nothing and add these actions to
the props so now my view component and
its props have
just to these actions and these this
state right now there's no state and
there's pretty much new actions if there
was you'd be able to access them here so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create just a basic action so actions
and for now it's actually I'm going to
call it action CAS so delete yes I'm
going to call it actions Bochy is oops I
don't want to hear I want to move it up
to the root directory I don't have in
the root directory okay
I thought actions was inside of route
okay and then we're going to export
Const increment counter and this is
going to take no parameters and all it's
going to do is we're going to return an
object of the type increment okay so now
we're going to go to recreate a reducer
so reducers and inside there will have
an index dot gif so here we're going to
import combined reducers from react
Redux and then we're just going to
export default combined reducers and
then all for now we'll just have one
reducer we'll call it counter from
counter
it will just pass that into our reducer
here and now we can create counter Ches
so this is going to be a reducer for
that we just added here you're just
going to export default I'm going to
take a state going to start at zero and
action and all we can do is we can
actually just we know it's only going to
have a type we can just expand it grab
it to type do a switch statement on type
and we can say case it's equal to
increment we can return state plus one
default we're just going to return state
okay so this is going to be our reducer
now what we'd like to do is call
increment and see it increase so also
now notice how we have right here I call
something called counter so if I want to
access the value of counter I can get it
right here so counter is equal to state
counter and now in my view here I can
grab in the props so this is the props
so notice how I have a pure function
right here so they pass the props in
like this I'm just going to expand it
and grab the what I just call it counter
yeah and I'm also going to get the
action increment counter so I'm going to
create a new button here that's called
increment new text the text here is just
going to have the value of counter and
increment here instead of calling
actions we're now just going to call
increment counter okay and I think
that's all wired up I might have some
syntax errors but let's refresh this
see what's going on so this is the
screen that will pop up if you get
something wrong in react natives so
unter main GSX contents and index and it
looks pretty good source index so if I
come here source index
I just forgot to close the provider can
refresh and we have an unexpected token
oh I know exactly what it can be
actually sit there actually I was
expecting an exit here saying line one
up counter so it says reducers counter
unexpected token we're getting AC
Michael on line one and there's no
semicolon here oh I was using the wrong
syntax there real so for I was using an
on this function right here and you have
to put your parameters here and an arrow
function and this is a body of my
function okay I was just using your on
subtext refresh can't find variable view
and come back the X we just forgot to
import it here so import this is in our
connect so right here we're in this
index file and we're getting the view
component our view components right here
has our counter increment counter so we
need to give it increment counter and
counter so to do that our index right
here we're connecting those and we're
getting the counter from here and we're
getting the increment counter from our
action creators and actually it's going
to be actions act increment counter so
actions we just need to wrap it one more
time
there we go now let's try refreshing
that okay hello world crashed refresh
and the find is not a function and we
just crash the amp all together let's
just try rerunning it react native run
android and it could be something wrong
with my counter here combined reducers
MIP combining reducer and we're
importing reducers in our store right
yep so reducers and we're grabbing the
index root reducer and reacts my default
that looks pretty good
okay so it's crashing because combined
reducers oh that's from redux not react
Redux and so i can rerun the app so
combined reducers is from redux out
reactor redux
I'm thinking now it should build okay
see notice how when I get the state or
redux door messed up it just crashes the
app all together we get an error screen
it crashes the whole thing so this is I
just rebuilding the app right now if we
come back over here we can see the
progress of it up in there just finished
building okay and we can see it here
cool when I was here a little zero so I
click this you're going to see it
incrementing up so that is how you add
Redux and with your react native app so
now you can add more advanced actions
and reducers and make your app larger
and more things to it so I hope this
helps and you can now add your own Redux
reducers to your react native apps and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
