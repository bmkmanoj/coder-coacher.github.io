accounts right here Bob - and Bob three
and I want to invite Bob three to my GG
team right now it doesn't show me the
little button even though Bob two
actually created the team so we're gonna
be fixing that in today's video now one
way I was showing in the last video to
do this is to create an admin field
right here make this a boolean but I
said that was pretty hacky but thinking
about it more I think it works out
pretty well because what this field
represents is whoever fetches this team
object whether they're the admin or not
so we're gonna fix it so it works with
fetching the admin here which is really
easy all we have to do is and our user
over here is say raw true and the reason
why we have to do Rahl is true is our
team does not have a admin field we're
actually game admin field from our
number object or a member model so we
just put R all true so it doesn't pass
back ass equalized object but we just
get the JSON data back okay so now we're
going to fetch our team's and one of the
fields will be the admin field which we
get because we're selecting all the
fields from teams and members also as a
quick sidenote
visual studio code their new version
lets you have two folders open to
projects so I have the client and the
server out in this single window so now
I no longer have to switch between
multiple okay so now and then I'm just
on the front-end here I'm just gonna
grab the admin alright so there's no
error here so we were able to fetch it
good the next thing we want to do is
actually determine whether there's an
admin or not and right now we are I'll
show you how we're doing that so we can
close the server and that's gonna be
over here in our routes and actually I
think it's in her sidebar container
because we're if we're passing in the
team and then we're passing in his owner
and his owner we were checking against
the token that was stored but we don't
have to do that so his owner here is
gonna be
Advan and we can get rid of that and we
actually don't even need to decode this
token to get the username anymore
because we are grabbing the username
from me so we can pass in the username
here as a prop to our sidebar
and we can delete all this so in our
view team over here we don't have to
console.log me anymore so one of the
things we want is teams and then the
username and the username we're gonna
pass to the sidebar over here so me oops
username is equal to username alright
cool so let's see alright now we're able
to see this invite people link here
because we're that happen so let's
invite a person so I'm invite Bob 3f Bob
calm copy that
add the user cannot add members to the
team all right so this is something we
have to fix so if we look at our
back-end here so our server and we go to
our resolver where we're doing this so
is in the users now I should be in the
team's add team member okay so the way
we're doing this is we're first grabbing
the team and basically checking if
they're the owner of the team but right
now we no longer storing the information
there we're storing it in the data or
our members table so we need to fetch
that instead so we have the team ID and
we have the user ID so instead of
fetching this we're gonna grab the
member so models dot member dot find one
where the team ID is equal to the team
ID passed and the user ID is equal to
user ID okay
so that should and then we're gonna pass
the member promise here so member
promise and we'll grab the member so
here we need to check whether the member
is an admin so member dot admin so if
they're not an admin then we display
this hermès error message otherwise we
can continue and then we're gonna create
a new member based on the user that we
want to add so let's try this again
so I have a user and awesome it looks
like it worked okay
so if i refresh over here we should see
hey look we are part of GG now and Bob 3
is not an admin so we don't see the
invite people link perfect and we don't
see the create channels link either and
now they can talk to they each other if
they want to that still works just fine
so cool I think we got everything
working let's actually look create a
channel I don't remember if that still
works so let's do a random channel
create and it doesn't look like it got
created let's refresh nope
so I believe we're doing the same thing
where we're checking if they're an owner
so if we look at the channel so team
notice how we're doing checking if the
team is an owner so instead of doing
that we're gonna just check number so
remember and we're going to say if
member dot admin so if they're not an
admin and the way we're finding it is
we're gonna grab team ID is equal to the
args passed in and then the user ID is
equal to user ID and user ID is coming
from the context ok so let's give this a
try again creating the channel so random
create and cool our random channels
created after your refresh here we can
see it hey awesome so that works nicely
so we don't want to now come back to
what we were working on before and that
was in her back end that was locking
down the subscriptions in point here so
now that we have our member object with
we can check whether they're an admin or
not we can fetch that user now I don't
want to put this logic here like I
originally said and the reason for that
is we could have multiple subscriptions
and some subscriptions we want them to
be logged in or we want them to be the
team member whereas some other
subscriptions we might want to open it
up so instead of putting the logic here
where we really want to put it is in our
crane subscription so if we come over
here oops that's our schema so here with
this with filter the first thing is a
function and this function is just like
any other function we have over here or
a resolver it has a parent args and
context so what we can do is pass to
this context whether they're a user and
let the the resolver itself decide
whether who they want to allow access to
so let's close some of these windows we
don't need you don't need that anymore
that we only really care about index all
right so instead of throwing an error
whether we don't get a user anymore
we're not going to do that at all
so here we're just going to return an
empty object and here we're gonna return
a user so I'm gonna say deconstruct the
user and return the user and I'm gonna
do the same thing here so return user is
equal to new tokens dot user okay and
then here I'm going to just return empty
object and that's unreachable code so I
don't need it then so now notice how
we're not throwing any errors in our on
connect and said all we're doing is
passing a user object which I this is
basically like context and whether we
need it or not and we're also gonna pass
in models so I sent models so models is
coming from up here
if you remembers we're importing it and
that's similar to how we're doing the
context here we're gonna creating a
context for our subscriptions so now in
the subscription resolver I can check
whether I have a user and then decide
whether I want to allow only users or if
anyone can so my message over here I can
actually use the requires off if I want
to so requires off dot create resolver
and what that will do is that will stop
anyone from logging in that's not a user
right so perfect so that was easy and
we're able to reuse this that we've
reused and now here we don't just want
to stop them from logging in if they are
a user so we have models and user here
we also want to stop them if they are
not a part of the team alright if I'm
logged in I shouldn't be able to listen
to messages from teams that I'm not a
part of so what you can do
is return this at the bottom but here
you can do check if part of the team
right
oops um looks like okay we need to move
that here there you go and I'm gonna
just put a console dot log here that way
I can save the code without it
reformatting so here we want to do it
basically check whether the team the
user is part of the team so right now we
currently have in our args if we look at
our schema we are passing a channel ID
and we also have the user's ID here so
really what we want to check is whether
they are a member of the current team
but we don't have a team ID but we have
a channel ID so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna first grab the team so I'm
gonna make this an async function and
we're gonna say Const team or sorry not
team channel is equal to a weight models
dot channel dot find one and we're gonna
say we're and then the ID is equal to
channel ID so we're getting the channel
which we got here and then we know your
user ID here and then from the channel
if we remember one of our fields of
channel and is a team ID so what we can
do is we can search a user so we're
gonna say kant's member is equal to
eight models dot member dot find one and
we're gonna say where and we're gonna
say team ID is equal to the ID that this
channel was a part of so channel dot
team ID and then user ID matches the
current user so we're checking whether
the current user is part of the team
which they're requesting channel access
to or listening to all messages
happen in that channel so now we're just
gonna do an if statement if not member
we're gonna throw new air and we're just
gonna say you have to be a member of the
team to subscribe to its messages and
let's double quote this there alright so
let's see this is our log for our server
doesn't look like we're getting airs now
let's make sure these guys can still
subscribe okay so it's refresh refresh
make sure we don't get any airs let's
look in the logs here unhandled so async
next is not a function oh are we
returning this okay good we're returning
this I'm thinking it's not liking this
create resolver so I'm gonna get rid of
that real quick and make sure see what
it doesn't like so refresh async
iterator is not a function so we're
getting an error here so what I'm gonna
do is I'm just going to comment out what
our code be added and see if that works
that way we can see whether our codes
causing it or if it's something else
okay so something else so it's possibly
the only thing we changed is we added
stuff here and we also added stuff here
so one of the two is messed up so let's
figure that out
okay I figured out what was going wrong
I did a little bit more research on why
we're getting this error because I
wasn't expecting this to fail at all so
it says async dot next is not a function
and the thing that's causing the problem
it's not what we have here we can keep
all this in fact we can get rid of this
comment too the problem is with art
async it doesn't want us do an async
code so as soon as I get rid of that it
works so refresh works just fine and we
can just test it high to see so it
doesn't want us doing async code and
this little bit right here before we
give the async iterator and it looks
like just by default doesn't allow async
code and we need to do async code to
fetch our channel and member so this is
where we're gonna stop the video I need
to do some research actually how to do
async stuff before I subscribe if you
know how to do this I'd love to know
please leave a comment below about how
to do this I was thinking it was gonna
be super easy and I could just treat it
like a regular resolver like I did down
here I had no idea that I was pickier
with subscriptions so do let me know if
you guys know how to fix this otherwise
we'll figure it out tomorrow thank you
guys for watching and as always the code
will be up on github
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
