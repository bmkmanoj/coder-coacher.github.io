subscribe function to work with async
code getting fetching our channel and
remember before subscribing so I'm just
gonna leave it for now and then come
back to it if I figure it out now if you
really wanted to get this to work
you can do the authentication and the on
connect and the fetching of the user and
making sure they're on the team but for
now I'm just gonna leave it and come
back to it and what I want to work on
now is sending direct messages because I
should see a list of my team members
here or I should be able to direct
message slack bot and user 1 and chat
with them so that's what we're gonna be
adding so the first thing we're going to
do is we're going to create another
model so we already have a message model
so I could have put it here but I
figured it'd be easier to just create a
separate model to keep them separate
because we don't have a channel ID it's
with our direct message it's slightly
different so let's create a new one
called direct message j/s and I don't
know if I want to camelcase this or what
let's just call it that let's just say
direct message like that I didn't know
how to
since this model has two words in it how
to capitalize it we'll just do it like
that so I want to paste this stuff in
here so we're gonna have a text this is
gonna be direct message and I'm gonna
use an underscore for the table name and
then
and we're gonna have a text just like
before and let's change it oops
change that to direct message all right
so now direct message belongs to a user
and there's gonna be a two and they're
from so name two and we don't really
need two camel cases since it's only one
word here that and same thing here and
but this is gonna be a from okay so
here's the user who sent the message
here's the user that it's sent to so for
example Bob three would be from he was
sending a message to Bob four and two
would be the receiver of the message and
we could may even make this more clear
by saying sender and receiver so we have
a message we have someone who sent it
and the receiver of the message so
that's our new model now because we made
this change since this is a totally new
chant table I believe sequel eyes will
create the table for us we don't have to
drop the database or anything but we'll
check the database to double check and
make sure so I'm gonna say direct
message and we're going to import that
all right
give that a save now I'm gonna come over
here and type P sequel and connect to
our slack and I'm just gonna look looks
like everything built okay and I'm gonna
describe the direct message all right so
direct messages has text and as a sender
and receiver perfect so it added to
their table okay so as long as the the
model hasn't existed before it's okay to
make changes and all you don't have to
drop everything so now in our schema
over here we can create a new one called
direct messages
jas and we export default and so we're
gonna have a query type query and type
mutation so we're gonna create direct
message and this should return a direct
message so type and we should actually
just kind of copy how we're doing this
for message because it's gonna be the
exact same thing so I'll paste that in
here
alright so direct message it's gonna
have an ID text it's gonna be a sender
who's a user and there's gonna be a
receiver who's a user and I think we
only really need the the receiver just
the user ID of the receiver so I'm gonna
make this an int so this is really the
receiver ID but we're just gonna call it
receiver so it matches with our database
and then the sender I think we're
actually gonna need to get the ID for it
and actually in our database hopefully
your he made the database so we'd have
to drop it we should really call this
receiver ID yeah why don't we do that so
now you make it
this makes it's better it's better type
wise to call this name this a receiver
receiver ID and we'll do the same thing
here
sorryi and now we have to drop the
database name field but there's not
really any important data in there
anyway okay so now in our schema over
here we can say receiver ID
well we actually need the sender okay we
weren't worried about subscriptions at
first but we will need to add them we're
gonna just call this direct messages
given a so they get the direct messages
we really just need the receiver ID
because we know the sender ID cuz that's
who you are
or should we actually we should get the
direct messages based on who the yeah
who the receiver is and the receiver
should be you
so actually we don't need to pass in any
parameters to our direct messages we're
basically just gonna ever get the direct
messages for you as a user okay so and
then we're gonna return the direct
message and array of direct messages
alright and here's our create message
this is gonna be create direct message
and now we don't care about the channel
ID it's gonna be receiver ID and then
text and we're gonna boolean okay I
think this looks good for our backend
let's start working on our front-end so
on a client we have a message container
over here now our message container can
either take a right now it's taking a
channel ID and it's fetching the
messages for the channel so we kind of
want to reuse this because we basically
want the same code I'll just I see some
areas I want to make sure the WebSockets
still going okay cool we want to reuse
this component here but when I click on
a user for example a user one we're not
going to have
a channel ID so I think we're gonna have
to change the URL have a separate URL
for this and then grab the user ID so
I'm gonna create a separate route here
first in our index so this will be a
private route kind of like how this
we're gonna have basically a user who
you can chat with so we're gonna say
it's gonna be an extension of you team
will say so view team and actually we
need to match this above so this is
gonna be a user and we're gonna be
looking for the team ID so we need the
team ID in the URL and then so we know
which actually I think we need to change
that in our back-end code as well
because a direct message we need to know
which team they're part of as well so
let's add one more so a models dot team
and we're gonna call this team ID okay
so the direct message it happens within
a team between two users so we just add
that on and we're gonna have to drop
this database in a second we need to do
force true so actually let's just do
that right now before I forget so at the
bottom force true
give that a save and then I may get rid
of it and then our reef is to restart
cool and then give us save without it ok
so back over here so we need a team ID
and then we need the we have the
receiver ID we need to have basically
the other user so we're just gonna call
this user ID and a team ID is mandatory
and a user ID is mandatory we need to
have both of those things to know how to
fetch the messages all right so we're
just gonna still gonna show the view
team component but now we're gonna have
a both this should have going here but
now we know we have a user ID and a team
ID ok so now in our view team component
I actually don't know if this will work
left to see we'll have a third prop so
prams we have a team ID channel ID and a
user ID
so first we'll check if we're loading
because if we're loading we don't want
to do anything then we're gonna check if
we have a user ID because if we have a
user ID we don't want to display some
things and you know what I actually
think this will be easiest if we make a
new component now that I think of it
because I think mashing it in here we're
gonna over complicate things than we
need to be so let's just create a
totally new route called direct message
dot Jas
we'll say direct messages such as and
I'm actually just gonna copy view team
because a lot of you team we're gonna be
using own we can get rid of this other
props too so copy view team pasted into
direct messages and then I route over
here we're gonna say direct messages is
the component and we just need to import
that copy that so direct messages and
then over here so we're gonna have a
user ID so because we don't have a
channel ID we don't have to open up a
channel so I'm gonna get rid of that and
maybe in this particular one so we have
a meet query that we're grabbing and
yeah no this is fine we're just not
gonna we're not gonna select a channel
to be open so close that close that
close that so here we're only displaying
if we have a channel we can get rid of
that so on this page oops we're gonna
show always
all right so now we need to think about
how we want to do this so our send
message is also basically hard-coded to
expect a channel name and a channel ID
and let's see this is gonna be our some
message so I think what we should do is
actually move up our responsibilities so
right now we have basically hard-coded
that send message here is going to
basically create a message to a channel
instead I want to move this up so
instead I'm gonna basically in my send
message here I'm gonna pass a submit and
actually instead of channel channel name
we're gonna pass in placeholder right
we'll comment these out for now so send
message I wanted to say on submit so on
submit for send message we call this
create mutation so I'm gonna move that
over and actually call it here that way
we can reuse the send message across
both components and now the placeholder
here we're just gonna show the current
the user ID I guess for now that's a
really bad place holder oops
we should show something better like
that users a name or something
alright so interesting message here I'm
gonna take away this this guy and I'm
gonna put it here so from graph QL I'm
gonna grab compose because we're gonna
compose these two guys together I'm
gonna say compose
and compose just wraps all the queries
here so I'm gonna grab that kind of how
we were doing here I'm gonna paste that
in here and now we don't need compose
here area and I think I I killed one
thing I think we don't need that one get
rid of a comma the gate we're just
getting an error cuz yeah and then shin
so if I move this up should be good yeah
now I'm gonna move this guy over here as
well so that's our mutation that we want
to run except we don't want to run
create message we want to run create
direct message and that's what we're
gonna be changing so the rest we can
pretty much keep the same just instead
of running mutate here we're gonna say a
weight and then we're going to call the
on submit function so on submit an on
submit is what we pass inter direct
message here so on submit
on submit and we just need to pass in
the values which values I'm actually
just gonna send values dot message so it
has the text that it wants to send ok so
over here we need to handle this now now
I actually want to fix a view team first
so now this guy is gonna handle the
submission so instead of passing in a
channel name we're gonna say placeholder
and then over here I'm gonna save
placeholder and change that here so now
it's generic and I'm just gonna copy
this mutation cuz this is the mutation
we want to run over here and I'm gonna
come pose like I was over there alright
and we're just gonna run that query or
that mutation so you can have multiple
graph QLS on the same component like
we're doing here and we just need to a
comma here so now instead of passing the
channel ID in here I'm gonna create an
odd submit and what this function is
gonna do is it's gonna take text and all
it's going to do is it now has a mutate
prop itself so up here I can say mutate
and I'm gonna call mutate
and this is gonna be an async function
and I'm just gonna return we can return
or we can just await the mutate and
we're gonna pass in variables our text
is gonna be the text we get here and
then the channel ID is gonna be channel
ID and that's what we're passing here
all right
and then what's wrong with our gql oh we
just needed to find it which I believe
where are we getting gql from paste that
over here so now we're basically taking
away graph QL from this and we can get
rid of that so this is a generic
component now and we can take that away
so now my direct messages and my view T
view team component can use it now we
made a lot of changes let's import gql
from graphic UL tag well let's make sure
this component still works how we expect
it to so now we're going to be whenever
we submit we call this on submit
function in our component and then we
mutate here so now we're gonna run a
different mutation in our direct
messages over here for now I'm just
gonna say that and we'll come back to it
put a comma there as well so we're gonna
come back and fix direct messages I just
want to see if we broke absolutely
everything so I'm gonna come up register
and create a new user
okay so Bob Bob calm and copy that down
all right so we were able to create a
new user now let's login with this guy
Bam Bam and let's create a team all
right
and if I go over to view team we should
get redirected to this good so now I'm
gonna say team one and create that cool
and we see team one here everything
created ok now I should be able to type
a message hello hit enter and notice it
works exactly the same way as before
which is perfect we just moved the
onsubmit like I showed you so now in a
direct message over here what we'll do
continue in the next video is our
onsubmit here instead of calling this
create message mutation we can call
create direct message mutation so that's
it for this video guys I'll push up the
code and we'll complete our direct
message tomorrow so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
