silent auction app so on the left here I
have an Android emulator and on the
right here I have a iOS simulator so
this is the same app running on both of
these phones and you notice they look
slightly different that's because this
was built with native base which styles
both for Android and iOS so same code
but they look slightly different they're
using the native components and I just
want to do a little demo of how
everything works and what's going on
here
so first is the main screen we have all
our bids you'll notice how these are
ticking down this is a timer when the
bid expires and you can see who made the
bid so the user Bob did this is
currently the iOS user I'm logged in so
this was also there's a log user system
for this this is the Android user you
notice the Android user is the top
bidder right now but I could click on
this icon and you'll know Hawaii
animation there the iOS is now the top
bidder and you notice how it also
changes on the Android view and the
number here changed as well five more
dollars now to show that they bid and
that's because it's using WebSockets so
everything is happening in real time so
I could go bid on this water bottle and
then Android would be the top bidder and
then you'd see five more dollars here
and you'd see the both of the same thing
on both screens so that's the really
cool thing about WebSockets is all this
is happening and this can spread to
multiple phones it doesn't have to be
just two and so that's how the bidding
works there's also some filtering here
so both shows both complete and
incomplete
Syd's and then complete just shows all
the bids that are basically have been
already completed and over there's a
couple other screens so we can add
different bids on that this little plus
button goes here click on that it opens
up this screen which I can then fill out
information for the bid so maybe I want
to sell a cat and let's sell my cat for
there we go that's all my cat for $75
and then I can select when the auction
expires so here I'm going to say
tomorrow Friday hit confirm and then I
can submit that and then you can see it
adds cat here to the screen over here
and biosimilars being a little slow
coming back to the screen after it's
done and then so the other things that's
pretty much it of how the auctions works
on the other notable things is you can
login with different users and signup
that's what these two tabs are doing
here
so you can login with different accounts
and create different users if that is
the silent auction at all this code is
on github it is open source if you'd
like to take a look at it and if you
have been following along with the
YouTube videos I also did a YouTube
playlist if you'd like to see how this
is ade it'll be linked in the
description below so thank you guys for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
