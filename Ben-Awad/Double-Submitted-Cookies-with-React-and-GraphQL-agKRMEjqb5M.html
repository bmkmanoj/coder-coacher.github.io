up double submitted cookies this is an
authentication method where you store
the JWT token in both local storage and
in the cookies I'm going to start by
doing a little demonstration of how it
works and then I'll show you the code
that powers this so here's my cookies
and you can see there's nothing in it
right now and in my local storage it's
blank
what I'm gonna do here is and I'm just
going to log in and when I log in you'll
notice we get the token and refresh
token filled for the local host or local
storage and in our cookies we have it
and if you were to look at these values
they would be the exact same the one
that we're storing in the cookies versus
the local storage and that's the idea
then if I go to some authenticated route
like slash book one what will happened
is I'll send both the tokens from the
cookies and the local storage so if I go
to network I can see here's my request
here I can see here's the request
headers I'm sending the Refresh token
and the token but I'm also sending the
cookie which has the token and the
Refresh token in it so they're both
being sent and the reason for doing this
is for example if I'm like some
malicious JavaScript and I come over
here and I come to local storage and
notice how that we get I am a book here
it rendered just fine we authenticated
okay if I'm some malicious JavaScript
and I go over here and I have access and
I mess up your token so I'm gonna mess
up the token here or maybe I don't mess
up your token but I changed the value
and say you're an admin or something or
I change what the payload of the token
is or try to mess it up or maybe I don't
even like supply a token and refresh
token at all these are not given then
what will happen when i refresh the page
is we'll actually get an error so a page
not found in our console it says not
authenticated and the reason for that is
because the tokens differ between the
cookie and the local storage and the
basic idea here is every time we do a
request we send both
the cookie tokens and the local storage
tokens and the server compares the
values and if they're not the same then
we don't accept it basically so now I'll
show you the code that has this working
so here is the client-side code this is
the react code that powers the website
and you can see I'm using graph QL here
and the cookies part is super easy this
is the only option that I have to do
when I create the network interface I
just say options credentials include and
then I can set and send cookies using
graph QL and using the Apollo client and
all the work for cookies is done on the
server side so I don't have to do
anything and here this is how I'm doing
local storage every time I send a
request all I'm doing is I'm prepend the
X token and X refresh token to the
header and I'm just grabbing the values
from local storage and then after I get
a request I'm just checking whether they
send back a refresh token and refresh
token and if they do I just set that in
local storage and that's it that's going
long that's all it's going happening on
the client side now I'll show you the
server so here is the server code here
is my function called add user so this
runs on every request and this is
middleware and I show you I'll show you
guys that right here and before we
actually get into add user I guess I
could talk about the cores and the
cookie parser so cookie parser is
something that I got right here and all
this does is it lets you get the cookies
from a request and then lets you check
what the values are so you know how we
were sending them here it just like
parses them out and lets you use them in
Express and I'll show you where that's
happening so that is a library that just
parses the cookies for you that's what's
going on here and you'll notice how in
the cores I have to set the credentials
true and I have to say what the origin
is and the origin their matches up to
this right here and the reason for that
is just to get cookies working you have
to do say what the origin it's coming
from and the credentials
and then we are parsing the cookie and
then add user' so now how add users
working here is I'm grabbing the token
from the header this is X token so
that's coming from local storage I first
checked if there's a token you know
given if not we just go to the next
thing then I see if I was given a cookie
so I grabbed the cookie token and I
check whether I was given a cookie token
if I was not I say next
and I also check whether the token is
equal to the cookie token and if they're
not equal
I say well this is a bad request next
and then here I go ahead and verify the
JWT token since the tokens match we've
gotten this far in the the logic so the
tokens are good and if I can't verify
the tokens
I read the Refresh token and again just
checking whether the Refresh token is
there if not we go to the next and if
the Refresh - or the cookie refresh
token was given as well I check that
against the Refresh token and if they're
not equal I return and then down here
let's say this all went correctly to
refresh tokens what I'm doing is I'm
creating new tokens and then after I
create the new tokens this is how I'm
passing it back to local storage I'm
putting in exto context refresh token
header and then I'm reading the header
in so that's what these guys are doing
here just setting that and then to set a
cookie with express I'm doing it right
here I'm doing response cookie and I'm
naming that the cookie called token and
I'm putting the token in there and then
I'm giving it a max age the max age here
is a week and that is just matching what
I have for off so off over here I had
the Refresh token lasting seven days so
I was having the cookie match the same
length of time okay I'm also doing HTTP
only and the the reason for that is that
way if I have malicious JavaScript as
you know changing the token and local
storage
I don't want it changing the cookie
value and so when I do HTTP only
JavaScript on your website cannot change
the value
of the token so it's very important to
keeping this secure is having that HTP
only so that's the reason why that's
there and that's what makes this whole
thing work and I'm doing the same thing
for the token and the Refresh token so
anytime we need to refresh the token I
send back new tokens to the user so
that's how that's working and the only
other thing I'm doing here is in the
resolver when the user logs in I'm
returning the token and refresh token so
they can add it to local storage but I'm
also setting the cookie as well and this
is the same logic as well so just the
response I'm doing dot cookie and I have
the Refresh token and the token as well
and passing it in so that that's it guys
for this video the main thing is just to
check whether the cookie matches the
local storage token and those match up
and if they don't something went wrong
and you just say they're not
authenticated for me or I'm not saying
not authenticated is I don't actually
throw any errors here you know so just
say next this is where I add the user in
so if they didn't supply a token I just
assume that they're not a user on the
website and they haven't logged in which
is fine so that is how I'm doing double
submit cookies on the code is in the
description below i have a link to
github where you can check this out for
both the front end and back end and see
how this is working and try it out if
you want to so thank you guys for
watching and let me know if you have any
questions in the comments below
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
