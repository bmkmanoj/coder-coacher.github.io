want to show you how to create a signup
page to add new users to the feathers
Gaea j/s server that we made using we're
gonna create a form and react to post
over to that so the first thing I'm
gonna do is create something in a router
so create a sign-up page so I'm just
gonna do slash sign up
and this will be a sign up page let's do
the lowercase you
so sign up page this is a component
we're about to make so open up the
components folder and create a signup
page component
and we're gonna get button
form from semantic and this is gonna
work just like how we did the ad recipe
page we're just going to create a form
and then create an action that the form
will call when the form is submitted and
that action will call a saga the saga
will then call that API and that's how
it's going to work so it's a creator
constructor props and
okay super and then we're gonna give it
an initial state with just a username
password
password
and we're gonna have a handle submit so
let's go ahead and bind that
whole fill in the handle submit button
in a second
the first felt the render
and before I forget export defaults sign
a page okay so we're gonna create a form
and then on submit we're gonna call a
handle submit
get a form field
this will be right username
or
email
and explore case Oh
now our input name it's gonna be
username unchanged
we're gonna capture the value as it
changes in the input field so this
thought sets state
and set the username to target dot value
and of course as the value changes we
want to update the state or not update
the state but I have this state I
reflect and then put itself then we'll
just have a placeholder email close the
input and the password is just about the
same thing so copy that
yeah let's uppercase email
so I'll tell this password
the one other thing is we're going to do
the type as password
that way it will cover up the input
field as you type
and placeholder we don't have to worry
about well I guess we could put password
and let's capitalize it capitalize our
place alert email and then we just need
to sign up button button type equals
submit
sign up
okay so what would we like to happen
when we click this button handle submit
will be called and handle submit we want
to just call sign up so first thing
prevent default you got prevent default
and then we want to call a action which
we will create in a second called sign
up and we'll pass in the username and
password
and then we'll reset the form by saying
a username and password
- laughing
okay so the next thing is to create the
action
so we're gonna open up the actions
folder and go into action creators and
just add one so call this try call it
sign up use your name and password so
username password and this is called
sign up requested now we'll go into our
saga and then here we're just going to
add in our sign up
saga so try sign up we're gonna need the
feathers app this will tell us whether
were you successful or not let's go
ahead and log if we are because we're
gonna assume we're successful right now
I'm not doing any air handling for
simplicity's sake and you know what we
don't even need to do anything if we're
just gonna redirect assuming we're
successful when we sign up we would like
to go to the login page which we
actually have not made yet so for now
we'll just push it there and before I
forget let's go back to the index and
just create the login page
that way it'll work
and then let's go and add that component
real quick so I'm going to copy the
signup page
and now we're gonna create a new
component which will be login page and
it's just gonna be a dummy page for now
it'll just be having h1 that'll be a
login page and we'll fill this out in
the next video the login page I just
want to have something here for now that
way we can see it as the saga finishes
that it does push to the login page
now
let's do a login saga or signup saga not
not applauding and this is looking for
sign up requested
passing in
the feathers app and we're going to call
a tri sign up and then we just need to
add it to our fork and that should be
good except for we need to call our tri
signup function
and we'll create that next that'll be in
our API so let's just make sure
everything's good so when our saga is
called we're gonna be watching for the
sign up saga or sign up saga is looking
for sign up requests when when it gets
one and calls the try sign up function
up it looks like try we have try sign up
twice so just call this sign up
okay so once it gets to try sign up
it'll try to sign up passing in up only
need a pass and the username and
password and then it'll tell us whether
we create a user okay and then we'll log
it and then we'll go to the login page
so now if we're actually you're doing
the application we would create the user
and then we could login with it okay
cool
now let's go ahead and go to our
services API and actually create that
function so it's gonna be kind of
similar to this one because we're going
to be creating a user this time instead
of a recipe so we call it signup it was
gonna get an app and a email and
password
feathers uses email not use your name so
we'll switch it now it's going to use
the users and we're gonna pass and
so we're going to use the user service
which feathers makes for us and then
we're going to create the user passing
in the email and the password and then
we're just going to log this data okay
if we do everything correctly should be
working okay so if we switch I'm going
to switch tabs to the feathers backend
and I'm just going to look at the data
tab and look at their users so right now
I have no users but if you go to our
signup page looks like I didn't render
let's see what our problem is form is
not defined up looks like I just need to
do capital form so if we go back draw a
component and we go to a signup page we
just need to uppercase form right there
now if you refresh it we don't need this
preserve vlog anymore
looks like giving our problem type
should in valley especially a string for
class but got undefined
check the render method
Oh capital F
after any easier
okay so we're getting that to render now
thank goodness now let's go ahead and
try an email so test test comm signup
takes us to the login page nice now
let's go back to our feathers data see
if we add in our user and awesome so our
test user has been added to our data
excellent
so we are able to now sign up and add
users the next step is to be able to log
in and authenticate users which we'll do
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
