our messages for the channel right away
so if we have a ton of messages it could
take a really long time
I look at the scroll bar I added a ton
of messages and this will not scale at
all as we have thousands and thousands
of messages and more people are chatting
it's just gonna grow and if we are
loading them on the initial load it will
not scale at all so we're gonna change
that and incrementally load the messages
and really a lot of time you only need
to see the messages the most recent
messages and then you might just need to
scroll up a little bit so there's really
no reason to load these messages at the
very top anyway that are from years ago
so that's we're gonna do today is add
pagination so we're just incrementally
loading the messages and not loading
them all at once now before we get into
that I accidentally broke public
channels this is me creating a channel
and you notice it says missing field
direct message or DM and that's because
in our ad channel modal in our
optimistic response we did not know DM
existed because we just added that so
now we have to say DM is false because
we're not doing a direct message Channel
and our we know this because we're in
our add channel modal we can only do DM
channels from our direct message modal
and then this is only for the optimistic
response I fix the first warning the
second warning is because our create
channel does not have a direct message
field in it and that's because we're not
selecting that field here's our create
channel mutation
we just need to grab DM and then we can
close that because that should solve our
issue let's add our Channel
create another public one pub two and
pub two is good to go alright now let's
start on our pagination the first I'm
going to do is limit how many messages
we're loading at first so this is in our
message resolver
and here's our message is query and I'm
gonna just set a limit so we're only
gonna say I don't know 35 this is
something number you can play with see
what works well for you and you can
either hard code it like I am or if you
want to you can pass this in as a
parameter to your query so now we should
get a much smaller scroll bar if we
refresh the page perfect and we have a
good amount of messages but not too many
so now I want to be able to load more
right as I get more let's say I get to
the top and I want to see further back
so at first we are gonna add a button
and we're gonna then and add three
different types of pagination so today
we're gonna be using a button because
that's very simple so I'm just gonna add
a button to the top here and right now
we're gonna just say on click it's gonna
be a load more and for now I'm just
gonna console.log a load more and this
button is coming from semantic UI so
today we're just gonna use a button and
we're gonna do the simplest pagination
and that is with cursor or not cursors
offset and limit and then next time
we're gonna be doing cursors and then
we're gonna do infinite scroll and where
I could just scroll up and I'll just
keep loading so you can kind of see the
different ways you can just accomplish
the same thing and see which one you
like the best to use in your projects
okay so perfect we only see the load
more button as we get to the top so how
are we actually going to load more items
well here's how apollo recommends doing
that there is a fetch more function that
they give to us where we can pass in new
variables for example an offset and then
we can update the query afterwards so
that's exactly what we're going to be
doing so for us we want to keep track of
the current position and we could either
in our state up here keep the cursor
position or the offset position I mean
or we could just get the length of the
items and that totally works too so I
think I'm gonna do it based on the items
so let's change this here so here I want
to run this stop props dot data fetch
more so this is the function that's
coming from graph QL and we're going to
be fetching more of this query of our
down here I believe yep of our message
is query now we actually need to change
our query to allow us to pass in an
offset so I'm going to say offset is an
int and offset takes the offset
parameter and now at first the offset is
going to be 0 so offset 0 and we need to
change our back-end to allow us to pass
an offset and now I'm doing variables
wrong here we need to pass it right here
props is in the options so like that
and we get rid of that give that safe
okay cool so we're passing the channel
ID in the offset of zero so I'll get the
first chunk and then variables policy
this all looks good and then up here and
our fetch more we're just gonna
basically change the offset of that what
we're fetching so variables and our
offset is gonna differ now let's go to
our schema though and get that working
so here we go so our message is schema
we want now I want to take an offset
which is an integer and in our resolvers
oops the resolver is over here I now
have offset and offset you can actually
directly pass in to find all it's
expecting offset and that's just how how
many items ahead it's gonna grab so
we're limiting to 30 and then we can
grab more further up in the list if we
want to so we want to keep the same
channel ID so that's gonna be this stop
props channel ID and then here we're
going to add a offset and this is gonna
be the length of our data so this dot
props dot data actually not yeah it's
data dot and it's messages yeah there we
go
so that's how many messages we have so
if we have five messages then we'd like
to get the fifth message onward and so
forth so we want to say dot length and
we might need to do plus or minus 1/2
this I believe it should work just like
that though but we'll see if we get any
problems with key errors
okay so now we have to do this update
query so let's copy that so how this
work because it takes the previous
result and what we fetched and combines
them together so here we're saying if we
didn't get any more results we just
returned otherwise the are returning
thing combined and save that ok so how
are we combining ours
well it's quite easy we're gonna keep
the previous result all the stuff I had
in it and then messages is gonna be
equal to our array of previous messages
and then we're just gonna add in the new
messages we just fetched so fetch more
result thought messages and that's it so
let's take a look at this and see how we
did and did I mess something up I hope
that should be a semicolon not a comma
ok so I scroll up to the top our last
message up here is hey click load more
and now I see Teemo head and I can go up
further and I can just load more make it
load more and it looks like it's working
ok I can load more oh whoa nothing's
happening anymore so we'll eventually
get to a point where we can't load any
more items so all we need to do is not
sure this little button right because we
don't want them to spam us so one way to
do this is to just set in our state
stay and keep a variable for this so has
more items it's gonna be equal to true
and so we only want to show our button
if this dot state that has more items
otherwise we don't want to show our
button
okay so we have fetch more and how are
we gonna know whether we've reached the
end of our list
well we're fetching in increments of 35
so if fetch more result is less than 35
where we know we're at the end so we can
just say if fetch more results dot
message dot length is less than 35 we
are gonna not return anything but set
the state this dot set state and we're
gonna say what is our what we call it
has more items has more items this false
so how this works is I'm gonna be
fetching in increments of 35 right I'll
get 35 then I'll get 35 and then when I
reach the end of my list I might only
have 23 left and then I'll be fetching
zeros after that right I can wait till I
fetch 0 if I don't know how many like
how what are my increments of fetching
are then I could just say 35 35 23 wait
for the zero to hit and say when this is
equal to zero
like that but this works a little bit
better because we can anticipate where
at the end of the list earlier and also
that's something you can add to the
server-side portion for you to return
back when you're at the end of the list
so we'll load more this should be
message is when your ads into the list
your server knows and you can pass that
back by using for example count or
something okay so load more load even
more and bam now we don't see the load
more button anymore perfect so we know
we loaded all of our messages so that's
it for this video guys there is one
little annoying thing going on and I
don't know if you guys noticed that when
I load more it bounces the scrollbar to
the very bottom I'm actually not sure
quite sure how to fix that for this I
don't know if we have to automatically
move the scroll bar up or what but this
gives you an idea of how you can add
offset pagination this is the easiest
way to do it in the next video we'll be
doing cursor based which has better
performance but is a little bit more
involved to set up not too bad but you
saw how easy it was to do offset and
limit so that's it for this video guys
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
