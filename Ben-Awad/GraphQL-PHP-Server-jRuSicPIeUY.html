you today and I was requested to see if
I could set up a graph QL server with
data loader in PHP so what I'm gonna
show you is how I set this up I got some
code working and as you see right here
here's the graph QL schema now I want
something super simple but at the same
time we could see how it worked with
data loader so I have a person which has
a pet so when I use this query get
people it's gonna return a array of
persons and what we want to happen is
each time we're going to get a person so
today there's two people then the first
person is going to have a pet and the
second person is also gonna have a pet
so it's going to be two queries so we're
gonna use data loader so we don't have
to do two queries we'll only do one but
we'll talk more about that in a second
so this code is on github if you want to
check it out but I'm just gonna be
walking you through it and an index dot
PHP this is where everything all begins
so I'm using two libraries well really
three libraries this over blog one which
is for data loader Seiler which is
really for graph QL setting up the
server and whatnot and handling azp
requests and also this graph QL library
so both of those are helping with the
graph QL and then right here this is for
setting up course so I can actually
request stuff in this server and for
this example I also connected it to a
database so this is connecting to a my
sequel database and it's on localhost
and I basically just set up a schema
that was mate matches the graph QL
database and I also have a or the
graphical scheme I mean I also have a
the sequel for that if you want to run
and set this up locally but anyway we
connect to the my sequel database and we
now have an instance and a related to
that and so I have a little function
here called sequel and what this does is
it takes a sequel query and just runs it
on the database and returns whatever the
result of that sequel query is and then
fetch all will give you all the rows
okay we're gonna come back to this bit
right here this is with how data loader
is working and yeah we'll come back to
that in a second next thing is actually
basically just starting up the server so
you'll see I am including a schema right
here
and I'm listening for post requests
that's what this is doing and for each
post request I initialize the schema and
set it up and it's lazy loading I
believe and so it initializes the schema
and inside the schema is our resolvers
and we'll look at that in a second
and you'll notice I'm also passing in
the context to initialize this graph QL
basically server and so our context is
right here and you'll notice I'm passing
in two things the pet loader which gives
us access to doing data loader things
and the second part is a sequel function
so this is for me being able to do
sequel inside of resolvers okay so next
let's look at a schema dot PHP so schema
dot PHP sets things up by reading my
schema graph QL so that's what we just
saw right here so it reads that and it
also reads the resolvers and creates a
schema out of it so we're gonna check
out what the resolvers look like next so
I made this again very simple so we're
only have two resolvers the first one is
get people so this and you'll notice the
structure of this we have an object at
the top and inside of that object are
our queries or our route things that we
want to resolve so we'd like to resolve
the query type and we'd like to resolve
the
person type so to resolve the query type
there's gonna be a field called get
people and that's what we saw right here
set the type query and then get people
and that's how we got the names for that
and the name for that and then here's
the function to actually handle this
request or this query and to do this
we're gonna be grabbing basically just
calling that function that we were
passed into context right so come back
over here that's this function right
here we're just calling that sequel
function that we set up and what we're
doing is we're just selecting the name
and ID for all the people so the table
called people we're grabbing but you'll
notice that'll only fulfill this one we
also want to be able to get the pet so
how we're gonna be resolving that on an
individual basis so for each person and
again that name matches up with the name
here that type and the field that I want
to resolve is pet so again that's
because we have the name of it right
here called pet so all those names match
up so inside of person type we want to
resolve the pet field we could also
resolve the name field if we wanted to
but we're already getting the name field
from this query okay so here I'm doing
two things so first I am accessing the
context the pet loader so this is for
data loader and I am loading in the
route ID so what is going on there right
well what I'm doing is I'm loading so
what root has access to is what the
person any fields that we have in the
person already so I can either get from
root the name or the ID because those
two fields we've already fetched from
the database when this function is
getting called so it's inside of root so
I'm accessing route de ID so I'm passing
in to the pet loader the ID of the
person and we're gonna use that later to
look up the pet for a person because if
we have the ID so right we have the ID
of the person we can look up
their pet and then lastly I am just
wrapping this and data loader data wait
because this is an asynchronous request
until we need to wait for that okay so
that's how that's working so let's just
go back to the last part and that is how
this magic works with data loader and
loading this in so there's just like
some configuration that you do have to
do to like set up
I guess promises / asynchronous stuff
and page P not quite sure but that's
what this junk is doing right here and
this junk is doing right here so you
don't really have to worry about exactly
what it's doing it's just setting up
I guess synchronous promises so what
those are doing so let's look at pet
loader this is a new data loader
function and we're gonna our new data
loader object and we pass in as a
parameter a function and also we pass in
at the promised adapter which is this
thing so as a parameter this function
we're gonna get keys so the keys that we
passed in are whatever we load with so
over here we loaded with the ID of the
person so we're gonna get a bunch of
ID's for people and the first thing
we're gonna do is just join them into
basically a list or a sorry a string
because they we have like a list of keys
and so what that's going to give us is
just help us build the query and we
don't really have to worry about what
this ID map is doing right now we'll
talk about that in a second in our rows
we are this is just what we get back
from the query so this is us selecting
the owner that is dog in the sound so
these are the three fields that we can
get from pets so is dog sound and then
owner is the foreign key to person oops
so we're fetching these fields and we're
fetching them for all the ones where
we're getting all the pets where the
owner is one of the IDS that we have so
that's our query so next what we need to
do
return the data that we just got so
we're not just notice how we did all of
the sequel for pets in one statement
right here
we're not fetching pets for each user so
we next have to break it out per user so
when I did array flip
we now have an ID map the ID of that
owner so now we can set in our ID map
just the owner of so we're looking
through the rows or saving the owner of
the ID and mapping that to the value of
the row so now we have basically are
creating a map or a dictionary where the
keys are the IDS of the owner and the
value is is dog sound and that's what we
need so at the very end we're just
getting the values of this and we just
want to make sure this is in the exact
same order and that's what all this
logic is doing and that's why we flip
around this array to make sure we get
the keys so for example if parent one
the idea of one and let's that's it okay
so if we have an ID of one two like that
what we want to do is with our ID map is
say like 1 maps to the row is dog and I
guess something like that is going to be
true and sound it's gonna be bark and
whatnot and then so on and then we're
gonna get to and then what its value is
and what we want is we want to make sure
that the very first value maps to the
first value so like if we were to
rearrange this if two was there and one
was here right so that so whatever order
we get the keys in we want to make sure
we return the
in the same order so the parents idea of
two should get the value two or the you
know which pet is the owner owner two
its data for pets should go there but
anyway that's kind of just like the
details of how data loader works you
just make sure the same order you get
the keys in you return the data in but
as far as the PHP part we do this
promise adapter create all and that just
like I guess resolves the promises /
creates promises not quite sure but we
need that and this is just the array of
all our data yeah so that is pretty much
it of how the PHP stuff is working it
was quite weird for me to figure this
all out and I'm pretty new to the PHP so
if you have any suggestions on how to
prove this feel free to leave a comment
below I'm sure a lot of you that are
familiar with PHP would know better
practices in some of these areas but at
least we'll get an idea of some working
graph QL code and a graph QL server so
you can now expand this if you need to
so yep that's it for this video guys
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
