write components like this where their
peer functions and I'll just export
default the function then I'll have my
JSX here but there is one downside that
I just found out about from doing it
this way
so here is my component right here and
you can inspect and look at the react
code for this using the react dev tools
which is really nice for debugging and
for looking at your state and kind of
just checking out what's happening with
your application but you'll notice with
this I have this unknown thing here so
everything else you can see the
components that are there and then right
here we just have unknown and that's
because we didn't give this guy a name
we're just export to you following the
function so throughout my code all the
time I have this written so in larger
applications I just have ton of unknown
tags in my JSX so now I can't just
search you know for my component because
a lot of them are called unknown so
that's not very helpful so to fix this
you know you can write one extra step
which is what I have started to do so
const app two is equal to this and then
I can do export default below here like
that so I write a little extra more code
to like name this right here but then if
I come over here I can see it's no
longer unknown but it's apt to so I've
just started at my components now
instead of just doing export default
naming it like that but this is only
something that occurs with functional
components for example if this was a
class I call it app 2 it'll
automatically give the name right
because we have the name here so if I
render this
can return the same GSX
we can see this guy will be named as
well because it'll automatically grab
the name from there
can I call classes function render
export default class extends react
component and then we can see of course
this will be named for us so this is
something you just have to do when you
have functional components like this so
now my codebase
I just recently started converting over
when I do export default to using this
in one of my big applications because I
want to see I want to use the react dev
tools that checks us out but the unknown
was super annoying so if you have
unknown and you're wondering why that is
it's because you need to name your
components your functional components
like this so let's just for this video
guys thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
