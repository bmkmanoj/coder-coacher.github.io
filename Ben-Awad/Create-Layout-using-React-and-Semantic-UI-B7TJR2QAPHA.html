going to be putting some stuff on the
screen and working on the user interface
so what I want you to do is open up the
components and first go into main we're
just going to do a quick thing real
quick in the render and the container
auto make it text this makes it a little
bit skinnier and then I just want to
remove this link and change this to -
duze you can call yours whatever alright
next we're going to be working on the
home we're going to be using two
functions or UI components from semantic
UI and put and list react okay now we're
going to do some stuff in the
constructor the first thing is when the
page loads what we'd like to do is we
would like to show all the items that we
have and store it in the database so if
you remember we create an action for
that it was called find all items and we
don't need to pass any parameters it was
just like that the next thing is we want
to have a state for our input bar which
is what we're going to type in to create
text or do create items and then we're
going to have two functions one called
handle key down and we're just going to
bind it so we can use this and then
another function called list item which
we will make in one moment okay next
we're going to do some stuff in the
render function I'm just going to create
a div to wrap everything
at the very top I'm going to have an
input these inputs going to be fluid so
it stretches the whole screen we're
going to just make a placeholder I'm
going to say what needs to be done and
then I'm going to create or set the
value is going to be equal to this dot
state dot text and then on change we're
going to create a lambda function to
update the state this dot set state and
we just say text is equal to e dot
target dot value and then on key down
we're just going to be listening for
when they're pressing keys that way if
they press the Enter key we know to
actually add an item to the to-do list
okay the next is the actual list so it's
going to be divided this is just some
styling relaxed and then sighs I want it
to be massive and then vertical vertical
line is equal to middle and then close
off what are the actual items well we're
going to get something from the props
the items now this we actually haven't
added to the props yet we'll be doing
that in the next video this is getting a
roll soom all the items are there and
there's something called all which is
just a list of all the items and then
we'll map it this dot list item okay now
let's create the list item and the
handle down so create handle key down
first and low key down and then
just going to pass in an event and the
first thing we're going to check is if
they do the Enter key
so we'll just create a little comment
for ourselves if e.keycode is not equal
to 13 then we don't care
13 is the key code for the return but if
they did hit return we would first like
to prevent the default behavior and then
we're going to get the text which is
equal to this dot state text and we just
want to trim all the white space and
we're going to check to see if text
actually has stuff inside of it or if
they just left it blank if there
actually is what we'd like to do is we'd
like to create a new item so props dot
create item that was the function that
we added in there earlier and we're
going to create an item with the text
equal to text and the complete equal to
false and there should be a comma and if
you haven't seen ECX es6 the new jobs
your features text is equal to text
those are quickly okay so after we do
that we would like to then just set the
state and make text equal to nothing to
kind of clear out the input okay and
then we're just going to do our list
item list item it's going to take two
parameters the item itself and in the
position this will return and we're
going to be returning is list that item
key is equal to I list dot content and
then inside of this we also need one
more content list dot content and this
is going to be floated to the right this
will be our little icon
so list the icon for deleting and we can
make it read like that and the name is
equal to remove that will give us the
red X that we want and then on click so
what would like to happen when it's
clicked we'd like it to be deleted so
we'll create a lambda function this
thought props dot remove item that's
something we created and what do we need
to pass it the ID item that ID will give
that to us and I'm going to just close
that off and then here we can close the
content list content and then down below
we're going to create one more look list
content content and this is going to
have the class name of we're checking if
the item is complete or not and if it is
then we create give it the complete
class
if not we'll give the active class this
is just for styling purposes which will
create a little style for it and then we
also need an on-click because if they
click the item we need to update it and
show that it's now been complete they've
checked off the to-do list so we're
going to call update item and what are
we going to add pass to this we first
need to pass the ID of the item we're
updating so that's an ID and we're
creating a new object with the updated
text or will the text will be the same
but what's going to be changing is
whether it's complete or not and it's
just going to be the inverse so item so
the opposite of item dot complete and I
think that is matching everything up we
just need to add that guy right there
so what that's doing right there is
twofold so we have a class that's
checking whether it's complete or not if
it's completely gives it the complete
class name this will do a strike through
it and then when this is clicked this is
the actual text itself I'll just let me
just fill this in real quick then I make
more sense so we have text here and then
let's talk content then let's talk
content and then list item okay just
close off all those tags okay that's
what I was saying is when they click on
the item text what we'd like to do is we
would like to check it off or check it
on so what we're doing is we're updating
an item we pass the ID of the item
that's being updated and then we're
creating a new item to replace a little
item the new item is the exact same
except it's the opposite of the complete
it's either now been completed or it's
uncomplete and so you just inverse it
this way so this sets up the just the
basics UI component there's one last
thing that's not working that we're
going to be fixing the next video and
that's we actually don't have this items
down here at the bottom right here we
need to actually add these and actually
do stuff when the actions change the
state so in the next video we'll be
working on that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
