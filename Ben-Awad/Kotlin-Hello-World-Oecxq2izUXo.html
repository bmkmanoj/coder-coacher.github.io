the start of the Colin video and right
now we're just downloading the plug so
well we're using Kotlin I and I need to
download the plugin for it which I just
need a file plugins should be here
somewhere preferences
okay here we go and we just want to get
it Collin
browse jetbrains plugins so we need to
make sure do trip great
do something with my IDE messed up maybe
Annie's second to load
so which one is it this one has this
almost like 30
so are we installing indexing down here
give that a second ok so what hello
world looks like
we're going to for loop looks like for
args and arc oh my this is not our
there's no brackets for this for so I
guess they're just using the next line
or maybe it's maybe it's the intention
that's specifying it like Python guess I
would like to download all this is
certainly a new language user conditions
just go to the learning section
I'll just looks like it's the tutorial
that we're about to go through ok so did
this done I did this finish are we near
restart so restart Android studio
you start that's always say not restart
car enter studio is ranked slow today
yeah let's restart
okay so we want to follow a I'm going to
do the mobile Gorillaz we want to do
this mobile tutorial alright so we've
created a new project with one job
activity let's make this full screen
while that's loading but yep we want to
add Kotlin easy so I start using
colonists to convert automatically Java
activity into Colin one please note that
any time instead of looking to
documentation for a new way to X
personal pen you rewrite it you can
write it in Java then copy paste java
code in the common file IntelliJ will
suggest to convert it oh that's pretty
cool so IntelliJ will actually
automatically convert my coach from Java
to Colin that's fancy in case I forget
something
or in the Android Syria
Oh
let's move this over here all right so
we want to convert the Java file to
Colin sopra comin two main activity that
Java we can do this is this way to
invoke fine action and start typing and
actioning like in a screencast volo
alternative we can call this option via
the code so convert Java to Colin so
what's sign is that I believe that's
option so option shift command J okay
option shift command J okay so it looks
like it works but this needs finish
thank you that needs to finish indexing
first before it can convert the file
okay so let that finish and then this
should automatically converted to our
Java code then what are we doing next so
then we have to configure it how are
they pulling up find action choose help
find action on the menu press shift
command a so shift
I think I need to let this finish
loading
Wow so we're still indexing good grief
so what is the next tutorial android
extensions
okay so we finished loading so let's go
option so make sure we're in the file
close this window and let's convert this
file to a Colin so if we alt shift
command J
with indexing again ice I assume that
switching this or did I tell to do that
I did option shift command to Jay
hopefully it's switching it this looks a
lot this looks very similar being a
different language I see a loss Michael
non semicolon uh Colin's okay it doesn't
look like that worked let me just pull
up thing convert convert java file to
Colin okay sweet so it actually worked
and let's change this to this is
depreciated now so we want to use
compact its app or my choices
it's compact something I just changed
this it's Lucy's c/o activity okay well
I'm not sure exactly what they should be
in top one so I'll just leave it as
depreciated for now this stuff is red
why are you read art rid of you alright
when you had a new cotton file
intelligent it automatically prompts us
as to whether we'd like to configure
cotton runtime for the project however
currently converting existing Java file
does not promise action therefore we
have to invent invoke it manually
configure Colin and project your comment
then we're prompted after we configure
okay
what that go oops we should have my
sound on okay now we have to change the
build.gradle file you can see that apply
plugin Colin so I actually enjoyed it
dependencies be in fat alright so this
automatically opened I'll sink this so
our Gradle looks a little bit different
not really just this prime source set
that's a little different okay so after
we can figure all right we just synced
it now the project has been set up we
can work with a layout using the visual
designer there's nothing different in
terms to lay out when we're Kotlin thus
is similar to either android java
development while using layout designer
and IntelliJ note there are two tabs yep
yep yep I right now about that
publishing and building posting
application
alright let's let's let's just run this
and see if we get to work let's boot up
Jin emotions and just run projects now
that works i need to actually learn the
language a little better actually do a
lot more coding
gradle still building
alright so let's check this out
text you oh that's very cool
alright so let's call our activity just
activity
let's change that oops
it's like there's two processes going on
updating indexes these are background
processes we don't throw out those okay
dependencies are they the same
alright let's go ahead and run and see
if we can build this column project
all right this is a pretty simple
tutorial is not very extensive
so it looks like you can mix collar and
Java together got a weird all right
let's see if our project runs Oh looks
like not Colin external annotations are
not set for Android API 20 platform
alright let's set those in I assume it's
in the manifest file still
it's not assignable why that's weird
it doesn't like activity
oh I have to import it do I not have
auto imports on I should all right now
let's build I should have Auto imports
on I don't know why is then
automatically import
show import pop up I mean we have all
imports weird I guess it's for only java
maybe for Colin I can't auto import
could be okay let's let that build looks
like we're can't find parent
it's very small right here they have
look like they teaching more of the
language there doesn't seem to be a lot
on Android
you
under cradles having a problem building
could be
doing it download something else
so slowly just practice all right let's
let's go back to the Android development
we might have missed a step riedel's
taking quite a bit to load maybe it's
just because it's the first time
building a column project could be
building and publishing colin is a
rather small you're now ready to build
the application and debug mode we can
really release so cannot build their
application regular oh no it's as we can
run it right here we can make a release
the application sign it like regular
all right looks good all right cool
finish building I'll see this baby run
all right there you go guys we just did
a hello world with Colin very nice I do
want to just try this out really quickly
like that one feature looked really cool
so the idea this is just hello world no
the ideas ID i'll call this text
underscore view here will say text I
wonder if autocomplete autocomplete
doesn't pick them so txt u is equal to
or not TxDOT set text hello world 220
slide create local horrible creep
property so how did they do it i just
saw it
so you did right here text view set text
instead of doing our ID text view so how
is he getting this import to this maybe
i need import this ok i think it looks
like i do unresolved reference
what that is this why aren't we working
kind of crappy example is this all right
so every Android developer knows well
defined view by be function it is found
outsourced blah blah blah well there are
silver libraries available that I'd see
this problem being libraries depend on
runtime later for entertaining fields
for each view the Kotlin extension
plugin allows us to obtain the same
experience we have with some of these
libraries without having to add extra
code or shipping any additional runtime
in essence this will allow for the
following code text to use an extension
property for activity and it has the
same type as declared in main.xml ah I
think I need to do some import all right
maybe we have to import the xml i'll
just do comm dot then maybe it's been
wat what's my package go see what is my
package oh yes Collin ah hello world
and then add r dot activity mate how
does it do dot Android dot Android dot
synthetic just star import everything
now I didn't like it still get create
okay let's okay let's get rid of this
it's that it can change my java code so
let's just write some java code so we're
gonna say text to you textview to the
lower case on some case be fine you by
ID arta ID dot txt you
and we just grab this cotton to Java
Holland convert Java and you convert it
to a hover
please feel so I constructor all right
so was this stupid tutorial sign
but it did something about this okay
here we go then copy paste java code
into a cotton file IntelliJ will suggest
to convert it okay so let's copy this
grid of that taste it piece of crap your
java class
alright that's stupid let's see if we
get this to work different way so
comment here using our layout made Oh
second no I'm doing that my second view
/ I'd fun weird name for a variable on
create right mine looks exactly like his
let's rename this text to nothing
not trying to get this to work text
views an extension property for activity
maybe I say activity dot dot yeah does
it seem to work see Jerry
just google this fine ID
I think I need to import maybe my xml
files somehow I don't know how I just
need to do not android com that example
of in Awad dot s dot maybe not actually
i'll see you guys soon or yeah I don't
know let's see yeah butter knife cotton
is up so how does Colin androids layout
ok let's try that I guess so we want to
import activity may not I just don't add
xml and then dot star it's not like you
might doc Cottle in X maybe I didn't
install tray once we create a package
well I mean let's see why it's not
working and resolve reference Colin X
unresolved the reference chocolate
yeah right no one seems to have written
anything my plugin is my plug-in working
correctly could be something wrong like
plugin maybe let's just try running
let's see if it gives me here it needs a
build or something there's the same
tutorials getting started tutorial has
colin x android synthetic domain crap
what oh that's a problem i wonder if
that was messing anything up over here
though no
you
we're actually going to be able to build
onto this possibly
now it doesn't give me errors so
unresolved reference Colin X well to
make sure i installed everything plug-in
is installed I guess there's no way I
would be able to be writing this code
though the pointless not installed I
don't think again
okay this is what i have installed so
make sure you're here we have problem
stalled
I guess let's just google a Kotlin Oh
world tutorial see if anyone else has
written a tutorial for this
alright so it does it for us right make
sure our Gradle looks like his yep
as is stupid well
maybe it's just cotton not caught my
neck no it is like Android huh
but let's look at someone else's project
and see how they do it
okay so get his android so he's using
find view by ID we're right here they
make a big deal about how cool it is
that they don't have to use find you by
ID all right let's just
this has nothing to do with us
this is such a new thing that it's not a
no one else has done it
well let's try try this so far all its
color guy taxi TV of the type button'
i'm guessing type text view find you by
d 2 and as text to you oh we don't need
some icon let's import that looks like
it's good now let's just try scooter to
this and let's run this and see if that
will pop up hello world 22 c we must
find someone else's project yeah
stream ah yeah it's a video don't you
have to do something what do you mean we
have to be running something yeah I have
the window closed oh yeah thanks
sorry about that guys okay
ok it ran or built ok that's a good sign
you
hmm doesn't look too helpful okay I
built ok so just Google cotton X saving
anything on what that is supposed to be
maybe we need to beat on this this is
separate library i'm so so download now
this looks like crap all there is is a
reading in any way but maybe colin x is
a separate library not sure
okay I that there okay well I'm going to
be tinkering with cotton a little bit in
the future this is what a simple hello
world project looks like just converted
this page and yeah so thank you guys for
watching hey what's up man um can't
really figure out how I can get this to
tie in with which we call it the view I
feel like I feel like i'm importing it
wrong I feel like I needed I feel like
I'm messing up I feel like maybe it's
something with import and in a work I
just don't know if the right one is yeah
so this almost looks like javascript a
little bit i think you call your cars
like that this how guess is how you make
a variable maybe let's just make a
string string equal to s I wonder what
the I really should look at what things
advantages to this language they read
through its documentation check that
stuff out so it's over here just want to
make sure one last team time I'm not
missing anything oh it's all there's
more on this I totally miss that okay
it's convenient waiting for all widgets
properties for specifically out in one
go thus if your layout is named the main
back smell weed import kotla next
Android the synthetic paint paint if we
want to call the synthetic properties on
the view useful in adapter classes we
should also import that once we do that
we can invoke the corresponding
extensions with your property is named
after the views in the XML for example
for this view we would be named hello so
we call activity dot hello dot set text
now how does that work that's pretty
cool it's not recognizing Coplin x i
wish this would work so cool
maybe it's I need to change the activity
now they have activity here maybe it's
because I have obscured of this like
this is something simple i'm missing
like giving a textview an ID right yeah
i call it text view I should call
something a better name hello text
alright I guess that's not that much
better of a name this should be throwing
an error now and this is a weird
language once we do that we can then go
corresponding extensions maybe I need to
try the dot view dot you know just like
not getting this Kotlin x what's so ever
like create a package that's doing hey
what's up man
have my text view maybe something wrong
with my view it's just a relative layout
it's nothing special heading height this
all looks fine maybe it has something
wrong with my package I don't think so
maybe it's humble but with the ? fungal
weird activity dot subtext man what the
heck underhood so Kotlin Android
extension is a plugin for Pilar does two
things adds a hidden caching function
and fuel inside each calling to be very
small how this works is that one
invoking a synthetic property where that
receiver is a call an activity
look at our manifest file
window this function is invoked adds a
hidden caching function of feelings at
each column that's hidden cache in
function oh yeah I have no idea why this
is how this works at all maybe its class
path problem don't think so at verdicts
so I'm not good aha that's the problem
this tour we're going to use but the
same can be accomplished oh not let's
try adding this maybe that's a problem
this looks like it's just very tell oh
shoot double colon cancel but I'm going
to mess up the thing
well crap yeah I don't know about this
i'll do some research or something i'm
not doing this all right breeder on that
maybe that'll help I don't think so
though this looks like it's just for the
IntelliJ which we are using IntelliJ
board using Android studio we're here
with dr. hood this tutorial we're going
to use fatal with the same can be Colin
just using either
okay so we broke please fix your project
and try again do not find the extension
okay let's just rerun or rebuild the
screen off Oh world 22 yeah okay so i
think i'm just going to go ahead and
take a break for now i will come back
later in try to figure this out so thank
you guys for watching really appreciated
and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
