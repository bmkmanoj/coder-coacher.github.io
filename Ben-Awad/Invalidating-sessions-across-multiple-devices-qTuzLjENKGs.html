about sessions again and I didn't want
to create my own library because I
wanted to make sure it was secure and so
I wanted to use one that had been battle
tested and used before and tested and so
I wanted to use this one right here so
this is Express session but with the
default configuration there was one use
case I was thinking about where I might
have some trouble just using this by
itself so this works really well if you
just have for example one client like a
website or something but let's say you
have a app and a desktop or a website
right so let's say you create a session
on the phone and you create a session on
the website nowadays users will be using
both right and you could expand this
looks that you have an Alexa skill as
well that might be a third session so a
user could have multiple sessions open
across multiple devices so what I want
to be able to do is let's say I log out
of a session then I want to be logged
out of all my sessions maybe now that
might not be something you want to do
for your application but some
applications want to do that but if you
don't want that application or that to
be able to do that you want some way to
be able to find all sessions for a user
and the reason for that is it's very
helpful to know all the sessions a user
has because maybe you want a blacklist
user for example they were trying to
break into an account or something or
they did something bad so then you want
to know all the sessions they have open
so you can close them down and by
default with this one there's no way to
store for example the user or query by
the user because all you're doing is
setting this by the session ID so if you
go over here you can find like get so
you can get a session ID but only by the
session ID
and in the session itself is just a JSON
object so you can't really query the
JSON object you can only basically get a
session by the ID so there's really no
way if at the default session library to
be able to get users so I was kind of
bummed by that and I was thinking how
could I do this am I gonna have to
create my own session library where I
was going to store this and then I want
to use Redis with the sessions to make
really fast for querying and getting the
sessions and with that you can only do a
single key for storing things but you
can start into things where you can
query by multiple for example kind of
set up a secondary index which might be
the user ID but then I would have to be
you know creating this session library
so I came up with a secondary solution
that I like a little bit better and this
is what I'm thinking about doing so I'm
creating a second table or not a second
table but a table in my database that
looks like this so I'll be storing the
session ID as a primary key and so every
time I create a session I'm going to
create it in my database as well and
when I create this session I'm gonna
store the user ID and I'm also gonna
store when it expires and now what this
will allow me to do is I could do a
database query whenever I want to
whenever I need to and I can get all the
sessions for a user and I can get all
the active sessions and I can also get
all the expired
sessions now I definitely want to set
this up where I occasionally clean up
the database and remove all the sessions
that are expired so that's a particular
reason why I'm storing the expiration
date here so maybe on every create or
maybe update maybe delete some kind of
thing or maybe a you set up a cron job I
haven't decided what I want to do yet
for example every day it'll go in and
get rid of all the expired sessions but
yeah this way in the database and you're
not always going to be logging out a
user right so the reason I could have
also just put the whole session itself
in the database
notice I didn't do that right so I don't
have the session JSON itself and maybe
this is a mistake maybe it's best just
to store the session in the database
itself but the reason why I didn't want
to do that and I did like a split right
so half of this is gonna be in the
database half of its gonna be in Redis
because you're frequently gonna be
fetching the Redis or the session and
then less frequently are you going to
need to know all the sessions for a user
and so it's faster to do Redis since
that's most your things that you're
gonna be using for the database this
might be just an occasional thing for
example when the user walks out or if I
have to ban a user that sort of thing
which is less common but it's nice to
have but yeah I just wanted to kind of
give you guys show you guys what I was
thinking about for sessions so I'm still
gonna be using this library right here
with Express and then setting up a
database table to go along with this to
keep track of all the users the sessions
they have and let me know what you guys
think about this I may just be better to
also store the session itself in the
database but I'm thinking it might be a
little bit performance wise better to do
it in Redis and this way if I'm storing
in the database I'll have to also
Express session I'll have to create a
separate I'll either not have to use
this if I want to store the JSON in here
or create two tables what you don't
really want to do but yeah that's it for
this video guys thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
