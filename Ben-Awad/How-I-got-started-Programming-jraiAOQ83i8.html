programming background and talk about
how I got to where I am today so it all
started around when I was 16 years old
and I don't think I had done too much
programming before that I think I might
have tried a little something in like
c-sharp or Visual Basic but nothing
serious and I took my first computer
science class it was an AP computer
science class in Java this was my third
year high school and the reason for
taking this was one to see if I was
interested in doing computer science in
college and two if I liked it and I did
well on it I'd be able to get some
credit for college so I took this course
and I actually did like it and I liked
the professor it was pretty good when I
took it and it taught me Java pretty
well and at the same time I was doing
this I was actually doing another Java
course because I was so interested Java
actually and programming in general it
actually just caught my interest so I
took this one udemy course Java tutorial
for beginners and basically took this at
the same time and this took me a year to
do both of these so this is around I
started around September ish and all the
way to May of that year so then it went
into the summer of my junior year and I
actually don't remember what I did
during the summer for programming wise I
think I did probably some Java stuff and
just kind of maybe a couple little
projects and I remember I eventually get
into some Android stuff but I think that
comes a little bit later but we'll talk
about that next then after the summer it
was my senior year of high school so
fourth year and for whatever reason I
kind of didn't really do much Java at
least at the beginning instead what I
did was some WordPress so WordPress is a
blogging platform they can set up
websites and stuff and so my mom had a
web design company and she built
WordPress websites so I helped her build
them and honestly I had no idea of all
those really
I kind of just it's you can see this is
kind of like the dashboard I kind of
just configured stuff in the dashboard
but honestly I know way more about
what's going on now back then I had no
idea what any of the things I was doing
and it was in PHP I didn't even know
what PHP was then and I didn't know CSS
or HTML or pretty much any of that stuff
but I did I did I didn't learn any
JavaScript or PHP for this but I did
pick up a little bit about HTML and CSS
and around the same time I also my mom
had a membership to this place called
treehouse so I don't think I ended up
doing any of these till probably around
December January the spring half of that
semester of my senior year and I took a
couple courses here and the first was an
Android course and I actually really
liked that and it was cool to see
something running on my phone and I
think it also took a command-line course
here where I learned basically the
essentials and basics of command line
stuff and I thought that was really cool
and I think I built two apps with this
and it was a stack calculator which is
very similar to line did with I did with
react native I basically just rebuild it
with react native so I did it an Android
and it also did it another one called
loss Scout which is a League of Legends
that basically you could track your
score your stats while playing it and it
was it was fun to make and it was
basically just practicing Androids and I
actually pushed those on to the Google
Play Store they're no longer there
though because the League of Legends won
got taken down for copyright and I just
replaced my stat calculator one with the
react native one because I thought that
was better
so I also around that time started
learning Python it was the end of them a
spring semester slash starting in the
summer that I did some Python and I used
this course called learn Python the hard
way recently just gotten updated but
this is
when it was not updated but and it would
taught me Python too so I took this and
it just taught me this Central's a
Python and I thought it was like pretty
decent so and this took a good part of
my summer before College and now this
was the summer going into college that I
started learning Python and I also knew
I was gonna have to take a Java class
and Python or not Python a Java class in
college and so I wanted to start doing
some more Java you know prepare for that
class and also learn basically learn
some more advanced Java things and I was
thinking I really wanted to be a Java
developer at this point for some reason
so I read through some of this book
headfirst Java right before going to
college and then I went to college and
my first semester I took the Java class
and it was super easy because I had
pretty much already learned Java twice
right with the AP class and the beginner
Java class and now this headfirst Java
but I did end up you know pretty going
through this pretty fast and getting
into like some servlets and some more
advanced features pretty quickly here
and during that semester I also started
to get interested in data analysis now I
got this book but I actually don't think
I actually read most of it I just did
like a tiny bit of it so I could pretty
much wasted the book but I supposed to
be good if you want to do Python and
data analysis so I had just learned
Python and then I was learning some
pandas and numpy and ipython and you
know all that good stuff that surrounds
data analysis and the reason why I start
to do that is because over winter break
my first year of college what I did was
go work at a quantitative trading
company and so there I used Python and
pandas and learned a lot about the stock
market so that was really fun and I
really liked it and then a second
semester of college I start
I took this class where we basically is
kind of like a senior design or senior
project type of class where we were
given a prod basically a problem we
hadn't make a solve it right so this is
what I had I made this project for a
company called Tech's protects and what
they do is basically data and research
about child abuse so they has a whole
ton of data online the Texas state
government keeps about basically records
and data and so what they wanted us to
do and this is what we ended up making
so I've the code on github and we also
hosted it using github pages I made this
little thingy right here so the first
part of this was scraping stuff using
Python so I learned how to scrape stuff
in Python and then I use what I learned
with pandas to basically clean up the
data sort it I'm get it in an order that
I could represent it here using
JavaScript so this is my first time
actually learning JavaScript and seeing
it and you can see this is a little
bootstrap and I actually didn't like it
at all I did not like JavaScript this is
vanilla JavaScript we're using var and
kind of didn't like it all especially
compared to Python or Java I didn't like
it one bit
but we I made this and I you know I got
some experience with it and also HTML
CSS and then I got better at doing
Python and pandas even more for doing
this and then this took so that was my
spring semester first year and then
right before the summer and then
starting the summer so over the summer I
worked at the same place I did over the
winter still doing Python panda stuff
and data analysis learning more about
the stock market so just getting better
with that stuff and then for some reason
I really thought I wanted to do
programming competitions so I actually
started reading and taking courses about
algorithms so I took this course see a
course and wash them the videos on it
from algorithms if you know what don't
know what programming competitions are
it's basically algorithms and data
structures where you're given a certain
amount of time and you try to solve
these problems so I started just yamming
doing these problems and learning these
algorithms so I took this class here
basically just consumed me I just like
got super interested in all of a sudden
and I started doing that so I did this
course and then I also read this book
over here as recommended just for
funsies
and I usually don't like books and these
are great professors right here I
actually watched some of their videos on
YouTube too I learned a lot of data
structures here and this is actually
where I got really good base and
fundamentals with just like seeing code
and seeing how fast it would run and so
I did a bunch of problems on like a
website like this or like hacker ranked
tons of other websites or basically
there's just coding problems online and
I think is lasted about a month so maybe
around probably I think I did this in
June so around July I was kind of just
burnt out but and I just was like I
don't this not even that fun just coding
these it's not really even coding it
just ended up becoming math like I
really liked it at first but then it
just ended up being just a ton of math
and I wasn't really interested in it and
it was just like memorizing advanced out
like once you get to a certain point and
basically the programming competitions
in these problems it no longer became
just programming and basic data
structures it was just like memorizing
obscure things that I would never really
have to use and I didn't really like
that but to do this I actually learned
some C++ and I got really good at just
the basically the fundamentals of data
structures and algorithms and when I see
a piece of code I know how fast it runs
and how I could possibly optimize it to
make it run faster so this was a really
good
basically it will help her for me for
future things that I wanted to do but I
definitely was like gross I don't want
to do programming competitions anymore
and this was actually kind of an
interesting summer for me and I was
actually kind of difficult because I
didn't know what I wanted to do I was
pretty much not interested in too many
like I wanted to do programming do
programming stuff over the summer but I
didn't know what to program and finally
this was all pretty much after work
while doing stuff at work doing Python
and pandas I didn't know what I wanted
to do I didn't like web development
right because with this thing this I saw
JavaScript I was like gross I don't like
it at all and actually during this time
I also did a hackathon so this was still
first year during when I was doing this
actually did a hackathon and tried to
react for the first time and it went
horrible
I actually actually just like stopped
using react and switched to angular
because I just could not figure out how
to use react I couldn't even do hello
world at all it was it was pretty awful
so I did was not interested in web
design at all at this point
at least with JavaScript and this stuff
so yeah so this is when I started
getting into like what are some of the
other things I could do I didn't like
web development I didn't want to do
competitive programming anymore
what was I gonna program I wasn't really
interested in doing more Android apps I
started to like like it less and wasn't
enjoying what it took to make an Android
app and I was just like oh this isn't
really that fun and I was considering
the other stuff so machine learning was
starting to get hot and everyone's
talking about big data and data science
and I thought that was pretty cool so
let's try that out right so I did this
and I took this course which was very
good everyone recommends this for
starting with machine learning I try I
did the whole course and it gave me a
basic foundation for machine learning
and I had experience with Python which
is used a lot in machine learning so I
did
learn started to learn about this and
start practicing using ipython and doing
stuff in there I was already pretty
familiar with panda's ipython right from
working with that and then also what I'd
done before and I started using this and
doing Kegel competitions if you haven't
heard of Kegel it's amazing they have a
ton of data they give you a problem to
do and then you can possibly win stuff I
never did any good in them and I just
kind of like played around with it and
did like the Titanic beginning tutorial
and stuff like that or I basically just
you know got a taste of data science and
what it was like but this is kind of
where I learned I wasn't really that
interested in data science and basically
machine learning and you know doing
pandas and all that stuff like I liked
it but it felt like a lot less
programming and that's the part I didn't
like it felt like it was getting to the
point where I was just kind of like
cleaning data and it kind of got
monotonous and I wasn't really enjoying
it as much as I really liked building
things and I wish I could just go back
to just coding and building things
rather than just like sifting through
data basically so I kind of got old of
doing data science and didn't want to do
it anymore so I kind of stopped doing
that this is still over the summer and
so I tried out
I gave web development another try but
in a different type right I started
trying
I liked Python so I tried Jango cuz I
heard you can build websites with this
but it was different right cuz I'm just
more back-end stuff I had no idea what I
was doing though I would go through the
Django tutorials and I went through like
the basic one but I just did not know
what was going on like I could get it to
work but I just nothing was you know
clicking at all and this is just a
reoccurring theme with this stuff so
this didn't make a sense at all but I
just I did it for awhile I'd say this is
kind of August July August of the summer
where I started doing this and for some
reason I got interested in functional
programming too so I kind of laid off
Django for a little bit instead
learning haskó which I really liked but
then I was like I don't even know I'm
gonna do with this after I like learned
it I was like well it's let's do a
different functional programming
language that I can do stuff with so I
learned a lick sir so I've learned a
lick sir and then I started I wanted to
do you know I was interested in doing
stuff building the backends so at least
trying it out and seeing if I like it
more because I didn't really understand
what's going on with Django
even though Django's really good and
good beginner stuff like I was starting
to kind of get it but at the same time
it wasn't making sense and so then I
started doing I tried with a Luxor and I
did Phoenix so this is basically the
Django for a Luxor this is a web
framework and I read I think I did a few
things out of the book I build a couple
websites with this same thing as Django
though didn't really know what was going
on but I was starting to get more you
know it was starting to like make a
little bit more sense but still making
no sense pretty much whatever it's a
print that was pretty much at the end of
the summer I did those things and then I
pretty much still didn't know what I was
gonna do because I didn't really like
data science that much
I wasn't liking what development wasn't
really going anywhere and there what the
back ends wasn't making sense to me
while I could like build this stuff I
was pretty confused and so I I didn't
know what to do so my sophomore year so
this is my second year of college and I
just started spamming hackathons I just
I just like didn't know what I was to
code at this time didn't know what to do
so I just started doing hack thoughts if
you don't know what a hackathon is it's
a thing they do for college students and
I think they're trying to do it also for
high school and then also for people
that are just software professionals now
and you're given 24 hours or 36 hours to
code something usually they'll give you
like a problem statement or something
that hey I want you to build this with
this API or this framework or this
library and we'll give a price the best
person you know the
project so I just did a ton of those I
think I did like maybe eight of them
over my sophomore year where I'm just
like alright let's just figure out what
to do you know I don't really know
what's going on I don't really know what
I want to code so let's just go to these
see what happens so eventually one of
these hackathons I did a project with
some friends and they used react and
feathers j/s so they used those too and
I didn't know what I couldn't use react
I'd know how to use it and I didn't know
what feathers Jas was so the part of the
project I did was Python and we actually
did well I did grabbing the date I think
I made a so what for this particular
hackathon it was we went for the JP
Morgan prize and the JP Morgan prize
they set up basically a little stock
market and so the team that made the
most money on this virtual stock market
so I made a little Python bot that would
do automatic trading right and then my
other team members what they did was
they ended up making a little dashboard
where you could actually trade so maybe
they made a trading dashboard which was
pretty cool but that was like my first
oh so that's how you do react because I
could see kind of how they did that and
I'd never heard of feathers either so
that's where I kind of like heard about
them and saw hey these are things and
they kind of look interesting let's
check it out so I think also around this
point I joined a club where I just
starting to do some programming and they
this programming club same people I did
the hackathon with so they were using
react and feathers so I I basically
needed to learn react for that and so in
feathers yes so I could you know help
them and do and you know be a part of
the club and so I was starting to learn
react and so the course I took for react
was by West boss and it was a beginner
react course it wasn't this one because
I don't remember
taking this I made something else I
think it was like a little Instagram
type of Cologne that we made so it looks
like it's a little updated but I took
this course and learned react now my
knowledge of react was so confused I was
so confused about it like but I could
get stuff to work and that was that was
you know that's kind of a theme right I
could get stuff to work with Jango and
elixir and now react but I didn't quite
understand how it was working but I
could figure it I could figure out how
to get it to work and then I also
learned feathers just going through the
feathers documentation the getting
started and the same thing you know I
was getting it to work and feathers you
know it started to make slightly more
sense what was going on with feathers
because I knew feathers and Jango and
elixir were all trying to do the same
thing or not a looks here but Fenix
we're trying to do the same thing but
they all did in different ways so I
started to kind of get how are they are
all trying to do the same thing and like
it was slowly slowly but surely starting
to make slightly more sense it still
wasn't completely like yes I got this
with feathers but I started to learn
that and that was good and this is
around the time where I started this
project called mini monkey and I made a
youtube video about how to set this up
and so I started learning react around I
looked at the last commit I made for
this was around November 11 2016 so this
is my you know second year of college
first semester and the end of my first
semester right November so right around
this time I started learning reacted
feathers probably a couple weeks no more
than a month for sure because as soon as
I started learning it I wanted to build
a project with it and try to get to work
so that's that and I did that for a
little bit where I just kind of was
learning react
and feathers getting better at it and
then spring semester and around May ish
so just kept programming doing those
things and programming with feathers and
react and round may ish I started a
project into I started YouTube making
YouTube videos way more than before and
I also started this project and which
I'm actually still working on right now
and with that and this is quite an
interesting how that evolved but with
that project I so I just learned
feathers yes and react right so my
natural inclination was alright let's
start out a the project using feathers
and react right and this was a project I
had planned on actually bringing let you
know everyone published this to the
world and let everyone use and this was
gonna be like a product I was gonna make
so that start that last May and I'm
still working on it today and so I
started it with using that and I slowly
realized this like this was not really
gonna work like I just kept getting
running into problems with it so then I
came back to actually Django and I ended
up rewriting the whole thing like I got
a substantial part of it done and I
ended up rewriting this in Django so I
still using react front-end but I got
ditched feathers and I used Django
for the backend and I think the biggest
thing that like that was I was having
trouble with feathers was authentication
and I want to do JWT tokens for some
reason so that was giving me trouble so
I switched over to Django and this is
where I I was like coming back to Django
things made a lot more sense my second
time coming back to it and I was liking
it a lot more but around this time I had
also was introduced to graph QL and I
really liked it
but for whatever reason I didn't choose
to use it in that project and use it
with you know that project for whatever
reason like I don't know why I didn't
but I just went with Django ice and then
I went from there and then all of a
sudden I was like man why am I not using
graph QL like I just asked myself that
and I was like well there's no really
good reason let's try using graph QL so
I rewrote the project for a third time
now for those of you that are familiar
with graph QL the JavaScript graph QL
libraries are a lot more developed than
the Python ones so I dropped using
Django and went back to JavaScript and I
started learning how the heck do I set
up a node server or a JavaScript server
with graph QL right because I had no
idea I'd never used really Express
before so I set up Express learned how
to use it with graph QL this is all you
know over is starting over the summer
last summer and all the time where I was
working at Bank of America so this is I
did this just like after work and I
think of America I did machine learning
and I did it with man what do we use we
used oh yeah we used the Stanford NLP
library so we are working on a basically
a little serie for Bank of America
that's the team I worked on and so I was
doing machine learning and NLP stuff
with that and so while that was
happening I was also doing this graph
kill stuff and I was also making youtube
videos and that's when things just
started to really click like I think in
the past the last summer and then the
last semester so uh roughly six months
ish eight months things just really
started to click and I think I've just
doubled in my programming skills because
things finally so I was always able to
get it to work right but things were
starting to like oh that's why that's a
thing and that's how that works like
things were starting to click pretty
much so this is my third year of
programming
around that time ish three and a half
that's when it stuff started to finally
click at least with web development and
getting react and stuff to work and then
I've just been doing that ever since
right so doubt so that was the last
summer and then let's last semester fall
just kept doing react kept doing graph
QL and Express and I'm I'm liking my
projects going well and those
technologies are working really well for
it and I actually did just recently
rewrite it but that's that's because
made some changes on how I wanted to do
things basically my code is getting a
lot better I'm enjoying the directions
going you know I'm enjoying react much
much much much better than vanilla
JavaScript and I never thought I would
do web development but I'm starting to
really like web development full stack
web development I enjoy doing react and
I'm enjoying doing the backend stuff
with graph QL and Express and also I was
starting to enjoy it with Django and I
did like it with Phoenix too
I liked those things a lot better I just
didn't understand it back then but now
I'm starting to understand it it's
making more sense I'm really liking it
and I could see this is I liked it way
better than the other stuff you know I
still do some data science stuff now and
then and I'm actually thinking about you
know would be kind of cool to start
doing some videos about that cuz well
I've done it for so long and I just
haven't done much videos on it and I
don't just because I've been so focused
on graph QL and about development lately
but I definitely want to do like maybe
some cattle competitions and stuff
because they still are pretty fun to do
once in a while so maybe some of that
content will be coming soon
with Scott Kay learn and some Python and
that sort of thing could be coming soon
but yeah so that's how I got started
with programming and my adventure so far
how I am how I got your currently and
that's how I kind of stumbled upon and
got good at graph QL Express and react
which is my current stack
and I guess also put a poster s equal
amusing and Django and Django helped you
know teach me how that stuff worked -
cos Django I you know I kind of got
started used to like what databases are
and what the models are because you
start building those out with those
things and feathers js2 helped with that
but yeah okay so this was a longer video
than I thought I was gonna be but I
guess I have and this was this is just a
short overview right I didn't go to in
depth into anything but yeah that's
that's how that's how I currently got to
where I am today thank you guys for
watching feel free to ask questions
about any of it and I'll see you guys
later
