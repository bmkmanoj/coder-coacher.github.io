stack that I'm using works with react
Express graph QL and equal so how is
this a cliff on to the screen how is
data getting there how is I am able to
log in as a user right so I want to talk
about that so I mean this little diagram
here I should actually start here makes
more sense to start at the top but
happens when a user comes to your web
app it's going to render beep which is
going to be a react code right then if
you want any kind of interaction like
saving stuff to the database logging the
event you're going to have to make
what's called an HTTP request to either
a get or a post request there's others
again to get information from the
database post is usually want to change
something in the database so for example
if I want to get some data to just say
I'm Twitter and I want to show some
tweets I would make a get request then
my server here would execute some sequel
the Postgres database to get the data
Postgres will in the back to express
formatting data is not necessary but you
might run several queries and you know I
need to all together and then you send
this data that it gets back they react
react takes a data that it gets and
renders it to the client will see on
their screen it's just this continuous
loop as the user does stuff and a stings
react will make an HG request to express
address will then you know do its thing
taking whatever information from react
it will build a sequel statement of some
kind some database and then pass the
data back and then this will get passed
to react and you a cycle right now one
thing to note with this fql graph QL
would sit right here so here it would
sit right here and the data will ask to
so instead of Express making the sequel
Beit will handle the HTTP request and it
will hand it off hoc QL graph QL will
take the query or the mutation is what
they're called whatever you know react
sends graph QL handles that and graph
that and your what's called result
others will execute sequel you'll get
the return value from that and then
you'll pass it back it'll it sing in
between so it passes back to Express
wooden to react but we get rid of this
gradual to the main three graph kills
kind of just like some cute saying that
I like that I find do pass data format
the data back and forth so I really like
that how the website works this is how
stuff is getting changed and depending
on different requests you make to
express different things will happen and
post sequel and then the database will
change will be reflected and then when
you pull data the next time it'll be
different and that's it you just keep
doing so that's it for this video guys
if you have any questions about how this
I'd be happy to answer them feel free to
leave a comment below I'm going to show
you if I were to put this on AWS use
what resources what does something like
this actually put this into production
what would each so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
