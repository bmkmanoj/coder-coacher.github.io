ducked out with material design and we
can type stuff but nothing really
happens when we hit submit we're just
clearing the form what I'd like to do is
submit that off to a server right maybe
we want to create a user a lot of times
that's how it works with forms now
before we do that I want to do some
clients I want to show you how to do
some client-side validation and here's
why you might want to do that so let's
say your server has like some
requirements so let's say users filling
up the form here bob bob bob bob bob
right and let's say your user name has
to be at least five characters long it'd
be nice not to have to make a request to
the server the server hat tells you
username has to be five characters long
you display it here right it's one way
to handle it but then you have to make a
request to the server when you know
beforehand and you could check on the
client side before you send it off
whether the username is long that so I'm
going to show you how you can do that
here so we're going to be using a
material UI error thing here this error
text to show how to pop up if there is
an error so we're going to do this is a
code if you don't have the code you want
to follow along I have a link in
description below so you can grab it so
what we're going to do is we're actually
going to understate here is we're going
to keep a first name air and this is
basically just the air that the user
then you know oops I spell that wrong
let the air that associated with this
field so if we wanted to display an
error we're going to fix this field so
I'm going to change this to two last
name and you want to have one you can
have one for as many fields as you want
you know just for each error text you'd
like to display basically you can create
an error so for me I'm going to do each
one because I might want to have it for
each one so password air and Theriot so
now am i down here I'm going to say
error text
is equal to this thought state dot first
name air and we're going to do this all
the way down get rid of your last name
air and we're going to do it for the
username as well
username air and we're going to do it
for the email air and the password as
well okay and if you come back over here
you'll notice nothing looks different
type nothing goes red nothing's
happening yet what we're going to do is
when the user submits to the form here
so right here on submit here you'll
notice what we're doing is we're just
saying they stopped props on change the
stop set state and we're setting all
these we're just clearing the form here
so we could write a little call on it
clear for them but what we could do
before this is we could say check for
errors check for errors and we could say
Const / so we could check for any errors
and if there's not in there we go ahead
and clear the form all right that makes
sense and then our check for errors we
should we should really instead of
saying check for errors we should say
validate because that's what we're doing
and here what we can do is we know the
users submit the form so we could say if
this thoughts state dot username is less
than five characters we're going to
return false and what we can do is we
can handle multiple layers too so we can
say what is error equal false
and we're going to return is there I'm
going to say is error is equal to true
and then here we can say Const errors
and then here we can say errors dot
username air through the name needs to
be at least five characters long now
this is a very long air text so I don't
know how well it's going to look like
meaning to fix it but then what we can
do at the bottom here is you can say if
is air this dot set state the state is
going to stay the same right this dot
set state so this will be state and then
we're also going to expand errors so if
there's an air we're going to keep the
state the same but we're also going to
add on any errors that could occur so
let's see this in action Oh Bella date
that should be this dot validate here
all right so say we come down here we
type involved for everything hit submit
and let's not work at all
so let's see what happened user name dot
links there we go now let's see if that
fixes it for us it's a knit and bam
so user name is built least 5 characters
long now we're not quite done with this
because look ray I want to show you two
other things so we're able to stop then
that's good there's two things going to
do one I want to show you how you can
display two airs at the same time so
let's say you want the username is
greater than five but maybe you also
want to check
if there's an ad sign so what we can do
is say this thoughts state that email
that contains I believe contains four
about time elves contains is actually a
thing I think it is contains at sign so
if it doesn't contain apps signed the
email we're going to throw an email
error requires valid email because we're
passing in Bob as being though that's
not good email all right so submit and
we get an error so contains is not a
function the other one is index of so if
it's equal to negative one that's how
you know if you don't know what index of
does it search is going to search email
through the @ sign and if it's not there
it's going to give us any negative one
so we want to know when there's not so
if I had submit you'll notice requires
valid email username is be at least five
characters long so we see both these
areas pop up so that's cool so now we're
able to handle XML there's but the
problem we have now is actually
nevermind this'll work I was going to
say well no well I'll show you why we're
not we're not clearing the air so like
I'll make my username long and this will
be a nice that's a nice email both of
these are valid right now are longer
than five and this is actually a valid
email because we have an add sign so I
submit but notice we've not clearing the
errors so that's the last thing you need
to do so here we can just say first name
error equal to that we can just we could
just come a peek back up here and copy
what the initial one is yeah so we can
just copy this whole initial state
because we want to set it back to what
it was at the start and then BAM so now
if we come back over here you can type
in our form hello how are you
and of course well I'll put an app sign
here we'll get a bad username so we
submit
can make it a little bit longer maybe I
get rid of this and you notice how it
still shows red here so what we can do
is we also want to handle that case
right we want to clear it if they fix it
so every time they submit every time
they submit what we want to do is clear
the form at the end or we could you have
to be a native plant so at the beginning
we actually I just thought have a
smarter way so that we only do this once
better way to do it is in the heirs set
all the heirs to nothing so if we pop
that over so now we sing all the heirs
to nothing we're grabbing theirs if they
exist and now we're going to set the
state whether or not there's an error
because you might want to clear them so
now for typing stuff out here
so our email is good right but when our
username is too short so I linked in the
username denied and validate the email
so BAM the switch perfect now I have AB
sign and this is a valid submission so
we submit so we're going to do next is
we're actually going to show you how to
submit that to a server so now that we
can do a little bit of validation on the
client side we can check and make sure
that hopefully when they submit it you
only have to submit it once to the
server and then you're good
so they'll save you time and just you
know server usage which is very
important and as you can see you can add
as many of these conditions as you want
here in the validate function and then
you just set whatever you want your
error to be here so that's it for this
guy's I'm going to put the code on
github they'll be a link below if you
want to check this out and yep next
video you can expect is submitting these
guys to an actual server and then
handling any errors the server
my thorough so thanks for watching see
you next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
