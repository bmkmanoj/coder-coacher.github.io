finally viewing subscriptions and I left
off last this is what it looks like your
quick refresh we have the vote we have
these boards right and we have
suggestions right here and these
suggestions have the actual suggestion
and a dash and then the actual count for
that suggestion we might change how this
looks later this is our upload button if
you will I only have one user so that's
why there's just one here and as you can
see if I try out voting I can't up vote
if every I voted which I have this
account and here I can upvote notice we
don't see the number pop up we don't
have a subscription set up so I have to
refresh the page to see it update here
and if someone else voted I wouldn't see
that either so that's what we're gonna
set up today using WebSockets and using
a Paula dated a subscription thingy that
we have right here and so let's start
with the server why not we'll set that
up first and I'm just gonna pop into my
code right here and I think we're have
to install some stuff if I remember
correctly I don't think I can just pop
right into it
here's graph kill subscriptions and I
think they have a thing for setting up
subscriptions here somewhere here we go
yep and then we have this transport you
can read more about here I think we have
to download a socket yeah graph your
subscriptions that's when I use pub/sub
and async got
so this shows you how to do the
subscription part and then setting up
the server I believe they should
show here I think that's what this
subscription transport is so we're gonna
solve this and I'm gonna install that so
but yarn add this and I'm on baklava
which is the back end we're gonna do
some back and work so I'm going to move
this over here so we can switch between
panels faster and my subscriptions as
well okay and then let's see what we
need to do next I think we have to set
up a new end point and then I can start
doing stuff okay I know how to stop the
subscription so you can copy this come
into our schema over here oh I already
do subscriptions well I forgot I said
I've already set this up haven't I yeah
I forgot I already set up the server
with subscriptions in a previous video
so don't even need to do this we're
doing it right here I think or is it
here yeah so slash subscriptions on port
30 30 and I think I have the other one
for 30 32 yeah
let's go to her schema so we can just go
ahead and add what we want here we don't
have to do I don't think we're doing
user added we'll say save vote happened
I will just say vote now I don't want to
conflict let's say vote happened and
what are we return me ouch okay vote
happened and what do we want to add
returned back maybe we could return back
what is what are we returning back on
vote vote on suggestion a boolean we
kind of just want to pass back the new
vote amount so I'm gonna pass back a
custom object type new vote count and
there's gonna be a suggestion ID should
be an int and they count which I love
that and that's what we're gonna return
so a new vote count
so every time a vote happens what we'll
do save is what will pass back whoever
subscribed to this will give them what
suggestion was uploaded or downloaded if
we add down votes and then the count the
new count that we add so that looks good
and we can come over here in our model
we can close that and our resolvers
okay so we have pub/sub here we no
longer have user added but we have vote
happened subscribe oops we're gonna say
vote happened
so now we just need to call pub/sub and
publish it and so what's gonna happen is
people are gonna call this to subscribe
and then we actually need to push data
to it so to push data we could do it
right here so we have the ooh this is
gonna be annoying actually okay this is
what we're gonna do instead of
publishing the count we will say
increment amount which is gonna be one
or a negative one it's downloaded yeah
increment amount because uh we don't
really so we have the idea of the
suggestion here well we don't actually
have an easy way to get the count so
yeah that's kind of problematic if we
want to update count we're just gonna
have to increment it which is fine this
works fine I don't think there's there
could be a race condition in here but I
don't think so so what we'll do is we'll
just say pub/sub and I think it's
publish the name that we want to do it
on is vote happen and the payload is
gonna be suggestion ID and then
increment amount we can only up vote so
we'll say one will increase the vote by
one and this will be ID
we just call this suggestion I oh no we
can't there I'll just make sure I'm
doing this right yep publish cool so now
we just need to do front-end stuff
because we set up the backend to be able
subscribe and we're pushing it on so
switch these guys switch to the
front-end pretty simple all we needed to
do for the front-end we just call
subscribe when we mount the component so
come over here to home and series
component mount on home it makes sense
so component will mount and here's where
we actually want to do this subscription
and now we need to go ahead and do graph
QL and do our subscribe button on that
and I'm just gonna go to locos 3 30 30
slash graphical to type this out so
subscription and then in here we can say
what happened
and we want to get the suggestion ID and
the increment amount okay so we'll add
this to our graph QL and this is gonna
be a so we have mutations queries create
a new one called subscriptions so we'll
import gql so this will be vote happened
and we're just gonna put it in R so our
graph QL that we have go ahead and save
that and alright my Auto formatter did
not work usually okay they're real it's
not liking cuz I'm only exporting one
thing the time now we'll export more in
the future
we can come back up here and we'll say
what happened and this is coming from
subscriptions
and I'm gonna do compose and then we'll
have our to graph QL things in here so
our first is the board query in our
second is our subscription so what
happened there and I'll go ahead and
import compose that's coming from react
Apollo let's see if we can get these I'm
gonna see if my formatter will allow me
to drop to the new line nope he likes it
all in one that's fine all right
so let's just come over here I'll show
you what has been now added to the props
up did not work all right we have need
to set up our network interface for
subscriptions
so let's hear hear ok so this is our
current network interface let's do
subscriptions we don't want to do server
this is going to be on the front end so
this is a react yes client setup alright
so on our client I need to install this
so it's gonna be rows so I'm going to
come over here to rows and say a yarn
add ok so then let's go ahead and port
this and use a subscription client
instead of the other client that we're
using AK yeah I think we can still set
this up I hope actually oh we can do
both area right so network interface add
subscriptions yeah ok so this is what we
do we add the subscriptions here
bring it down here all right so we're
creating a railer network interface now
we're creating our subscription
interface basically our subscription
client and we just need to combine those
and I have it at 30 30 slash
subscription all right come over here to
confirm subscriptions strings must be
singlehood yeah I don't know why that's
back ticket like that oops
all right so this looks good and to
combine them we do add we need to import
this and yeah and I'm gonna put it below
this just in case when we need to add
middleware that need this needs to
happen before this is coming here say
network interface is network interface
with subscription all right that got rid
of all our errors so creating the other
interface subscription interface here
writing middleware for a regular
interface we're combining the two and
that's what we feed in so now let's see
if we get that air nope it renders okay
I think we're gonna need to rename I
think there's a problem now okay so you
know this how nothing is rendering here
the reason for that is and our graphic
you all here you'll notice we have two
we just have to give one of them a name
so I'm gonna give because I think
they're overriding each other so here
I'm gonna say name is gonna be sub
and now we should see the data show back
up here if it doesn't then I don't think
I'm using right name okay so you notice
this showed up and let's see what this
warning is okay so it looks like they're
releasing a new package soon but it's
not out yet okay so we can worry that
worried about that later time
so okay stuff showed up well let's see
the new props that have been added for
us so if I come in to react I can see my
time now when this is done we can look
at the home component we see data which
we're getting from our query and sub I'm
not just loading still I don't think
it's the connection worked because we
should see other stuff here if it did
work see no data has stuff right so data
is able load subscriptions not working
for some reason so let's see why that is
we have our server up I want to make
sure
little host 30 30 that looks good
all right the configuration looks like
it's set up good
what we will do say this props will say
console dot log this stop drops so it
could be I don't know why it's still
loading it's very odd I want to kind of
print the props here to see maybe if
finish loading but it's not no still
loading
all right this makes me think I have
something like a parameter messed up so
it's just loading indefinitely
alternatively I'm gonna try killing the
server here and see if loading goes to
false here we go it does so the
connection is happening okay I spelled
subscription subscripts ins yeah I
suppose the subscriptions right and it's
able to connect notice how we go 7c
still loading in search for home I don't
know why would be infinitely loading
we're doing something wrong we were
following the readme exactly though I've
done this exact thing with subscriptions
before so I'm not sure why here we're
loading indefinitely
because then what we want to do is call
subscribe to more after that I just saw
this red and I was like what is that
okay so on port 30 30 still so that's
correct
um I'm gonna clean this up a little bit
get really things we're not using so I'm
not using Facebook right now so let's
get rid of that cuz I have a lot of junk
here that like it just makes that harder
to look through the code oh I hope the
secret was you it was being used for
Facebook I forgot it's not so I did I
deleted this this secret I'm using for
authentication so it can't go to that
but we get rid of this okay so make it a
little easier just to look through the
code now and we can get rid of these
things okay
we're creating the server I know it's
connecting okay
right because I don't know if it's here
it is this status finished but then it's
also pending here it's still loading I
wonder what the timeout is it should I
can't just go on in this forever
eventually it should go to false still
loading Wow
okay so graphical though you can do
subscriptions now so I'm just gonna see
if I can try the test out the
subscription here and see if it'll work
so graphical subscriptions so I can see
if it's my back-end that's broken or if
it's the front end that's broken so yeah
so to see April 11th they just recently
popped out now you can do subscriptions
and graphical alright so how it works we
already have this okay so we just tell
them what our endpoint is alright
so here's a graphical express we pass in
our subscription in point two and for us
we're using thirty thirty oh and that's
it okay so let's try reloading this oh
we broke something or made the service
reloading
yep service just reloading anything else
having to do let's try writing it
surgeon do appear here after server
publication all right so listen get
subscribed okay I'm gonna hit the plus
uncaught cannot return null for an
unknowable
field subscription that vote happened
that makes me think it's finished
loading nope it's not I don't know what
this sub thing is doing message cannot
return no I don't know what's happening
with this I'm gonna try refreshing and
seeing if the vote went through vote
went through okay vote popped up over
here but it's an object that's kind of
awkward why aren't they rendering the
object
does it say here
you
look there's get surrendered okay maybe
I have the maybe I have in the server
wrong let's just look at our pub/sub
again
oh that's not good user outed here I'm
gonna get rid of create user not doing
that we're doing the registration now so
good Cruiser okay we didn't even have
create user in here anymore
okay so we're pub subbing we're passing
our object and we're doing something
slightly off I'm assuming it's the back
end cuz we're returning an async
iterator right alright we're doing the
back end for a little bit swap these out
yep so we return an async iterator with
a vote happened when we subscribe oh do
we have to call subscribe
yeah okay that's right it wrong I think
I just do that right I think that's what
I'm doing wrong okay that's probably it
now we can try refreshing run that I
didn't object show up immediately that
should not happen let's see on the front
and if that fixed anything okay okay we
get an immediate uncaught now still
loading subscription must return async
iterable received undefined so vote
happened okay maybe we do do subscribe
comment added
Oh notice how they the same name here
here maybe I should try doing that so
I'm gonna put the subscribe back so it
looks like we need that oops what did I
do
I went back to me okay so I subscribe
here I don't want to try is down over
here
wherever I'm publishing I'm gonna say
vote happened and return that
okay let's come over here and vote we
cannot vote on any more suggestions so
let's create one
still loading Hey look at that the
subscription worked
we got increment mounts and the
submission ID okay so because it works
here we've narrowed it down that
something's wrong with our front-end so
we can move that over there and this
over here and I'm gonna refresh and see
if we can get that air to pop up again
cuz maybe we can just try debugging that
nope
maybe it's cuz I vote it
validation there that's fine because I
can get the air to come back up so let's
just look again over how I can figure
this to make sure I configured it
correctly oh we can we want to match
what they have here okay add all have a
slash at the end there but that
shouldn't be causing a problem right
oh it doesn't actually it doesn't
actually even connect so we know it
connects okay because we don't see any
errors right but for some reason I can't
load it that's so weird
what could be causing that so it
connects to it but then it infinitely
loads I don't see anything here
I just am I missing anything
maybe I'm doing this wrong I'm not sure
I getting rid of this and just having
the subscription there I'm gonna check
out this warning to me that warning can
talk more about how we're supposed to do
it can I trade property
alright let that refresh
so same problem
I don't think I don't think naming is
messing it up either because I'm putting
a name there yeah sure getting here that
real quick actually I don't think this
is it but I'm just gonna try
I honestly have like a little idea what
it could be I'm just kind of narrow
things down a little bit
no not the naming which you wouldn't
expect that to be the problem okay so
that's a check out the readme to start
with a full WebSocket transport that has
all types of operations and pouring
create an instance oh I see graphic
you'll endpoint
it doesn't show you how to set up the
server for this though but maybe that's
what it wants us to do we're currently
doing this basically but something wrong
is happening somewhere
I guess it looks like they're gonna
depreciate hybrid I don't see your
reference in the researching the code
would you consider the morning since I
assumed me will try to understand why
it's only he realize it can't be solved
Waring's that can't be fixed are
irritating it's not actionable I don't
think it should be displayed at all that
said the work you're doing is great too
it says here
alright this just looks like they're in
development of this so this should be
working it's one of those things where I
kind of just want to restart both
servers and see if it works
why is data I put this back I only saw
data over there all right we're gonna
reset the server I'm gonna restart the
client see if that fixes it because
everything looks pretty correct
my vote happened this week of this
worked on our other thing in our
graphical that exact just something in
our client is messed up because we know
this exact graph QL works here
look at that oh yeah I forgot to put the
name back the sub dear yeah begin still
loading not sure man this is actually uh
stumping me pretty hard right now
graph QL is working fine let's try
changing the name of this oops hello
so notice like when I changed it in
point to somewhere else it does get
an error so we know that we're pointing
to the right end point so that's not the
problem and we know the server doesn't
work we've already established this I
just there's nothing complicated
happening here maybe the middleware is
messing it up but that's only affecting
this not this
I can try commenting that out let's see
I changed it - hello I mean that should
not do anything right it doesn't
okay with data graph QL options
okay so props comments maybe we should
try to mean this I don't think this will
work either though just cuz it knows how
they're just going into the props to get
it I'm gonna try adding this and console
logging the props and seeing what they
look like if they're any different than
the props we see over there
let's close that drop to new line so you
can actually see what we're doing so
props we're going to return props
console dialogue hi bye
and then props
so we've here to refresh
okay still loading still loading so
whole time
I don't own props is here and okay so
this is not gonna do anything so
I'm gonna try commenting out the middle
we're seeing it that does anything I'm
gonna call me not that query - I should
just leave this here because we're
debugging and I'm keep adding it alright
so again we know this doesn't work
confirm doesn't work
come over here comment out this
middleware I'd really don't think of it
the middleware for not even it's been a
weird just for regular stuff okay good
I would expect it not to work still ok
so let's try this see how they just have
a subscription client here what if we
just pass it the client and I'm gonna
try doing it I'm not gonna use the
network interface I'm gonna create the
client I'm gonna pass in the
subscription client here so I am now I
can only base the only doing
subscriptions and let's see if that
works
all right that does not work so I can't
just pass a regular thing there what if
I pass it to this that probably doesn't
work either I imagine
or me I guess you have to combine it
with this hybrid thing where you combine
them together so put this back let's put
this above the middle where
nope nothing
I'll put this back give it good naming
subscriptions alright so something must
have changed an Apollo or I'm just not
catching what I'm doing wrong but
debugging is not happening right now
we're not I'm not gonna be able to
figure it out it doesn't seem so what I
usually like to do when an issue like
this happens is to just stop programming
and I'll probably think of it just
walking around slash doing other things
so I'm gonna in the stream here and
hopefully figure this out
maybe I'll gonna walk and think about
this cuz I honestly have no idea what
could be going wrong here so that's it
for this stream guys thanks for watching
hopefully I'll be able to figure this
out soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
