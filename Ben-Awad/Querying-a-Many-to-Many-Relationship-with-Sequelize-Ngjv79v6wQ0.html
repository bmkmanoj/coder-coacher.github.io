bug fixes and then we're gonna be fixing
our all teams query that grabs the teams
that we put on the sidebar cuz right now
it's only fetching the ones that we are
owners of so if I invite a person to a
team like my cool team it's called cool
team if you can see that here if we
invite Bob 15 top 15 is not gonna see
our team when he logs in right now so we
need to change that but before we get
into that let's discuss the bugs these
are things that people in the comments
have spotted out so thank you guys for
catching these and showing how to fix
them so we're gonna fix those up real
quick and the first one is this little
thing that pops up here form submission
cancel and the reason why that comes up
is if I click in my team and I hit
cancel this guy pops up so what we're
going to do to handle this is come over
here and change how we're doing these
for handling people's clicks now there's
one quick optimization that we can make
as well while we're fixing these and
that is to toggle instead of having a
closed and open so right now I have two
methods that handle opening and closing
this add channel modal so here I'm
turned it true which opens it false
turns it off and I'm currently talking
about this little sidebar here so when I
click on that we take it to true it pops
up I hit cancel takes to the false turns
off and we don't need two of them
instead what we can do is we can do a
toggle so toggle add channel modal and
what we can say is if the current state
is true we want to take it to false and
if it's currently false take it to true
so if it's open close it if it's closed
open it so the way we're going to do
that is set state one way is to pass in
an object just like this but you can
also pass in a function so we're going
to pass in function what this function
takes is a state and then you return a
new state so
we're gonna take it to state and then
we're just gonna invert the current
States open add channel and we're gonna
do the same thing before these two so
I'll get rid of that we're gonna say
toggle invite people modal and same as
up there and then we're gonna say not
state dot open invite move so now down
here and our on clothes and then we
clicked we can use the toggle everywhere
so toggle AB channel toggle invite
people I'll go add channel toggle invite
now this should work the same but this
doesn't fix our little warning that pops
up so as you can see closes opens okay
we see is get that little warning and
the reason for that is if we come over
to our modal over here notice how the on
clothes we are passing a parameter you
don't see the parameter being passed but
if we wrote a function we could pass in
a function it looks kind of like this so
this little component passes us an event
object so we don't want to do it like
that we're gonna keep it like this
but in our side bar over here we're
gonna handle this event and all we need
to do is say e dot prevent default and
another warning goes away now let's
refresh and see it its little plus hit
cancel cool nothing pops up anymore and
same thing here but there's one small
thing that we just added and it's a bug
so if I come over to my add channel
modal you'll notice I also call on close
all the way down here and all I'm passed
any parameters to it so if that so
notice how on channel or on closed new
prams here but we're passing params here
and in our sidebar we assume that E is
passed to us
so we can't really assume that so we're
just gonna have an if statement all
right
close that so now we're just checking to
make sure
so doesn't affect what we had before so
still don't get the error but now I can
still add users and everything be okay
so now let's work on our all team's
query so I'm gonna invite the the user
Bob 6:00 or Bob 15 on Bob 16 to my cool
team so add the user and did I react him
let's add Bob
16 or 17 all right so we just had Bob 17
so I'm gonna log in with Bob 17 I'm just
gonna come view my team and we don't see
cool team oh there's one more bug I
wanted to fix before we get into this
sorry I forgot about it
and that's notice these numbers up here
if I put in a really big number that
causes an error and the reason for that
is and our code over here this is a
really quick change in our view team
code so we're checking if we get not a
number right so we're checking whether
parse int works or not and if it doesn't
work we just pass in a zero but we're
not checking is if we get a valid number
but the number is too big so the way
we're gonna do that is blow - we'll
return a negative one so team ID X is
equal to negative one and the only
returns a negative one if it can't find
the index so in that case if we can't
find the index we'll just return the
first one the first team and we know
we'll have some kind of team because
we're checking the length the same thing
with channels so team channels groups
channel by DX equal native one then
we'll just show the first Channel
okay now if I come back over here and I
put a really big number we shouldn't
crash anymore oops
we still crash what did I not do if
Channel is equal to negative one up I
put three ends okay all right now we're
all good
so I want to see my cool team show up
here because I've joined that team so
the way we're gonna do that is by fixing
our query so this is something we're
gonna go back to our database for so
right now we're only grabbing the teams
that were the owner of and we'd also
like to grab the teams that we are a
member of so we're gonna create a new
query for this ideally we do this query
we have one query that does both but I
don't think that's possible just with
the way our database is set up do let me
know if you think we can and if you can
come up with a sequel query that grabs
both the teams that we own and the teams
that we are part of because it is more
efficient if we do it in one sequel
query but I'm gonna split this up into
two queries cuz I think that's an easier
way to do it and I don't know how to do
it the other way / I don't even think
it's always possible but it might be so
we're gonna create a let's start with
the scheme over here
so all teams we're going to say maybe
invite teams so these are the teams that
you have been invited to that will show
up the thing is are very poorly named
this should be called like my teams and
they should be like maybe teams I've
been invited to or something I don't
even know what to call this but all
teams is not a good name for that but
I'm not gonna go rename everything we'll
just keep it for now so invite teams
returns an array and now in our resolver
we're gonna say we can pretty much copy
this because it's gonna be very similar
invite teams now we're gonna require off
and now we want to find all of our teams
but we don't really care eight if we're
an owner or not so we can get rid of
that clause we still care if we still in
return draw because that's a little
faster well we really care about is
whether we're a member or not and the
way we check these things in sequels is
by using the include so what we can do
is we can include models that we are
associated with so I'm gonna copy this
and that allows us to basically do a
join if you know what joins are in
sequel they lets you grab data from
other tables and combine them so the
model that we were associated to is
models user all right so our member
table that we created join table and
associates teams and users so this will
join the team in user together and what
we're going to be looking for is where
the user ID so the ID is equal to user
ID that we have here and now we don't
need to worry about the paranoid so
that's it
so our invite teams query is good to go
and we can run this on the front end so
now we actually need to call this guy
and we're gonna really see the power of
graph QL so we just added a new team
query so you might be thinking hey we
need to make a whole separate query and
call it twice but know with graphic QL
you can just add them on so I'm going to
say invite what I call it invite teams
and buy teams
and I can do my select and I'm gonna
select the same fields here I'm gonna
just do export to you fault right now
well no we'll just we'll say export
Const I don't know just so these red
lines go away okay so we have our all
teams that are invite teams which are
gonna run at the same time when we send
it to the server which is really nice so
we didn't have to create a new route or
anything and we didn't have to make two
requests this is one request to the
server where both they're getting are
gonna happen and then in our view team
over here now we have two of them so all
teams and invite teams so now I'm just
going to console dot log invite teams
and we can see our team's pop up over
here alright so here we can see oh look
he's associated the two teams team a and
the cool team so nice so we see team one
team two he has access to and also these
two teams here all right so let's grab
those two teams and merge them with the
teams that this guy owns so currently
that's all teams so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a just a team's
list so Const
teams is gonna be an array and we're
going to join all teams and invite teams
and now instead of looking at teams or
all teams I'm gonna look at teams and
we're gonna look at teams here and here
and here pretty much every place you see
all teams we're now gonna do just teams
and I don't think there's any other
places nope there's no other places that
we're using all teams so now we come
back over here up we broke something
teams oh we needed to spread invite
teams - okay cool so now we see our
teams and look I can join or I can view
the teams and I can switch to the
different ones and I can see all the
different ones so now I see this little
invite people think but I'm not the
owner of this team so I shouldn't be
able to invite people because I don't
own that team right so what we should do
is in our little sidebar here is we
should basically not allow us to view
teams or view or see that invite link at
all so to know that we need to come back
over to our query here and we need to
grab the owner so owner
owner so now if i console.log this we
can see what this looks like so console
dot log teams ooh can we not even grab
maybe I don't have owner in my schema so
let's come back over a team I'm gonna
look I have owner and alright bad
request so let's look at our server we
just got in here no error here I look at
these little arrows those are kind of
cool I think that's a sequel eyes OTO
creating things and I don't know what
this air is going on here I thought this
would be a quick little thing where we
can just grab the owner but it's not so
we'll deal with this in the next episode
so ideally we select the owner from all
teams and invite teams and then we pass
that to our sidebar here and then in our
sidebar we only show the invite people
link so we have to also pass it all the
way down to channels we only show this
thing if we are a team member right or
at the owner of the team and also really
you shouldn't be able to create channels
either just just out of curiosity let's
see what happens if we try to create a
team or and/or create a channel so I
don't know and we get an error cannot
reach property channels of it undefined
so that's good so we actually are
preventing them from doing that in the
back end and if i refresh hope it does
show up so that's a problem so we also
need to prevent users from creating
channels if they're not the owner unless
we give them privileges right so we'll
work on those next in tomorrow's video
so thank you guys for watching I'll save
this code and put it up on github so you
can check it out
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
