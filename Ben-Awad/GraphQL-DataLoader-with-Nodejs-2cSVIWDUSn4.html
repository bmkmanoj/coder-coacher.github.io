data loader and how to add it to your
graph QL server now the ability I don't
know what this is this is a library by
Facebook that actually makes you request
your databases faster by caching and
batching requests so I have a graph QL
server already set up I'll put a link in
the description below or Swiss starter
codes so you can follow along if you
want to and so I have graphs I have the
server up and running and I went to
close 3000 got graphical up and here's
just a sample query you can do on my
graph QL server now this particular
query requires to basically make
multiple database calls because I'm
getting the user or the board table and
I'm getting all the suggestions for your
boards and you'll see how we're handling
it I'm going to come over here to the
code real quick and show you what the
resolvers look like for that so for the
query user boards it's one call here
find all for the boards and then for
each suggestion and you'll see this
suggestion is actually an array so if we
go to query user boards will notice it's
a array of boards which then returns an
array of suggestions so what it's going
to do is it's going to make a database
call for each suggestion in each
suggestion we're going to call find all
what you're about to find out and also
if you're following along I need to
change one thing in the schema this
needs to be an int somehow it got
changed I've been making changes to this
so somehow got changed so yeah just make
sure you change that and that is the
user forward query okay so now if we run
this we get as well it looks like
they're returned so I put some random
data in there just some dummy data and
we can see it took 187 milliseconds to
run now we can run this a couple more
times to get like a good baseline so
okay fastest time was about 45
milliseconds and surround you could say
50 to 60 milliseconds is its average
right so remember that and see after we
add data loader how fast it is
period - that lets it run a couple times
now in my console I have it printing out
the actual sequel queries it makes so
you'll notice sorry let's come back over
here real quick
I have 13 boards right board has
suggestions and as an array of
suggestions that could possibly and so
what's happening is we're doing a select
query and you'll notice for each board
so this can come out to like 15 boards
or 15 sorry 13 sequel queries right and
we see them right here look all these
select queries is making so this is one
query with our graph QL but look how
many database queries so this is a lot
of queries right and it can get even
worse if we're duplicating data right so
example this if I were to run this query
twice and clear this let's see how long
this takes so this is 150 and it's over
100 milliseconds every single time right
and you'll notice what we're doing is
we're actually calling the Select double
the times right so you'll see we're
calling board ID one and you can see
we're calling it again up here right
there so we're just doing a ton of
queries right these could all be put
into one query and that is what data
loader is going to do so let's do this
with data loader and see much faster we
can make in how much more efficient so
I'm just going to pop right over here to
my project in terminal and add data
loader and then we can get started so on
the index page I'm going to go ahead and
import data loader from data loader and
then I'm actually going to pass so for
each you want to create a new data
loader object for each request
so each request is going to come here so
here we want to create a new suggestion
loader which is going to be a new data
loader and you'll notice I didn't just
call this like generic loader right it's
specifically suggestion loader you want
to create a new data loader for each
batch so we're going to batch all our
suggestion queries together you're going
to batch user queries together you would
put that in a separate data load third
separate data loader object so your it
might look something like this
you might also have a user loader right
you need to create two like that so
depending on how you how many of these
you want you'd create a new one for each
tailor for us we're just going to start
with one and for the parameters here we
actually it actually takes an array or
sorry a function which takes an array of
keys and then we have a function that
handles this
so batch suggestions and then we're
going to pass the keys in and I'm also
going to pass in the models so that way
we can actually do some database queries
so I'm just going to create this
function here probably better practice
to put this in a separate folder but I'm
only going to have one batch suggestion
right now so I'm not going to worry
about it
so models and now that we want
suggestion so this is our function right
here in the function here is how you
handle all these keys so if we pop over
here so when we saw we're going to
basically be passed an array of IDs 1 2
3 all the way to 13 and we need to turn
that into a query that'll be just one
query instead of running a query for
each and so we'll do that here and then
it's very simple actually in our
resolver so under our board resolver and
suggestions instead of this we have our
suggestion loader and we're going to say
suggestion loader dot load and then the
ID and that's it so all we have to do is
write the logic here
how we handle a bunch of keys and then
we're actually done and you can see how
fast we will optimize this query so
seduction loader we got which we're
creating here and then here how are we
going to do this well so we have our
keys we have the suggestion model so
we're going to do suggestion dot find
all and so this is going to be keys is
going to look something like this one
two three and so on all the way to
thirteen for us and we want to find all
suggestions and we're getting past the
these are the board id's right we come
over here to the queries that's the
board ID is we're getting past
so in suggestion we want to find all
we're going to do a raw query so that's
true a raw query just means we don't get
it a sequel eyes object back we're just
given just the data and then right here
we're going to say where and we're going
to say board ID and then we're do this
special thing dollar sign in and then
keys so the dollar sign in is a special
sequel eyes thing and what it does is it
just says it looked just as it as you
would think a checks and tries to find
all the for IDs where the poor ideas in
this array of keys so what we can do is
we're going to get Const suggestions
back so we're going to weight this so
let's make this an async function we're
going to get this callback and what we
need to return is an array so we need to
take keys and then transform it into an
array that looks something like this
where you have object one object two and
this is like board ID is equal to one
this one's board ID is equal to two
right and so on but there's one
so we want to just like map right the
suggestions to the key that they match
so we want to do something like a keys
map but what do we put here right we
need to do some logic here and there's
one extra step we have to take because
suggestions this could come back with
more suggestions and we have keys like
we get 20 suggestions right because
we're asking for all the suggestions
because the board can have more than one
suggestion right so as you can see right
here
this board has four suggests or five
suggestions so we actually need to do is
group those together so I'm going to
come up here to the top and import
lodash to help us with that from below -
okay and I'm going to say conf
gf standing for group suggestions is
equal to dot group by and we're going to
take this suggestions object and
actually is going to be an array of
objects and we're you want to grab one a
group by the port ID so for those of you
that are not familiar with how group I
works if what's going to turn into is so
suggestions look something like this
actually suggestions looks exactly like
this so we can ask you this right and
let's say we have we can have text hi
text by and then let's say we have a
third one text by two and this has a
board ID of two right so what it's going
to do is it's going to turn our array so
this is going to look something like
it's going to have an object and the
keys are going to be the values for
board ID so one and two and each one is
going to be an array
and the array is a grouping so it's
going to put this since this has a bore
ID of one right it's going to group
these guys together it's going to put
them here and since these two have a
bore ID of two it's going to group them
together and they're going to go in this
degree it's going to look like this
right and then we're going to map over
the keys and we're going to check our
grouped suggestions and we're going to
look for the key value so one we're
going to find one get the two we're
going to find two but let's say board
three doesn't have any suggestions so
we're going it undefined here so we're
we have no suggestions we just want to
return an empty array and we can get rid
of the keys okay so that is what our
code is doing there and so now what
we're returning is an array of arrays
and each array has suggestions now
assuming we have no errors we can come
back over here and see this working in
action so first I'm just going to run
this guy right here and we can get rid
of that to clear this run that and see
that run so let's run this a couple more
times
so as you can see looks like the time is
fairly similar oh well we hit a little
bit lower oh 16 milliseconds we can run
a couple more times so it's pretty
consistently below what we had before
and now if we come over here we can
actually see the query that's happening
so if I scroll down to the very bottom
so now instead you'll notice each one of
these so I was hitting the play button a
bunch but this is one graph QL query so
now we're making two database queries
for every graph query you're making so
you'll notice this is where our query is
turned into now so instead of doing a
select for every board ID we group it
together
and we grab it like that so we can just
run run run that a bunch of times and
see how much it runs
now that's batching right now caching we
get the same we get the same thing we
don't change our Co at all and it
automatically caches it for us too
so you saw this took over 200
milliseconds here over 100 milliseconds
to run right this is going to be super
fast same speed as you you're seeing
below right but we're running double the
query rate no because it actually caches
it for us
so you'll notice we're actually only
running this query once and to prove
that to you I'm just going to run
research the server so I'm going to
press the bun once and you can see it
alright so this is the query we're doing
right we run this so this is the query
it ran it selects the board twice which
is expected because we're not caching
board we only made a suggestion loader
but notice we only select suggestions
once that's pretty cool right this is
only called once even though we have two
queries here and if we weren't using
data loader as you saw it took double
the time because we are doing double the
database queries but here we do the same
amount I mean not counting the board of
course of per suggestions so that's a
huge increase and just saving your
database performance time and speeds up
your quest so I highly recommend if
you're not using data loader added to
your graph QL server speed up your
queries
this will help scale things and you
don't have to upgrade your servers your
database as much because your being
smarter with how you're coding your
resolvers now so highly recommend added
in this and you want to make sure and
add views for now you want you don't
have to always add these for all your
queries but when you see nested
relationships like between board and
suggestions
that's where data loader can be very
helpful so I highly recommend adding
this to your site so that is it for this
video guys if you have any questions
about data loader or had any trouble
setting it up please feel free to leave
a comment below it be happy help you
guys out because this is super crucial
to add to your site I highly recommend
and all the code again is going on
github and the link will be in the
description below
you're going to check this out and you
can add it to your website all right
thanks for watching I see in the next
