add a footer and react native using no
UI libraries using no extra libraries at
all just the built-in components that
you get with react native so here I have
the iOS simulator and here I have my
code this is a code from create react
native so anytime I change anything it
automatically refreshes over here so if
I say hi and then save this we should
see hi here instead of open so save
refreshes and I see hi there and I can
refresh back so that's what we're gonna
do is add a footer to this guy now this
is commonly used for button navigation
or tabs or many other things and this is
how all mouths show use how native base
does it and many other libraries that
are UI libraries so what they'll do is
you can't just like add a view and then
put text and then call this your footer
right because what will happen is this
guy won't actually go to the very bottom
it'll go right here now you might say
hey but there's some Styles affecting it
so let's get rid of these styles that
are on this view here and just look at
this and notice they're mashed up at the
top here so what we could do is say
style margin top like 10 pixels or other
just so it's not mashed up against the
top let's make it like more like 20 give
it a nice space so here we go here's our
stuff and you'll notice footer is here
up against this contact what we really
want is footer all the way at the bottom
so the way one way you can do this is by
using a scroll view so if I just say
scroll view
and then wrap everything you want in the
main body in your scroll view and then
here we end it because we want this to
be our footer here and then you notice
nothing happens till you only know their
last thing you do is flex this guy so
flex one and give it a save and you
notice bam our text is at the bottom now
and our stuff right here is there and
now you can scroll and do different
stuff and the footer text here stays the
same so let's just copy this a couple
times and we can see the text expand to
the bottom and we can see our footer
will always be there and I can copy this
right I can have footer multiple times
so I can put whatever I want my footer
here I could have a view and I could do
you know some flexing here as well and I
can have them expand I could have them
be a row flexing this makes you know
pops it up a little bit but I could say
maybe I want these to be columns instead
of rows different stuff but you get the
idea
I can style the footer and add different
I can add icons instead of texts but
this part right here this Scrolls but
this part here stays constant stays at
the very bottom and you can do the same
thing if you want something to stay at
the very top right so this is now a
header if you will so notice how when I
scroll up this guy stays at the top and
so it doesn't overflow it so all that's
doing is adding flex and then a scroll
view flex makes it expand their whole
width so that's why the scroll view is
taking up this part here and this part
here and that's why scroll view pops to
the very bottom or not scroll view but
the footer pops to the very bottom
because the scroll view is pushing it
all the way there and we can just see if
I do style what I like to do when I'm
doing these
is add the background color so for
example red and you can kind of see
where the boundary of it is so you know
how the boundary of this is right there
and we can see where the boundary of
this guy is just the containers so blue
we can kind of see oops background that
should be color we can see our main
scrollview containers taking up that
portion where our footer is just at the
bottom here in red exactly how we want
it so mix match scroll view scroll view
in regular views with a flex of one that
I'll get you the footer you want using
no extra UI libraries at all and that's
the way you can make a footer of your
own style as you want and whenever
you're trying to do containers I
recommend using this little trick set
the background colors so you can kind of
see where your components are and as you
for example if I change this to flex of
one we saw how that messed it up a
little bit and it popped up here we can
see how much it grows it says it for
this video guys
thanks for watching and I'll see in the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
