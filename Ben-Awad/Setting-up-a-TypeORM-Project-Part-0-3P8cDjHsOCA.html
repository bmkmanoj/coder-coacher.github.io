in a database and pretty much any web
application these days needs one and now
we need to be able to interface this
database so the database I want to use
is Postgres sequel and I really like
this arm called type arm integrates
really nicely with Postgres sequel and
typescript so we're gonna be starting
our project from scratch using their
boilerplate so if we scroll down on
their home page they have a couple of
different ways of how to install this if
you already have a project or prefer
creating it yourself you can follow the
manual installation but for us it's a
little bit easier just to do the
QuickStart so two things make sure you
have type form already installed
globally I already have this so I'm not
gonna run it but go ahead and run this
command right here if you don't already
and then we're gonna run this to
basically bootstrap our project so this
is gonna create a folder with some code
already in it so here we are I'm going
to go ahead and I've run this command
before so it has it auto complete but
what you want to do is do type form in
it the name of your project and then the
database I'm gonna be using Postgres so
that's what I put so after that we're
just going to open up that folder and
I'm gonna open up in my code editor and
I'm just gonna go ahead and close this
window here because I don't need it
anymore okay so you'll notice we have
some stuff over here I just want to real
quickly give you a rundown of what they
gave us
so TS config this is the configuration
for typescript we'll be switching this
file up with one of the ones I like to
use readme we can just kill that file
package.json we can see they give us
some dependencies in here TS node is
going to go ahead and compile our code
because we're gonna be using typescript
and then run it because we can't just
run note because behavior using
typescript and not javascript so this is
the typescript version of node you'll
notice we're using app types note this
downloads the typescript
types for standard node libraries that
come with node and then we have
typescript and then some other
dependencies here type warm this is a
library that type or muses and then PG
is the Postgres library package for node
okay and you'll notice we have a script
here if I run NPM start it's going to go
ahead and run TS note on source index
type script which is fine one thing you
might notice if you look at this closely
is actually some of these versions are
outdated so we could go in and reinstall
each one of these but there's a tool
that I like to use and it's called NPM
check updates I already have this
installed so I can run it but what you
do is you just do it and see you you
know go ahead and update your all your
versions so I would recommend here's the
installation right here I would
recommend installing this and upgrading
them so if I run and see you and I'm
just gonna upgrade all of them and it
looks like I need to update this but
here you'll notice our TS node no
typescript
reflect and Postgres all of these guys
were behind so I went ahead and upgraded
the versions so now I'm gonna go ahead
and run yarn and stahl all the latest
for all that ok and here we have the arm
config so this is another file this is
how we connect to the database so you're
gonna want to make sure you have
Postgres or whatever database you're
using installed on your computer so I
have mine installed and running and the
username I'm gonna say is Postgres and
the password is nothing so this is
basically the default for any database
that I create and I'm gonna call this
graph QL
- typescript - server
- boilerplate so this is the name of my
database and I'm gonna copy this if you
don't already have the database created
on your computer if you do yarn start
I'll go ahead and run the code and what
it's gonna try to do is connect to the
database and just make sure everything's
working so I currently don't have the
database created so I get this error so
if you get this that just means you need
to create your database you don't have
it create on your computer so I'm gonna
do create DB and then create that one
right there and go ahead and do yarn
start okay so if you get this little a
log you know your database is good and
you're able to connect to it okay so and
looks like we're done so it finished
executing next we can just look this is
our index dot typescript this stuff is
in here now we're not worried about this
this is just type arm stuff we're
actually gonna be removing this with
other stuff so what I want to do next is
actually go through the TS config change
this so here's the TS config that I like
to use so I'm gonna copy and paste this
in I'll link a video in the description
explaining what this does and why I use
some of these things next I want to set
up TS lint so I'm gonna go ahead and
Aeon ad and duty eslint
and also install this other package
called TS link config prettier so this
guy just makes it really nice to go
ahead and use TS lint with prettier
which formats might coat
so here's the TS lint file that i like
to use as well i'm just gonna copy this
config so TS length up json and i'll
link both of these files in the
description below so you can copy and
paste them as well if you want to use
the same setup as me okay so we have
that and we have that so we just changed
those two files so it's gonna change how
this is compiled and whatnot I'm just
gonna go ahead and reload this window so
it goes ahead and reads in the new
settings and I'm just going to run yarns
start again to make sure I didn't break
anything
when messing with the TS config file and
okay we're able to create a new user in
the database perfect alright so next up
i want to create basically the server
we're going to be using and the server
i'm using is graph QL yoga so this one's
really nice we could actually build our
own graph QL yoga server because
underneath it uses all these packages
right here so it's gonna be using
Express and Apollo server but it
packages up really nicely and takes a
lot of the work out of it which is
really nice so I like using it so we're
just gonna do yarn add and then we're
gonna just try to get this hello world
working so I'm just gonna paste this in
and now I'm gonna get remove everything
inside of index dot typescript except
for this reflect metadata I'm gonna keep
it because we need it for type arm and
let's just copy this guy paste them in
and the way I have it set up is I have
to specify the types for these and I'm
just gonna say any for now and then I'll
be discussing more in the future how
we're gonna be handling typing these
easily those are our resolvers okay so
we don't need this comment here and
let's go ahead and run this and see what
happens so yarn start so when this is
done I should be able to go to localhost
4000 run hello and we should get hello
back so this is gonna be our main means
of doing things so localhost 4000 and so
here's where we're gonna make our
queries and basically test out our code
or at least their graph QL resolvers
some of them run it we get hello back so
that is we're in it working nicely
lastly I want to just install yarn add
node month or no demon as I like to call
it and this is gonna be a little package
that just helps making developing easier
so if we go to our package at JSON I'm
gonna start it so this command right
here what it does is it executes TS node
and anytime that we make a change in our
code over here it's gonna automatically
restart our server so I don't have to
change it so
so if I do yarn start it'll start up my
server and notice how it says it's
watching and what that means is it's
watching the files over here so if
instead of hello I said bye and I save
this you'll notice it's restarting and
it starts back up which is really nice
so then over here I can run this and we
see it says bye world so then as we're
developing over here and I make changes
I don't have to come to the command mind
control C and then start it again
I can just leave it running in the
background and then it'll automatically
handle that alright awesome so this is
pretty much the base setup for this and
the next video will just take it from
here and start adding stuff so again the
code for all this is going to be on
github and the link will be in the
description below
