talk about flags now in previous videos
you've seen me do remove RF or copy our
and there's been like this little dash
and then our and it looks different than
all the other commands I didn't really
explain I just said type this command
and it works so now I'm going to explain
what that is and how it works so let's
call a flag and it's basically an option
for that command it gives you gives it
like a little different function or a
little bit different effect of how it
works it works a little bit differently
than if you rant without the fly so a
couple other things a couple other flags
they just want to share with you guys is
remember if i go to my home directory
romero I didn't LS and you saw these but
then when we were looking in finder and
we go to my home directory there's a
crapload of other files I have in here
we're only seeing these ones shown in
bold why is that well the main way that
LS works is it doesn't show any files
that start with a dot so notice is a dot
slime dot SSH knowledge stuff is dot
well let's see dots you have to use the
dash elf a flag excuse me so notice if i
do LS dash a and i hit enter wow that is
a lot of files all of a sudden because
it shows all the ones that start with
dots the other thing you can do is
what's known as a long listing which is
LS dash l this is just another way to do
LS it gives you a little bit more
information here it shows the
permissions on the file which I'll talk
about in a different video but what this
means I'm time you made it and you know
some other stuff here for that's really
not that important but the other thing
you can do is notice again i just did
LOL so it did not show all these files
again all it showed was these main ones
you can pair flags together so i could
do dash al and looky there we are now
getting a long listing and we're seeing
all files another thing you can do I
leave this is just for LS I could be
wrong I haven't looked too much into it
you can combine them together like that
that's another way to do it but most of
the time I will do two flags like this
not for LS because I usually see it like
this but for example if I'm doing remove
I'm pretty sure you can do remove RF
like that too there's some other ones
that I don't clump together it depends
on the command that i'm using but most
the time i will separate flags another
really cool one is with make der let's
say i want to create something like
folder one folder too and they don't
exist up doesn't let me because folder
one doesn't exist but i want to create
this whole path i want to create
multiple files well you can do make
terse Dash P and what that I'll do is
I'll make the whole path so you do F 1 /
f2 f3 f4 and now if I do an LS on f1 you
notice there's an F to do an LS on f1 f2
and you notice that's the whole bunch is
there so that allows you to make the
whole path of a directory and there's
lots of other flags for almost every
command that I've shown you so far
there's tons of them well how do you
know what you know flags they have and
what it does well there's something
called man and so I'm just going to
clear this man and then you type the
name of the command that you want to
know information on for example I would
like two more no more about LS this
command if i hit enter you'll then be
put up to this page that looks super
weird you notice your cursors down at
the bottom what this is is called manual
page and it shows you some information
about the commands and also shows you
these flags here and what you scroll
through this and actually look at what
it does to scroll
use j to go down k to go up and if you
hit the space bar that goes down a full
page and then once you're done if you
hit Q you'll exit out so we can look at
copy and you can do this for all the
commands so I'm just going to go through
I can look at the different things that
we can do are going to be a dash a with
coffee can do dash F and it tells you
what it does so that's pretty helpful so
that's it for today that's so good
important ones to remember LS dash a
gives you all the files I think that
including ones that start with a dot L
gives you a long listing it gives you a
little bit more information make der
dash p gives you the whole path like
that and it builds everything you see
that whole thing and then a man and in
the name of a command will give you the
manual page so you're able to look at
what that command does super helpful
super good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
