you how to download and set up any
javascript project that you want to run
on your computer that you find off of
github now for this example i'm going to
show you off using my action application
which is a react native app but it
doesn't matter you could be downloading
a web application anything less
javascript it would generally do it in
this way so this first thing you'll do
you'll click on this clone or download
button I'm going to click this to copy
it to my clipboard and then I'm going to
come over to terminal and now you need
to have git installed on your computer
which I do so I can then do git clone
and then the URL that we just copied
over and at the end I can specify a name
like we could say sample one and it
would download and sample one just tells
it what you want the folder name to be
so sample one and I can see all the code
was just downloaded off of github onto
my computer now we're not done yet
I can't just run this JavaScript
application what you need to do is you
need to install its dependencies and to
do that you need you have two choices
usually you'll be doing NPM install or
MPN I and you can just run that it'll go
and it'll fetch all the dependencies
right the other way is if they have yarn
setup you need to have a yarn lock
that's how you know over yarn you can
also just run yarn even if it isn't set
up it will set up for you
I prefer doing yarn if you don't have
yarn it's just an alternative to NPM you
also use if I use them in conjunction it
just installs things a lot faster than
NPM I found so we'll go and it will
fetch all of the pittance fees right and
then that's it you install the
dependencies and if you do not have yarn
and you want to get it you can do it
like this the yarn you can do NPM
install global yarn and you can start
installing so if they aren't like that
so just to recap you'll clone it off of
github and then you'll come in do npm
install or a yarn installer dependencies
and then you could run it which is
usually npm start and it'll run the job
trip application
now there's one other important thing
when I'm running let's see if I did it
if you'll notice how I have a node
modules folder on my local machine but
if you look here there's no node modules
to be found here all the folders there's
not a node modules folder you should not
be putting your node modules folder on
github this is very important I see a
lot of people doing this it's important
not to if you're going to put something
on github that you don't want to put
node modules to get node modules you get
that after I do MPM install or yarn so
you'll notice in all my projects you
won't see a single node modules package
because you should be creating node
modules on your computer with a p.m.
install after you close library and so
to avoid adding it to your project or
advocatehub you want to edit your git
ignore now you see you might get ignore
I have node modules right here so it's
just a single line there's a bunch over
to each stuff in here you don't worry
about that but node modules you specify
it like this and it will ignore it when
you use and get and you're putting it on
to github and that way it won't add it
and important all right that's all I
wanted to show and share with you guys
is important not to add your node
modules on to github and you get the
node modules by using yarn or NPM
install by the way I don't know if I was
clear about this mpfi is the same as
that is the same as in PM install so
make sure okay that's it for this video
guys
thanks for watching I'll see you in the
next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
