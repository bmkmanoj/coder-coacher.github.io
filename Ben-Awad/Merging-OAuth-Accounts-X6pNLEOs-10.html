merging ooofff accounts so this is a
concept where when you have multiple
ways to login so for example you could
allow people to log in with Facebook and
Google and Twitter and they can log in
with just a username and password and
someone can click Facebook for the first
time I login but then for the next time
they might just log in with the email
and password if they had registered with
that before so what you want to do is
you don't want to create two separate
accounts one for their Facebook and one
for their username and email or their
email and password but merge those
accounts together so they have one
account or both the email and password
and the Facebook ID merge together and
the same thing if they then log in with
Google you merge those into one so I'm
gonna be showing you how to do that so
here I have my user model you'll notice
I used to split off the Facebook stuff
into a different table but I only really
care about the Facebook ID in this case
so if I'm only caring about one ID I'm
just gonna go ahead and put that in the
table itself so I have this in the user
table and you'll notice I created an
index for it and that's because I'm
gonna be searching it whenever the user
logs in with Facebook so I figured it'd
be a good idea to make it index I could
probably index the email field too but
I'm not sure if that's a good idea to
index that as well and it might be
already index with E because it's unique
I can't remember if it auto indexes or
not but anyway
sidenote so we have the Facebook ID here
then we have and username email and
password now we could replicate this
let's say if we had a Facebook or a
Twitter this could be a Twitter ID this
could be a Google ID any other Roth's
that you want to do you can do the same
concept and then what I'm using is
passport if you've seen my earlier
videos I show you how to set this up
passport with Facebook that way you can
do OAuth I changed a little bit how it
works you'll notice also I'm using
locals host a guy post in the comments
showing
how to do this that's super nice
basically you do not need to do in grok
to test this locally you can just have
your callback your relative local coast
um if you don't know I'm talking about
don't worry about it
so here I'm also this isn't our
important one how do I emerge accounts
emerging when the email is the same so
if I have a different email that I'm
using for Twitter and then my Facebook I
can't really merge those accounts
because you don't know if they're the
same thing you only really want to merge
when they use the same email so that's
what we're doing and to get the email
from Facebook we have to ask for the
email scope and then we say we want to
get the ID and the email when we
actually do OAuth with Facebook so now
there's three cases when the user clicks
our ooofff button on our website they is
either their first time clicking the
facebook login button they've logged in
with facebook before or they have
registered an account on our website
with that email so here's the first
thing that happens profile is what we
get back from the facebook o auth after
they log in with their account we get
their email and their ID so I'm storing
the email value and value and the ID and
ID and then the first thing I'm doing is
I'm going to search my database to see
if the user is in the database at all so
I'm looking for an ID where the Facebook
ID is that or an email to see if this
email is already in our database so the
first thing I check is if we even get a
user back at all if we have the ID or
the email in the database if we don't we
know this is their first time clicking
the button or you know that email is not
associated with any accounts so what
we'll do is we go ahead and create a
user for them passing in the ID and the
email and then we just do the call back
regularly now let's say they log in
again and they've logged in previously
with Facebook we're gonna check if they
have a Facebook ID if they already have
a Facebook ID that's fine we keep going
right we don't need to create another
user account for them so
if they have a Facebook ID because we
created one from right here then when we
fetch this user the users going to exist
and they're gonna have an ID so they're
good we don't have to worry about it we
don't need to do anything else but case
three is when they've previously
registered with an email and we'll see
this an example in a second and when
they've registered with an email what we
want to do is actually the Facebook ID
is gonna be null right because they did
not sign up with Facebook they signed up
with just an email so then we just set
the Facebook ID which successfully
merges the accounts together so that's
what this merge is doing here I'm just
updating this user and setting the ID so
let's see this in action and what this
looks like so here right here is a
little form I'm gonna go ahead and
register so I'm gonna use my email here
that is associated with my Facebook
account let me go ahead and register my
registration worked and I'm gonna come
over here and login so if I were to log
in with this account let's see what my
first off this is PC cool so I can look
at the Postgres sequel database and I'm
just gonna select the user and we can
kind of see here's the result you notice
we have this password here that's long
that's why this is stretching out and
the Facebook IDs right here and it is
blank and let's just select a few fields
so it's not so long so ID Facebook ID
username email okay and you'll notice
how the Facebook ID is actually blank
and that's because of course we didn't
login with Facebook so now when the user
logs in with Facebook we're gonna know
hey this email is the same one as the
Facebook and they'll fill this value in
so but first let's login so oops double
clicked it but the login worked you'll
notice our user ID is 1 and then if I
login with Facebook
I just redirect to home you'll notice
the user ID is one if we come back over
here we do a select you'll notice how
the Facebook ID is now filled in and we
only have one user still we did not
create a new user so that's very
important so now I want to show you how
this works
the other way so let's say they did
Facebook first and then they registered
for an account because that can happen
too that's weird but it can happen the
first case which I just showed you is
more common I'm just going to come down
here and I have force true which will
reset the database for us that way we
can start over and here's what the
resolver now looks like so if they
logged in with Facebook first we're
gonna be setting only the Facebook ID
and email so the username and the
password are gonna be null so what I can
do is I can check where the email and
password
I could also check the username but I
didn't worry about it but basically the
password is null but the email exists so
then we know there is a previous account
that has that email well not a previous
account they previously logged in with
Facebook because the passwords in all so
then what we're doing is we're just we
already know this how they have a
previous account so we're just updating
the username and password otherwise if
they don't have a previous account they
didn't login with Facebook before we
just create that user right early so
let's take a look at that so I'm gonna
first log in with Facebook
nice so we have we're all logged in I
can do slash register if I come over
here we notice how the username is blank
and if we also grab the password that
should be null as well so then we're
gonna do this check so I'm about to
register write the values come in we're
gonna find where the email is equal to
been Awad because that's when we put
here so and then a wand and then the
password the password is null which we
saw that value in the database we're
gonna hash the password like usual and
the previous account will exist because
we just logged in Facebook and we see it
in the database so then we're gonna
update the username and password so it's
all good so let's go ahead and register
we update the user now if I come back
over here we notice how my username has
been in my passwords here so now I can
come in and register so no matter how I
register it's gonna get the same or no
matter how I login now I get the same
thing so if I log in log in worked and
my user IDs one or I can log in with
Facebook and my user ID is one so pretty
neat this is important just to keep the
accounts all in sync and you don't want
the user logging in with a different
thing and then losing their account
status you don't want to create a new
one for them and so you would take this
same approach over here with the
Facebook ID how I'm doing it in this a
auth here you would do that same thing
if you had a let's say Google OAuth or a
Twitter author any type of OAuth to
merge the account based on the email
field so that is it for this video guys
links in description below with the code
up on github if you want to check out
either this code or the front-end code
that runs this because this front-end is
in react right now so that's it for this
video guys thanks for watching I'll see
in the
next one
