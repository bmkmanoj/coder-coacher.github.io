little icon here that we could click on
and we could add a new channel but we
weren't seeing it show up after we
created the channel we would have to
refresh so we're going to do now is
update the cache so we actually see it
pop up right when we create it and we're
also gonna fix a little bug that we have
so if I come over here to view team the
way we were doing it is if we don't say
what team ID we have if you come into
our code up here we just say grab the
first index so we check if there's a
current ID given otherwise we just say
grab the first index of the team and so
this causes a little bug in our code so
if I try to create team knows how it
craps out and the reason for that is if
we take a look at current team it's not
available right so we just get grabbed
the team with the first one and if we
look down here we're using the current
team ID so instead of using the current
team ID we should use team ID and that
will give us the actual team that we
have open and then that error will go
away so let's see
c5 creates it okay give it a little
refresh and we see it there perfect okay
so next we're gonna see this pop up and
the way we're gonna do this is with the
update so I'm gonna copy this this is
from the documentation of Apollo graph
QL run the optimistic UI section they
have how to update so we're gonna come
over here to add channel modal and this
happens after we mutate or in this
mutate function so I'm gonna paste in
this and I'm just going to save this so
how this works is this update function
gets the data back from whatever we
updated and what you can do is you can
read a graph QL query and then update
that query so here their update they're
reading a comic query and then adding a
comment to it so what we want to do is
actually read the
query that we have here the all teams
query and then update it by adding the
new channel we just created now we need
to be able to access this query from
here so we're gonna refactor a little
bit of our code and bring the all the
queries and mutations into a file out
here so I'm just gonna create a new
folder called graph QL and I'm gonna
create a new file called team J s and
then here I'm an import gql from graph
QL tag and then I'm just gonna export
what we have in our sidebar here so get
rid of that and paste it here and it
doesn't like it because this is our only
export but we'll be adding more exports
than the futurism and ignore this red
line and so here I'm now instead of
importing there I'm just gonna import
the query so it was all team's query so
all teams query and it was from up up
graph QL / teams and unable to resolve
graph QL / O's team not teams and we're
gonna do the same thing in our ad
channel modal up here
so now we have this all team's query and
we can grab that because this is what we
want to update so when we read this end
we're gonna read what the current query
we have saved in the cache and I'm gonna
get rid of these comments here so we
want to do is we want to read data and
then for us and we can console.log this
data so you can kind of see what it
looks like I'll show it to you but I
believe we should have this structure so
we should have in all teams and then we
should have channels so I don't know if
all teams is going to be here or if it's
just channels I want to say it's just
channels just from the way that the
comments worked so I'm gonna push a new
channel now the channel here we get data
back from this mutation so we really
want to get the channel that we created
so here when we create a channel instead
of returning a boolean what I want to
return is a channel and I'm gonna make
this Noble so we have a chance to
actually return a null Channel and while
we're at it we should actually just do a
channel response and creating okay which
is a boolean
a channel and that's of type channel and
then any errors we get we don't expect
any errors for this but just in case
channel response so look at that a save
now the data we get the name of it is
going to be the name of our mutation so
the name of our mutation here is create
channel so I'm gonna call it create
Channel and the data that's gonna be
here is this response object so we're
gonna have an OK channel and airs so
we're gonna say we only really want to
update if create channel is okay so we
can get rid we can get the okay and the
channel from the create channel and we
can say if ok then we want to do stuff
and actually what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say if not okay we'll just
return so then we're gonna read our
query and now we're returning the
channel that we just created here so
that's what we can push on to our
channels object here oops so I'm gonna
set channels our Channel and then we
just write this query back to the store
and this will update the cache and the
query that we're doing is the same query
we have here I'm sorry same query we
have here which is all teams query so
we'll I'll put this data so you can see
it looks like but this looks pretty good
now because we changed our create
channel here we actually need to select
the fields so we want to get okay we
also want to get channel and from our
channel we want the selection field to
match what we're selecting here so ID
and fragment there sorry ID and name so
we could set up a fragment but this is
very simple that I don't even
think it's worth so ID and name here
we're gonna grab the ID and name as well
and then when we update it should be the
same so let's take a look at this so if
we open up our console ok new channel
we'll call it c6 run it and bad requests
I'll see what the error is
oh we also need to change our resolver
so I don't see any errors here but we
changed our channel response so now we
need to change our channel resolver I
forgot about that so now here is a Const
Channel and return okay which is true
and then our Channel and then here we
can import the format errors and return
those as well
you know it will console.log tears in
case there's any so okay is false and
Aires is equal to format errors air okay
so let's give that a run again refresh
oh and our server just need a second to
restart okay so now C 6 and we getting
the same thing so let's see we're
getting no error here let's see what
that says so network err request failed
with 404 not 404 it's just bad request
so not sure what that is so I'm gonna
have over here to Apollo
this keeps track of the mutations that
happen so here's the mutation that we
just ran and I'm gonna say show and
graph QL and I'm just gonna try oh that
should be name not named I wonder if
that's the only thing that's messed up
so what I can do is I can actually run
this see what the responses and that's
being really slow I don't know if this
the dev tools is just slow or if it's my
server
let's try running it here too so see
seven and let's see ok so we have all
teams and then all teams and then we
want to get the first team and then
channels
okay yeah so all teams and then we need
to know which team we're currently on so
we know which channel to push to so
we're not passing it anything in the
props are we we're passing the team ID
so actually we can fact we can find this
so Kant's team the index of the team and
the way we're gonna do it is the same
way we're doing it over here with the
find index
oops we could also pass the index in
that would work too but this is not too
bad
so find index of data all teams and
we're looking for the ID where the ID
matches team ID and the team ID is
coming from the props here and then
we're gonna grab that team ID so if we
find the team and all teams that we want
and then we grab the channels and we're
pushing the channel on to it so refresh
that so let's do a c8 so no air is here
and we can see c8 pops up right away so
cool so that's working now and update
happens after the mutation actually
completes if you want to make this even
faster you can do what's called
optimistic UI and the way this works is
it'll automatically run and if we copy
this so before the mutation even runs
it'll update the UI so we don't have to
wait for the server to respond and what
we do is we just populate our view with
fake data or the data that we know we
should be getting so I'm gonna call this
create Channel
because that's the name of our mutation
and the type name here is channel and
there's only two props here so an ID so
we don't know what the ID is gonna be
because we haven't actually created it
yet but the name we know what the name
is gonna be and so the name is the
values dot name so the point of this is
to update the UI and show the name of
the channel before we even get the
response from the server and it will
automatically go away if we get a bad
one you know we just forgot missing
field okay oh yeah so here we have to do
the whole response object so okay is
true and then channel is equal to this
guy so now we rerun that c10 and so this
will just be faster to see the UI change
than if you do update so missing field
type name and
wants me to do a type name I guess it
wants me to add a type name to this I
don't even know what I would add that
for the type name for this honestly if I
go to Apollo I should be able to look at
the store though and I can see what the
values actually I can look at the query
right or it's a mutation I can see the
return
okay so we're asked we're also grabbing
the type name of create channel I guess
that is a mutation let's try adding then
I actually don't know what the type name
should be here let's see c11 now okay
seems to be happy it's updating looks
good so now there's one last thing I
want to do real quick so when I click on
these I'd like to switch which channel
I'm on so the way we're gonna do that is
we don't need this add channel modal
anymore in our sidebar here we have the
current team we're on what we have here
and we're passing the channels in right
what I also want to do is pass in a team
ID so the team that ID so that way in
our channels when I click on a channel
I'm gonna use this team ID to actually
create the URL because what the URL we
want to do is the team ID and then
whatever the channel ID is so if I come
over here to my channels we now have a
team ID object or prop coming in and
we're gonna just pass that to our our
map function so
this is gonna be X comma I and we're
gonna pass to our Channel and I'll
channel I don't know if it's analyzing I
nope it's not using I so we're not going
to pass I in so X is our actual channel
we gets called a C and then we're also
going to pass in a team ID which we grab
up here so in our team ID we now want to
make this guy clickable and we need to
add a link so a link and this is coming
from react router dong and we're just
gonna wrap our sidebar item
and to create the URL like I said we're
gonna be using going to slash view team
and we're gonna grab the team ID and
then the ID of the channel area and I
messed this up this should be an M cool
so now when I click on the different
channels okay they look like links now
check the top-level render called
oh Sh I have a key I just need to move
the key up to the link like we did last
time okay so now if I click on this
notice up here the URL changes each time
the team stays static because they're on
the same team but the channel itself
changes but you'll notice hash tank
general does not change and the reason
for that is we are not really passing
the channel in and our channel is kind
of locked in our sidebar right here when
we really need it in our view team we
need to pass it to our header and our
send message so what we're gonna be
doing in the next video is lifting our
state up so their state lives and more
in our view team or at least the graph
QL query well so we can pass it to our
sidebar our send message and our header
so everyone has access to what our
current channel name is but that is it
for this video guys we're now able to
create channels and then switch to them
as you can see that you're also changing
as we're so now we just need to be able
to handle the switch in our UI on the
right and then very soon we're gonna be
getting into adding other users to our
teams and then finally doing some
real-time chatting with subscriptions so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
