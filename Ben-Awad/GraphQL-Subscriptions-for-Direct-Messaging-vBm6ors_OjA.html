as user Bob and over here I'm signed in
as user Tom and when I'm chatting
between these two guys in a direct
message I want to see the messages pop
up in real-time so and I'm like hey Tom
- I want to see it pop up
I shouldn't have to refresh the page for
the message to come so the way we're
gonna get this working is with graphic
you'll subscriptions and we're gonna do
it similar to how we did with the
channel over here and how I can just
type and it pops up right away so that's
what we're gonna be working on but we're
gonna make it work with direct messages
so right now we have it all commented
out on our front end but this is the
subscriptions stuff for our messages so
we're gonna go to our back end and get
this working for direct messages so for
our messages we created a type called
subscription and we're gonna do the same
thing so I'm going to copy that for our
direct messages schema so here I'm going
to create a type subscription and then
here miss a new direct message now and
then we're going to send a direct
message so to subscribe to direct
message you need to tell us the team ID
so int and then also the user ID so for
example over here I would like to
basically listen for subscriptions for
team one chatting with Tom so any
messages that I send or receive from Tom
I'd like to see here while I am in team
one okay so that's what I need to pass
now let's create the actual resolver for
this and we can copy how we did our
resolver here so this is our message
resolver we're good subscription I'm
going to copy that paste it here
now we have this permission thing here
we're going to create a new permission
for this and we created this little
pub/sub object here I'm gonna create
just like a little folder for this I'm
gonna call it pub sub J s and we're just
gonna export default new pub sub because
you want to use all nice it just
automatically imported that for me
except it got it from the wrong place I
think that's a new visual studio code
feature where it tries to auto import
for you so we're gonna create a new pub
sub here and that's because we want to
use the same pub sub across our whole
application okay so now over here
instead of saying new pub sub I'm just
going to import my pub sub so import pub
sub from the pub sub file that we just
created and I'm gonna do the same thing
over here and my direct message and
we're gonna be filtering on this guy too
so I'm gonna copy the graphic UL
subscriptions with filter okay so I
called it new direct message and then
here we're gonna create a permission for
this we're gonna say requires so you
need to have team access we're gonna
just call this direct message
subscription
um Direct Message subscription so we're
just gonna make a specific permission
for this exact resolver and then here
we're gonna create our event so I'm
gonna say Kant's new direct message and
we're gonna copy that paste in there so
this is what we're going to issue and
now in our basically our filter here
we're in a check so in the payload I
think we're gonna pass the receiver ID
and the sender ID so we just want to
make sure we're given in the args if we
come over here we just pass team ID and
user ID and we need to know actually the
current user ID which I don't know is if
that's in the args as well
so why don't we just pass in
so user ID we want to subscribe to and
current user and actually we don't want
to pass in the current user ID because
then they could pass in something
they're not
we basically need to read the token to
know who the who you are and we're not
passing the token in with our
subscription here so we actually don't
know who you are unless I can't remember
actually maybe we are so if I go over to
my index we can see slacks over here
real nope that's my model resolvers
schema index so scroll down bottom okay
so we are we are passing the models and
user okay so I do have the user in the
context and that's fantastic so that's
what I wanted I believe we're passed a
context for this yep looks like we are
past the context so we can grab the user
from this perfect okay so the first
thing is payload team ID is equal to R
because that team ID so we'll pass the
team ID that we're creating message for
and then we're gonna say and and then in
our boolean expression here we want to
make sure user died ID that we get from
the args and the user ID here either the
sender or the receiver so payload sender
ID so the sender ID is equal to user ID
user ID and the payload dot receiver ID
is equal to the other guys so that's
gonna be args that user ID so either
this is the case right so the current
user is the sender and the other guy is
the receiver or it's vice-versa so we
want to check both of those so we're
gonna
but another we've gonna another
parenthesis air and we're gonna say or
and then here we're gonna say payload uh
sender ID is equal to args that user ID
so we're just making sure these guys are
both involved in this receiver this
message and then receiver ID is equal to
user ID cool so if we get the right team
and what both of these guys are the
sender or the receiver that's what we
pass a message to them so let's create
also our permission right here the
direct message subscription so that's
going to be in our permissions over here
and we're gonna export kant's and I'm
just gonna copy this because it's gonna
be very similar so we need to think
about who do we want to allow to
subscribe this and we're say oops equal
sign who do we weren't allowed to
subscribe to this this messaging that's
happening between Bob and Tom so it can
only really be either Bob or Tom
subscribing to this and Bob and Tom have
to be part of the team so what we're
gonna do is
we have the team ID given to us from the
args and we also know the user so we're
basically just going to make sure both
users are part of the team so the user
that we get here and this user ID so we
don't care about channel here so here
we're gonna check and make sure they're
authenticated the same check as we were
doing before just making sure the person
who's subscribing is logged in and here
we want to check and Boop's we want to
find all and well we want to basically
find too so we're gonna see members and
we want to say where the team ID is
equal to the team ID up here and then
they use their ID is equal to either
this or equal to this guy's user ID so
we're going to do an or here and we
didn't or in the last video so I'm going
to copy how we did that and paste it in
here
so basically we just say either it meets
this condition so the user ID is equal
to user ID or the user ID is equal to
the user to ID and I forgot a comma
somewhere here you about that's safe
okay so you're expecting to find two
members here that are part of this team
so we're finding the team and then we're
finding two members we're either their
user ID is the one that they got passed
in or the user ID that we get from the
user that's authenticated that we get
from the token so here we're going to
say if not members dot length equal to
two so if it's not equal to two we don't
get two members throw an error something
went wrong so there's like multiple
things that could go wrong here like one
of the members you tried to subscribe to
is not part of the team or we only that
user doesn't exist something like that
so we're just going to throw something
went wrong here
because we expect to get two users back
okay so that's good authentication for
our subscription route for direct
messages let's create the actual
subscription where we pub/sub this so
that's down here so when we create a new
direct message we want to alert the
subscription about it so I'm gonna
comment this and here we are gonna say
async function that we're gonna run and
we're going to pub/sub stuff now we made
this an async function last time because
I wanted to grab the current user from
the models but we actually don't need to
do this I'm gonna here with that
and I actually did a database call for
no reason because the reason we did that
last time is we wanted to get the
username of that user but we already
have the username because we're storing
it in our JWT token if we check the auth
over here see how we're storing the
username so we don't actually have to
look up the username we actually know it
already and if we look at our front-end
over here we need to pass back an ID of
the direct message the sender the text
and created app so we're gonna say new
channel it's not what we want we want
new direct message the name here this is
very important so this is what its gonna
be passed to our front-end and
everything this name has to match the
name we have up here so new direct
messages here so we're gonna do new
direct message here and then here I'm
gonna put direct message and then we
have to do dot data values because this
thing is a sequel eyes object not a
regular object and here the sender we
want to get its username and the user
name of the sender we just grab from the
user and grab their user name and that
should have all the fields that we want
and this looks pretty good on our
back-end so let's try calling the
subscription now on our front-end and
I'm just gonna open up console nothing's
crashing that's good so over here I'm
going to comment this guy out and I'm
gonna say direct message subscription
and this here we're gonna get a team ID
and a user ID and this is basically the
user we want to subscribe to and so this
is gonna be new direct message and we're
gonna just pass in our team ID and our
user ID and then here this stuff here
that we want it to match what we are
getting here so I'm gonna copy that and
we're just going to get rid of the seus
lint warning now cuz we are gonna be
using component will mount this this all
this stuff and comment this stuff now
real quick we're gonna be making changes
to this SUBSCRIBE function so component
will mount we need to pass in the team
ID and the other stuff but real close
what I want to talk about is a lot of
people had issues with this subscribe
function now this is something I kind of
glazed over which is my fault so if you
put curly braces around it like this
you're not actually returning anything
here you need to return this function
because subscribe to more will return
the unsubscribe function which is what
we're using so getting rid of those if
you don't have curly braces and arrows
just pointing to this you're good but if
you use curly braces make sure to return
this function here okay so now for
subscribing we need two things right so
we need a team ID and a user ID so new
direct message or not yeah it's new
direct message my autocomplete just is
not working oh I didn't call this new
direct message subscription area new
direct message subscription
and the variables here we're going to
get a team ID and a user ID now in our
update query we're going to update the
direct messages so direct messages and
the name of this is the name right here
and we're gonna say previous direct
messages and then subscription data new
direct message and new direct message
here matches the name that we have here
okay so now what we just need to call
the SUBSCRIBE function with team ID this
is good so when we unmount we're going
to unsubscribe when we mount we're going
to subscribe passing in the channel ID
and then we receive new props we're also
going to change this what we're
subscribing to so I believe we're giving
the team ID and the user ID in the props
here and I'm doing this wrong so let's
fix that real quick so we should be
getting it from the props and variables
goes inside of options we learned this
in the last video area so the props
object options can take a function that
passes props and we return a new object
like that
so in our props we have a team ID and
this that user ID which is what we want
to access up here so this stuff props
dot team ID and this dot props props dot
user ID
okay and then same thing here we're
gonna grab a team ID and a user ID and
we're gonna say this dot props that team
ID is not equal to team ID or
this stop props not user ID so either
one of the IDS changed right is gonna
cause us to Reese absque Ribe so we're
an unsubscribe don't we ever subscribe
to and then recibir passing in our team
ID and user ID okay that was a lot of
work let's see if all this hard work
pays off and we're able to subscribe
with no errors now so let's look at our
console looks like we subscribed okay
I'm gonna refresh here to make sure we
subscribe there as well oops we don't
need to look at the page source inspect
console no errors here real-time
messaging alright we get data here but
we don't see anything update here yet
alright let's see what happened there
did anything crash on the server nothing
crashed on the server are we subscribing
it's console.log we just subscribed
that's me this is very odd we're getting
no air is just no response whatsoever so
this is us subscribing so let's make
sure that happens and then on our server
side we can console.log weather I think
what's happening is probably oh I know
what's happening we're not passing our
little our guys right here so we made
this nice little filter function but we
forgot to pass in all the data so we
need to pass in here our team ID the
sender ID and the receiver ID
okay so I believe a lot of these are
coming from the args let's look at our
schema for direct messaging so a direct
message we have the team ID and the
other user ID oh sorry that was for that
our direct message has receiver ID&amp;amp;T
mighty cool over here so we can say args
team ID and our receiver ID and then the
sender is whoever the current user is so
user to ID alright so now let's see if
we get subscriptions now you see we get
this little error here because the
server is down for a minute I'm gonna
restart restart we see real-time
messaging we both just subscribed and
won awesome now we can subscribe to our
messages em too and we can send it from
our user Tom hey Bob and we see Tom pop
up over here so very cool we have
real-time subscriptions working and I'm
just gonna get rid of that console log
that we add here we don't need it
anymore and let's just make sure
switching to direct messaging to
different people works so here I'm
talking to Bob I'm gonna come over here
and talk to Jim would be like hey Jen
that works and I pop back over to Tom
and I'm like hey Tom so be able to
subscribe and everything looks good
cool so that's it for this video guys we
got Direct Message subscriptions working
nicely so it's very cool and the next
video what we're gonna be doing is I'll
show you how I like to test and graph QL
so we're gonna be testing out some
graphical resolvers and making sure
everything is working how we expect it
to so I'll be putting this code up on
github and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
