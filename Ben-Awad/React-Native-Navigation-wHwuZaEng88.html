going to show you how to move to
different pages in your application and
use navigation and this video remember
using react router looks this is a nice
library it's very popular and lets you
create scenes and each scene corresponds
to a component where you have a react
component and you can switch between the
different components in and out for
different pages so I'm assuming you have
a basic react native app setup and if
you don't I have a video down below in
the description you can click it and it
will show you how to set a basic react
native app up so I'm going to do is on
this up the route so I'm going to create
a route component and might create that
locally and then I'm just going to
render that so we can get rid of this
stuff this is just the index of my
project currently I'm in source index
and there is you can see there's nothing
else is just a vanilla project okay I'm
going to create a folder called routes
and insider routes
I'm going to call a creative index jf
and just do from here and we hear that
for now okay so over here we actually
just copy this and pork react from react
okay so now we're importing two things
scene router and react native router
folks and before you get too far let's
actually download this library because
they don't think it downloaded it yet to
download it you can use NPM bur yarn I'm
going to use yarn I'm just a yarn add
react native router flux so this is an
alternative to just using the navigator
that react native supplies alright and
we don't need this all this stuff we can
just pare it down
I like doing peer functions when I can
export default and then we'll do that
and tab it over okay so right now we
have three routes each each each one we
right now don't have a component for it
I'm just going to create one page that
way we can see this so when I create
page one AF and I'm just going to say
import react from react export default
import and return grab text from react
native so you can say text hello from
page one okay now we could create a
you're going to want to make a scene for
each component that you want to switch
to so I'm going to call this page one
and notice how we have a route scene you
can also basically add some styling if
you want to you can have a basically a
troop component so I could have a
component here that renders on every
single one of these scenes but for now
let's keep it very basic so we'll do
page one and then for title of say page
one now I'll show you what this looks
like so I'm going to refresh the app let
that rebuild and you notice how we can't
see the text hello from page one all we
see is this big page one and that's
actually coming from this title page one
here and it's this is not really
something you usually want for an
application so a lot of times I'll do
hide nav bar and that just gets rid of
it because you do want to add your own
and now we can see hello
page one and also I can use initial
initial means this will be basically my
home page my home route okay
and also if you're not too familiar with
new with react or the new JavaScript
this is equivalent to doing this just
putting just adding it here the prop
name okay
so to show you guys kind of how to
switch between pages I'm going to create
two more pages page two and page three
I'm sewing your route of initial we
don't want that when it we can hide the
nav bar though so you could think of
these as the pages in your application
so we will create a view text and a
button so say hello from page one and
we'll create this as a view and then I'm
going to create some buttons and what I
want to do here is we'll say title page
go to page page two and then what I want
to do is on press when they click this
button actually take them to page two
and how you can do this is you can
import actions from react native router
folks and then here you can say actions
dot and then the name of your page we
call that page two and then you can pass
parameters in but for now we don't have
anything so we can just pass an empty
object in and if we come back over here
you'll notice how notice how I said pay
actions lot page two this is the same
thing you use as your key so if I call
this page nine I want to put page nine
over here okay and now I want to create
another button for page three
- take me to page 3 okay so now I have
two buttons rotation you need to page
two and page three so I'm just going to
copy this component and create a page
two and on page two here I'm just going
to change this to go to page one and
we'll say hello from page two and now we
can copy that go to page three now we
have all three components change that
now I can go ahead and refresh this
application since giving you changes and
now we'll see this two buttons now we're
on page one so if I click on this you
notice how it slides over and we can go
to the next page now we're on page two
now you click on this so I can go to
page three can you pack page to go to
page one and you can notice I'm
transitioning in and out of the
different route that's pretty cool so
that's how you switch between pages
using react router and this is really
nice really easy way see how simple this
wasn't set up and now we have all these
different pages that we can swap - and
now what you usually will do is setup in
your app later is you'll come on over to
maybe your page one you'll do some stuff
and then you can actually call these
you'll have to call this actions and
your component you can also call them
for example in a reducer or not a
reducer of course but say in saga
you're doing some async stuff or maybe
and Redux observable so you can call
these things either with fun clicks you
can hook them up to anything all you
have to do is actions dot and the name
of the page you want to go to so super
cheap super easy to transition to
different pages so that's how you set up
react router for react router in flux
whether it's called react native router
flux that's how you set it up now you
have navigation and you're reactivate of
app so I hope that helps if you have any
questions feel free to leave a comment
below and I'd be happy to help thank you
