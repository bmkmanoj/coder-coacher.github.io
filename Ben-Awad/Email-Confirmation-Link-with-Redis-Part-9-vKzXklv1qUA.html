fix our register test well not really
fix it but take one of the suggestions
that you guys gave I thought this was
great and we kind of have it broken up
into different parts now and just lets
you do this in a better way so instead
of having tests at the top here we can
call this describe and this is gonna
basically describe a bunch of tests so
here we are registering a user right and
we're basically testing the registering
a user function in multiple different
ways and we can wrap each one in its own
test block so I can say give it a string
of what we're testing and inside of that
I can do async code like so and then I
can move like for example this bit of
code here this is where I register a
single user and then I register another
user and make sure that you can't have
duplicate emails so check that all will
just say check for duplicate emails and
we don't really need the comment here
now and then we can do the same thing
below now we can use test or we can use
it I'm gonna use it because it's a
little bit shorter both are the same
thing it is just alias to test oops
and so let's do it here so it check bad
email
and let's make this asynchronous and now
we can check bad password and now I'm
doing this we're gonna have a nicer
output as well give this is save and
this is our last one down here so it
we're gonna say check bad password and
bad you know async and we take this
chunk put in here okay
so now that we've basically split up our
register tests into multiple little
smaller tests we'll see what this looks
like when we run so Yaron test i should
now have all these little tests printing
out and we should see exactly which
register function fails now and it just
kind of makes it easier to tell so here
we can see register user and then I'm
just there register user we can see the
individual tests and actually this is
kind of nice we can see how long each
test took and we can see the duplicate
emails took quite a bit longer than the
rest of them with the two requests okay
cool and maybe this server was like
warming up and stuff or whatnot I don't
know but that's not today's main topic
what I want to do today is work again on
the register resolver and what I want to
do next is send an email to the user
and the reason why I want to send an
email to the user is to make sure their
email is actually legit and they own
that email and the way we do this is I
don't want them to be able to log in for
example before they have confirmed their
email so we're gonna add an entity or
not an entity we're gonna add a field on
our user so I'm gonna add a column here
call and I'm gonna call it well it's
gonna be of the type boolean and it's
gonna be called confirmed and this is
going to be a boolean and I'm also going
to give it a default value of false so
this field will be whether the user has
confirmed their email so by default they
haven't and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna send the user a link and when they
click on that link we're gonna turn
confirmed to true well if they never
click on the link then you know whatever
they I won't let MOG in because we check
they're not confirmed so what we're
gonna build today is a function called
create URL or we'll call this create
confirm email link TS so we're going to
explore it const create confirm email
link so what we're gonna do is take the
current URL
and the reason why we need the URL so
this might be for example a GP localhost
or we might be running on so we might be
right on locos 4000 or we might be on
Auto
HPS slash my site comm so I want to take
this as a parameter and what I'm going
to output is something like this so
we'll take whatever URL we have so maybe
it's the site and we're gonna append
confirm and then we're gonna have
basically an ID at the very end and the
ID at the very end or gonna do with that
is store it and I was originally gonna
store this in a database but I think a
better place for this is Redis and we're
gonna be using that to store our session
data anyway so might as well double up
and store this as well and what this
idea ID is this basically just
corresponds to the user and I want the
link to last 24 hours and this is
basically I'm taking off of the forgot
password cheat sheet
400 ASP where it talks about basically
some basically best practices so
originally I've used like JWT JWT tokens
before but one reason I don't want to
use those is because I want to be able
to once the user has confirmed their
email they should not be able to click
on the link anymore basically it should
be invalid the string or the ID and JWT
tokens you can't really invalidate I'm
the token anytime you want unless you
store it somewhere so you might as well
store our owned token so that's what
we're gonna do so here we're gonna do a
couple things basically we just need to
store a key pair and for this we first
to create the link and this is this is
really gonna do two things right it's
not just creating the link it's also
storing something in Redis
and so to store something in Redis we're
gonna have to use a Redis client and
curious what you guys think about this
there's like two main Redis clients
there's this one called IO Redis which
I've used before and liked but there's
also another one called like node Redis
I believe and yeah
called no dress there it is I'm not sure
which one's better both of them look
really popular and used by a lot of
people so I'm gonna use this one but let
me know in the comments below if you'd
recommend the other one or vice versa so
we're gonna install this so yarn ad I
read us and we can also go ahead and
install the types for this cuz I don't
think it's written with typescript
either / io Redis okay cool so what this
URL thing is going to do is first create
an ID and this ID I'm thinking the best
thing to use is a UUID so I know we just
uninstall this we're gonna reinstall
this cuz it's just great for making IDs
so yarn add this ID and I want to say we
were to install the type for it I don't
think I uninstalled that I didn't so we
don't have to reinstall the types
alright so step one
from you also this is a trick one of you
guys told me about I can just import it
like this instead of using the slash so
we'll go ahead and do that as well
so we'll say costs ID is equal to
version 4 okay
and the other thing we need to pass this
function is the user ID so user ID so
URL is going to be a string user ID is
also a string okay so we now have the ID
and why don't I and start server over
here we need to create a Redis client
and we also need to pass the Redis
client here so we'll pass it as a third
parameter in one second so I'm gonna
just import and we can just copy their
hello world example so import Redis from
IO Redis and we're gonna have this in
our create server here so we'll create
an instance Cerreta s' and I'm just
going to pass this to our context so I
think just say context and then pass
then Redis like that and okay so what is
the type of this can we get that
oh it's any
there you go all right so this is a
Redis stop Redis so let's copy that so
we want to take that as one of our
parameters oops that right was the
capital our Redis both capital ours okay
and area recently first to type is being
used as a namespace there you go okay I
don't know if this is the right type we
might have to change this but it looks
good for now so what I'm going to do is
say Redis dot set and we're gonna set
the ID here and the second parameter is
going to be the value which is gonna be
the user ID and then the third one we're
gonna say e^x and this is for expiring
and I want this to expire after I think
24 hours seems like a good amount of
time and this is in seconds so I'm gonna
do 60 seconds so we have a minute and I
want 60 minutes and I want 24 hours so
that should be about 30 yep I think
that's correct and so Redis set I think
this returns a promise doesn't tell us
what it returns I think it does so I
think I need to await it
and we'll say a sink okay so after we
set this ID next thing that we want to
do is actually return the string so I'm
gonna return and then pass in the URL
have a slash confirm slash ID and this
is going to be the URL that the user
clicks on so when they click on this
link they're going to be taken to our
server and go to this URL here so now my
start server I'm gonna create an
endpoint now you'll notice I'm not gonna
be using graph QL for this I find it
just simpler to do this I actually don't
know if it's possible at least without a
front-end to do this with just graph QL
and so I think it's easiest to do this
with rest so I'm going to say server
express dot git and I looked this up
because I haven't used Express in quite
awhile at least making a get route so we
can make a route like this and we can
put parameters like so and then we can
do request stop parameters to get these
parameters so I can say slash confirm
slash ID and here we're gonna say
request res and I think next was the
last one I actually don't even know if
next is one for the Gipper ammeter okay
and then here what we're gonna do is
we're gonna get that ID from request
stop grams and then when we get that
idea if the next thing we want to do is
say Redis dot get that ID so Const
user ID this equal to a weight getting
this Redis so we'll do a sync
and then next thing after we get this
the user ID is we're just going to set
the confirmation so we're gonna say user
got create or not create update and we
say what we want to update by so I want
to update by the ID so I D is equal to
user ID and then in here we set what we
want to change I want to change the
confirm or confirmation I think I accept
confirmed is what I called it yep and
when I said that's true
and we're gonna wait and then res dot
send okay now if we were using this for
real what we would want to do is like
redirect them to our front end but we
don't have a friend yet so I think this
works okay there's one last part of this
and that is in our register resolver is
to actually call create confirm email
link so let's do that real quick so
really after we save the user in the
database
assuming that worked okay we're going to
create a confirm email link so we need
to pass in the URL we'll talk about how
we create the URL in a second well we
need to pass in the user ID which is
going to be user dot ID I'll need to
pass in Redis which we're getting from
this guy up here the context
and I'm gonna wait because it is a
promise that we return from that and
this is going to be the URL so we're
gonna do something with this URL or this
link very soon okay
it didn't like this oh because this is
our context for now or I guess we can
add this to our context so now in our
context we have Redis which is Redis
okay so we have a single thing in our
context perfect so how do we get this
URL right well I look this up and this
looked like a nice way to do it so on
the stack overflow
we can get this from the request I ever
have in the past set like environment
variable at but I think this will be a
little bit easier so whatever they
requested we can get the protocol in the
host and use that as the URL so let's go
ahead and back to our index over here
start server I think they actually just
changed this so now the request is one
of the parameters sorry this is the
wrong thing I hope this was the context
we're gonna touch context there we are
here's context
so from context we want to return an
object now and I forget I think it works
like this so whenever I come across
something where I'm like I don't
remember how this works what I'll do is
in Visual Studio code I can right click
go to definition and I can now see how
this guy works so I can see one of the
things is props I can click on props I
can see oh look I can either pass
context a object called context or a
context callback let's see what context
callback does alright well it takes some
number of parameters and then I returned
context so what are these parameters
that I get oh nice it has the request
object which is exactly what I want
so let's use that so parameters request
and so here but on their return is the
URL which is going to be exactly what we
got from those guys so request request
and the reason why we didn't get the
original URL at the end is I don't care
what's after the slash all I want is the
host so for example it might be a little
post four thousand slash graph key well
I don't care about this bit right here
that's what originally your L would have
given us so all I cares about this part
and the HUP part which is what this
gives us okay so now I have the URL
passed into the context as well and now
I can update my type okay so I now have
the URL which is a string so now my
resolver over here have URL will pass
the URL ok so this was a lot of stuff so
I want to just like recap everything so
let's go through how this is gonna work
so let's start with start server so now
whenever we start up our server we also
connect to Redis and we basically can
use this to do any kind of Redis
commands we interact with this Redis
object we're also getting the current
URL of the server so whether we're on
locos whether they're around my site
comm or whatever and we pass these two
as context so we can use it in our
resolvers so now in our resolver over
here have those two things and at the
very end after I save my user so they
successfully registered I want to create
a link which then I can then email to
them so this create you create Creek
confirm email link we're taking the URL
the idea of the user and the reason why
we need the ID of the user is we need to
know who the heck were updating right
whose email needs to be confirmed who we
confirming so to actually do this we're
just creating an ID I'm doing this as a
UUID because it's safe to put in the URL
and it's also unique Here I am setting
an ID and are setting a key value in
Redis and I'm saying it should expire
after 24 hours or one day and I have the
ID which we set here and the value is
the user so whenever we fetch this we're
gonna get the user ID back and then I'm
returning the actual URL which is the
URL slash confirm an ID and really what
we might want to do here is really just
return the ID and then the the person
creates the link from that I will I'll
think about how I want to do this I
think this is probably fine for now we
are also returning the string of what
the user would click on if I sent them
an email so when I send them an email
I want to send them this link now and
then finally when the user would to
click on this link what's gonna happen
is they're gonna come over to this over
here and we're gonna get the ID from the
parameter in the URL we're gonna get it
from Redis this would give us the user
ID right because that's what we stored
and I guess it's gonna return null
otherwise so maybe we do like a little
if statement if user ID
otherwise rezzed offs and invalid
something like that but if we do get a
valid user ID all we're doing is we're
changing user ID to confirmed or we find
that user and we update them that they
are confirmed
and so when logging in users I now can
just check this field and see whether
they're confirmed or not now I think
this stuff works but this was a pretty
long video already so I'm going to stop
it now and in the next video we'll write
tests for all this and make sure
everything functions and works all well
between now and then I would recommend
it's swallowing Redis because we're
gonna be starting this up and using it
very shortly so the for this video guys
thanks for watching
