for a couple tutorials in the past and I
got a request to do just a little
tutorial on how to use it so we're gonna
go over just the basics of how to do
stuff with code sandbox so if you go to
their home page you don't even need to
create a count right away you'll see
these cool little boxes that you can
click on and with each one you can
basically do a different language so
this allows you to code in the browser
and so here all the frameworks that you
can get set up I'm my favorite is with
react and there's also even more I think
if you do create sandbox here are all
your different options of the things
that you can do and they actually have
some really cool features where you can
actually like sync the code that you
have on github with a sandbox so you can
actually code and it'll be a time you
update the github it'll update the
sandbox and vice versa so that's really
cool but anyway we're gonna be
discussing the react one so immediately
when you click on that button you'll get
this and what this is is a editor right
here that's this box and this is very
similar to visual studio code
I believe they use like one of the
plugins or projects that emulate Visual
Studio code in the browser so that's
that and then on the right you see a
preview of your code and then you can
even see there's a little your elf right
here and then on the left is basically
like a little dashboard panel thing you
can see your files dependencies whatnot
now this is actually the default
template it's very similar to create
react app and you actually don't have
this is currently like an online
template you can see a lot of people
have used it these are the views in the
hearts and it's not saved into your
account or like you don't you don't have
this until you click Save and I actually
don't really ever click Save and I
actually don't know if there's a Save
button and
but what I do is I just do command asks
I'm on a Mac and you know notice I just
hit command s and it I forked that
repository so I guess you could click
Fork up here but yeah I beat ctrl s on
Windows but you can just save and you
now have this code on your account I'm
not logged in but it would save this if
I was on my account okay so first off
here all the files over here and you'll
notice this is very similar to create
react app we have a folder called public
we can go into index.html and we can see
you know basically the same thing what
this stuff doesn't really matter I never
ever touch public index.html at least
when I'm doing samples because the
default works good but you could add
like some CSS here or whatnot but even
here you can add external resources like
bootstrap CSS so that might be a better
place to put it rather than the head and
then it uses react scripts and the
dependencies over here so these are all
the dependencies so by default there's
react react Dom and react scripts and
you can see there's this little refresh
so I've been doing some react 16.3
tutorials and so I need to upgrade these
because it's only on react 16.2 so if
you hit that little thing notice how it
just bumped it up bump this guy up and
we can bump this guy up so now I'm using
the latest versions of each of these
dependencies and that's because the
template that I forked this off of was
just using an older version that's why
but you can click this button at the
bottom and there's a console and you can
see what's going on here
not sure why that warnings showing up
but like for example you may want to use
Redux in your project I could just add
dependency aerial and I could say Redux
and then I just click on that one and
we're good we now have Redux added to
our project we can import it and you'll
notice we have a document I get element
by ID and then we're rendering our app
into
so index dot JSP
at least in this template and then in
public if we go to index.html you'll
notice there is a div tag with ID root
so we're just rendering our app that's
why that that's why we have that bit
there
we're just rendering our react
application there and then as you're
coding over here
anything you code so I can change what
it says here like hello how are you
you'll notice as I'm typing stuff like
starts to appear over here so you know
it's real time as you're doing it just
recompiles and run so that's really nice
it's fast for just iterating through
stuff and testing it out and then being
able to share it with somebody you can
just come over here click share and ban
so we can now try this out and they
actually just had a release for alive so
multiple people can be coding I sandbox
at once but I think you have to be a
patron to do that but anyway the other
thing is I can create just right click
on source and create a new file or new
directory so I could do Bob KS and then
it works like any other text editor here
I could just code up a component if I
wanted to but I don't care about that so
I'm going to lead him and then they have
this kind of cool feature
so I'm currently on the file hello J s
and you'll notice how it says I'm on the
project view if I click on this it will
change to the current module view so
what that means is it'll just render
this component so this component right
here just says hello
so you'll notice how it did not say
hello how are you all that stuff but if
we switch you see so like it's basically
just rendering what other whatever
component I have in the file currently
open and if I'm in the project view it's
just gonna render the index ojs in this
case
and I don't really actually ever look at
there's also package.json I don't ever
touch this stuff I'm only mostly in this
file editor tab there's project info but
I maybe will change the name of the
project or the configuration files I
never touch either but I mean that's
nice to know it's there if I wanted to
change some of the configurations of
prettier or whatnot and you also notice
I have like this flashing green box
that's because I'm actually using vim in
this so if you come over here there's
like a little cog on the top right as
Preferences and I've turned the vim mode
on so I love that it's super nice the
other thing they have prettier
integration already if you don't know
what prettier is if I just write this
super ugly and I hit save so notice how
this is not tabbed over correctly if I
hit save it'll just nicely format my
code so that's what prettier doing and
you don't have to do any type of setup
it's already there and then pretty much
the last thing yes lent is well last
thing I like is this little Zen mode
that you can turn on and off and it just
basically gets rid of the top banner and
makes it a little bit nicer for like
presentations so here's like and now
like full screen my code if I want to
and we can go back and I can just kill I
think there's a way I can hide the
browser if I want to full screen my code
and whatnot and they have hotkeys for
this so it's really nice so if you
haven't tried out code sandbox I would
recommend it I really like it for little
demos or whatnot because it just is very
easy to get something set up and then
also if we come back - we don't need
this if we come back and you click
explore examples they have a really nice
search where you can just look for demos
that people have done and check out what
you can do so I can be like alright I
want to see someone who uses Redux and
someone who uses Redux logger and now I
see all the projects that use those and
then I can search I can you
tags but this is really my favorite
feature right here is being able to
search by dependency so you can really
narrow down and find something like a
project that you want to see an example
of but I hope that helps for you if
anyone is having trouble with code
sandbox or was curious what it was
that's how it works and like you saw
it's not just for react they are for
lots more than just that angular pre-act
I haven't tried this framework before it
looks interesting though but yeah that's
it for this video guys I'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
