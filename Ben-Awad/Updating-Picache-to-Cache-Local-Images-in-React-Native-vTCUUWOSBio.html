is with react native if you're using
Expo and you have local images or files
and your users are using your app that
those local files are not sitting on
their film Expo actually has a CDN that
is or they're using Amazon CDN to send
the images or host the images so
whenever the app needs even local images
so for example getting an asset like
this circle dot jpg even though it looks
like it's coming from the app itself
it's actually getting taken from the CDN
that Expo has set up and so what this
means is if your users offline they
cannot actually access that CDN so even
images that look like this will not show
up in the app so what I wanted to do was
add this or add a workaround because
they talked about it in this article and
one way you can fix this is by running
this on the image and what that does is
it'll actually download the image from
the CDN it's stored locally so that's
what we're going to do and add it to my
component that I already caches remote
images so now we'll handle both and
basically what I want to do now is since
I'm handling both remote and local I
just want to go ahead and basically be a
drop-in replacement for the image
component except now we cache everything
so the first thing that I want to do
with this is to fix the type because I
put my types in a different folder
called type TS and in here I split up
things and I set the URI as a string and
I actually forgot to remove it from here
but we're now no longer gonna have that
we're gonna have a source just like the
image so I'm gonna go ahead and change
my props to image props that is going to
be the props for my component now and I
can just go ahead and remove this from
types and we can just kill this
altogether
so now I'm really just gonna have a
state which is going to be a URI source
okay so now we have source here and
first thing we have to fix is we now
don't longer use props we use image
props so let's go ahead and change those
so with that said image props do not
have an image right so let's get rid of
this is gonna be a source source is now
the thing that we're going to be
changing and we're not gonna get the
source from the props we're gonna get
this source from the state like we have
that and how we're passing it in here so
now when I do component did mount I was
originally getting the source or the URI
me now we're gonna have the source so
let's go ahead and pass it in source the
source okay so now for download image I
need to handle a source not a string so
this is going to be image resource and
if we were to look at what this could be
here it is so it could be a URI and I
actually want to support the other types
so where is image properties so I want
to show you guys this so it could either
be an imagery source an array of it or
an image require source so this is
really I'm actually gonna create like a
new type because I think it'll be
easiest to use across so actually this
curry over here in types I'm gonna call
this type uppercase source
so this is what we're gonna use and
let's go ahead and import this image
require source and that's actually what
our source here is going to be so a
source and we just need to export it ok
so now my state is good so now it's
actually just going to be a source and
that's what my state is so on source I
have to check what type of source I have
whether I have and requires just a
number by the way
so if URI and we're gonna check the type
of is equal to a number we know this is
going to be a local image it's gonna be
of something like require image dot PNG
that's what it's gonna look like elsif
array dot is array so we're gonna check
if the let's call this source
let's call what it really is not Erie
anymore so if the source is a required
tag gonna handle it in some fashion
we're next gonna check if the source is
an array and then we're gonna say else
so these are gonna be the three ways
we're gonna handle each one I'm gonna
treat these two the same if it's not an
array then it's just an array of one
item so now I'm gonna say async download
remote image
given a let's give them give an array of
strings or something I don't know
exactly what I want as my parameter yet
but I'm gonna move everything into that
okay so now first I want to handle what
happens with local images and then I'll
handle the remote image so I'm going to
say a sing download local image so we're
gonna handle remote and local and here
we're gonna just take the source which
is we know is going to be a image I
think a number well we know it's a
number but it was the image requires
source image require source so download
local image and we'll pass in the source
okay so now here we're gonna do exactly
what they show here but slightly
differently and the reason for that is
we don't need to download it every
single time we first need to check if
it's in the cache already so asset get
that from Expo so I'm gonna say Kant's
asset and we're gonna await this and
this is going to be our source so here I
just await it and then after we await it
if we look over here this talks about
what happens with the asset so we get an
asset object back and here's where we
can see if there's a local Erie so if
the asset has been downloaded by calling
download async the URI is pointing to
the local file on the device so what I
want to do is say if asset has that
well Yuri then I don't have to call
download async otherwise I do otherwise
we're going to wait asset download async
and then after that I should get a local
Giri out of that I believe we come back
over here we can see how they do it
they're waiting for promised at all and
they don't talk about what they do with
it afterwards I assume what they're
doing afterwards is they're getting the
local Giri so this is going to be we can
actually look at what download async
returns do they have it here no don't
talk about what oh here you go
maybe we'll have to test it out and see
what happens but what I think I get back
is cons no asset and I assume this new
asset and let's see it should tell us
the type no this is a void maybe it just
changes so once we've downloaded it I
think maybe and we can console dot log
asset that local URI whether this exit
now exists and it doesn't like it
because we don't want to console.log
anything that's fine so I'm gonna say
let local URI equal null and we're gonna
say local URI is equal to asset that
local Erie otherwise it's equal to asset
dot local URI actually I really just
need to check it I'm doing this poorly
the local URIs if it's not there all I
have to do is called download async so
I'm just gonna say do this
differently so if vocal Yuri doesn't
exist it should now afterwards so then I
can say this does sets staying and we're
going to say source and we're set theory
equal to acid dot local Erie okay so I
think I'm happy with the local one to
download local image so here we are
checking if it exists already and if it
doesn't exist we download it if it's a
really local we then just set the URI to
the source and then we're done with that
okay so download local image is good
let's handle download remote image we
basically have everything we need but
now I want to pass it in array so this
is going to be will say URIs and this is
gonna be array of image URI source so if
it is an array we just directly pass it
in so this dot download remote image I'm
gonna pass in the source so we know it's
an array this dot download remote image
so here we know that source is not an
array right because we checked and I'm
this is a really cool at typescript also
knows it's not in an array so what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna make it
into an array so it's an array of one
element so now here we're always
handling some kind of array of URIs and
so all we're gonna really do is check
now we're just going to go through the
areas of each one so
here see the best ways we could just
regularly loop over them but that seems
bad because what I want to do is group
them like this asynchronous call here I
want to group the async calls so they
happen in parallel so that one and the
download I feel like you could download
a couple at a time if we wanted to so
first I guess we can grab names I guess
the best way with name is to create a
dictionary so I'm gonna say Const names
is going to be key string and it's gonna
have string so now I'm going to say
youri's dot for each and URI and the
type of this it's gonna be an image
source Siri I don't know if I actually
need to explicitly type it I want to see
if it picks up does it
yep okay so cool does pick up on the
type automatically but for each one I'm
gonna say names short hash dot I
actually know that the key is gonna be
the URI and the value is going to be
short hash dot unique URI and right so
your e dot URI really I really should
call this sources I think is a better
name than URIs so this is a single
source and our source diary sources okay
that makes more sense
so type undefined cannot be used as an
index type so it looks like URI can be
undefined so we're gonna say if sourced
at URI then we're going to do this
we don't really care if it's not defined
okay so this is us hashing it and the
name and really we don't need the name
but we want the path do we use name
anywhere else we don't we really just
want to create the path so the path is
going to be file system cache directory
and then this is going to be our name
and then I'm gonna add dot PNG at the
end so don't eat either of those we do
both of those in this step here and
actually you know what I should just map
this cuz then yeah I should just map
this I actually did this in kind of a
poor manner well not too bad but we
could do map here so this is going to be
Kant's image exists so here's we're
going to check where the images exist
and we're gonna say sources and we're
gonna map instead of for each because
what I want to return is a promise of
this so you know what this is so much
simpler if I actually just forget about
asynchronous oh I feel like it's gonna
be complicated going down this route
what I wanted to do is we could do right
I could return this
and this will return an array of
promises so then I can do promise that
all on await it but we're gonna get like
a problem with ordering and I don't want
to deal with all that stuff so I'm gonna
just go back and I'm just going to let
it handle a single URI so you're gonna
handle a single source so a source now
instead of updating the state it's just
gonna return the new source so this is
gonna be source diary if source dot u so
if it does not exist be returned null so
now what I want to do is instead of set
state we're just gonna return the new
URI which is going to be image diary and
same thing here so what I'm gonna do is
now set the state where I call this
return new image that URI this will be
source diary okay so now down here in
download image so now I'm gonna pass it
source that URI and we're just gonna say
Kant's new uri
is going to be a way to that Oh
you just pass it in like that so here
we're gonna say this stuff says state I
were to say source I hate that it keeps
doing that so we're gonna keep all the
properties that is already on source and
then we're just gonna say URI is equal
to new URI okay so what does it not like
type property source incompatible so
source here what type do we specify it
as we specify it as a source that it can
be one of those that's good and so what
if I got rid of the Erie itself does
that fix oh it does fix it I'm pretty
sure so this is an image Erie source can
i really not set the URI here I mean I
could just do source two thought New
Year you right there URI is equal to New
York I guess cuz it's read-only alright
so for whatever reason it doesn't like
it what I can do instead is instead of
returning the URI here I can return
gotta thought source and the URI is
equal to that so I can just do it here I
don't know if this will fix it I think
we might get the same type air I'll talk
about source your image diary and this
should be new image there yeah so we
return that back so now here this is
really new source is what we get back ok
so now this will be easier to look at I
suppose so argument of type source types
of property source are incompatible no
was not assignable to type ok so this
could return null is what it's saying so
all I have to do is say if new source
then I update it there we are
so that was the only problem ok so let's
do the same thing with this so I'm gonna
say source dot map this dot download
remote component so Const new sources is
equal to promise all so it's gonna
return a bunch of promises back because
this is an asynchronous function and
we're mapping over it so I'm gonna say
promise at all and this will await it so
we'll get that back actually I think
this is fine this is happening I believe
in parallel to so this is actually the
best way to do it I think the way I was
doing it before I think would just be
too much work and like not as simple as
this and I think I don't think we
actually getting gain from it
so we have new sources we want to filter
out any that are not null so I'm gonna
say this that set state is gonna be
source is equal to new sources dot
filter X where X diary where a Giri
exists I'm guessing it doesn't like it
for the same reason because some of them
might be yeah it might be undefined
so even with the filter that doesn't
work so what if I this complicates
things here I'm gonna say if source
diary and okay so now now hopefully it's
not on is this what is this the problem
is this one okay so the URI is just
straight optional and that's the problem
okay so what I want to do instead is
actually definitely just return the area
sorry guys I keep changing my mind but I
like this the best we're just trying to
get to work to fiddle around with
typescript
okay so I now only return a year II and
I'm fine
am i fine returning okay so now I return
and you Yuri really why I should pass in
now is a string okay so we're gonna pass
the string you're in and now download
image so here we're gonna pass in source
diary and now we're gonna say source and
URI is equal to New York awesome so we
didn't get any warnings there now I
think I can get to work up here with
this one as well so now instead of
directly mapping it for each source I'm
gonna pass in source why would the URI
be optional for this I'm that's what I'm
questioning when would you ever have an
image that is not but we can filter
these out first we're gonna say Kant's
source with URI you know what no we
really have to do it here I I'm trying
to get to fiddle with so it works with
the type I think I have to do it here so
if s diary we're gonna do stuff
otherwise we're gonna return null so
we're either returning a source or null
here we're gonna return to our turn
source we're mapping over passing it and
and here was where I call download
remote so pass in the Erie cuz it does
exist and null promise I don't think I
can just promise no like this I forget
how to do it it's not callable is it new
promise are you gonna tape Nola's notice
I'll to parameter is it like this
I don't think it's like this I forget
how I just call I think I can promise I
can array like that I don't think I can
promise null what I will do though so
this is a really hacky solution for now
and then I'll figure out how to get this
tour return null and it returns null so
this is an asynchronous function that
returns and all so here I want to return
them so this is something that returns a
promise of null all right so here now I
have new sources ok yes should be an
array of URIs or no Leary's all right so
the index of new sources matches with
source so I'm just gonna sit a brand new
a straight for loop kant's new source
this is going to be a new URIs and we're
going to do four let eyes equal zero
eyes less than source dot length I plus
equal one prefer four of oh really it
doesn't like just straight for loop I
don't know how to do a four of with two
of them so we're gonna ignore this
this is Lent warning so I'm gonna push
and here's what I'm gonna push so if
we're gonna say cons fury is equal to
New Year's at position I if Yuri exists
then we're gonna say this is a source so
it's gonna be dot dot dot source at
position I and then Yuri okay so this is
us creating new sources and I don't need
to filter anything here okay I think
we're done now this one was more complex
than I thought it would be so this is
trying to handle a mapping of sources or
an array of sources I mean I so I'll go
over the logic real quick so I first
loop over all the sources I map it and
then I check if the source is a URI and
if the source has a URI I go ahead and
download and create a new local image
for it otherwise I return null and this
is basically a promise that returns null
I need to look up how to just like do
this without creating this little hacky
function
so I'll switch that out so then we have
a bunch of promises that's what this
gives so we're awaiting all of them and
now we have a list of strings that are
either URIs or they're no so that's why
we loop here we're looping through the
source the source should be the same
length as this because we're mapping
over it and so we can loop through both
at the same time and then for each URI
I'm checking whether it's null or not if
it's not no I push it on to this array
and this is just keeping all of the
previous attributes of source adding on
the URI and then here I go at the end
and set state I'm sure there's probably
a better way to do this because this is
not super elegant but I think it will
work so I'm gonna go ahead and test this
next but that's it for this video guys
sorry for all things I changed my mind
about this is I guess more of like a
development video of me just adding on
to this and trying to figure out how to
get this to work but yeah that's it for
this video guys thanks for watching
