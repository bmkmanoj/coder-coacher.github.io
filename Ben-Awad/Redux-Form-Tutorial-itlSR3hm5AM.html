to walk you through how to set up Redux
forum so if you've tried to set up your
forum and you came to issues and you
couldn't get it working this video is
for you I'm just going to walk you guys
through this implementation guide right
here so you can get your first forum up
and running so the first thing I'm gonna
do is just do our yarn add hook forum to
install the library and if you don't
know what yarn is it's very similar to
NPM but I think it's a little bit faster
if you don't have yarn and you want to
try using it you can do NPM install -
gee and then do yarn or it could be yarn
CLI if you can google it and it will
tell you it's probably yarn and if you
don't want to use that you can use NPM
you can also do NPM install your redux
one oh cool that's installed so the next
the first step it tells us to do is to
add this to our reducer so I basically
have just a basic react project here the
Iraq project you're working on go ahead
and use that if not I have a github
below them in a link that you can clone
and use that to follow along if you want
to okay so I'm just going to open this
up and I'm going to go into my root
reducer and I'm just going to go ahead
and add this line right here so we're
going to import that and let's see if we
can move this over a little bit there we
go and we can close that for now okay so
we add this we're importing the reducer
and then we just need to add this to our
reducers so I'm going to move this to a
new line and then I'm just going to put
form is equal to form reducer just like
they have it there and now I'm already
doing setting up this stuff because I
already have Redux set up and
project if you do not have Redux setup
in your project you make sure and do
that first so let's move on to the next
step is to actually create our form so
I'm going to go into the components
folder now I'm just going to create a
new form called my form and we're going
to import the act from act now there's
two choices when you're basically
creating forms we're just going to mimic
this contact form and actually we can
just copy this exact thing so you can
just copy this exact code actually right
here and it should work for you what
it's going to say is you can actually
create a class like this or you if you
don't need um basically these functions
like if you're not going to use
constructor or component will mount in
your form what you can do is actually
make this into a just a function which
I'm going to show you next after we get
this to render on the screen so I just
want to walk through this code real
quick so you guys understand what's
going on so we're creating a form handle
submit this is something that redux form
passes to us and we need to grab it from
the props and it's not even I'm just
going to do this dot props dot and
they'll submit this we're not using
anywhere else so this is basically this
is a function that's going to be called
when we're done when we submit the form
and well this is something that actually
redux form gives us and we can actually
create another function here that's
called my submit and here we can just do
values
and then if we call that this stop my
submit what will happen is when we
submit the form it'll actually pass the
values into our form right here but for
now we're not going to do that we just
want to see a form render on the screen
so we're just gonna have it like that ok
so then he has a field component right
now he's doing a very basic field
component where he's just doing um an
input field so he's basically what's
happening here it can think of it like
an input and he's just wrapping it
around with this field that way Redux
form knows about it and this name is
very important first name this is the
name that is going to be returned when
this is how you're going to access this
field by this name first name so for
example if you want to get the value of
this field it would reference it by
first name and so he's just creating a
couple more fields the same way he's
doing different names for them and
notice he's using the component input
for all of them but you can actually
change this to a custom input which will
actually be doing a little bit ok so we
have this submit button that's just
normal listed at the forum and then this
part down here is very important you
basically just need to react your or not
not reacting to wrap your component with
this redux form function and then you
just pass in basically a name as it says
you want to do a unique name for every
form you create so this we're going to
call it contact and this is the
reference your form if you need to
outside of this but we won't really need
to be doing that so it's fine so we are
then just exporting it so we can import
this in our project so now in my home
component I'm just going to import my
form so we can see what it looks like
and then we're almost done we still need
to do something it says and this is just
the on submit so we can do this as well
so there's there's like two two ways to
do it you can put the on submit outside
your form or inside your form this is
what I would say doing it outside your
form so we can do this first so we can
call this submit your console dot log
values and then we can say on cement
particular this does submit now now
notice how the on submit prop here we go
back to our form the proper using was
handles in it so that's not the actual
prop that we're not passing that to on
submit here notice how awesome it here
it's getting handle submit and then
we're passing in on submit to our actual
form this is the correct way to do it it
looks weird what's happening is handle
some it is something that read UPS form
uses so you need to have that in your
form this is something real quorum uses
to actually update the redux state and
know that you're done submitting the
form and then if you actually want the
values of the form you have to pass in
an on submit prop okay
so let's go over to our react
application and submit it's not not
defined in home jf and it's because I
put it inside the render function
to refresh that okay and we have this
nice little form and if I bring up the
console it looks like we have a problem
and this looks like it's just a
different part of the project uncaught
at the root so this is just a different
part of the project it's on air coming
from the ABS when my saw is messed up
okay so I'm just going to say Bob and
then last name is going to be Bob - I
mean I was going to be Bob at Bob calm
and when I submit this as you can see it
will return the object back and then we
can do whatever we want with this form
data I notice how or some consoling the
values here alright cool so that works
the next thing I want to show you is so
we got a basic form working rate I'll
render on the screen okay and I kinda
just want to show you different ways to
get this working so for example what if
I don't want my submit here what if I
want to have the same submit no matter
what my form is or who calls my form so
what I can do do a submit function here
console.log submit inside form and we
can just log the values and then we can
do anything we want with those and then
we just have to call the function this
dot submit this dot submit on passing in
our submit here to our handle submit
function that you x1 gives us so now I
can do this again ABC
and we can see we had submit inside form
and we can get the values back very cool
so now I also told you that you don't
really need to make this into a class
you if you don't need to like right now
this is for this form this form is so
simple you don't need a class if your
class doesn't need Kompas methods then
you don't need one
or I can do is I can get rid of this I
can get rid of render can get rid of
that get rid of all this stuff and I can
basically just have a function here
that's going to be called contact form
this is equal to so I'm creating a
function called contact form and all
it's going to do is it's going to return
this stuff now we can pink copy that
over and then props are passed here so
we basically instead of saying this we
have to get the props from here so I can
get handle submit that way and then we
actually just have access to this submit
here and contact form is equal to
contact form we basically want to just
change the name we'll call this contact
form function I guess okay and contact
form is not defined so it doesn't like
so component that you submit is not
defined which is a conce there and
contact form is not defined we just say
cons okay so notice
that renders um and let's just give in
our test and you can notice it work just
like it did before so this is a lot
simpler it's lighter weight because it's
just a function instead of a component
so whenever your form doesn't need to be
a class I recommend building it like
this because it just makes the logic lot
simpler make it work a lot better this
way okay so the next thing I want to
show you is let's say this is this
component really ugly right no one's
going to want to make a form that looks
like this what if I want something
different what if I want a custom input
type or maybe let's say I want a
password or something well I guess you
can get password working but let's say
we want something from a library to
style it they actually support custom
fields so if we just click on fields
here it'll show us how we can do custom
fields do it here here we go so I can
actually create a function called render
field
okay and what I can actually do is tab
that over give this to Michael and okay
so you notice they basically styled it a
little bit differently and notice how
there's this field object that they're
going to call so how we're going to do
this is we're then instead of doing it
this way instead of doing input what
we're going to do so we're going to just
pass in render field and what's going to
be it's going to pass in a field object
with a lot of information now what I
like to do is actually decompose this
and and that we Don to basically do feel
dot a bunch of times like input is
something we're going to need here look
like we're indeed meta we need touched
and air so I can do meta and do touched
and air and then I can do is then I
could just expand input and then I can
do its touched and there's an air so we
can show the air okay so I just want to
walk you through what these props are so
the input field here is every time the
user basically types a letter into the
input it is going to dispatch an action
and update the reduc state but you don't
have to worry about that
but you just need to do dah-dah-dah
input that way that you're basically
connecting this input element with redux
form or a Redux tour so it can actually
pass information between them and then
down here this is basically a condition
it's saying if they've touched the input
and there's an error then you show the
air with the span element so this is
something that Redux form takes care of
you takes care for you it looks for if
they've touched the input and if there's
an error then it will go ahead
and return this to that there is an air
it is touched and so you can show the
air and then that's pretty much it for
this render field and now what I also
like to do is we'll say we want a label
and I just want to have like label yeah
I'm just a label function basically so I
can replace all of these forms with
basically one thing so now I can
actually pass this as a prop and I can
grab it and so now instead of that I can
say passing the component I can say
label and I can say first name and now I
can delete this I can delete this I can
delete this we just have this field here
and I can do the same thing for all
three of these so now you can say label
is equal to lastname complete the outer
divs
because you know it's going to give us a
div automatically because we're going to
be calling that component
so we're going to render field there and
we can do that for email as well so now
is how we simplify this plot now we just
have our little custom component here
and we call that three different times
so now if we come back over here you can
see it rendered okay and it looks the
exact same but we simplified our code a
lot and also you can now style this in
any way you want let's say I want a line
break here for whatever reason and it
splits these two on two different lines
like you your bait you can style them a
lot faster now and make them all the
same if you want to and I can create as
many of these render field functions I
could say a render field to and then
change it slightly differently and
notice how the type is text here
what we can actually do is notice how
we're putting the type here we can get
this prop here as well that way they're
not all text
and that will pass the type-in so that's
how you do a custom little input
function that react form can use now
that is the basics of react form now
there's one last thing I want to go over
which is validation so if we just come
down to we're going to start with
regular validations which I believe is
just submit validation and I want to do
yeah do this one this one is fine or
actually I want to see if there is field
level validation that might be the one I
was looking for so basically this
validation is you're breaking it out by
fields um I don't like doing this
validation as much I prefer the onsubmit
so let's do the submit validation so the
submit validation has you basically
coming in in this on submit and if
there's something you don't like you
basically throw an error so I'm going to
do another import here for a react form
called submission err so mission err and
I'm going to decompose those values we
should be getting a first name last name
and email oh so this is about talking
about with the name the name that you
use here is going to be passed up here
so first name last name and we can scoot
this over because we don't need that
anymore
and also email so now I can do any type
of validation that I want I can say for
example
if so maybe I want to make sure that
first name last name and email are not
blank that's a very common check to make
sure before you basically submit the
form and do something with it
so if first name dot I think it's trim
and basically basically you're checking
then you have an air and I don't know if
it's throw LT gets throw inside of the
submit but I kind of want to check to
see submission air actually yeah it is
but how I want to do it here's another
here's another way that I have done it
before that really like to basically
create an error object an empty error
object and I do what is air equal to
false and at the very end I'll do if is
air
I'll throw new submission air and I'll
pass in my air object else submit form
to server or do something else with it
and I'll do all my checks here so if for
example first name is not empty your
first name is empty and then what we
want to do so is it Duplin not here so
if we want if is equal to basically
empty or undefined or any of that oh and
also what I like to do is I like to just
set a default of an empty for each one
of these in case it comes in undefined
so we'll do like this if first-name if
we turn the first-name and it's equal to
an empty string then we say air dot
first name is equal to required
and then we say is air is equal to true
and this is important that I used the
first name because now what's going to
happen is as soon as we throw this air
it's going to associate first name to
the field first name it's going to pass
and required to this airfield right here
and I'm actually gonna do this three
more times I'm going to do this four
last name and I'm going to do this four
email as well so now if we come over to
our form I just click Submit you'll
notice how it says all through these say
required but if for example I add a
letter now only two of them say required
and you need that as well there's Matt
sign so now just last name is required
so that is pretty cool right we are
connecting the air by we're telling them
which air is by the submission format if
we just do that should submit okay and
it does we'll say let's cause a lot log
to show that it gets to this Auto log
valid submission
so it's required and we get a valid
submission okay very cool so and you can
do any type of error checking here any
type of validation you want when they
submit it so for example what if I want
like the first name needs to be I don't
want them to basically put in like a
hundred characters so um I could say if
first name dot link is greater than
let's say we actually let say we just
want less than twenty then we get
through our new error that says first
name too long and then they have to fix
that so as you can see can that any type
of validation here that you want now
that's it for this video but in the next
video what I want to show you guys how
to do is to actually submit this form to
a server so let's say I successfully
submitted my first last name in email
and now I have a back-end server that I
want to talk to and I want to submit
this data to and so it can add it to the
database so that's we'll be showing you
in the next video if you're interested
in checking out that please stay tuned
I'll put a link in the description below
when that video is done so you guys can
check that out and learn how to submit
your forms to servers so I hope this
helped if you have any more questions on
redux form you can leave a comment below
and I'll be happy to help and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
