be building a react to-do list app so a
lot of you were interested in seeing
something with graph QL and it's a do
list so I thought I would go ahead and
put this together so I'm gonna be making
a to-do list and react native and so
we'll just get right into it so first
thing I'm just going to go to a folder
that I want to make this in and I rehab
react native install on my computer so
I'm just going to do an it and I'll call
this too and just going to go ahead and
ditch Eliza react native part so react
native is going to be my front end for
this and then my back end I'm going to
do feathers je s and I kind of did a
back end before with graph QL and I
actually want to Postgres there we go so
I already made a which we call it a back
end in graph QL before so I'm going to
basically use this as a little template
and for building the application okay so
we have the to-do list let me just go
right into the to do and then I start up
T MUX that's how I like to develop and
we'll split the screen and we'll come
back out and I'm going to go ahead and
clone and this will be actually what I'm
going to do is I'm going to react
native to do and we'll move to do inside
of react native to do your act native to
do
I'm just reorganizing the folder
structure real quick so it's nice and
clean and then get clone and then I'll
call this server okay so now I have the
server I'm just going to go ahead and
start up the iOS so react native run iOS
this will start up the iOS virtual
machine just like a live phone and then
here is the I get this server start over
here so I think if I NPM start this
should break actually no it won't break
because I actually have that database if
I go to the config default and I can
just change my database to call RN to do
ok looks good so basically what I was
doing right there is I was changing the
database which database that I wanted
the oops looks like this is starting up
what database I wanted the server to
point at so I wanted to point to I'll
show you guys I want to point to a
database called RN to do so now I need
to create that database and I'm using
Postgres so I'll use PC cool and I
actually don't know if this is okay it
is running that's good um so then the
first thing I'll do is we'll just create
database and then when I called it our
end to do and okay we carry the database
now if I do I'm not going to NPM start
because I max
going to change let's go on to the
source and I'm just going to make this
fullscreen for now so you know services
we want to get rid of some stuff so
we're not going to use secret burrito so
I'm going to get rid of secret burrito
we're not going to use taco so I'll get
a taco both those are dead so I'm going
to have to go into the index file kill
taco and secret burrito
now viewer I think we can keep go the
index you have your spine so you viewer
hooks populate user yeah yeah computers
fine viewer just gets the current user
and then users should be fine graph QL
as well we're going to change so if I go
into graph QL schema um and actually I
wish I didn't kill this is still loading
it's taking its sweet old time I wish I
didn't kill the other files because we
might want to use those your reference
that's okay okay so for now let's do
it's created to do have an ID and carry
meet this capital and I'll have a text
and it will have a check that'll be a
boolean think bullying is a type will
find out so for now actually I should
call this complete so it'll have some
text complete geared of that get rid of
this nonsense root mutation root
actually I cannot can't kill root query
you need that root query viewers fine
just do to do
all to dues or turn mmm that's fine
that's fine for now list up to deuce and
then we should have a create to do and
then we'll have a sign up and login
let's actually spell login correctly
schemas fine so email password to login
that's good that means to be also need
an authorized type so I'm going to bring
that back should have killed us way too
many things I changed so I'm actually
not going to do that I'm going to undo
back to where I had authorized but
instead I'll just come over here and go
into the file viewer and grab that
so graph QL schema need this authorized
type because we're still going to be
logging in okay so the route mutation
will have a created to do to create to
do you just need to supply this text and
then whether it's complete and then we
own we kind of want a default value
because the default value should be
false if they don't supply it I wonder
if you can do that in graph QL I'm sure
you can the type will be to do we'll
just leave it as like this for now let's
see default value rec you'll sometimes
have default values that seems not what
we really want say mutation do you whole
value graph QL mutation
the article this doesn't look like maybe
you can't worry about figuring that out
later it's not that big of an issue
right now okay so this looks pretty good
for the schema let's just pop over here
it looks like our react native right
here finished building that's nice let's
create another one we're now going to go
into the resolvers and let's go up to
the root folder of you have to go to the
root folder of feathers to what I'm
going to call it you have to go up to
the roof folder of feathers to actually
create like services and stuff so I'm
going to create a service we'll call it
description it should ask for a name
there you go um call it to do it's a
database use Postgres do want
authentication yes create that for
and then we can go back to resolvers and
then for now I'm going to close this so
we can't have a full screen alright I'm
going to open up the resolvers and the
graph QL folder and now we're going to
change a few things so now we have a -
duze and we have users we don't have
that anymore okay that's fine for
authentication we'll use the same thing
oh you know what I never MPM installed
so let's do that real quick see that
dice fer Amazon yarn and we don't need a
vagrant file and I'm going to remove RF
give her this gift folder because I
meant creating you get one and we can
kill the license and the readme okay
what was I going to do oh yeah so I like
setting up yarn because it just makes
installing things so much faster that's
fine I expected okay so I've gone this
air before if you ever gotten this yarn
air before unexpected connect overt
object to primitive garbage thing you go
to your package JSON it's one of these
things it doesn't like this keywords
thing I believe it doesn't like this
doesn't like this is like this and like
this basically anything that's like an
object that's empty and we don't really
need to just kill it at least if it's
not important to you and then I'm just
going to yarn go ahead and install it to
the dependencies that this package needs
what those finish installing then once
these are finished installing we can set
up basic resolvers so that's what I'm
doing right now I'm just setting up the
we'll go back in the services graph QL
I'm setting up the basic resolvers for
you notice I made like a really basic
graph QL schema right here
now we're just setting up some solvers
I'm just going to get this stuff set up
a very basic level and then we'll get
more advanced when we get into it so
basically it to do should be tied to a
user so actually let's go back out what
we're going to have to do is we're going
to associate a user to it to do so we
have to go into to do and I believe it's
hooks index there's like a populate user
I go back I should will close that I'm
just going to look at the project that I
made as a reference so if we go to
source services secret burrito hooks I
want this associate current user and
that's on create oops so on create I
want to associate the current user with
B to do so what that does is it adds
like another little field to this to do
over here which is the owner ID so I
actually just add that to our schema as
well and that's something I forgot to do
as well let's reason graph QL we
actually need to set this oops not there
this is going to be in that to do
to do model okay so I have an ID by
automatic um do I need to set up a like
foreign key okay so right now notice how
we have an owner ID here right
this owner ID is going to match up with
a user and usually in a database um you
set up a foreign key to relate them it's
going to be a let's see you can have
mini - duze as a single user so it's one
too many for now because we're not gonna
have you use your sharing - duze at
least for now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a basic to-do app
and then I'm just gonna add features on
top of it for now let's leave the owner
field owner ID filled out and just see
if we get an error when we create it so
text we don't want that to be false and
then complete this will be a bully the
end should I look at that okay so now
that's our schema and we can go back to
our resolvers what folder miami don't
care
alrighty so here we will have to do x'
and this well what to do okay so this
will fetch all the two dues for a user
um looking at the owner ID root query we
haven't do we create yet all - dues
which is going to be all -
oops it's going to be - dues and right
now this is this is actually won't work
because we have all syndication it'll be
all - dues for a user which we need to
guard it for now I'm going to get rid of
all - dues right here only can get a
viewer right now root mutation you can
create it to do still the create to do
to do stock create passing in the data
perfect login and we don't need this
actually we can leave that okay so our
resolver looks likes it's all done and I
think I'm just going to leave the
backend as is right now so the cool
thing about oops the way cool thing
about graph QL is you can test it out
with their interactive oops and assert
the server there they have an
interactive little graph QL editor that
you can practice it on see if everything
is working let's make sure it runs okay
looks like we have an error let's suit
our areas um when this happens I usually
just run babel node so I can see it
babble node source can't find modules oh
we need to fix our imports our resolvers
Zener solvers know what is
importing this can't find module oats or
index so kill seeker burrito kill taco
all right now we're good
can you start the server user not found
and document um that's you there I
haven't seen this before a few L oh I
didn't create a user type all right I
mean I got rid of the user type so what
happened is um we can actually kill that
it's going to graph QL remove NPM debug
in my schema notice how I only have the
type to do and type authorize I also
need a type user accidentally removed my
type user I actually needed it which we
can grab the email and - duze for which
is a list of two do's and now we can
come over to that or you're on this guy
alright start it up so we can come in
over here okay so the first thing we're
going to do oh I think we needed to just
go to the schema real quick when we
create a secret burrito no I don't think
we can just create so what I think the
we're going to have a problem right now
so our mutation what we want to do is
create a to-do right um we'll say to do
one sit commas I can't remember and then
complete going to be false
argument has invalid value false
expected string found false I thought I
made complete yeah I made complete a
boolean so boolean graph QL
is their boolean to graph fuel area this
is not very helpful documentation
area
expected string will give it we can give
it a string can I create property of
undefined okay let's see what's
happening on this side cannot read prop
recreate of undefined oh okay
so that's one of our resolvers so let's
look at the resolvers so - duze is
undefined so to test this
let's console dot log to do's and then
we're going to clear we can oops p.m.
start and let's see what gets console
down you should expect undefined yep it
does so why is to do Oh capital really
still is it oh you know what think I
messed something up I think it might be
- duze is I think I really messed up the
spelling what we can't I I got really
console okay so the reason I think it's
to do is this feathers jeaious always
adds an S at the end of stuff nope still
undefined okay let's just there's one
easy way to find this out do you go into
that service so to do slash index it'll
tell you the location so this is the
service apt up service - dues okay but I
had that at one point maybe not yeah I
did have it we can do this thing
I'm still undefined why is it undefined
to use app dot service oh I know why
it's undefined
Yertle flux so check this out guys um if
you go into index this notice how to do
is after graph QL and you make sure to
set up to do before graph QL that's what
we're doing wrong so I'll go back to
into resolvers I mean I'm so sure this
will work now get rid of that yep
works just fine get rid of that now but
false ok still it's still selling me
expect oh you know what you know what
guys I know it is if I go into the
schema I put string right here needs to
be a boolean okay now restart the server
sometimes you have to refresh ok
authentication token missing this is
what we expected to get or I was
expecting to get reason for this you
need to be authenticated to do this and
I'm not litigated so what we're going to
do so we're an authentic we're going to
create a user then we're going to post
with postman so let's put this guy right
actually this is a fine location so
we're going to copy this and we're going
to put into a post request then we're
going to pass our token for this so
close some of this stuff
close close close we're gonna make a
post request post body raw JSON ok so
our query
is this we just have to expand then we
need ad token which is a JWT token and
we're going to go to localhost 3030
slash graph ul is the location our
endpoint for our graph Kuehl server so
what we're doing here is we're going to
I'm going to create a user using the
interactive thing right here so let's go
ahead and I'll walk through while I'm
doing this so first I'm going to sign up
to create a user so email Bob password
Bob create this guy and now I'm going to
login um email up password Bob so we
remember how we said we wanted to create
reduce to be authenticated
well that means I have to be logged in
to create to Deuce it's you can't really
login in this little iql thing so we
have to do is we have to make a post
request and pass in this token and this
token lets us do requests and tells the
feather server that we're authenticated
so I'll run this command as if we're
authenticated so it allows us created to
do so let's run that and cool created to
do for us and I just want to make sure
there weren't any errors on the server
and doesn't look like there was I think
this was from the old one so when it
created that little to-do thing what it
was supposed to do is also added an
owner ID so I want to see if it did that
for me so if I go here I'm just going to
actually check the database itself so
I'm going to connect to a native to do
and select all from not users from -
duze what would be the name of the thing
to do is okay is it in quotation marks
really that's really annoying okay so
this is the to do and as I expected
there is no owner ID so we have to
create like a foreign key for this so
what I'm going to do and when we create
when we make a an edit to the schema so
that's we're going to be doing goes
Soros so this is going to be and source
services and this is going to be the to
do schema to do model so what we need to
do is we need to make a relationship
between the owner ID and the user so
sequel eyes foreign key
so see does it tell us how we can do a
phony okay you're free or foreign keys
our user this does sequel I start define
so I think you might need to like import
the user no so we have very user we're a
to find that okay this does sequel eyes
to find company user stock along user
justice equalize to find user company I
don't I don't see where they're adding
user top belongs to company a UUID okay
in case we're ads has been to find lb
use it places the turret holiday okay so
what I think I want to do is I want to
import the user model so that'll be user
model so I import this and this will
return a user function C equalize okay
we need a pass I don't know how I would
do this in feathers J ass let's see if
there's any docs on it feathers J s
sequel eyes for and key this is just
going to see equalized ox
you
then service of the end of the module
functions okay so if we go up one it
looks like I was thinking that's where
some of the okay here it is this is
where some of the sequel or where some
of the functions are actually being used
I have talked figure so a black
configure must run this and create the
make sure that X Chema's okay so let's
go back how are they creating class
methods associate is what I need to do
is I need to pass like a suit there's
another way because notice how they pass
an object if I can pass the name of the
table that it is related to I could do
it through there
one to me project has many as workers so
basically what we would like to do is
we'd like to say and our user oops our
user model just say user dot has many
and then to do basically is what we'd
like to accomplish now the actual syntax
you do this I do not know so it looks
like what's happening is we need to put
it here
okay so I think just looking at this I'm
going to try and try this in tax and see
if it works
so Kant's to do is equal to require when
you go up a level then we need to go
into two dues oops that's fine to do
then you're go into to do model
I think that'll give us this function
right here where we pass in the sequel
eyes so notice inside this function what
we can do you can say Const to do will
say this it will call this to do phone
good to do will say this is to do ski
and that's fine to do func passing in
the sequel eyes that we get from the
user and there should be the to do a
schema over here and now we can do this
has many so user dot has many and then
we want to say to do as to deuce
I have no idea if this is going to work
at all but to test whether this works we
have to kill the schema so I have to go
into piece equal drop database okay I
dropped it now I need to create database
Arn to do okay so basically I just need
I can actually just drop all the tables
and I'll have to draw up anyway
basically I need to refresh the database
so it can remake the schema so let's
start and see if the schema gets made
Oh also I need to call this like owner
ID not to deuce validation error
unhandled rejection validation error
okay so this is just straight a terrible
error message so we call this zero to do
to do model freeze table name
is it because this is already synced
possibly do it I'm going to read this
guy's some more so how is he trying to
do this permission ID seagull eyes
default primary key okay permissions
come role permissions do you have
pointers help me solve this Thanks
okay so this is what I want to do oh
this is kind of weird oh I wonder if
kind of one just like console.log this
sequel eyes for a second oops no this
sequel eyes and see you if there's like
actually in their mind I was thinking
for a second maybe it would have like
the tables in it possibly you know why
not I just want to console.log to see
what the sequel eyes object is so NPM
start
uh-huh that's interesting it didn't
crash after the ballot hey why did he
crash I didn't change anything that's
interesting I want to see what the field
is now um this is not what I thought I
was going to be anyway okay so we didn't
crash I'm really curious what the schema
looks like so I'm going to type EC equal
this this I I didn't explain this
earlier but this opens up a connection
to the Postgres so then I can look at
the database but you might have figured
that out by now select all from dues I
don't know why this is in quotes I don't
really don't like that created at up do
that okay so didn't create it so this is
in the seek wise defined class methods
associate models role permissions to oh
go ahead role pressure so sync here okay
I think I know now if I go into
freeze table I wonder if it'll be in the
same comma okay so it's in the same
thing as freeze table names
okay
associate models that looks like it's a
syntax error
okay so class methods and also I need to
go into index and you make sure this to
do is created before the user that way
it exists and the user can then user
exists here
that way we can associate it so role
permissions wait where is this coming
from this I'll guess from here but it's
inside of it so how can it be calling it
so so class methods it's an object this
object has I don't even know this won't
compile I don't think I mean knock up
I'll run like I just want to put up
console dot log models I don't even
think this will work
I probably doesn't go here because the
scheme is already created piece equal
drop database create database start
but just a validation here Oh agura this
Oh stupid
okay so just dropped and create a
database to refresh it
it does compile this doesn't do anything
now class method is associate let's see
if there's anything else
wow this is a really really long post
he's adding a foreign key or assuming
Hall drive or not though new has
happened since class methods this guy
does this associated thing to alkyl my
associate it's not being called though
how do I want to do this see if anyone
else has anything else
set my relations belongs to
you
okay this guy does the same thing he
uses model 1 sure let's try this on one
that has many models ok for whatever
reason this console.log it's not giving
anything hello put models and then I'm
just going to try doing how they do it
so model one and he has fries table
names above okay so this is called user
has many models dot and then let's see
what did I call it to do model to dues
so let's just see what happens with that
um I'll drop create and we'll get out of
here
we'll start server
so the application started now let's
check the database and see if the
database has changed
nope we wouldn't expect anything from
this I don't think associate is being
called I really don't nothing's getting
logged just for kicks I don't know why
it's not being called though let's also
put it in the to do model
- when I should do anything in there
either
and actually I should stay in here we're
dropping and creating let's start
nothing
class method associate not being called
sequel eyes
associate is a function try like that
really just because I I wrote the
function like that no user definition
there the class methods
well this is a really annoying error
that looks like it's take a while to
hunt down
class methods and since methods what's
the difference
so there are they say much
just Google general class methods
equalize all the methods you don't why
so don't modify or check any type okay
no let's just look for example I guess
Postgres other shit-ass example that's
exactly what we want to relate how can I
do this I make it so I'm writing to a
similar area are you kidding I'm
starting database the cozier than a goal
except let's see how I did it though
because you got it working it sounds
like once common slots equalize stop
models okay that's what we want
so get rid of this throw that
and if we go into users user nowhere in
users to do goopster gotta open
somewhere oh I'm being dumb I thought I
had users open these are mall ok can get
rid of this and then user I want to say
sequel eyes dot models comments thought
it count okay so user dot has many model
and then to do and then we want to do as
and we'll call it owner ID this is
feeling promising it's open up P sequel
oops
drop create get out diem start
all right start it up that's a very good
sign so let's go into you and then
select all from would it be user I don't
know it doesn't we shouldn't see
anything user good select all from - we
don't see this field either we just did
a freaking Association we didn't get in
there has many is 1 to n I hope maybe my
understanding of is incorrect what yeah
one tomatoes are connected the charts
over again connected to exactly one
specific this attribute project ID is
needy prosciutto matically through ode I
do we definitely should be using this
syntax though it shouldn't affect
anything has me to Do's why does that
not affect the database
do I need to then go back up here to see
a UUID nope
toriel you show
I mean I know why he's getting that air
as artists that mediate
oh did I need to call this stuffer to
get this class methods probably okay we
might need this later I'll keep this up
so I'm thinking I need to go into to do
and sequel eyes so how does the foreign
key work
create this
let's be an owner you know what actually
let's before I do any of this stuff I
want to look at the documentation for to
do hooks associate current user so she
currently feathers yes okay that's not
what I want to click on
and gay so does no documentation that's
great because I wanted to see if it
creates that table field for you and
like alters the database later I think
we're just gonna have to play around
with in see okay so this is what I want
to try I want to touch this model and I
want to create a owner ID it's not going
to be a primary key though it's just
going to be a UID let me make sure I
think a UUID is what I think it is so I
mean I just want to see one
has many foreign key okay so when you do
something like this I'm going to just
leave this on the screen for a second
for you guys to look at and I will be
right back
a
okay I'm back so when we do this has
mini we want to create a foreign key
looks like which we call owner ID not
this as crap so you actually kill that
so okay so comment this comment know the
image has mini comment comment belongs
to constraints full scope comment about
foreign key foreign key alrighty let's
try that see if that does anything okay
it's going to PC equal drop create and
PM start cool it started okay so let's
open up P sequel connect to RN and we'll
select all from to do always bad syntax
no it doesn't have owner
okay how about user doesn't have
anything either so that has many thing
is three state constraints true okay so
we assume we have a tables of constant
of the concave uses of your image
since
maybe maybe I do want to add a
constraint
foreign key let's just look at the
foreign key into
user belongs to company led company ID
to user we want to do it the other way
around
we want a user ID so we want to touch to
do we will we want to do dot belongs to
belongs to and wheelss a sequel eyes dot
models dot user I just want to see what
that will do
because okay so I'd really like to see
like just a field show up from doing
these relationships but I'm not getting
anything looks like we got probably the
same air node source
nope that my scroll is messed up
something that's not an instance
so let's pipe this to a log file so you
can see what's going on okay maybe
because we didn't add a UUID now
this is twice and it's unclear what's
going on here oops I'm curious if I need
to do this canta melis equalize utter
devalues the filter sure let's try this
and see equalize okay I'm going to try
this
let's give it a log so this is going to
be an index so we're going to copy this
see why sync and then okay so we're not
doing this
sync here we sink there this is after
configure yep
after configure we do that I always do
seagull eye stuff sync sync everything
up set up relationships
okay okay okay okay call that good I can
remove that log so now let's go into the
to do hooks nope now we can create this
class method stuff that we are seeing
earlier
okay so associate muddles so this is to
do has many that's not what we want to
do though we want to do this for C
source services graph QL views for user
hooks user model
we're going to say user has models dot -
dues let's see what happens with that
and let's comment that out for now
comment you out comment out both the
sinks we're not sinking those two let's
reset our database okay I just tried to
clear that drop syntax all right
create and we want to just NPM start
okay so that's what I expected to happen
because it worked before with this cuz
I'm doing has many again actually I
should I want to console dot log and see
if this is doing anything still I think
it is because we're actually calling it
now because I didn't know we had to call
it before I want to connect to database
liked all from to do's comma users yes
this is what I've been waiting for guys
this is what I've been waiting for user
ID right here right there we got it as
and we just do an owner ID
oh no we actually need a piece equals
they need to drop this okay so why is
this important why is this big so now
that's how we have this calm user ID we
haven't had this before so what this has
a mini added was this column user ID
which associated the to do table and
this user table so now they're related
users can have multiple to dues that's
what has many means so if I come into
here nap now I notice how I did this as
already that should change the name of
this column to owner ID owner ID matches
what we had in our hook earlier close
disconnect select all from to do and
it's still user ID that's weird
that's really weird so what's going on
there maybe I save for and key instead
drop cannot go ahead we haven't had that
problem
oops we haven't had that problem before
where we have that open database thing I
don't know why it just popped up so so I
don't know if I need to use like a
different keyword to get the column name
I could just change the hook to user ID
but that seems like about I want to
actually know how to do this we just
yeah yes yes guys look owner ID okay
that was a lot harder than it needed to
be a lot harder so let's save our
freaking way to hard of work um in case
it's not I get repo just going to need
to do to do models okay kill all this
stuff thank you thank you and let's go
up to the top server get in it get
status you don't need to pay grant get
status again that looks good at it all
this is our initial commit and
and I'm just going to put this on github
create a new one react native to do
server grab that code buy and it's up on
github so we finally got that stuff now
I think okay yeah so what I wanted to
happen was when I created a to-do list
associated to the user so I'm going to
do I'm going to create another user
because remember we reset the database
of on so the user is gone create a bob
user you make sure do npm star-filled
the fetch it means we just need to refi
oh did it I'll just need to take a
second okay so we're going to run that
create our user now we can log in Bob
password Bob copy your token now making
over postman put our token in send
created to do now we're going to come
back to our database what are we looking
for we're going to connect to our
database and we want to select all and
voila
owner ID matches up with our user okay
that's what we wanted this is a good
place to be
so our back-end at least for this simple
to do is done so let's hop back well I
can just leave this running I'm going to
leave it running I'm going to open up a
new tab
and now I'm going to start working on
the front end I apologize for how long
it took if I don't think anyone will
even continue watching past that
horrendous what we just went through to
get the get it working we went through
documentation just ugliness so I thank
you if anyone is still watching after
that I'm going to kill the Android and
the iOS we don't need these two actually
what am I talking about we do end up
stop Android yes touch index iOS yes
sorry we need both of these but they're
going to basically point to the same
folder so I'll show you how we're going
to do this we're going to make a folder
called source and then n source we'd
create an index J s and then we
basically redirect index Android IJ s
and index iowa's to J us to it so I have
another project I did this with right
here so I'm just going to copy how I did
that
so index Android okay so it's getting
this app container this is basically
just a wrapper for the app and I'm going
to call it I think just and the same
thing you can literally copy index
Android to index iOS okay so they're
both looking for this source index this
app container thing so if we go to my I
react native app we're going to our
source index will be setting up all this
jazz a little bit to get Redux working
and stuff but for now let's just create
a little view that says hi to make sure
everything is working rxjs
very cool okay hop over to let's push
these two guys together okay so we can
reload it our app go on there you go
okay corresponding closing tag Tet
oh my gosh I push command Q instead of
command R I'm sorry guys react yeah yeah
run iOS because okay so to refresh the
little app and iOS the little emulator
you do command R and I was doing command
Q on accident I'm so trained to do that
that was my apologies okay we don't need
this anymore though so it's going to
load back up so I can talk about real
quick
not this react native I want to talk
about the UI component that we're going
to be using to make the app look pretty
I found this really cool library that I
like and I used for this so if we go to
package what I use here is react native
elements really like this one it was a
really nice element anti elements the
components pretty popular I'll just show
you so today we'll set up a login page
and stuff pretty nice-looking login form
cool looking button they have a lot of
different stuff I'll just show you up to
the top look at all these components
that they have and they look really nice
too
and they look really nice on Android and
iOS gets this finished building say hi
cool does um source and arcs okay so we
have
both Android and iOS pointing to this
right now
we won't immediately jump into the UI of
this you know what I actually want to
think I'm going to end here for now I
think going to finish start on the front
end more tomorrow since we got the back
back in took so long get set up I think
I'm just going to leave leave it here
alright so next video we're going to fit
we're going to start on the front end
and get that rolling and start making
this app come together so thanks for
watching guys and have a nice night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
