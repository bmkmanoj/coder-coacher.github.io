an application like this where we have a
node.js server and a react client we're
using graph QL and actually take this
into production and deploy it so anyone
can come and access it now we're gonna
be using docker to do this but before we
talk about how docker works and how to
use that we need to get our back-end set
up our server with babel and start
getting that to work and I'll talk about
more about what I'm talking about in a
second before we get into that babel
there's a quick bug i want to
demonstrate to you guys and how we can
fix it so if you create a brand new
channel like so and you just start
typing stuff when you get to the very
top notice how the scrollbar hasn't
started yet but as soon as i start
typing a couple of our messages the
scroll bar is going to appear because
we're gonna overflow and it's gonna jump
because it thinks we are fetching more
items so hello how are you see how we
didn't see how are you and we're kind of
like midway through the scroll and we
have to scroll down to the bottom and
then say hey bottom and now we're at the
bottom the reason for that is in our
message container this number is too big
when we have a small scrollbar or I
guess this is a big scrollbar when
there's not a lot to scroll this is not
enough so now we're gonna change this to
something like 20 I'll give this a
refresh and we'll create a new channel
and that will be gone so see 8 pop over
here now if I type lunch messages
you notice how the messages are always
at the bottom
hey latest so we're good and it doesn't
break give that a refresh if we go over
to general for example it does not break
infinite scrolling over here we can
still continue to scroll so cool so
that's the place where you can just come
over here if you're having problems with
the scrolling is come fix tweak this
number to where it works well for you
and then also another one you can play
with is here or calling handle scroll
okay so let's start getting our back-end
set up and ready so we can start using
docker so first thing I want to do is
talk about one of our resolvers and I
believe it is I think it's a message
resolver yes so right now you'll notice
we are hard-coding localhost 8080 one
now when we're using docker and we put
this out into production this URL can
change so really what we want to do is
we want to detect what our URL is and
put that here instead of hard-coding it
like so so here is what Stack Overflow
recommends so in Express there are we
have a request object and that has a
protocol and these variables right here
that we're gonna use to get the full URL
now second answer top answer here
recommends using this URL from nodejs to
format it so we'll go ahead and do this
instead of just doing a string
concatenation I guess actually we don't
need a path name so we'll just do a
string concatenation but here are two
different options you can choose you can
have URL format for you or just
concatenate it yourself and I'll put a
link in description below if you want to
check the Stack Overflow out but in our
index file so index ijs we have access
to this request object right here and we
can feed into our context so I'm just
gonna say server URL paste in this
and put that there give that a save and
there yeah now for us this original URL
at the end here is gonna be slash graph
QL we don't need that part we just care
about the hosts and the protocol and I'm
gonna turn this into a string template
real quick like that like that do that
safe okay
so now in our resolver over here I don't
have to use this but I can use server
URL and the server URL is coming from
the context so parent args context grab
the server URL okay so now let's make
sure this works if you remember we're
using that this to format the URL and
the URL is for pictures our server
restarted so if our picture works over
here we know and we see our Teemo head
awesome so cool so now we're good so
this will we want to make any changes
the other alternative that you can do is
you can actually just put an environment
variable and then change the variable as
things change
so I mentioned Babel earlier in our
package I'll JSON if you remember at the
very beginning to let us use import and
async functions we were using Babel node
but Babel node is not good to use in
production if we come on over here -
babbles website it tells us you should
not use production this in production at
all because it has heavy memory usage so
there's a better way to do it so babel
supplies a way to actually build out our
project that way we can instead of
calling babel node we can just call node
on index a GS now to help us do this for
whatever reason i did not create a
source folder earlier so we're just
going to create a source folder now
and move our whole project into that
because ideally you should have a source
folder so off batch functions for my
errors the next such is pub/sub
permissions such yes ok so here's all
our source code and source all this
other stuff is extra stuff we don't need
so now what we can do is create a build
script and I can run Babel and we're
gonna do dash D and we're gonna babble
on source and we're gonna say dist
so what the heck does this command do
that I just wrote so what it does is
babbles gonna run on our source
directory so it's gonna look at all the
source files here and it's gonna
transpile them or transform them into
regular JavaScript that is not using
async functions and such and put it in a
dist folder so notice how we have no
dist folder here but okay so this is
crashing I'm entering this off real
quick and also note we're gonna have to
do start source slash index dot JSP put
everything in source and let's actually
start this back up and make sure we
didn't all moving it we didn't miss any
files or folders or anything all right
looks like it started up okay and I'm
just gonna refresh over here make sure
it loads good ok now we're gonna turn
this off we're not going to need it
right now so in the command line over
here I have the server pulled up and I'm
just gonna do NPM run build and you'll
notice what it's doing is it's going
through every single file that we have
in our source and it's spitting out a
that same file in the dist so if we come
over here and look at this we can
actually look at some of these files so
index ah yes and you'll notice there's
just a bunch of rubbish rubish
JavaScript but this this is actually I
mean you'll notice it's using var
instead of Latin Const and this is
actually your code transformed into
basic JavaScript
instead of using constant let and so
with this dist that we have now here we
go back to package up JSON instead of
calling Babel note on source index I can
I'm gonna create a new script called
serve where we just use node and we call
on this slash index up GS so now that we
use babel to do that
spit out all these files in dist what
you can do is we can serve those files
using regular note because node can
understand that now cuz we got rid of
all the fancy javascript but it works
the exact same so i'm gonna do npm run
serve and we have an air it's called
regenerate air runtime error and the
reason why we're getting this is because
we're using async and a weight and we
need to do one extra thing so here is
the page that babel has on this this or
generator runtime and it recommends
adding this regenerator transform plugin
but i have tried this before and for
whatever reason I still get that air and
they say basically download this
regenerator runtime package but the
thing that has worked for me before is
doing this right here and I'll like this
Stack Overflow in the description below
if you want to check out as well so the
two top answer here this one recommends
using babel polyfill but the one that
has worked for me in the past and that
we're going to be using is to install
this plugin so we're gonna come over
here and we'll do this over here so you
guys can see this better we're gonna say
yarn add dev and so we're gonna add this
babel plugin transform runtime and then
in our dot babel RC we're gonna add a
plug-in and the plug-in that we're gonna
add is this transform runtime now for me
i didn't even have to play with any
settings the default one worked fine for
me and then we just need to save the
babel runtime as a regular dependency
so I'm do yarn add and paste and babble
runtime and I believe you have to build
again
so we'll clear this so I'm gonna run npm
run build and also note when you run npm
run build you're gonna have to run build
every single time you make a change to
your source and that is why we are
actually using babel node so we didn't
have to run babel and build it you
pretty much just do this build whenever
you want to deploy it okay so we just
built it again now when i do in PM run
serve we shouldn't get any problems and
it should start up cool so now we see
this blank wall of text that we usually
see when our server starts up and we'll
notice it's the exact same server
writing the exact same code just on node
instead of babel node now so if i
refresh we notice we're fetching the
same messages we scroll up we're
fetching more stuff here as usual so
nothing has changed on our front end the
code works exactly the same all we did
was transpile change it from fancy
javascript to regular javascript that
the browser will understand and that
node understands that's AG we won't be
running this in the browser anyway right
we'll just be running this with node so
this will actually be node disk slash
index this is the server will be running
in production just like that now of
course we'll want to use the production
in flag which we'll talk about in a
little bit but that's all i wanted to do
for this video is to show you guys how
you can actually build what we have here
are using babel node take that all this
fancy stuff build it out into separate
files over here and then this dis file
is what we will be using with docker we
actually won't even be using source for
dr. Alvey zhing dist so that's it for
this video guys and the next one will be
starting up with docker and setting up
our environment and all that jazz and
running our production environment
locally and then taking it into
deploying that
so thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
