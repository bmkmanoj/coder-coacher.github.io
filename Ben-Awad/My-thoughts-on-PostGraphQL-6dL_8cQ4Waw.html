for quite a while and I've been wanting
to do it as well and that is to take a
look at post graph QL this is a really
cool library that takes your Postgres
sequel database or schema and turns it
into a graph QL API automatically you
don't have to do any coding at all if
you don't want to and now I'm looking at
the github page right now it looks like
I call it kind of an awkward time it's
transitioning from version 3 version 4
and a lot of big things are happening
and one of them is looks like they're
renaming themselves to post graph aisle
but nonetheless let's take a look at
what this is and how it works so I
already installed this on my computer
with MPM and I'm gonna run this command
right here on my slack database which I
made in the slack series that I did so
here I'm running post graph QL and then
just the URL that you need to connect to
the database so running that that's all
you really need and you have your server
built in your graph QL API so we're
going to take a look at is the graphical
and kind of test out the endpoint and
see what it gives you out of the box so
here I have graphical open and this is
your first time using post graph QL you
might be wondering what the heck do you
type here right what do you I don't know
what commands right well the nice thing
about graph QL is that has these handy
docs right over here so you can see
what's going on and you'll notice
there's a lot of stuff if you click on
query my first impression when doing
this was there's a lot of junk in here
for some reason maybe there's because
I'm just not used to post graph QL and
this is all needed and this is just like
advanced stuff but like int contains
join cell I don't know what this is or
int contained and match cell and then
it's very vague arg0 arg1 arg2 arg3 and
overlap i don't know what any of these
things does but if you scroll past all
this junk you'll actually find some
decent
so this is when things get interesting
so for example all channels all direct
messages these are all tables that I had
so all members and the one that I wanted
to look at was all teams and we can run
this query so all teams the cool thing
about this too is it makes it compatible
with relay which is a front-end thing
which is a client for a graph QL and
they use edges and notes and now I can
get the name if I want to and I can see
the name all these teams in my database
but you'll notice the documentation is a
little bit better for these order by
before last offset this makes sense and
first thing it was very cool is all the
features that you get off the bat
without doing anything so I get to sort
things if we click on this I can see all
the ways I can sort this so I can say
order by and I can sort by the name if I
want to name ascending named ascending
and it has all my different options of
how I might want to sort something also
you can search the docs dog-teams also
the thing I really liked it was the
condition this is actually something I
didn't even know you could do but
condition and it's nice they have all
these docs on what each thing does as
well so if I click on team condition I
actually just looks like kind of an
object and I select what I want it to be
equal to so my ID here ID let's say I
want the ID to be 3 run that only
fetches ID equal of 3 so this is pretty
cool I haven't seen this type of syntax
and graph QL before mainly I've just
passed and I haven't passed in objects
as parameters before but I mean it makes
sense you can do that so here all your
options that you can do for that and it
just looked really nice and like I don't
have to do pagination it gives me all
the pagination stuff already a lot of it
is already done so I was super impressed
and I really like that because a lot of
the work is done with you and
does this for all the tables right it's
not just teams you guys saw members
users and then the mutations are plenty
as well there's a lot of them going on
so I really liked it my only and this is
something I liked how much time like I
did no work whatsoever and three up and
running my only concern with these types
of libraries and this type of thing is
any time we're doing anything besides a
crud operation so create read update or
delete besides that it can sometimes be
hard to do but or fall apart but nice
thing about post graph QL is it looks
like authentication is easy to do so
they ty have a point here about
token-based authentication using JWT
tokens which I like and you can also do
permissions and stuff inside the
database itself so they seem to have
covered a lot of the cases but there's a
lot of other things that I want to look
into and see how easy they are to do
with it for example if I wanted to do
images let's say I want to start taking
payments if I want to integrate with
stripe or something or if I wanted to
use persistent or persist graph QL which
is really good for production and I'd
want to use this if I was in production
and I would want to use post graph QL in
production if it allowed this which I
think it should be able to because they
have this thing called graph I'll build
which I don't know if it's considered
out yet it looks like it's really close
to out if it's not out I think it's in
beta right now and what you can do with
this is you can attach plug-ins and run
this in an Express server so you know
just how write this thing over here this
is just me running this command I don't
see any code under the hood but it'll
allow you to hook this into graph QL and
Express and right here I can add my own
types and things on top of what they
give me and this is really important
and I actually want to play around with
this more and see how powerful this is
because I like that it takes away all of
the work that I have to do the crud and
that's something that should be there I
don't want to have to do that every time
you guys have if you watch any my other
series it can be kind of redundant to
add create this create that create that
or read for each single object you have
in your database and you're basically
replicating the code each time but
changing the name so being able to plug
this into like an Express server and
then being able to extend it is really
nice and they're taking it into a nice
direction which I really appreciate and
I could see myself definitely using this
for a project and then if it works out
well using in production because this
thing can just speed up your the work it
takes to get up and running but I'm
gonna wait and see where this goes
and away from the release version for
when that's how I'm gonna come back
maybe do a series with it and check it
out what it's like to actually use this
thing with an express server and then
extend it right add some of the other
things that I want it to have but in the
time being another thing I'm looking at
recently released is Prisma I'm gonna be
making a video shortly about this
checking this out this is from the
people that make Graff cool and this is
same thing turn your database into a
graph QL API so we can kind of compare
and contrast what prison is like versus
graph Isle or post graph Isle I suppose
but I believe this is just my sequel
right now but we'll get more into this
later
that's it for now guys those are just
kind of some of my thoughts about post
graph QL and where I'm at so gonna leave
it for now come back to it when version
4 is out and then spend some time
testing it whether this is worth using
and spending more because it is a big
time saver if it is easy to extend
other cases thanks for watching guys
