use MongoDB so I thought I would make a
video on it and explain why I don't use
it that much and the reason for that is
I don't know it that well I've been kind
of timid to learn it and as for a couple
of reasons the first is that it is
schema 'less this has some pros and cons
the thing I actually like about it being
steamed Alice is you don't have to do
migrations migrations are things and
Postgres and my sequel and sequel
databases where you have to change
basically your existing data when you
change the schema because you don't want
your schema to be inconsistent with how
your data looks so that's really
annoying that's great about schema
malice but what I don't like about
schema-less is it does not enforce that
your data is all the same and that's
something I don't like and I like how
sequel does that for you the second
thing I don't like is it does not have
joins if you're not too familiar with
sequel you might not know what that
means but basically it makes making
queries very nice and you can query a
lot abel a lot of data from multiple
tables with one query very nicely so i
had to have don't have too much
experience with MongoDB but something I
have used more is Cassandra which
Cassandra actually uses something called
C sequel or Cassandra sequel which it is
a no sequel database here but if you
actually use
Cassandra you'll notice it actually
looks a ton like sequel but what it does
not have is joins and you know the
sequel stuff and so when I was doing
using Cassandra one of the things I
constantly saw and it was annoyed about
is I cannot do joins and so that you
know cost me doing extra queries and I
actually think you have to be a better
database designer to use no sequel or
MongoDB than you do to use Postgres or
my sequel and do sequel because you have
to plan this out ahead and make sure
you're not doing your data is together
so you're not doing tens and thousands
of queries across different tables and
stuff whereas with
sakura-san my sequel I can do joins but
I found myself many times Cassandra
having missing that feature and having
to do way more queries than I would have
liked that's one thing I didn't like so
what I am using is post press right now
I would consider also using my sequel
both of those seem really good I like
enjoy using a sequel I actually probably
will spend more time experimenting and
learning no sequel because it is it does
interest me and fascinate me
but for the reasons I listed and the
other thing I'm kind of scared about
with MongoDB I don't know this for sure
but I've heard rumors about it just
being an inconsistent database where
like you could have inserts where half
of it gets chopped off so half of your
data is lost whereas the other half is
in your database and your database can
just get basically screwed up and the
state totally messed up and loose data
which is really scary they might have
fixed all this stuff this might be
rumors from a while ago but that that's
kind of like I had that's why I haven't
spent too much time with MongoDB
specifically but I do want to try out
some different no sequel options MongoDB
included but there's also a lot of other
good ones that are worth mentioning like
couchdb Couchbase DynamoDB and rethink
DB and I'm sure there's more than just
this but these are the main ones that
I've heard about for no sequel that seem
really interesting all with their pros
and cons of what they offer so these I
want to definitely try out and
additionally a Rango DB now this is a no
sequel database that's also a graph
database which is very interesting so I
will be checking out this soon as well
but I plan on testing out a couple of
different databases and see which one
liking but right now my main database is
Postgres sequel but I may be spending
more to because there's some nice things
about MongoDB
scaling is a big plus I heard is much
easier to scale with MongoDB or no
sequel in general using something like
dynamo DB from AWS could be really nice
using Amazon's database so those things
I really like so I will be testing out
trying some more no sequel databases in
the future so that's it for this video
guys thank you for watching
