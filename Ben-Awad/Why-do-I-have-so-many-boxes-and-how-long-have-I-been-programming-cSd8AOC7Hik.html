for me and it's freezing cold it's below
20 degrees which might not seem that
cold but it's really cold if you live in
Texas and nonetheless just went to the
gym had a good workout leg day for me
and just did some rearranging so you
know some kind of different angle right
now I'm facing a window right now which
gives me much better lighting as here
I'm sure you're seeing as opposed to
where I was that last time but
unfortunately you can't see my box Tower
but don't worry it is still there and
I'll be answering your questions today I
have my phone right here with all your
questions on them so I'll further ado
I'm just gonna go one by one answer them
so the first question is what are your
goals so with goals I kind of do it in
two different ways
first I have like a really long term
goal and then I like really short term
goals it's like a 10-year sort of thing
and then like a monthly or a weekly
thing so right now my tenure or my
long-term goal is not quite sure but I
think would be pretty cool to build like
a consulting company a software
consulting company something like that
and then for my monthly goals and this
is where I have a lot more and so with
that I have three or four goals right
now the first is to keep making YouTube
videos
the second is I'm currently working on a
product it's a web app that hopefully
I'll be releasing soon and so just keep
working on that and get it to first
release and then the last thing I don't
think there's anything else oh graduate
there you go
graduate at university or college and
then lastly keep working out going to
the gym getting fit yeah so those are my
goals right now next part of that
question was do you have enough boxes
probably but I will continue to keep
boxes as I you know as they come
kind of hoard them in the corner and use
them when I need to okay let's do the
next question so how to read
documentation and turn the examples and
tutorials into something you can use in
your own app now that's something that I
don't think there's a special tip or
trick that really helps you a ton and
you'll kind of get used to it and get
better at it as you're just programming
more but I'll tell you what I like to do
so usually I will isolate if I'm working
with a new library or something I won't
actually integrate it with my project
right away if I want to bring it in
especially if it's pretty complicated
what I'll do is I'll just get the
documentation example or a bit of it
just try and get running in its own
separate like I'll create a bare-bones
project to get it set up and and try to
get it running in there so now once you
finally get it running or set up and you
know a bare-bones very simple
application you kind of get a feel for
it and then you just go from there so
then you slowly tinker with it change
things and then eventually you've an
idea okay I see how I might be able to
integrate this with my own project and
then you just go ahead and you integrate
it and so that's usually what I end up
doing and I think it works out pretty
well okay so next question is then why
do you keep these boxes um that's a good
question
not many people have as many boxes as I
do so I'm currently in college and when
I moved here I had to pack up all my
stuff into boxes and so that is where my
initial stash of boxes came from and
actually includes probably about 90% of
boxes that I have it's just when I moved
in stuff that was stored in them and I
haven't thrown away because I need them
when I move out and then also of course
some from an ordering stuff from Amazon
and then also one of my big boxes is I
did order my bed online so the bed box
is pretty large yeah let's promote my
boxes they're coming from
and they just I just kind of kept them
that's why I kind of have like a nice
big box Tower right now okay so next is
dude are you running an eBay shop
no I'm not running an eBay shop and I
don't think I've actually ever posted
anything on eBay before next question is
problem-solving in JavaScript full stack
development often students are following
along verbatim which gives them an
identical app to the one being taught
but in order to transfer that skill of a
set to real-world applications or even
customize an app understanding how to
apply a new syntax how to problem solve
issues and how to think is the next
critical step and gain independence as a
developer so I would say with that is
once you go about following a tutorial
or a documentation on something is to
take that and build something with it
and so you'll then learn what areas
you're like you didn't really understand
when you did the tutorial or you
followed it and you can go back and read
like basically fix the parts you didn't
know about but it's very important to to
do that step where you use that code as
like a boilerplate or starting off and
then expand on it and try to build a
similar project and I think that helps a
lot and you'll get a lot out of it but
personally and also you have to look at
how you learn
personally I learned really well from
doing projects and coding so I spend
most of my time actually just building
things and my understanding grows the
best that way so that's what I would
recommend if you're struggling with you
know you can watch a tutorial build it
but then you're struggling building
stuff on your own take what you just
learned try to build that exact same
thing slightly differently or different
twist to it with the same language or
framework and use the boilerplate code
where you have the very rote and that'll
help a lot I think okay next question is
you look young dude so first question is
how old are you currently I'm 20 years
old and I'm quite skilled yes and next
question is how long have you been
programming
I've been programming for probably like
four years I'm gonna guess I started
junior year of high school so that's
when I was a roughly 16 years old I'm 20
now so about four years ish and next
question
talk about your programming background
I'll get back to that you on this I
think this would be a better question to
expand and go more in depth and I think
I'll make a separate video just talking
about that and I want to touch real
quick on the last question actually
again about programming experience
because I don't think it's actually a
great metric to ask how long you've been
programming in years and the reason for
that is if you take two people and they
say they both been programming for two
years that can be you vast ly different
things and I'll give you an example that
if you take the average computer science
student at a college or university
usually they're not programming a lot
usually a programming maybe I don't know
maybe an hour a week right they get one
assignment or two assignments an hour
two hours and then some weeks they don't
get assignments maybe other weeks
they'll have a big project they have to
do that maybe takes three or four hours
a little bit longer but an average I say
there's program one or two hours a week
just for school another thing with
University students is sometimes they
only are programming for school and
maybe they're programming more than that
but they're just programming for school
so compare that to other students and
like myself I will program a lot every
day just outside of school so I think
it's better to use maybe an hour metric
Halloween hours you've heard no that's
hard to keep track of over the years
right but saying how many years you've
if you compared by four years someone
else with four years they might be
drastically different and also I haven't
I would say to two of those years
programming a lot more than the other
two years that's the other thing
and I've been doing a lot of react
lately I think I learned react probably
a year ago I feel like maybe a little
bit longer so roughly about a year of
react experience that's the thing is
I've been doing react a ton so I feel
like I have probably more knowledge than
an average person that's been doing
react for about a year and graph QL - by
the way react graph QL nodejs odd stuff
about a year before that I did a C++ a
little bit Java Python mostly but I'll
get I'll get to that when I do my
programming background I'll talk more in
depth about that but yeah that's all
your guys's questions I hope I didn't
miss any if I did please leave a comment
below and I will answer them and the
opposite I'm getting pretty hungry I
think I want to go get some food I'll
see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
