of my thoughts on server-side rendering
I recently tried out to different
server-side rendering starter kits for
react just want to kind of talk about my
experience and what I liked about it
what I didn't like and if I'm going to
be using them in the future
so I started out with react QL because I
really liked graph QL big fan of it and
this was a specific starter kit for
graphical and react and then I tried out
next year because this is server-side
rendering and react next yes is the
thing it's a much bigger framework and
it's getting a ton of hype right now and
I thought I would like this one a lot
when I was first hearing about it what I
heard other people talking about it and
there's a lot of good things it promises
and a lot of good things it does and
server-side rendering if you don't know
it's supposed to help with SEO and also
with just the first time loading the
page should be faster so both those
things are big advantages that are hyped
about server-side rendering everyone's
kind of on the hype train right now on
it and I thought I would probably jump
on that hype train after I tried it but
as it's actually not the case when I
tried it I actually didn't like it as
much as I thought I would so starting
with react QL I actually liked this one
a little bit better and it's probably
because it's meant for graph QL and I
only disclaimer I only did graph QL
stuff with react so I think I was like
next shift more if I was doing maybe
some stuff with Redux and working with a
regular REST API but I was using graph
QL with it and I didn't like it that
much
I like react QL a little bit better than
next yes anxious I like the least and
react girl was a little bit better
worked a little bit better with graph QL
and was a little bit easier to set up
but here are the things I didn't like
about next shifts and honestly same
thing with react QL right the both
server side ring they didn't enjoy as
much
just that it was things just didn't work
out of the box I think it requires a
different mindset and I think that's
fine and I just think I don't like how
you need to do server-side pre-rendering
I might change my mind in the future and
I might come back server-side rendering
and I probably will right now I didn't
like the way you have to like make your
application to get server-side rendering
to work because it runs on the server
first and then gets run the clients you
have to think about that and things just
don't work out of the box you kind of
have to make it work in that paradigm
where it's running on the server first
and then goes to the client and things
like you know your header you need to
make sure you put in every single page
because each page is going to be loaded
basically separately right there's no
state between pages and as important I
didn't like that as much I think I would
have liked next year more like I said if
I was not doing bascule - it did not it
was I didn't like you too much in the
graph to QL because it here's a
basically a whole extra big file that I
had to grab from the next year's people
actually even get crack kill working so
and I felt like a lot of things were
like that
so I don't like that as much so if I was
actually starting a production
application today what I would be using
is create react app I like this one the
best there's one thing I did actually
really like about react QL which was
here's where they talked about all the
things that they do is annotations so
the @ sign that you can do they're not
showing it here but there's not
annotations and create react app yet and
so those are really nice with graph QL
and they reduce some boilerplate so I
really like that but for all general
purpose I really like create react app
which is not server-side rendered and I
I was building a production app today
which I actually am so I'll be coming
out soon I'll be talking about that more
later
but this guy I'm going to I am using and
I would use if I was creating more but
if I had to choose server-side rendering
I liked react you all better but again
I'm biased because I really like graph
QL and this one is basically built to
use graph QL so it's hard to beat it and
I definitely don't think server-side
rendering is bad though I would
recommend trying it out and see if you
like it because there is a lot of perks
to using server-side rendering as I
mentioned so if you like it definitely
use it but for me I'm going to be using
create react app in the future so that
guys just want to talk about that a
little bit thanks for watching and I'll
see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
