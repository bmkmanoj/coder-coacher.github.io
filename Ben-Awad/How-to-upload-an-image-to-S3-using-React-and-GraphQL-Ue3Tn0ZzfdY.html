upload a picture to s3 using react and
graph QL now if you don't know what s3
is it is a service by Amazon that allows
you to store pictures or files it's
really nice and great for applications
where you might have users uploading
lots of images and you want to store
them somewhere so let me show you an
example how it works and then we'll dive
into the code to make this happen so
right here I have a little form that I
can fill out so I'm gonna give them a
name
and upload an image here and then I'm
gonna hit submit and what's gonna happen
is it's gonna submit the form to my
server and also upload this to s3 so
it's pulling the image from s3 and we
have this text right here coming from
our database so let's see how this was
made how we actually made a request s3
to actually store the image so first I'm
gonna show you the front-end code to
make this happen and right here is our
upload page so this is the form that we
have the dropzone which is the little
thing where I can upload a file and then
when I upload a file we call this on
drop and all we're doing it on drop is
saving this file to our state and then
when I hit submit what's happening when
I click the submit button we're calling
the submit function right here and this
is the core of the action so right here
we upload s3 and we're calling a
mutation but first I want to show you
the actual graph QL so here that I'm
running two mutations first to get
what's called an s3 signature so it
actually uploaded to s3 what I'm using
is a URL I don't actually don't know how
to my client doesn't know how to upload
it to s3 what happens is I hit my server
and I say hey I'd like to upload an
image and I basically tell it the file
name of the image I want to upload and
the file type and what's going to happen
is it returns the server is gonna return
a URL and a sign request that I can then
use to make a request AWS and to s3 to
actually upload the image
itself so what the flow of this is is I
make a request to my server to get the
signed URL I then upload this to s3 and
then I create the champion using the
picture ul we get from s3 and store it
in the database to be used for later so
that's what the two mutations are here
for this guy for getting the URL this
one for submitting after we've uploaded
it to s3 that way we can store it in the
database itself and reference it later
okay so let's take a look at the actual
code that's getting around here
so of course I'm just grabbing the name
the file the name in the file so the
file name is different from name this is
just the name of my champion object so
file the first thing I'm gonna pass in
are the variables so I'm getting the
file name this is something that the
user provides this is just the default
name of their file and then the file
type or passing in as variables now you
notice I'm calling this function called
format file name and that's right here
and the reason for that is I just like
to format my files for s3 the the naming
of them and also there's some
restrictions so I'm basically like just
cleaning the name and then putting a
nice little date and cleaning it off so
it's not too long so here's what I do
I first grab the date in this format I'm
using moment J's for this there's just a
date library but you could also just use
a regular date and JavaScript then I'm
generating a random string here and then
here I'm getting rid of anything any bad
characters and the act like the first
file name that they named it so and then
I'm replacing all those with dashes so
I'm getting or spaces anything that
would cause problems in the string in it
and this is a regular expression where
I'm saying anything that's not a
uppercase a and Z or a lowercase a and Z
or 0 through 9 we get rid of and we're
lower casing this there's not a problem
and then I'm doing a new file name and
I'm storing this in a images folder and
s3 bucket and then here's how I'm
building the filename I'm putting the
date a random string and the cleaned
file name so this is just me building a
unique name for the file that I'm
uploading the s3 and then I return just
a substring because it can't be longer
than 60 characters or I think it might
be a few more characters you can't
remember but anyway so it doesn't it's
not too long that's all just naming the
file here and then after that I actually
do the upload so we're getting back or
we just got that the signed URL so we
know what we're supposed to make a post
request to so we used this signed
request and this URL that we get back
from our server and we upload it to s3
so this is an hour function I'll show
you that right here so I take the file
and the signed request and I just make a
put request and I just upload the file
and I'm just passing what the file type
is in the header so that's all that's
going on to upload to s3 we just need to
use the URL that was signed and I'll
show you guys how we're actually signing
the making this signed request in the
backend in a minute so that will upload
it to s3 and then this URL is actually
where the file will be once it's
uploaded you'll notice our sign request
generates that for us so after that what
we do is we saved that URL that we get
here in our database so this is just
create champions as a normal regular
database model we're saving the name and
the picture URL and our database and
then we're pushing to a new page so
we're pushing over to this champion page
and this champion page all we do is we
make a graph QL query to get the
champion and then we're just rendering
the name and the picture URL that's all
this picture RL is coming through s3 and
the name is just the name of champion so
that's what's going on the front-end and
let me show you what's happening on the
back
so here's my resolver this is actually
sign s3 but before I get into more about
how this works let me show you the
schema so here I just have a type s3
payload which has a signed request in
our URL they're both strings and then I
have a mutation here called sign s3
which takes a file name and a file type
and generates that payload back pretty
simple so let's look at the resolver
that does this so to do this resolver we
need to use the AWS SDK so if I screw up
to the top here you'll notice I am
importing the AWS SDK this is another
package that we need to use and you also
notice we need a couple environment
variables you don't have to store your
bucket as an environment variable this
is just something that I do makes it
easy you could just store this as a
string but the actual name of your s3
bucket you need and I just stored on a
variable up here because I use it a
couple of different places and also you
want to make sure there's two
environment variables AWS access key ID
and ADA a secret access key that you are
storing so these you can get on the AWS
console and make sure you store them so
I have a diet in file where I set them
and that way they're available because
this AWS SDK uses these two to actually
make the request and then here I'm just
creating basically initializing the
object and I'm saying which region then
I'm in US East too and then the version
you want to put V for and then here we
put the parameters for creating this
signed request so I passed an s3 bucket
the file name that was supplied the file
type and then the ACL
I forget what ACL is I think has
something to do with permissions and we
want to be anyone can be able to read it
so you do public read and then expires
means how long they have to
actually send the request after we
create this URL so I believe this is
second so we're giving them 60 seconds
once they have uploaded so this URL that
we this signed request that we pass back
it expires in 60 seconds so if the user
doesn't upload that if our client our
react code doesn't upload in the next 60
seconds it will actually the sign
request will invalidate it's been too
long and then we just create the sign
request using the s3 object we created
right here so the aw SDK is doing all
the work for us and we want to put the
object there and we're basically
uploading an image so we put object and
then here console we're just creating
the URL from the s3 bucket and then the
filename and that's how you create the
final name right there and the URL
that's gonna be stored at and then we
just return this back and that's what
our client uses so that is how you
create a sign request and now and you
actually didn't have a client and the
nice thing about this is your client
doesn't have any of your AWS credentials
and stuff so you don't expose that to
anyone so this is a way to keep it
secure and so no one can sign things or
no one can upload to your s3 unless they
have a signed URL so you can protect
this endpoint right here like for
example I could only allow people that I
want to so I could put permissions on
this actual graphical endpoint kind of
how I do requires off that create
resolver I could say this requires
author this requires some special
privilege that I checked before letting
someone use it now there's also some
things you can do in the console for AWS
and I'll show you guys that so this is
what my AWS console looks like for s3
here's my bucket policy and I'll show
you my course configuration in a second
I honestly am not very experienced with
how permissions works on s3 so I'm not
sure too much how this works but
basically what I want to allow is people
to upload images and
images so that's what I tried to do with
my bucket policy in my Coors
configuration and it does work but I'm
not sure if it's too open
this is something I need to spend more
time on like tuning and figuring out for
sure what you don't know is here this is
my bucket name so this what I have for
dinner actually but you can switch out
your your bucket name right here and you
could copy this bucket policy and here's
the course configuration so you can
actually allow only certain websites
like I could just allow localhost
through 2001 here but I'm allowing
everyone actually sorry it's up here
allowed origin
so there's different ones and here are
the different operations you allow so
those are the two things you can also
change and there's also access lists and
other things other permissions you can
change on s3 that can go more into death
with depth into how much you want to
secure your application but that should
be a good starting point and give you an
idea of how you can start uploading
files s3 storing them over there and
then keeping the URL in the database you
can actually reference it and show your
the pictures on your website so that is
it for this video guys the code for both
the front end and the back end will be
up on github and I'll put a link in the
description below if you want to check
out any of it
and give it a try so thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
