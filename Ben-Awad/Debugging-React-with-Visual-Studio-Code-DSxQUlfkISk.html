the chrome debugger for Visual Studio
code that lets you debug react code in
Visual Studio and I want to just kind of
walk you guys through how he did that
and how you can debug your first program
now they say you can only do this with
create react app so I'm not sure if this
works for other starter kits it might as
well but I know for sure this works with
great react app so the first thing I did
is I click this little box here to
install a plug-in in the plug-in that I
installed or extension is up here
debugger for Chrome I have no idea if
this works for Firefox as well this is
specific to Chrome you can search it
over here and it'll come up and just
download this one with three million
downloads and then once you have that
you can pull up the react app location
that you want and I'm just gonna npm
start to start the server as usual so I
just hit control + the tilde sign to
bring up terminal and then I'm gonna go
ahead and say NPM start for my project
and this will go ahead and open my
browser and I'm gonna go ahead and run
this on a different port cuz I have
another react application running right
now but I'm gonna go ahead it'll go
ahead and start up on will close 3001
and we can close terminal and we can
just use the application regularly if we
wanted but all you want to do here is
debug so once we have the server started
up like this we can start debugging
and to do that you click on this little
bug icon with visual studio code and for
whatever reason you need to actually
close this but make sure your server is
still running just close the window at
least that's what I had to do and I
click on this little cog and I click
chrome and what get created is this
little launch JSON file and this launch
of JSON file I want to just say the port
got my localhost is running on so you
guys saw mine was on three thousand in
one
so I'll set that and just save it and go
ahead and click this little Run button
and those house turns orange down here
and now we see it launched again and now
we're to be debugging we're actually in
debug mode and you'll notice how I have
these little options up here this is how
you debug so for this we're going to
debug the login page so the first thing
I want to do is catch it every time I
make a change so my on change function
here is called every time I type so to
set a breakpoint you just come over here
to the side right next to the number a
little red dot pops up I click on that
so every time I type what's gonna happen
is it's actually gonna freeze the window
over here and I can click this if I want
to resume but you notice I'm now
debugging this and if I open up that bug
window I have earlier I can see right
here the local variables so I can see my
eave area below right here and I can go
into the props if I wanted to could see
my Global's which you know there's a
bunch of react stuff you don't have to
we don't talk about that you can see
your local variables you can kind of see
the flow of your function so if I wanted
to I could step through this so this
little guy right here we step over and
we can just go through that function and
I could just go ahead and push the green
arrow to continue and have it run
we got an exception not sure what this
exception is about I'm just gonna go
ahead and click run and if I don't want
to get all these exceptions you notice
how down here it tells you when to
automatically break so we have this on
uncaught exceptions I can get rid of
that and
it play-doh go ahead I don't see all
these random exceptions that pop up and
if I click on this debug console I can
actually see the console here so if I
inspect console you'll notice how these
will match up so I have this weird lazy
require webstore I actually don't know
what this is I've never seen this air
before I wonder if it's just because I'm
debugging that that's popping up but
it's a call i can type another letter
and actually i just broke the debugger
look at that we're done debugging so i
think that was actually related to the
debugger i've never had that happen to
me before i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
close it reopen it and see if it'll work
and i'm gonna go ahead and click this
again this is a good one uncut
exceptions is a good thing to break on
so you can see when your code is
breaking usually it's not your code
causing the error but let's go ahead and
go to login and let's see if we caused
the same arrogance so again I have this
breakpoint set here and instead of
stepping through this I'm just gonna go
ahead and push play and you'll notice we
don't get that error again it'll stop me
every time I type I can run it I'm not
sure what was it going on there I think
mails a Visual Studio code bug or
something but what I can do is while I'm
debugging here I can actually take this
off and now I just do it regularly so
you can toggle the breakpoints on and
off if you want and if you want you can
also get this here you can go into or
out of functions we don't really want to
go into the set stay function but I
don't know if I have any functions that
can really help us here but for whatever
reason if we want to see the internals
of set state I can click on that and
you'll notice how I'm actually in the
internals of this function and if I
wanted to get here I can push this come
back out if I want to restart everything
I click that guy restart you'll notice I
reload the page over here everything
restarts and I can click on this little
stop button if I want so I'm doing the
unchanged function here let's try the
submit and actually walk through what it
looks like to walk through a function so
I'm
go ahead and click a little stop guy on
this response so I'm gonna go ahead and
type my email and my password and click
login and this actually never gets
called what the heck I'm gonna go ahead
and put my breakpoint here click login
there we go
I don't know why this didn't get called
I don't know if it got caught or what
actually I did so the reason why this
break pointed so if you noticed I was
able to login we got this invalid login
here the reason for that is I set a
breakpoint here but since this is what's
causing throwing the air we didn't get
it so let's step through this I don't
know why I just went to the bundle I
just stepped over this function that's
very odd so you can see it's a little
buggy
all right let's step out of this step
out step out I'm going to all these
random functions even though I'm saying
step out I'm just gonna go ahead and
restart that so as you can see this is
the debuggers a little buggy and I'm not
sure if I actually enjoy doing this more
than just putting like print statements
but now and then it is pretty helpful
this is definitely the most buggy I've
seen this thing before
doesn't I've never had this many
problems with it before so go ahead see
if we can step through this guy at least
so step over man same thing happens with
this bundle thing just go ahead and
restart it I think it's because it
doesn't like the try catch we can try
putting the catch putting a breakpoint
in the catch itself so login go ahead
and step and that seems to work okay
we're gonna hit it run to finish the
function
but that is how you debug your code you
can go ahead and put your breakpoints
here you can say what bright pants you
want to get caught on so notice how it
knows I have a breakpoint here I can get
rid of this breakpoint if I wanted it
talked you saw it toggle on and off so I
want to set a breakpoint on change you
notice how we just paused here but if I
want before you replay this again I can
just turn that off right with this check
mark and now I can type fine so this how
you can control toggling the breakpoints
on and off or you can come over here and
press them and you can get the uncaught
if you want and the only settings over
here is in the launch Thai JSON which
you create and this is a nice little
menu can hover around you just click
this to pop that so that is the debugger
for react personally I'm not in love
with it I think I actually prefer just
doing console log statements
whenever debugging but I think when you
have like an algorithm or something that
in particular sometimes can be nice to
step through with the debugger because
you can see all the the values and stuff
of it but a lot of time your code looks
like this Reed is loading async but if
you have a more complex set state or
something it can be nice to step through
it with debugger so do give this a try
but as you can see you might just like
doing console log statements better
because it's a little buggy as you saw
and it's not necessarily buggy but we're
going into files that aren't that
helpful that's probably the correct way
but it's not super helping us find a bug
or whatever so that's it for this video
guys
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
