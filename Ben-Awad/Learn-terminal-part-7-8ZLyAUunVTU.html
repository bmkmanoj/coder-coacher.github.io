to go over to new commands and the
command line but first I want to talk
about how we're gonna do it so i just
downloaded django which is just
basically big piece of code has a lot of
coding it's an open source python
framework for doing web stuff just go
here and click download I'll leave this
in description if you want to follow
along and download this as well but just
wanted to let you guys know that so it's
in my downloads folder if I do an LS I
see Django I'm just going to see the end
of Django and we see all these little
folders I'm going to see you into Django
again and then there we see more folders
and we're going to just look at the
utils folder for now okay cool so I see
all these different files what does the
grep command you what the grep command
does is allows you to search a sort a
piece of a file for a certain word so
for example let's say I want to search
for the word if and the deconstruct file
what it does is when we run grab it will
print each line that has a if statement
so look at this one as if statement this
one is of statement this guy's at this
statement so just prints the line that
has if statement on it but notice it's
not just if statements it's any letter i
F we can also use maps or not maps we
can do the star that which we saw in a
different video so for example I can
check if there's a look for all
instances of the use of if and all of
these files right here so if i hit enter
we can see it'll tell us the name of the
file and then the line that it found the
if in so for example in treetops you why
we see there's an if right here and it
spits up the line that has there this is
good for searching through lines of code
if you want to find something
and you know just check if something is
there for example I don't know we can
just you know do something goofy and you
see there's use this new output except
for just this garbage because it was not
able to find this this would be helpful
if you're looking for a specific
function like let's see if they use the
map function it looks like these map a
couple times but notice it doesn't just
hit map its map eng important to know
you can also use regular expressions and
grab i'm not going to talk about how to
use regular Trisha's that right now on
those are more complicated if you want
to our expressions let me know in the
comments below I may do a video on that
but just know that what grep does is it
allows you to for the first command put
what you're looking for in the second
one the file you would like to look for
in this case we're looking for
everything we could look at just Python
files I can specify the certain Python
file like to look for likely we can
check in six and we see there's two
lines that contain it so it just spits
out the lines that contain that and
that's how grep works the next one I
want to go over is find what this does
is just clear this up is it looks for
multiple different things for example it
can look for files you can look for
directories or folders and that sort of
thing so if we just print we notice we
have inspect 6py and some other jazz
here we're going to remember that we're
just going to go up a folder we're going
to go back to downloads and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to find in
Django so first you do the Korean find
where you would like to search I'd like
to search and Django the folder Django
and then you have to tell what you're
searching for now differs different ways
to do that in this case I want to search
for something with the name for example
6 so I do dash name and I do 6py and I
do enter I notice it goes through and
then finds oh here's a where
six is located now it can do a lot it
can do more advanced things as well
first off another flag that I use a lot
is type you can do type F this specifies
only search for for example if there's a
folder called 6py that's not the case of
course it would find that too but this
search is just for files the search is
just for folders or directories with the
stash type D what you'll see is
important in a little bit later so you
can also do wild card expansion so for
example I'm looking for we can do I and
then a star and you can see it spits out
a whole bunch of stuff invalid your l's
because this starts with an i any word
any file that starts with an i just
found for us and printed it out so I'm
just gonna hit the up arrow to run that
command again and maybe I'm looking just
for the ones that are Python files so
all Python files that start for eyes
what I just tried to find there and you
know you can do all sorts of different
things to try to find different files so
this is very nice really handy the other
thing I like to do is what's called the
exec command the exact flag so if I just
do dash exec what this will do is every
time it finds a file it will then grep
it so and this is where it's very
helpful i'll show you if i don't run it
with anything so let's say i want i'm
looking for something specific for out
of the word hello let's see if we can
find that you know we get a bunch of
this garbage is a directory is a
directory is a directory and we get this
nasty garbage because what it's doing is
its grapping directories and it's giving
you basically an error message also good
to note notice when i ran this command
I'm just like running you know what's
going on let's say I don't want it to
continue running I see it's garbage you
get control see that terminates the
yup the program running so ctrl C stop
that anyway so you see all got all that
garbage about directories if I do dash
type f that will only do files and you
won't get this stuff it looks like
there's a binary file that has the word
hello in it but let's do something else
that will that will match better let's
look for I don't know it's an obscure
function let's see if they're casting
anything to an int that's not that ups
here so let's going through and you can
see it's still running and it's looking
for every time it sees file with int in
it so we're just going to cancel that
well it's happening and you can also do
this for example I can do name so you
can stack these flags like I told you
before so it has to be a got python file
the file has to start with an i and so
right now we're trying to find a file
that's in this folder it starts with an
i it's a python file it's a file and
then we're wrapping it to see if it has
int in it so we're just gonna run it and
look at that we round we found a couple
looks like a couple different files but
notice it just sends us a bunch of
garbled text we actually can't see what
it where it's from if you do to dash
print flag that will tell you where it's
coming from so for example in the ipv6
you'll notice it has a what were we
looking for int as inch right there so
as you can see this find is very
powerful this might be kind of confusing
there's a lot going on here i recommend
you looking at the man page for find it
has a lot of other things you can do for
searching that is pretty helpful but
lets you view a lot of powerful things a
lot of cool things to search through
code find things and can be pretty handy
when you don't know where things it
you're trying to find something
find myself doing it a lot for example
in like my home directory a search like
find squiggly and I'm looking for I
don't know a file that you know
sometimes i'm looking for the specific
file i know i started with a PE and i
know it was a C++ file but I don't
remember exactly what I called it and I
can just run something like this and
it'll go and find something that matches
that description so it can be really
helpful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
