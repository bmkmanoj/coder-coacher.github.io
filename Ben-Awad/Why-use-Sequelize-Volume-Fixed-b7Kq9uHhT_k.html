you have to make sequel statements so
I'm gonna be doing this with JavaScript
but this is gonna be general and you can
take this for whatever language you're
using for your server so you can just
run vanilla sequel statements using
something called node Postgres this is a
JavaScript library that just lets you
run sequel statements so you can run
this what you can do is depending on
what you know the user asked for your
server can run different queries or
execute different delete update all
those different sequel statements you
want to run and basically you just just
like this you're right out your sequel
standard so this is one way to do it
another way a lot of people do it and
that I'm currently doing it with the
project is using what's called an arm
the arm that I'm using is called sequel
eyes and an arm stands for an object
relation mapping and basically what that
does is it converts a JavaScript object
to a database table and so on so for
example here they have a user so notice
how this is them setting up the schema
when I set the schema they're not
actually writing sequel see how there's
no sequel here this is a little example
of sequel eyes there's no sequel instead
they're writing JavaScript and that gets
transformed sequel eyes will transform
that into a sequel statement for them so
it's taking this JavaScript object here
and it's gonna submit that it's gonna
insert that into the table that's what
this user dot create is happening right
there so they're creating a user table
here that's what this chunk of code is
doing and then here they're creating a
user with this data so just a faster way
an easier way if you're using javascript
and orbs are universal these they have
them in every language it's a fast way
to take you know your object that you
have in JavaScript and convert it to
sequel and run it
you know create your objects and for
example you don't have to take it so
notice here how they're doing this
dollar sign one text thing and they're
like putting hello world here that's
what it's doing
you don't have to do any of that kind of
replacement sequel eyes handles it for
you right you don't have to put this
inside of this you don't have to build
the query yourself sequel eyes builds
the query and does a lot of a heavy
lifting for you now there's a big con to
this too though so seek allies they give
you a lot of power and do a lot for you
but you lose control with node Postgres
and with any sort of one that like this
where you're get direct access you can
write more efficient queries because
you're writing the exact query right
this is also assuming you're good at
database stuff if you're not good
database stuff use an arm will probably
write better queries than you can but
there'll be some scenarios where sequel
eyes might not write very good queries
now for the most part it does and that's
when it's you could use node Postgres
and the nice thing about sequel eyes is
if you know something is not running
well you can always do a one-off
statement like this and sequel eyes like
you can write sequel and sequel eyes too
but a lot of time you'll be using
JavaScript but this is as you can see
we're connecting to the database and you
can you can basically control when
you're connecting to the database when
you're not connecting how many threads
you have open and all that stuff and you
don't do as much of the stuff and sequel
eyes you can but you you're pretty much
you know this is what your code looks
like you're creating objects and you're
not dealing as much with the lower-level
stuff that this is so this is more work
but you can you know sequel is does a
little bit more heavy lifting for you
but you pay for that and one it could be
a little slower and a little bit more
heavyweight but it development speed is
a huge increase with sequel eyes
compared to those now sequel eyes is not
the only arm it's the one I'm using but
I'm actually not a huge fan of it and
there's two other ones
that I heard that are decent that I want
to check out soon the first is called
necks and the second is bookshelf and I
believe bookshelf it says it's built on
neck so it should be very similar I
don't know really the differences
between the two but they have a little
more different syntax than house
equalise does it so I want to try that
out so you can see what it looks like
here they're connecting to the database
it looks a little bit different their
code thence equalizes so these are two
to check out as well if you are looking
for an arm and JavaScript currently
using this this is like the most popular
one and there's just a lot of good
information out there if you want to
learn sequel eyes and build stuff with
it so I'm using sequel iced-over node
Postgres because i like the development
speed that's just if if I find that
sequel eyes is doing something slow I
can always write my own query they have
a command that lets you do a raw query
like this so you kind of get best of
both worlds I can write code really fast
the sequel isin if I need to write a
query myself I can - so that's kind of
the different ways you can write sequel
statements and communicate with your
database from your Express server but as
I was saying these are these are the
JavaScript specific but there's gonna be
once for this for every language if
you're using Python using Django there's
gonna be different ones if you're using
Ruby on Rails elixir all those different
backends they'll have this exact same
options for you to choose from and arm
or writing the queries yourselves it'll
be bunches of different arms you can
choose from so I would recommend using
norm because it's just the development
speed it gives you you can code stuff
done get done a lot faster so that's
what I would say on that that's it for
this video guys thanks for watching
