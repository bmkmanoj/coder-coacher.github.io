to work on is adding users or
registering them so to do this we need
to set up a table in our database to
store them and how you do this with type
worm is things called entities so right
now in our project under source entity
we already have a single one called user
so we're going to basically start from
this and then add on to it so you could
think of each entity is more or less
correlates to a table in the database
right here we have a single table called
the user or they might slightly change
the name maybe two users and we're gonna
modify this so here are the columns and
our table the first one is an ID now
right now it's using a numerical ID that
just increments but an ID that I like
better these days is a UID so that means
it's going to be of type string and it's
just going to be a primary column so
like this and the reason why I like
using this over a numerical ID is
because it hides the ID and people can't
guess it and so what I mean by that is a
UID for those of you that don't know is
basically just a random 16-bit number or
it's not a number it's blue that's 16
letters string or something of that sort
and as opposed to an ID numerical which
goes 1 2 3 and so on
so the reason I don't like 1 2 3 4 is
people can guess basically the IDS in
your tables and they can also know how
many items you have in your database
basically I don't want to give that
knowledge to an outsider I'd like to
hide this and so a UUID does that and so
we're gonna be adding a library to
create uu IDs automatically for us
whenever we create a user so the library
that I'm going to be
is called UUID so I'm just going to copy
this and I'm gonna use yarn so yarn add
and then there's a couple different
versions of these that we're going to
use or could use the one we're going to
use is the random one which is version 4
I'm gonna copy this and paste it in here
and I'm gonna switch this over to import
syntax now a few things it doesn't like
if we hover over we can see first is
we're never using it so let's first use
it so what I'd like to do is insert a
new ID for this user whenever we are
about to create it so there is a special
function or special on decorator that we
can use from type form called the for
insert and we can do I'm gonna call this
add ID so this function can do whatever
I want and though it's going to be
called right before it's inserted into
the database so what I'm going to do is
say this the ID so this is gonna
reference the current ID I'm just gonna
create a new one for it so perfect so
now every time we insert a user into the
database this function is gonna run
before it and it's going to add the ID
so we don't have to actually add the ID
when we call the insert function this
will automatically handle it for us so
next error is it can't find a
declaration file for the module so
whenever you install a library that's a
JavaScript library it's not gonna have
definitions and we're using typescript
so luckily they have a definition file
but what you have to do to install it is
do at types slash UUID
you'll notice I did an uppercase D here
did install it as a dev dependency
alright so I got rid of that error the
next error we're gonna get is sub module
import path from this package if this
allowed and this is a TS lint thing so
I'm actually just gonna turn off this
rule because we're fine importing from
sub modules
in this project so we're just gonna say
false and our TS lint config and then
lastly it just has no default import and
so when you get that you just import it
like this so perfect alright so now we
are creating an ID for this guy
let's fix these columns right here I
want two columns at least to start with
the email and then password and I'm sure
you're probably wondering why we specify
like string here this is actually the
type script type of it
so when we're using this in typescript
we expect its type to be a string we
also need to specify the type we would
like this to be in the database so I
want to be a bar chart and here I can
specify as a second parameter any
options so I want to specify the length
I'm gonna say is 255 I think it's like a
good amount of size but I don't think
it'll get bigger than that but we're
still giving enough room for users to
type whatever password or email that
they have I think it's always good to
have a max even if max is really good
big I think that's fine just to make
sure there isn't any people you know
making Chennai enormous emails or
whatnot and actually since we're hashing
the password we don't even have to worry
about using varchar' for this one we can
just use text I believe at least there I
think there's the others text and text
allows it to be any length at least in
Postgres sequel so we don't worry about
the password length because we're using
hashing and that in here so we're going
to store the hash and not the plain text
version or the real thing and then here
we still want to cap the email so
someone does that do a super long email
alright so this is good for our user
there's one last thing I'm
say extends base entity this is a type
worm thing that's going to give us
access to be able to do for example I
can now do user dot create and then just
pass in the values to create a user
extending basins T allows us to do that
alright so this looks good for our
database column now we're gonna have to
actually synchronize our database and we
have synchronization to true so type
arms gonna automatically do that when it
basically starts up but we're gonna
worry about that later so right now our
database is not in the right basically
format or doesn't have that table with
those columns that we want but we're
gonna be syncing that up after we do
resolvers and then our schema so I want
to go ahead and move the type deaths to
a separate file I'm gonna call it schema
that graph QL for now and I'm choosing
to make this a graph QL file to store
this stuff for a couple of reasons one
we get this nice syntax highlighting as
opposed to a string and two we're gonna
be using a library that needs it to be
in the format of dot graph QL and you'll
see why or plucking down a little bit
but we can't just now import this schema
graph QL file we have to actually use a
library to do this and the way we're
going to be using is called graph QL
import so I'm gonna go ahead and add
this and then what we're gonna do is
we're just gonna use this import schema
function which allows us to import from
dock graph kill so let's at that and we
can just copy this bit here
and now we don't actually care about
graph QL tools so we're gonna remove
that okay so we have the type deaths now
coming from the dot graph QL file which
is perfect and I also want to remove my
resolvers to a separate file so I'm
gonna create a file called resolvers
typescript now I might end up doing this
and kind of like a folder structure
later but for now I'm just gonna move it
here and it'll be easy to split up later
if I want to and we're just gonna import
resolvers from dot slash there's alders
okay so we split everything up nicely
now we're gonna edit the schema and I
have a new type so this is going to be a
mutation and it's gonna be register so
in register we're gonna do taking a few
parameters the first is email and this
is required to string and then a
password which is also a required string
and lastly we're just gonna return a
boolean which is going to be true or
false whether we successfully registered
that user all right so before I actually
type out the resolvers over here I want
to go over a few things so right now
we're specifying oops the keyword in
here in here for the types but really
it'd be nice to be able to get the type
of these arguments especially because we
know what the types are here so there's
a library that actually helps us with
that and it's called gql - typescript so
we're gonna install this and what's
going to allow us to do is add the type
definitions for these functions
automatically - so I'm gonna go ahead
and install it locally or as a dev
dependency so
yarn add - D gql to typescript and then
in my package.json we're actually going
to create a script called Gen schema
types and what this is going to do is
just call this function so or not this
function this command-line utility and
we're gonna run this one so what it does
is it takes a schema as the input and
outputs type script so let's see this
guy in action so my schema is at schema
doc graph QL and the output I'm gonna
put this into source and I'm gonna
create a folder called types and so I'm
gonna go into source slash types is
gonna be at the output graph QL DTS and
maybe I'm gonna call this something else
I'm gonna call this schema dot
typescript so this way we now have and
maybe I'll just say no that's fine I was
thinking I might prefix it but I think
I'll just call it schema all right let's
run this and see what happens so yarn
and what did I call it Gen schema types
gens schema types and if you get this
allowed but here it means that I believe
it works so if we go into types we can
see schema dot d dat typescript and
here's all the junk that it gave us so
this might not look super useful and
actually I don't even come in and look
at this here's what I usually do so now
that we have that what we can do is in
our resolvers instead of putting any
here I can actually specify the type of
this argument and what I do is I say gql
and that's the namespace that it uses
and then what i say is i want to get the
arguments for hello so i say i because
it's an interface and I just do hello
and then I just auto complete it and
this is the basically arguments now for
hello and we get them from that type
file so that's perfect
the other thing is I don't want to
specify
here so there's this thing called AI
resolvers I resolvers from graphical
yoga which basically will have all the
types but I've noticed it doesn't always
work and we'll see that it's about to
break when we add our mutation so let's
add our mutation now for register so
register and again we're gonna have just
an underscore and then here are my
arguments and this is of the type and
let's there we go
GQ l dot register and I register and it
looks like something is broken because I
wanted to autocomplete for me I think
maybe because I left it empty I register
there we go
but notice how we have now a little air
that pops up is not assignable and I
guess the type is not compatible for
whatever reason but it does go ahead and
it now knows for example I have an email
and a password here so it knows those
properties exist on this object which is
crucial and I can also see this is a
string this is a string because of this
so now whenever I add something to my
schema all I'm going to do is I'm going
to just run yarn gin schema types and
then my resolvers I can then specify the
types and then as far as this thing I'm
basically going to create my own type
here so inside of types I'm going to
create a new file I'm gonna create it
I'll just call it graph QL utils dot d
dot TS and I could just do dot type
script and then export on this interface
and I'm gonna call it resolver the map
and it's gonna be a key which is a
string
and it's gonna have an object which
should be a key of a string and then
here is our function which we have a
parent which is any arguments which is
any context which we're actually gonna
be defining later but for now it's gonna
be empty object because we're not
passing any context and then it can
return anything from this so basically
this is the type of this resolver over
here so I'm gonna now replace it with
resolved in that and we now have these
guys happy everything's happy except for
we're not using these and we haven't
defined the block so that's what we're
gonna be doing in the next video is
actually filling out the register
mutation and put the business logic to
actually create the user in the database
so it for this video guys thanks for
watching
