video I want to show you some commands
that will help you working with big
files and checking them looking at them
and debugging some you know making sure
to files have the same contents and then
so the first thing I want to talk about
is the command if what diff does is it
takes two arguments two files so they
have two files a and B and it compares
files and B to see if they are the same
this is going to be really handy when
you're running programs and you want to
make sure the output is the same you
know you run it today you run tomorrow
make sure that puts the same or it's
been a while it's basically checking two
files and making sure the same so to
help me show you how this works I have
an infinite Python program I just wrote
and it just goes from a really big
number and prints out a bunch of big
numbers here's the code for it so if i
run python infinite just spits out a ton
of numbers right well as we learned in
our prior less than i can redirect this
to a file a and i can redirect it again
to another file called be and now
theoretically a and B should be the same
right but the really big how do we know
for sure well one way to do that is to
diff a and B if you hit enter look we
got no output that means they're the
exact same now i'm going to create
another file called see but i'm going to
this takes a second to run i'm going to
end it early just like that if we do a
cat on see well notice it only goes to
this number whereas if we do a cat on be
it goes all the way down to that number
so if we do a diff on B and C will
notice we get this weird output with all
these things so what does this mean what
is it telling us well first noticed
there is a carrot right here this is
telling us that this line is missing
from another line so if I did it from C
to B notice how the arrow is pointing
the other way basically it's telling us
this number was present and B but was
not present and see when we flipped at
this other
way it was just the arrow is just point
at the file that this number exists in
so now that B is over in this side this
99 is pointing at be because that number
exists in be it doesn't exist and see so
it's checking each line in each of the
files and comparing them then checking
if they're the same and if they are the
same like a and B it prints nothing and
you know they're the same so there could
be helpful win testing the outputs of
your programs now if we just do the man
page for diff there's a lot of different
other flags I'm not going to go through
all of them because there's a lot of
them but take a look if you in ignore
case or skip new lines or there's
several other different things you can
do to diff two files which would be very
helpful so take a look at that if you
want to do more in-depth diffing but
it's good know this exists when you need
to use it the other thing is notice when
I cat a that's really huge and stuff I
can do less on a and they can scroll
through but still let's just say I want
to see the first five elements or
something I can use a command called
head so i could do head a and by default
it just shows the first 10 lines of the
file a get head be i can head see and it
just prints the first 10 lines now i can
use the dash n command and it tells you
you know there that dash in flag and you
specify the number of lines like to see
so maybe I only want to see two lines
from a it just first shows me the first
two lines and of course I can ask for
more let's say I want 20 shows me the
first 20 lines so this can be very
helpful when you wanted to see the first
couple of lines in a program and you can
also pipe that remember you can pipe
almost anything so if I just pipe head
on to this it'll show me the first 10
lines of this output and then it'll tell
me the pipes broken because it continues
running but you can see that right here
it just showed the first 10 lines and
now there's a counterpart to head what's
called tail so the tail gets the last 10
lines of the file so if i do tail a you
know these are the last 10 and it has
the dash n flag as well I could ask for
two if I wanted to
and if we do a tail on in nearly show 5
on C will see that the last five lines
are different than the five bus lines of
a and that's another way to kind of
check different files if you just want
to look at the bottom or the top that's
really helpful so that was just a couple
commands i want to show you to help you
with looking at files makes a little bit
easier so again one more time to review
we use diff which compares two files a
and B and then looks at their contents
and tells you which lines are different
tale looks at the last X number of lines
default looks at ten lines but you can
do the dash and flag can get as many as
you want any head is the inverse gets
the topmost so check out these commands
try them out and hopefully that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
