the last video and where you can type
stuff in here and we're keeping track of
the state and then when I hit submit I
can see what the values of my email and
password are in this video we're going
to take the next step and when I hit
submit it's actually going to send a
mutation to our server and log the user
in so let's get started on that so to do
this what we're gonna do is add a login
mutation on our server and we are going
to basically be using a education
methods that I have created in a
previous basically project and what
we're gonna be attending is this try
login so I'm gonna copy this right here
and we're gonna paste it into an auth GS
file on our server now I'm gonna go over
what each one of these methods does and
we're gonna be we already have low - and
bcrypt
we just need JSON web token so I'm gonna
say yarn add JSON web token okay so try
login is going to be where we actually
basically the resolver we're gonna run
and this is to attempt to login the user
so we have an email a password and then
a secret and secrets important which
we'll talk about that in a second so
first we try to find a user we're
finding a user with the given email so
if we can't find the user based on their
email here they don't exist we can just
throw an air so--that's throw new error
here but actually before I go through
this off I want to create the schema
with you guys so it makes more sense so
I'm gonna create a login mutation there
takes a email which is a string and a
password which is a string
and it returns something and what do I
want to return I'm gonna call this login
response so it's gonna be okay which is
a boolean and similar before we're gonna
show any errors that might pop up while
doing this and then also we're gonna put
two things a token which is a string and
oops I forgot this can be heirs and
token can be nullable token and then
refresh token and that's what we're
gonna return login response now token
and refresh token are JSON web tokens
which are basically a long string that
we can put data into so when we call a
tri login here we're gonna attempt to
log the user in and now in this example
I was throwing an error but I don't
really want to throw an error if this
happens what I want to do is I want to
return okay is equal to false and Ayers
is equal to path email and oops message
email not found there no user with this
email exists or something like that and
then here the next thing we try to do is
we found a user with their email so they
gave us a valid email we want to make
sure they gave us a valid password so
here is where we use bcrypt
and this is a async function because
Beeker compares asynchronous so we're
going to wait the response and it was
how our first one is our past where this
is plain text and the user dot password
is our hash so what bcrypt will do is
they'll go ahead and hash the password
here and compare whether this password
is the same as this password that's
hashed for us and then it's going to
give us a boolean back whether it's
valid it's not valid we know we got a
bad pass
so we're gonna instead of throwing air
again we're gonna do this or turn back
to our user and the reason why I'm
putting this in an off jeaious files
because we're gonna be using this in
possibly other places so path this is
gonna be password and we can just say
wrong password now you notice we're
giving the user information about
whether their password was wrong or
whether their email was wrong you know
we could just say wrong email that's
that's simple wrong email or wrong
password you don't have to do this you
can just return invalid invalid login so
you don't tell the user whether it's an
email or password it kind of just
depends on how much information you want
to tell the user now next thing we're
going to do is the user has successfully
logged in if they've made it past these
two if statements we know they gave us a
good password and a good email and we're
what we want to do is we want to create
their JWT token because they are good to
go and then we can just go ahead and
create their tokens and return those and
now we're going to say okay is true too
and so I'm gonna go over how this create
tokens works in a second but let's talk
about how we're gonna actually call this
try login so in my resolvers over here
my user resolver i'm going to import try
login from off
and then down here after give you before
registered we're gonna say login parent
args and args here is an email and a
password and we have models and then
we're gonna call try login and that's
what's gonna get returned whatever the
the return value of try login is so we
need to pass email password models in a
secret so email password models and then
also a secret so where are we gonna get
this secret well the secret is used for
our AWT tokens and we're gonna pass that
in from our context so that's how we're
gonna call this so now in our function
over here or in our basically our main
server class I'm just gonna up here say
Const secret is equal to something
that's the vast secret value I'm gonna
create and it's just a random string
value now we can pass this in now a we
can use in our resolver now try login
let's go over how this create tokens is
working so when we create a token we're
gonna get two things back first a token
which is gonna be looked like something
like this there gonna be some periods in
it and staying with refresh token and
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna
store a ID in this string and it's
basically cryptic sign cryptic Lee
signed that way what's gonna happen is
only people that know our secret are
able to decode this well anyone can
decode it but basically verify it so
we're the only one who can issue tokens
here
and we could just create tokens function
we can see and we'll talk about how to
refresh tokens work later but this is
how you create them and this is actually
synchronous so I'm gonna just change
this I had this wrong before
so create token and create refresh token
okay so you'll notice how for create
token I'm doing a signature I'm passing
in the secret and we also need to pass
in a second secret which we'll do in a
second
so I'm gonna pass two secrets one for
our refresh token and one for our token
we want this to be different and I'm
going to talk about how we're gonna
choose the secret for a refresh token
because I'm gonna do it in a kind of a
special manner and also passing in the
user end so from our user we are
selecting some fields here I was
selecting is admin field but we don't
have that so we really only care about
the ID and what we could do is we could
just actually pass no this is fine so
we're picking only the ID field from
this user object and passing it and
that's what we're storing in the token
so it should be an object but has it
looks something like this of an object
which has a user which has an ID of like
2 or something and so whenever the user
makes a request well we're gonna tell
them to do is they have to send in their
JWT token and we'll I'll show you how to
do that on react and then we'll identify
the user based on this token and distort
ID and then this expires in a minute now
this expires really fast we don't
actually need to have this expire that
quickly because we're not storing any
like sensitive data and our JWT token
that will change so I'm gonna say like
20 minutes
you know let's given how or why not this
is something though you can increase the
time on or shorten you really want to
shorten this if there's anything
sensitive and here that that changes a
lot so if I was having something in here
like is admin where if I want to be able
to revoke the admin
I don't want them to be an admin for a
whole hour so I'm gonna have to change
that so this is basically how long you
want to give them access for and then
they can refresh if they need to that's
what the point of this refresh token is
and that's seven days okay so these
tokens expire and so we need to use it
out refreshed oh you're good okay so I
was storing the Refresh secret in the
user table but for this what I'm gonna
do is use secret to which we're gonna
pass you know we're gonna pass as a
parameter so it's gonna come in here so
we're gonna have create a second secret
and I'm gonna do a little trick that I
like to do is a conce refresh token
secret is equal to user dot password and
then also we're just gonna you know
we're gonna add them together let's just
do a plus secret two now the reason why
I'm basically putting this user dot
password at the front and this is the
hash of the password instead of just
using the secret to is this way the
token will automatically expire if the
password here changes so if these are
changes their password I don't want them
to stay logged in so this will
automatically expire it so let's pass in
a second secret and in the next year I'm
going to create another one
and put some more random characters and
we'll hop down here secret to sweet and
so this should be all good to go now our
back-end and our tokens look pretty good
they're gonna expire after an hour or
this token and a refresh token last
seven days I'm gonna talk more in depth
about how these guide the tokens work in
the next video we're just gonna get this
set up in this video so now this is all
good let's try running this well let's
first actually make sure I have the
server up yep I have server up and no
errors so I'm gonna localhost I think I
have it on 80 81 now let's go to
graphical mutation login email and I
mean I actually don't think there's I
don't remember if I created any users so
I'm actually just going to register a
new user real quick so let's call him
Tony one two three and his email is
gonna be Tony
one two three at abc.com and I'll copy
that to use this and password
Tony Tony and let's just see whether
it's okay or not
all right created it okay so now let's
login email password and let's see if
it's okay I'm wearing at the token
refresh token Aires ie sorry pack a
message okay
alright so this worked and here's what
our token looks like and a refresh token
now I'll show you all the errors that we
get so bad email we see our token
refresh token or Nolan says wrong email
so now we can fix that and give it wrong
password and we get wrong password cool
so that is all setup and looking nice so
now in our front-end let's go ahead and
call this so we're just going to say
email so we're gonna add some variables
here because that's how we're you need
to do it on our front-end and that's
gonna be a string as well and pass the
email here and password here and we're
just gonna copy this and I'm gonna go to
my front end over here and come over to
login and I'm gonna say
Const login mutation this is equal to
gql and pay sec I am so that's what
we're going to use let's go ahead and
import that and now I'm gonna go ahead
and get rid of this observer that we
have and put that down here so I'm gonna
say export default graph QL and now I'm
gonna pass in the login mutation and now
I'm gonna be pass and both the observer
and the class we have up here so the
class we have here is login and I see
the colors a little bit off here so I
think I did a typo somewhere but let's
look at what's wrong with that in a
second notice how I'm doing an observer
here this is a higher component that
traps login and then graph QL wraps that
higher-order component so you can nest
these and you could do observer on the
outside but I think it's better to do
graph QL on the inside but I'm not quite
sure what exactly which one's the best
I'm thinking observer first because the
observers gonna be changing more then
graph QL is so I don't want to pass it
through two components just one okay
where did I mess up that this is not
colored export default
here's compiled successfully so that
looks like it worked I'm guessing just
this line right here
oops looks like it's just a little bug
I'll see if it's nope syntax error
expected name found in the file
I'm guessing it's missing and I'm gonna
comment this guy out alright that seems
to work it should say it doesn't know
what logging mutation is good
ha
okay so notice how it read for a second
I was working huh I think I think here's
what I'm gonna try doing I'm gonna get
rid of logging mutation and see if this
works so I got rid of the graph QL okay
that works i Jim and I'm importing gql I
must be doing something super silly I
thought I've done this before I mean we
can go see what how I do in register
this looks like the exact same and that
looks good so so you notice how the
coloration changes I'm gonna try copying
my register and see if that works
yep that works just fine so I'm gonna
copy the inside of my mutation here
maybe I have an error in my do I just
have an error in the graph QL if I come
to graphical I can go ahead and run this
prettify it looks like all the curly
braces line up and stuff up I see we're
missing a curly brace that's all my bad
all right I'm gonna go ahead and just
don't do everything this whole time I
was just missing a curly brace funny how
that caused that all that problems you
would have thought that this was a
string and it would not affect anything
okay so let's login with our Toni and I
forgot what my username was already
let's control Z this area Tony ABC and
Tony Tony oh you know what hold that
we're not calling this mutation yet so
an on submit and this thought so we're
gonna say cons response is equal to
await the stop props
dot you tape and we're passing our
variables that we get here and then in
our response we should get a token back
if we get it right and so I will then
save that local storage if it works okay
what learner oh I didn't I was in
console logging response so we could see
what it looked like we can see the shape
of the object so paste that in Tony Tony
alright so that worked so data login
refresh token token so we're gonna say
Const ok refresh token and token equal
to this dot nope it's in a response dot
data dot log in so if it's ok then we're
gonna say local storage dot set item
token is equal to token and refresh
token it's gonna be equal to our refresh
token so let's give that a run and the
way you can tell tokens is here so you
can see I already have some stuff in my
local storage I'm gonna just go ahead
and clear this out so when I hit submit
if we do a good username password we
will see our tokens stored here so Tony
and so real quick application storage
local storage 3000 okay so Tony Tony
alright cool so now it worked ok so now
we see our both our tokens here so nice
thing is local storage will store it
these here and they will persist so if i
refresh the page
they will still be here even though the
values here get changed
we still see refresh hey our values are
still here so now when I go to make
requests on other parts of the website I
can tell whether someone's logged in
whether they have a token and their
local storage and then I can use this
token on my server side so we're gonna
be doing in the next video well I don't
actually know if we're doing the next
video but very soon
is we're gonna make some routes so for
example team we have a create team
resolver but we only want you to create
a team if you are logged in we don't
want random people creating teams right
so here what we're gonna do is we're
going to check whether they give us a
valid token and if they do we know
they're logged in if not we know they're
not and they're not they're possibly not
a user so we ignore them so that's how
we're gonna do authentication we'll get
more in depth in the next video when
we'll handle some errors here from the
front end in case we do a bad so here's
a bad username password we're not really
doing anything with Aires right now so
we'll handle the errors in the next
video and we'll also talk about more off
stuff for logging in so that's it for
this video guys thanks for watching and
the code will be up on github
