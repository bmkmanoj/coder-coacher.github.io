this is the listview dragging animation
app this is an app that Google made and
they gave you the code so you can learn
how to do a drag and drop list view and
so if I do a long lick and move it
around it works just fine and I tried
implementing this on my own app so let
me show you what that looks like and if
we come over here this is my list and
notice how these all the same name Apple
Apple Apple whereas the cheese's were
all different names so but when i click
and try to move this notice how just ate
that list view row let's go up on more
now just ate this one that's super weird
but it works just fine for example I
don't use this one let's see if I make
another list view item so let's say and
go candy group beer if I try moving
these around the list it works just fine
just like in the actually that is
obviously a bad example it usually works
just fine with the occasional glitch it
works just fine so something's wrong
when every single name is the first all
the things in the list have the same
name so what I wanted to test was did I
add in the functionality of the dynamic
list wrong or is this a problem with the
list view itself so what I did was I
went to the code for the app and here's
the list of cheeses that they use now
I'm going to comment this out and
uncomment this up here so i made a new
list of cheeses and all it says is
cheddar chat okay chatter chatter
chatter chatter um and it if i run this
the ListView will just have chatter
chatter chatter chatter and and the
google app will actually break as well
and our cradles on building and it
should boot up here just terribly so if
I on click and try moving this around
notice how none of the items are
shifting downward excuse me up and we
actually lose a row see how this is
black it's gone I'll try moving another
one down here maybe and we lose another
one we lose and you see how that's just
not working well so this is the bug I'm
trying to fix and I have no clue what's
causing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
