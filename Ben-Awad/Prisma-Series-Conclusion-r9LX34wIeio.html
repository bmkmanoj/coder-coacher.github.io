series that we did and just talk about a
few things that I learned so the first
is I liked typescript a lot so I had
didn't using flow type before which is
Facebook's version of typescript
basically and it's a little bit
different because it's not its own
language you kind of just add it on top
of the JavaScript and I didn't like it
as much so when I saw prison I had a
typescript version I wanted to try it
out but I was skeptical and didn't think
I would like it as much as I did and so
now I really see myself continuing any
type of back-end code writing it in
typescript over JavaScript in the future
now cuz I I enjoyed like it worked
really well with Visual Studio code
getting auto completion was really nice
I also want to look into what it's like
with react and see if I like it too so
some videos possibly in the future about
integrating it with react I believe
there's a create react app for
typescript which I'm going to check out
and see if it's also pretty nice and I
like it because I tried flow for with
react too and I was not a huge fan now
the second thing would I use Prisma in a
production environment right what I
would consider it for a project or if I
was starting a project next what I
choose Prisma I think I saw a Prisma
being like a really great choice I think
they they they did a lot of things right
where you can customize and pretty much
add anything you want on to it you don't
have to use primarily Prisma right you
can integrate it with other things like
you could have a totally another
database you can add caching with Redis
you pretty much have full control of
what your server does and you pretty
much just have the option to use the
Prisma database if you want to but with
that said I don't think I'll be using it
for for my next project but I'm gonna be
keeping a very close eye on it the one
thing that a few things that really are
promise breakers for me is I like being
able to control
how queries are run and being able to
tweak things I think prism is really
really great for someone who wants to
just get a MVP up quickly and then they
don't they don't want to worry about
making fast
I think prism Missouri optimized but
they don't want to worry about
optimizing their code and worrying about
creating the database tables and it's
really nice that Prisma handles all that
stuff for you but I think I would prefer
hat doing that myself and I I like
having the ability if I need to to just
write some sequel if need be and I think
that's important but I think Prisma and
that's really the one thing that's kind
of stopping me and I feel like there's
an extra request you have to make great
because there's now a prism server
sitting in between the database so just
those things I'm kind of just like about
but I definitely think Prisma is still a
really good option and I wouldn't
dislike using it in production at all I
just want to try some other things I
really feel like it takes the place of
sequel eyes and so what I want to try
out is type warm I've been playing
around with it with the past few days
and I'm actually really liking it much
better than sequel eyes I'm gonna
integrates really well with typescript
so I'm gonna be doing some videos about
this in the future I think it's really
cool um but I honestly I would recommend
Prisma that to anyone that wanted to use
it I think it's a really great product
personally I'm gonna be using trying out
type warm and probably ended up going
with that if I were to create a new
project just because I would rather be
in control of the database yeah so
that's with Prisma I think it's really
good I'm really happy about it and I
want to watch and see what they do with
it in the future and also they don't
have Postgres equal support but it's
coming very very soon so I'm excited
about that so I'm definitely gonna check
that check that out when it comes out
but yeah so what am I going to be doing
next there's a lot of cool technology
that came out while I was doing the
Prisma series that I want to touch
one of the such libraries is called
Oracle so this is a library that was
created by Ken wheeler who's a pretty
cool dude and you can see it's modeled
after Oracle here and it's a graphic u
library
it's basically an alternative to using
Apollo client or relay percent so I want
to check this out I also want to check
out relay I've been wanting to do that
for a while so I finally will be getting
to that so lots of cool stuff in the
future but yeah that's it for this video
guys I hope you like the series I'll see
you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
