working on a project in a while so I
thought it'd be fun to do one and what I
was thinking was doing a slack clone now
if you've never heard of slack is a very
popular messaging app for businesses and
I thought we would replicate this using
graph QL and react so this has a lot of
good opportunity for real-time
subscriptions where messages are coming
in live as people are typing them and
filtering the subscriptions so filtering
the WebSockets not pushing to all the
clients but only some of them when you
have different types of channels not
everyone is gonna see the message that
you send right so here is what I was
thinking the different components I want
to start out small and then maybe add on
some more features as the first basis if
I get this working well so I'm thinking
is we'll have users that can ring create
teams and now to create users I'll have
a sign-up login all that stuff and then
we'll have teams where you can then have
users that you invite to teams so users
can create teams and teams can also have
users inside of them and then in teams
will be channel so public and private
channels this will be a nice chance to
learn how to do guarding against off
authentication where you have some
people you want to show the channels to
and some people not like your whole team
you might want to not want to show you
might just have a special channel just
for your CEOs or maybe your managers so
private versus public ones how we share
those permissions for that and then of
course messages that can be sent so I
figured this would be a nice good start
and what I do is I just code a little
bit every single day make a video about
how it's done and start from the very
beginning so even if you're a beginner
to graph QL or react you'll be able to
follow along and create this
lack clone and this will be a really
good project and I want to try to make
it look very similar to slack as well if
possible so let me know what you guys
think if you like this idea and if
there's any particular features of slack
that you would like to see I can
definitely add those on as we get later
into the project I'm thinking starting
with these and then anything else you
guys want to see we can add on as well
but this will be a good base and you'll
learn a lot of good stuff about a
real-time and permissions and doing this
so that's it for this video guys stay
tuned for tomorrow the first video on
slack clone
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
