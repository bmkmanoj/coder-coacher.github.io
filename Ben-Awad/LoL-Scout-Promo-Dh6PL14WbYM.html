League of Legends where you can look up
your stats and much more in this video
I'll give you a quick tour of how to use
lost Scout right here we're looking at
the featured player of the week the odd
one on his bowl off we're looking at
what league he is in he's in diamond to
what having games he's played on all off
this season his kill death and assist
ratio and you can see each break out of
the wins and losses you can also see in
the right his loss courses are rating
from 0 to 100 basically saying how good
he is and it's based on KDA you can also
see a basic bill that the odd one uses
40 up you have to bury bomb some runes
that he uses his green page for Olaf you
click on that it'll give you a little
preview of how each stat they're getting
from the rune and what the room is now
if we navigate to talk here we can go to
match history where we see right now
we're at dyrus you can see the last 10
games dyrus escalade now you can search
any sumner you like let's so let's
search the odd one and we're going to
keep the region the same up here you can
change the region but he's an NA and
oops and you can see what Sumner's the
person took items champion played the
green bird border indicates they won the
game at the red board indicates they
lost you can see some basic stats and if
you look on the left the sir 37k for
nearly that stands for how much damage
they del packing now if you click on an
individual game like this is that game
we can see some more information about
it now if we go back we can go to our
menu and go to rank stats this gives an
overall rank stats of how they did this
season right now we're looking at dyrus
and we can cook through the rune pages
that he uses for all this champions if
we won now this is just the season if we
look at the odd one we can search him
I'm getting and keeping the region the
same and you can see the name that they
named their room pages so he names the
spring page bug and you can scroll see
all the runes that he uses in what he's
getting from each room also we can go
over here to the tracker page this page
is where you can look up a Sumner and
see how much time they played so let's
look up the odd one
and we can seize play an hour and 54
minutes say if we want to stop tracking
we can push this X and the update
updates how much time he's played now
it'll send you a little note occation
you can enter this you can enter sumner
and you can tell it how much time you
want it to when and once you alert you
and you can do that by going to the
setting so right now I have it for a two
hour time limit cap so if i go over two
hours it will send me a notification and
we can change that by just going to one
and the other one is over one hour of
playing so if we hit update it'll send a
little notification now if we want to
change how much time this is updated
because this app will update how much
time you've played frequently you can
just click right here and it refreshes
every hour but you can change that so
this is how los Scout works thanks for
