typescript yesterday but we were using
the default typescript compiler settings
and those are actually not the best so
what I'm gonna show you today is how to
configure how typescript compiles and
checks your code so there's this file
called a TS config which has basically
all the settings for your typescript
compiler and what it should be doing and
we can create a dummy one by doing TS c
- - in it and it'll go ahead and create
one for us and microsoft was nice enough
to also put some comments on the right
side and tell us what the heck this
stuff means because there's a lot of
settings you can turn on and off and I'm
also kind of walk you through the ones
that I usually use and what they do so
first off you can see the target in the
module target is what you want to be
compatible with like what it's gonna
compile your code down to now it looks
like by default it cs5 and we can turn
if you look over here we can't amp it up
to some greater ones now I tried running
it with like yes 2018 or some of the
later ones and it didn't seem to change
the code in any way at least when it was
emitted so if I do that and we look at
what the JavaScript that this created
you'll notice it's still using var it's
still creating functions like this so it
must be for some other functions or some
other things that this affects but the
emitted code didn't change at least the
target but usually I have this on like
yes 2016 or yes 5 one of those depending
on what I'm doing but I think for the
most part I'm usually on 2016 and then
module this is really just how a
JavaScript you want your JavaScript
modules to work and for the most part I
just leave it on commonjs I don't think
I really changed any of these unless I'm
like having a problem and then I'll go
search it'll be like hey change module
for most part I just keep those next
thing is we can now turn and turn on/off
this Lib thing this is for adding extra
types and whatnot the check you don't
really have to worry about this for the
most part unless you get errors in your
typescript saying that things don't have
types and in you have to go add a
library and this is where you would do
it so for example here's what I use my
typescript config file and this is for
you for a node project and you can see
I'm using es6 and then you can also see
here are some libraries that I had to
add to be able to have types for things
so I was using Apollo server or
graphical yoga I think and it needed
these async iterable in the es 2017 so
there is some example of libraries that
you might need to add here you can see
you can allow J s and checked yes I
usually don't even worry about that
because if I'm using typescript I'm
usually not doing this with JavaScript
but this could be nice if you're like
migrating files a big javascript file a
project over to typescript and you want
it to allow compiling to that but
whenever I have done I've done some
migrations in the past from JavaScript
of typescript every time I turn on a low
jeaious it doesn't really seem to work
that well it compiles it ok but I just
have like problems with the types and
the typescript after allowing J s so I
usually just convert everything the
typescript and then do stuff
anyway you know for about GSX unless
you've been react declaration this is
for when you have a library or an impact
on to creating a MPM package that's
gonna use typescript you're gonna turn
on declaration to true because what this
will do is this this will allow you to
get the types of all your stuff so like
other people can access your types and
we can turn this on real quick and we
can see what this does
I don't know if we're gonna have any
good types in this and I don't think I'm
exporting anything so I don't know if if
this just gonna be empty or whatnot but
as it says it creates a dot d dot ts
file with all the types that you have
and I don't guess I don't have any types
so it's not creating anything I guess
what I could do is export a type right
here so I'm gonna say export my
interface random type and let's say I
use this type somewhere in my code X is
going to be a number and name is gonna
be a string and I think it should create
something now mmm doesn't look like it
not sure what's going on with that
usually what happens as it says it
generates a DDS file and maybe it's
because it's not using the config by
default so what I was going to talk
about next was the outer and the Rooter
so if we turn these guys on
we can specify usually you don't just
have one file but you're like you have
source and you have a bunch of
typescript files in there and then so
what you specify is you want a
typescript to compile all the files in
the root directory which in this case is
gonna be source and then you can specify
Ari I want this to compile to a folder
called build so now when I run this I no
longer say like source slash main or
something like that all I do is
typescript and it will look for my TS
config and then it will build that and
alright so it went ahead and created by
DT s file now and if we look at that we
can see it does have this exported type
so now other people that are using my
NPM package would be able to grab these
types okay um the other thing is source
maps usually I turn that on and that's
for just heirs usually and out file I
don't really know what that is I haven't
really used it concatenate and emit
output the single fire file looks like
it's for combining them all into one
remove comments that's pretty
self-explanatory
it would just remove the comments that I
have in your code in my code and
typescript seems like a good thing to
turn on no Amit I'm not sure what that
is not sure what really I haven't really
used any of these settings right here
but I could read those and check them
out this is the important section right
here I usually turn them all on and then
I haven't heard of always strict looks
like what it does is adds you strict in
your JavaScript code I haven't tried
this before go ahead and turn on seems
like it would be just a plus this
basically makes the type checking
stricter and you don't have to have this
on but it you get the most benefit from
typescript if you do this so I was
talking about this yesterday
strict to null checks and this is when
we had this object to an object to has
the property X&amp;amp;Y but it is of the
interface XY and z
and Z is optional so now when I do
something like object to dot Z plus five
or 45 it's gonna be like hey that's
possibly undefined right in this case it
actually is undefined right
so what we'd have to do is be like if
object to dot Z then we can do some
addition like that right so it's nice
that typescript can now catch some of
these basic mistakes that we make and
also now you can't just not specify the
type so when I do something like this I
think by default this is I guess we we
specified the type here but if I were to
get rid of that there we go so we have
not specified the type of this X so by
default it is any but we turned on this
setting called no implicit any so what
that means is I have to specify the type
of this so I have to put a number there
so it knows or I could just do add funk
oh and by the way I don't need that
there because I already have it defined
and specifying the types up here okay
what are the other stuff strict types I
don't know know exactly what this one
does
I guess it's you have to have function
types and then also this one strict
property initialization is I think you
just have to specify the like a default
value for the property I think sometimes
I will turn this off as it comes in be a
problem sometimes with react no plus at
this always strict I don't know exactly
what some of these do but I just know
they are like in my code when I'm coding
these I will see them turn on and I like
them and you can always come back and
turn them off if you're like I don't
really like that setting or whatnot
these are really nice these little
checks right here I'll usually turn all
of them on there just basically wasteful
code that you can get rid of so no
unused locals don't use parameters what
that means is if I'm like Const B or not
used is equal to five or whatever so
this is not being used so it would be
like hey this functions not being used
it's not telling me that it's not being
used though I don't know why maybe I
need to wrap it and like maybe a
function so it was an another function
yeah I don't know I don't know if it's
just not checking the type I wonder if
it will compile art feel through and air
something that's being okay here we go
so it says a is declared but the value
is never read so it's not showing it
right now in my editor for some reason I
don't know if it's just not looking at
the right TS configure what but random
func is declared and never read so
you'll get these so all of these things
are not being used and I could just
delete them if I wanted to we'll go
ahead and turn this off so we can
compile our code for other things but
that's what that check does and I like
turning that on this stuff right here I
don't really touch that much I'll turn
on that sometimes this has to do with
importing things this is something you
can flip on and off depending on how you
want to import stuff in typescript this
stuff is for I believe when you want to
import things and you want to use like
relative versus absolute imports so if I
have something like main to typescript
and I want to import that in this one
import name too I would usually do that
right what that allow you to do is get
rid of this dot slash and I could just
do it like that so it knows that I
should be starting from the source and
you can also do something like this
we'll just call this components and
we'll call this Heather that pipe script
so again instead of doing dot slash
header sorry components slash header we
would now just do this and now it
doesn't really make sense it doesn't
it's not really helpful when we're right
here but you can see where this could be
helpful where I'm down here so now if I
want to import main for example instead
of doing up up I guess just one I could
just import me from main so it's helpful
when you have like deeply nested stuff
it allows you to do like absolute
imports and you I believe baster
configures what you want it to start at
and then module resolution how you want
to work I think node is what you want
but I haven't played too much with that
I usually like just using relative URLs
but those are the settings if you're
gonna play with that source route I
don't think I really mess with any of
this stuff either right here and then
here's what I was talking about with the
decorators you can turn these on this
one you don't really need as much the
metadata it is necessary for one library
that I like to use called type arm and I
don't know why it doesn't like it maybe
because there's not a comma at the end
up here
area we just didn't have a comma or
something like that but anyway this will
allow you to use decorators and
decorators are the things where you see
like function mutation I guess I think
it's a packraft QL is what you can do
for Apollo but I don't really use
decorators too much this is you need for
type arm I usually don't have that and
listen using Taiwan yeah but other than
that that's kind of like the settings
and I'll link here is the actual
settings I'm using for this one
typescript project that I'm using the
boilerplate that I'm working on so I'll
link this in the description below so
you can use this and check this out and
this is what I usually like to use and
all just you know tweak stuff as I'm
going along in the project if I don't
like what a setting is doing or whatnot
it's very easy to come in but Microsoft
nicely added all this you know
information this comments so I just
recommend looking through that and
seeing what each one's does that's what
I did once and just see if it be useful
or not for me and then also if you're
using react if you do create react app
using the typescript version
it comes with a nicely created TS config
for that so I just use the default for
that but that's it for this video guys I
hope that was helpful and how setting up
a TS config and I'll see you next time
