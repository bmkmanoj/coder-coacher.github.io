video we're going to be making the
feathers fervor with the brand new
feathers release so I'm going to be just
making it from scratch it'll be a lot
easier this way
because it's actually not too complex
since I should be really quick if you
don't have the feather CLI make sure to
install that I believe it's NPM install
feathers
Feli and make sure you get the new
version or else this won't make sense so
the first thing is you want to make a
folder that you want to basically create
all this in so i'll call mine upgraded
menu monkey and all this CD into it
arlynn I'll do feathers generate app and
this is basically the there we go the
start of and all the defaults good this
is just the beginning of setting up your
application so now it's a lot different
now with feathers you first make you
generate it like this and it gets all
the just like the base folders and files
that you need for doing feathers and
staying this up but the first evidence
you'll see is you actually have to set
up authentication step or at least we
have two feathers generate
authentication and then for this you can
choose what type we're going to username
and password you can finally keep the
default for users and then we were using
needy be the last one I'm going to just
use MongoDB for this so I can show you
guys how to set this up with a real
database so keep that and this
connection sharing is fine let that
build out and you notice how it's
actually using yarn which is pretty cool
cuz usually uses NPM but they made that
switch so that's pretty nice so now that
all setup authentication for us and then
the next thing is I want to setup is our
service
which is going to be a recipe service so
the degenerates service and then we can
again this going to be a MongoDB there's
going to be recipes and it does need
authentication all right so we created
those and we just copy
oops copy the name of our database right
here if you don't have MongoDB installed
you could just do follow along with the
needy B as well if you wanted to but if
you don't have Mongo installed make sure
you install it before you do and get the
CLI for that so you can just type Mongo
to start the CLI and then use and the
name of your database and then it will
actually create the database for you now
we can get out of there the database is
created now if we do NPM start on our
server so this is pretty sweet now I'm
going to show you what we have just
created
so now with authentication what we can
do is first of course we need to
actually not wanted to do it like that
because it'll be really easy first when
you create a user so we can make a post
request to users
we don't need strategy for users though
speaking you're rid of that so we're
going to post the email and password and
this will create a bob user so if I send
that we can create a bob user and get
RIT for that and now we can actually
authenticate and taught them Kate we go
to this make a post request to that URL
and then we add the strategy local and
our email and password and then you'll
notice
oops sorry this is authentication not
the de Kate and you'll notice it'll give
you a access token so we copy this
access token when they give us an access
token we then this is what we use to do
make sure that we're off our I so for
example if we want to create a recipe
now we can add this to the header and
then down here oops that's an old one up
here this is what I like to create and I
do send and you'll notice right here
it'll get name something ingredients
whatever I just created here so exact
go to one amalya notice there's one
thing missing
and that's basically different about it
is we don't have the owner ID so there
is actually a nice little hook that we
can use right here this is the associate
current user hook and this will just add
the current user to our when we create a
recipe for us so that's really nice so
to do that we're going to go to source
services recipes and then hooks so we're
just going to paste and the hooks and
then in the before create we're going to
do a hooks dot associate current user
and then we're just going to say bye and
then owner ID leave it was bye
so right oh it's as associated for user
yes okay now when I do NPM start should
we just start up okay and we do notice
when if I create this exact same object
again and now as an owner ID so now we
can find the recipes that you create and
that's it so our authentication is now
all set up and our server is all good so
I'm just going to let this run in the
background and then in the next video
we'll continue working on our front-end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
