about how it takes my current stack
react Express and Postgres equal and put
it on AWS so here's what it would look
like I put this on AWS these are the
components I would use to put it out
into production and just a quick note
I'm not using server-side rendering so
things may differ if you're using
server-side rendering and you want to do
that with react but right now I can with
my react application make it into a
static HTML on JavaScript so what I can
do is actually I can serve this on s3
and you just have a static website and
it's super tube post on s3 so that's
what I really like about putting react
here and then so I have cloud front
sitting in the front of this and what
cloud front does is actually have not
tried this guy yet I've tried these all
these guys haven't tried cloud front yet
because this is kind of an extra and you
don't really need it if you have a small
user base I see it as something I need
if I wanted to scale up to more users my
understanding is it helps spread the
load of the you know users coming to
your website and handles that and I
think you could probably also get cloud
front for elastic beanstalk not sure if
that's something after research but
basically what I have done in the past
this guys are maybe when you scale up
you can add this guy in but for sure you
have s3 sitting in the front this is
going to host your react application so
you're going to bundle your react
application the static HTML and CSS or
JavaScript too and that's going to sit
on an s3 bucket and then that's going to
serve you know just the static files for
you and then for our Express server oh
and our reactors going to make calls to
our Express server and this is going to
be in ec2 now I'm saying elastic
Beanstalk here because this is what I
like using because it just makes it
really fast to set up the whole back-end
this is what I consider the backend
right here
Postgres and ec2 so aussicht Beanstalk
will set you up
the nice ec2 instance and solve the
software that you need really easy and
basically this is just a virtual server
so this is a compute to give it as a
computer running on someone else's
you're running your code on someone
else's computer
and so Express is running on someone
else's computer you can think of I'm
using elastic Beanstalk for that and
then sitting in the back
I'm using Postgres equal and that is
hosted on RDS so I believe it's
relational data stores what's called so
each one of these guys is what I was
used to react rs3 elastic Beanstalk for
express and Postgres equal is and RDS
you can to host several different
databases so you can swap this out each
one of these components can really be
swapped out with any language you wanted
to use if you're using view or angular
I'm sure you could use static HTML as
well and put it here if you're using
Django Ruby on Rails you can switch
those out for elastic feed stock here
too so this is kind of the generic
front-end back-end database or not this
is all considered I consider back in so
server database and also good to note
these are all pretty scalable so but I
know these two for sure
this one you pretty much just you don't
really scale but this these two you said
how much database storage you want how
much CPU you want and as more people
start using your site you can ramp up
how much you're paying and how much CPU
usage you're using so you pay as you are
increasing yep so this is how I would
set stuff up let me know what you think
of this setup and if you would set it up
differently and how you set up your AWS
account for your react application so
I'm actually very curious how other
people do it so thanks for watching guys
i'll see in the next video
