project I'm going to be starting but
before I do a quick announcement I just
created a Facebook page where I'm gonna
be posting my videos and also some
exclusive content in the future so I'd
really appreciate it if you guys could
come to this URL and I'll put it in the
description as well and give it a like
and to share and feel free to post and
ask questions on here I kind of want to
make it a place where we can just
discuss stuff alright so let's get on
talking about the project itself
now we're gonna be creating a calculator
but not just any type of calculator a
RPN calculator which stands for reverse
polish notation so this is a special
calculator that I actually prefer using
two regular calculators and I have made
this application before using Android I
made an Android app like this but I want
to recreate this with react native and
make it nicer so this is the basics of
what it looks like and how it's gonna
look at least kind of we might change
the design a little bit and if you're
not really sure how this type of
calculator works I'll link the Wikipedia
page that discusses it but the basic way
it works is you input your numbers so
here's a number here and you basically
input your numbers and then you say what
operation you want to happen on them so
for example I entered 256 and 45 now I
can say what operation I want whether
it's division multiplication so I can
say I want to add them together and then
this pops here and notice when I click
enter it goes up in the stack so notice
how 101 is now here I can enter a new
number or I can just add them together
and it pops here so whatever I have up
here and here they're gonna do math and
the cool thing about this is it stacks
so that's why I called it stack
calculator and so you can have multiple
operations so it'll just going to do
operation on these two so times and then
notice how 202 popped down
so pretty cool but you'll get used to
this calculator as we build it and I
want to focus this tutorial for
beginners of react native I have done
some pretty advanced tutorials in the
past someone take a little step back and
target this towards beginners so I'm the
acquirement for this project if you want
to follow along is just basic JavaScript
skills and also if you have at least
looked into react so we'll be starting
from the beginning and going all the way
to a finished application and same
format as the last project I'll just be
releasing a new video just about every
day and just keep adding on to the
applications slowly and starting from
scratch into a finished application so
that's the project and we're gonna put
the whole thing up on github so you can
check the source code and follow along
and code along so lets it for this video
guys and stay tuned tomorrow when we get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
