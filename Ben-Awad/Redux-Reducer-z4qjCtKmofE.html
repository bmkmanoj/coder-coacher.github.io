we're gonna be wrapping up our real-time
to-do list and the last thing that we
need to setup is actually twofold the
first is very quick though and that is
just a Styles dot CSS and we only have
one rule dot content got complete and
we're just gonna create what is called a
text declaration text decoration and
we're just blue line through and then
we're also gonna do of color gray so
it's just gonna set the color gray and
the line through it whenever a item is
complete and we just need to go into our
index page and we import Styles thoughts
CSS okay we just do a quick LS we see
Styles index added right there and now
important and at our Styles just a real
quick one right there and then in our
reducers we're going to create a new
reducer I'm called item J s and this is
gonna handle all that jazz so we're
gonna create a function called handle
items it's gonna have a default state
and in this default state it's gonna be
an object with just one thing a value of
all with an empty array list or excuse
me array and then we're gonna have the
action and then we're gonna create a
switch statement action dot type and
then we'll just create the default case
real quick and that is just to return
state and then bound here export default
handle item show click ok ok so now
let's go over the cases the first case
is when we find all items
so case find all items done so when that
is done we're gonna return all action
dog this little got data and case to
create it item this is gonna return all
and then this is basically what this is
doing is this is adding a new item to
with this all list so we're just gonna
pend action dot item to the front and
then we're gonna add all those items at
the end and how we do that is do the
triple dot state dot all and that
appends all oops
matter that that pens all the items from
stay all into this list two more case
update item return oops not return this
this isn't more there's more run on this
one the the first thing we're doing is
we're going to be creating a new all
list now what we want to do is you want
to go through the items in state until
we find the one that we need to update
so we're gonna just do for haunts item
of state all then we're just gonna check
the item IDs item the ID it's equal to
action dot item the ID then we replace
it with the action item new all dot push
action item
otherwise we're just gonna do a push of
item okay I'm just going to return all
new all and then remove item when we
remove an item return all state all dock
filter item where item the ID is not
equal to action item got ID okay that
looks good
and there's one small problem I forgot
to do the find all items action so I
said we didn't need any return values
and our sagas but we actually do so I'm
gonna go back to the sagas real quick
and update something so it's actually
all of them we don't need anything for
except for call find all items in this
case we do need the result and then we
yield in this case what we're gonna be
doing is we actually need to call a a
action so to call an action what we need
to do is we do put and this will invoke
a action so if we just do find all items
done what we can do is we can also pass
in a for example different values like
you would any other action so we can do
a send results
and this allows us to use result and our
reducer and add that to the state and
that invokes an action and it will go to
a reducer and do that stuff update the
state next we just need to add it to our
index so import item handler from item
say items is equal to item handler okay
and then we just need to go to our
components app file and we just need to
map this to the prompts so we can say
item this is equal to state items okay
save that and let's see if you have any
problems up I just have a semicolon so
code to the components and reduce your
not component sorry the reducer and this
is an item I just had a semicolon at the
end right there
was there anything else no so I just had
a semicolon on line 6
I am handler is defined but never used
Oh handle items is what I called it
reducer index so go back to the index it
what did I call it that I forgot again
my bad item handle items is what I
called it so in a reducer index
we're gonna be importing and all items
okay oops
delete that and we're loading awesome
now let's see if we if we can start
typing and adding things we hit enter we
see carrots pop up we see it both of
them alright nothing happens when I
click on it so let's just pop into the
console real quick and see what it
doesn't like cannot read the property of
undefined an item so it looks like a
problem something is undefined I just
want to see if deletes working so delete
is working so ABCD and let's see if I
create one over here another carrot
pineapple but when I click on that like
it's an air
so let's debug this real quick go to our
console we see cannot read property of
ID this is happening and handle items
and our items okay so if we go to
reducers items it looks like something
is null and update item so state dot all
that should be good action not item Oh
updated item no it should be update item
not update is it no I think it's updated
item should be what we pass in I think I
was just passing in the wrong thing and
sure enough I was so in my reducer items
it's updated item okay guy
we have the finished product finally
you'll see where you know you guys can
play around with this as we do changes
in one the other one is exactly the same
so it's really nice you're fresh the
page if that just from the feather
server the same data and allows you to
just keep populating things and it's
super nice so I hope you like this video
using WebSockets new see how cool and
powerful they really are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
