slack clone similar to how github has it
up here you see this little green and
many other sites are doing it nowadays
and just to make the site more secure
and also I believe it has some
performance improvements as well using
it now I've never actually set this up
before so I would did some research
about it and it seems people recommend
using this engine X proxy library for
setting up it in docker and using nginx
now this is a pretty popular library as
you can see by the number of stars and
you actually just use this in place of
using the engine X image now before I
continue on though just a note I did not
get it working yet because I was using
let's encrypt to generate the encryption
needed and that does not like ec2 but
we'll get to that in a little bit so
this prop this library right here is a
docker image that you use totally in
place of the regular Engine X image and
I actually didn't really get why this is
needed I can understand why it's needed
before docker compose but now that dr.
composes the thing and that we're using
docker compose I don't really think this
library is needed at all so there's this
little link here that links you to why
you might want to use engine X proxy and
I read it and it said that basically as
containers die and are restarted their
IPS change and this will help you keep
track of IPs and automatically restart
nginx and point the IP to the correct
host so you can see basically created a
template file and as this host is
changing the proxy pass changes so as a
container is destroyed and restarted
it's a new IP and ip's replace what
sounds nice if you're not using docker
compose but with docker compose we just
put web
here and since they're on the same well
network we don't have to worry about IP
addresses at all we just let dr. Campos
handle that and we just point engine X
at the web container so if the web
container is restarted it's still gonna
be the web container so I don't really
see a need for engine X proxy right now
but I might be missing something but you
can still use it to get SSL set up so if
we come down here setting up SSL support
they recommend using let's encrypt
they're using which is a really nice
tool and I really like it at least what
from I heard from it looks really nice
and so there's this companion project so
if we click on that it is another docker
image and what this guy does is you can
see this little diagram it's pretty nice
so it basically acts as our little let's
encrypt container guy and what it does
is it gets the certificates and
auto-renew stuff when the certificates
get old which is really nice and how it
recommends setting things up is there's
this nice little example down here that
I was gonna use to set up so it's over
here and their example looks like this
so this is how they recommend getting
this set up now they ended up using
nginx gin and the regular nginx which I
like better since I didn't see the need
for this nginx proxy but engine and X
proxy just uses these two anyway if you
look at dr. Jen and this is this is what
nginx proxy uses basically it listens
for when containers are started and
restarted and automatically can't like
recreate configuration files based on
that so here is the index template and
you'll notice again the proxy the host
is changing and so every time a
container
started restarted it grabs the host so
that's what docker gin does basically
just listens for containers to as they
change so this is yuqing using docker
gin again which air engine
yeah docker gen which I don't know if
it's needed or not I'm thinking I could
maybe set this up with just nginx and
just let's encrypt but this particular
container there's this particular
library this let's encrypt nginx proxy
companion expects you to have docker gin
so it does not work without it but I'm
thinking I might be able said something
up without it now with that said I tried
to get this um set up so here is the
docker compose I set up for it so first
thing I did was add a couple other
containers that nginx needs and I just
created a local engine X folder and
store it so storing the configuration
file and the certificates needed and
then I just gave it a container named
nginx cuz it's gonna be used I believe
yeah so I have to get name the
containers for this service so nginx the
name matches with engine X up here and
then I opened up a new port 443 and
that's all I did with the engine X you
notice I got rid of the command at the
bottom because it's just gonna use the
default config because nginx gen is
gonna worry about changing the
configuration for us this I just copied
the command that they gave us and then
put nginx that's the name of my
container and then I set up these
configuration files for let's encrypt
and the nginx uses and you'll notice
here I used my site template because
that's the name of my nginx template
right here
and again I'm not using any of the stuff
that the templates look like where they
are using the IP address that's changing
I'm just using web okay and then I'm
mapping that to into next template I
like they do in that configuration file
and then I set up the engine X let's
encrypt service here and again I just
used the image that they gave us and the
defaults here and then I added on a
virtual host and I let's encrypt host
pointing at my ec2 instance right here
which they talked about doing they come
over here all right here so you can add
a virtual host and you want to point out
your sub domain and without HGPS in
front so although I didn't like having
to use this docker gin because I didn't
think I really needed it it's possible
it's needed for the let's encrypt stuff
so I thought you know let's just give it
a try and see if it does work so I went
to my my ec2 server and I ran docker
compose up and we actually got a little
problem
so with let's encrypt we got this little
air here called Acme server returned an
error and it said creating new basically
not authorized policy forbids issuing
for a name and the name being this guy
right here so I looked up this error and
it turns out what's encrypt which is
what we're using for the encryption
blacklists ec2 instances so it doesn't
let you so what you have to do is set up
a custom domain on it to get it to work
so not sure what I'm gonna do about this
next I might set up a custom domain and
see if I can get this working or seems
like a decent amount of trouble I might
just leave it and forget about HTTP for
this particular project
um but yeah let me know if you guys have
set up a cps and docker and how you've
done it I'm at least with nginx like we
want to do here and also if you've ever
used this law this guy engine X proxy
I'm curious what the use case for it is
yeah that's it it for this video yeah I
sorry we didn't get a CPS working it's
annoying that they block easy too it's
also possible we can set up our own
encryption and not use let's encrypt
I've just heard let's encrypt is very
easy with having to set up because the
encryption expires so it's handles the
whole process of Auto renewing and stuff
which is nice and changing your engine X
file but that's it for this video guys
