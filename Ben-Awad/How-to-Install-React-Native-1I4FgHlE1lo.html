can get your computer set up with react
native so you can follow along and build
the stack calculator with me now I'm
gonna give you three options and the
first one is called Snack Expo this is
for you if you do not want to configure
anything or install any technology at
all onto your computer you would develop
it entirely in this little web app right
here where it has the editor on the left
and you can see an Android app on the
right you can also switch to iOS and
they have lots of different features
here but notice as I type HelloWorld
it'll go ahead and save refresh and we
see hello world pop up here so really
nice experience when developing you just
type stuff here pops up right here so if
you want to this is a good way to do it
if you want to install nothing on your
computer just come to this URL here you
can start up a new project so all links
in description below if you want to try
this the other way is using create react
native app now if you're familiar with
react you probably know about create
react app this is very similar it is a
nice way to bootstrap and get a react
native application up really quickly now
the advantage of this is there's a
couple advantages to this if we scroll
down on the bottom and we look at the
philosophy for this you don't have to
install Android studios or Xcode which
is really nice if you know anything
about react native it can be really
annoying to try setting up both of those
guys I've done in the past and stuff can
easily get messed up so it's really nice
to be able to just run create create
react native app and not have to worry
about those and also I don't need to
have a Macintosh computer to now develop
for Apple so for example I can use this
create create react native app on a
Windows computer this works on any
operating system and I can use it on
Windows or Linux machine and if I have
an Apple phone I can scan there's a
little bar code that will come up you
scan the barcode and you can actually
run the app
your phone even if you have an Apple
phone or if you have an Android phone
either way but you no longer need to
have a Mac computer so that's really
nice and also the developer experience
is really nice similar tell Expo over
here where I just type and it will just
pop up over here automatically same
thing this snack Expos built by the
people that did this as well so it just
Auto refreshes the app and its really
nice experience but there was a couple
downsides to this one the first is you
need to have an internet connection for
it to run on your phone if you want this
to run your physical come phone your
computer and your phone have to be on
the same network which I'll show you how
to set up in a little bit or you can run
it without internet if you have a
virtual emulator on your computer and
you can run that just off to the side
and have that and it'll connect and run
on it
now there's another downside as well
here talk about the limitations well you
don't have to install Android or Xcode
that means you're only writing pure
JavaScript so if you want to run any
kind of native code which means specific
Java or Swift code for Android or iOS
specific you won't be able to do that so
there is a third way to do things and
there's a fish and official react native
CLI now react native also recommends
using create react native app but you
can also if you need to use native code
I'll link this as well this is the
official react native CLI you can use
that and install X you'll need to
install Xcode or Android studio
depending on which you want to run it on
but for this tutorial I'm going to be
using create react native app just
because how easy it is and how nice the
developer experience it is so let's get
this installed on your computer to
so over here I just have coming online
open and first thing I'm gonna do is get
the version of my MPM now if you don't
know NPM is that is a package manager
for JavaScript which means you can
install third-party libraries with it so
if you don't have this on your computer
make sure to install node now after you
install node run NPM and get the version
of it like I just did now you probably
are seeing version 5 or that's the
latest I think it's five point six is
the latest right now it might be higher
up depending on when you're watching
this but currently and you won't check
the documentation for a create react
native app whenever you're watching this
right now they have a little bug with
npm 5 so let's see if i can find it here
we go so we strongly recommend using NPM
4 or 5 there's a bug with NPM five
currently sorry I said three or four so
I'm gonna be using NPM four if you don't
have n PM 4 and you have NPM 5 what you
can do is type NPM install - G and then
NPM app for so what this will do is
it'll replace your current NPM version
with NPM for which I've already done so
I'm good to go so once you have that you
can go ahead and install create react
native app so if you have NPM all you
have to do is do NPM install - G and - J
stands for global so it's a global
utility and create react native app now
after you run that I've already
installed it what you can do is you can
just type into command-line create a
react native app and then the name of
your application I'm going to call my
application stack calculator and I've
already run this but go ahead and run
this and it'll generate the project and
you'll get a folder called stat
calculator you get an CD in there and LS
and you should see these files in here
so if you made it this far and you have
this setup then you are good to go and
we'll start in the next video actually
what these are and then how to actually
rupes and how to actually run this on
your actual physical phone or in an
emulator that's it for this video guys
I'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
