how graph QL resolvers works and one of
the cool parts about them is you can get
data from anywhere you can hard code it
you can get it from an API or you could
make a request to a database it doesn't
really matter so what I'm gonna show you
how to do today is how to make a request
to an API and then send that data all
using graph QL so the API I'm gonna be
taking a look at is the Star Wars API
and what we're gonna do is we're going
to take a single request and then see
how you would use this if you were to
query it through graph QL so here is
what the one request looks like here and
I'm not going to go through and do the
entire thing because there is a lot of
different types in here so what we're
gonna do is just this first half right
here and this is for a single person and
then from that person we're gonna be
grabbing the film's so here is I have
set up a simple graph QL server and
right now here's my schema which has a
single type hello and then a single
resolver so we're gonna add on to this
so I may create type called person and
this is how I would go about doing
pretty much any REST API I would grab
the response and then just copy and
paste it into something like this so and
I just go one by one so the name is a
string and then the height is also a
string and then just go down the line
like this and create the types for it
and in this case most of the things are
strings
looks like all of them are strings and
if we want to maybe we could turn it
into an enum or whatever so homeworld
here this is actually going to another
API request so really with this what
we'd want to do is create another type
called worlds or something and then have
all the fields inside of that I'm gonna
not worry about home home world for now
because I'm gonna do films instead so
I'm gonna create a separate type called
film I'm gonna put all the fields that I
want to support for film inside of there
and so instead of just displaying like
an array of strings what I'm gonna do is
have film be the type film and it's
gonna return an array of those so now
when I fetched the person I can actually
query some of the fields inside of films
and that is actually gonna be a separate
API request as we saw because there's
multiple films that could possibly
happen so I'm gonna copy this and just
go check out a film over here and then
we're gonna do the same procedure we're
gonna copy and paste now I don't want to
go too deep so I'm not gonna worry about
these right here but I'm just gonna grab
these fields if you were doing this for
real
you'd want to definitely grab all these
fields though let's just go down a line
delete those string and
and the last two strings as well okay so
now we pretty much have to type setup so
what would the resolvers look like to
actually get this data so we're gonna be
making multiple API a request to fulfill
this data and send it back to the user
and I'm just gonna add a new query that
we can do up here it's called get person
and we're just gonna pass in a parameter
and if we look over here notice how we
can put like a 1 or a 2 so that's gonna
be just like an integer that matches I
guess the ID of that person so I'm just
gonna call it ID and it's gonna be an
integer this is a required field and
then we're gonna return back a person if
we find it okay so let's start coding
the resolver for this so I'm gonna call
it your person alright it has to be
called get person and I don't care about
the first field the second field is
gonna be the arguments which I want the
ID and I'm going to just expand it so
we'll say there D structure and grab the
ID and then last is the context which I
don't care about ok so and we just need
a comma there so really all you need is
to pick your favorite request library
I'm gonna be using node fetch for this
but you could download any number of
them and we're just gonna make an API
request so I'm gonna say Thomas response
is equal to await fetch and here's where
we're gonna put our URL so the URL for
us is going to be this thing right here
and then we just add that to the very
end
our ID and I'm gonna make this
asynchronous so it's totally fine to
make your resolvers asynchronous and
return promises so next what we're gonna
do is get the JSON response and we're
just gonna return that so response dot
JSON and that's it so this is gonna be a
promise that we return and then graph QL
is gonna resolve it and that's the only
step we need to do but if we were gonna
do this if we look at our response we're
gonna get a string of an array of
strings for films and we don't want that
what we want is all this stuff right
here and even more if you mate wanted to
right so we're gonna do is resolve the
film field so I'm gonna create a
resolver for film and the field that
we're going to do this for I mean not
the film this is going to be person so
inside of person or resolving the field
called films so films and then here we
can put for example the parent and/or
the route there's not really any
arguments or any of that so we can just
pass it in so this is just going to be
an array of strings right and for each
one we want to make an API request to
get this so or going to do is I guess we
could just map over them is one way so I
could say conks promises is equal to
parent dot map and we'll make this
asynchronous and each one of these is
going to be a URL
and so for each aerial or for each film
we're gonna say contra sponsz is equal
to a weight fetch of that URL and then
we're going to turn your L dot JSON and
I mean responds up based on there so now
promises is going to be just an array of
promises so we're gonna just return
promises dot all and we're gonna just
take and I mean promise that all I'm
we're going to pass in promises so just
again what this is doing is films we're
gonna resolve this field and in parent
we're gonna be getting the films field
which is gonna be array of strings or
array of URLs we're gonna map through
each one and for each one we're gonna
fetch the data for it and then we're
gonna return it and since it's
asynchronous wearing it a bunch of
promises and we're just gonna return
those promises all right that's how
that's working let's try querying it and
see what happens so if i refresh this
I'm gonna see her schema I can now get a
person so I'm gonna say get person and
I'm gonna say an ID of one and I'm just
gonna get make this real simple at first
so let's just get the name of the person
and see if that's correct so we do see
Luke Skywalker which we get for the name
as well so now we can we could query all
these fields too if we wanted to but it
doesn't really matter
we'll try grabbing the films we know
we're gonna get them right so we could
try a height mass
hi mass or any of these fields we wanted
to we now have and were are available so
let's do film so films and side films I
want for example the title Oh parent dot
map I wanted parent top films I just
changed it so I guess it didn't refresh
looks like it I'm just gonna restart it
grab that and write again okay there we
go so now we are getting the films and
we see all the different titles so
that's pretty cool
so in behind the scenes this is making
one request to get the person and then
one two three four five API requests so
six total to get all this data and now
we can grab as many fields as we want
from the title so I could get the
opening crawl director producer any of
that so let's get the director and the
producer as well and we can see all that
data is there so this gives you an idea
of how you would basically be able to
fetch data from api's or get your data
from API when using graph QL now you
might not always need to do the mapping
through and do promise that all if you
don't have an array so if I just had and
actually let's do one more to show you
what this would look like so let's bring
homeworld back in since it's actually
pretty easy to do these so this guy is a
single here or else how would you do a
single URL versus an array of URLs
let's take a look at that so is this I
want to see what the planets looks like
okay so planets I'm gonna just do these
three fields on the planet
so I'm gonna say type planet and you
could do numbers for these if you want
to but I'm just gonna represent them as
strings like the API does and I'll just
tab goes over so now for the person they
have a field called homeworld right so I
can add that and that's going to be a
type of planet
so now inside my person type I have a
new field I need to resolve to homeworld
so home worlds and we're gonna take a
parent and now for this since there's
only one string we don't need to do any
type of mapping we're just gonna say
console response is equal to a wait
parent dot home world and that's gonna
be the URL so we just wrap it with fetch
so now we fetch it and then we're just
going to return response a JSON and
again this is gonna have more fields
than we need so it is gonna just filter
it to these three that we have here okay
so now we could grab the film's you
could also get the home world just need
to refresh this looks like I just need
to restart oh I need to make this
asynchronous there we go
and then my server restarted and in a
second
hopefully I should be able to be reached
we also just restart this so now I'm
gonna say home world and I'm gonna get
the orbital rotation and the name was it
okay so now at the very bottom we see
the home world grabbed as well and it
looks like we got the right values too
so that's how you would handle an array
and that's how you would handle a single
URL and yeah this is how you would be
fetching data across an API now if you
want to try this out we just did a
subsample of these good exercise for you
if you wanted to practice this is to go
try to get the species vehicles
starships any of these and try to do
more and you can start nesting these too
so for example this planet has a film
and actually I could show you guys that
real quick if we wanted to so for
example I could create a new resolver
for the type planet and this is actually
pretty useful so let me show you guys
we're gonna reuse or reuse this so
notice here I'm getting films we can
also get films inside of planets right
because it's right here so I can say
oops
we can add this type to my planet
and so we'd have to add a resolver for
it though so we're gonna say plan it and
we're gonna grab the film's filled and
this is where we're gonna do the exact
same thing that we did here so what we
could do is a conce resolve films is
equal to this function and now we can
share it across both of them so now I
can resolve films or planets and resolve
films for the person so both these
fields are now using the same function
up here and we're able to do that
because we named them films here right
so the name film matches up with the
film there so we could use the same name
here okay let's take a look at that so
now if I come down here I can say inside
of home world I should have a film's
there and looks like I just need to
restart it and inside of that I can
select the title and the director and
the producer okay so now you can see we
are having a much longer request because
now we're doing quite a few requests
inside of here so now the film's inside
of home world we're getting all these
films as well now a smart thing to do
would be to like cache these films so
like if we fetch the same film across
two of these like there might be some
duplicates so let's see new hope did we
do fetch new hope over here so notice
how we fetched the new hope inside of
home world and inside of up here for
grabbing the person so we duplicated a
request so a good thing to do with graph
QL is to do some caching on the server
side so that doesn't happen but that is
for a different video that's it for this
I recommend trying this out and getting
used to it it's pretty nice
and you can pretty much very quickly
start adding a whole API all the scheme
like it your scheme is set up I kind of
just copy and pasting over and then
doing a request like this but so for
this video guys thanks for watching
