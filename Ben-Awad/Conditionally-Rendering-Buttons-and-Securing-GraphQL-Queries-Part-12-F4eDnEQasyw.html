Redux and added the user ID to the Redux
state so now we're going to use this in
our product view so to be able to
connect to the Redux store what we're
gonna do is use the connect tag and this
is coming from react Redux and similar
to how we used it before but now instead
of adding an action we just want to get
something from the state so the first
function is no longer gonna be null and
how it works is you take the state and
map it to the props so I would like this
to be called for us we really only care
about the user ID so I can pass the user
ID right into the props like this I can
say state user user ID so how do I know
it was called dot user well if we come
back over to our reducer I called it
user here so that's how I knew user
there and then dot user ID again because
I knew over here we just said the state
is equal to action that user and in our
check token we passed and right here the
user ID all right so now in my props I
have a user ID and I can console.log
this to show you guys so let's give a
save alright so this is the user ID of
that user so now we want to show an edit
and a delete button conditionally if the
user ID matches the user with whoever
made the product so how do we know who
made the product well we can grab the
seller and grab the ID for the seller so
now if i console.log
products we should be able to see the
seller attached to it so notice how this
guy has a celerity of this and you
notice that might be the same as this
one all right so we know this guy owns
this product because he's the seller has
the same seller idea so we're gonna do
is in our vendor item we're gonna
conditionally show some buttons so few
so if user ID is equal to item dot
seller ID then we want to show these
views otherwise we want to display null
so inside of this view I'm gonna say
button and this first one is gonna have
a title of edit the next one is just
gonna be evilly all right so now we see
edit and delete on all of these because
we own all of them and now and wants us
to go ahead and specify on clicks or on
presses for now I'm just gonna say no
well you know what we can just say
returns five will fill these out in a
future video okay and I'm just gonna
give this a style style dot edit delete
will say edit section so this edit
section I want to be horizontal so up
here edit section
I'm gonna say display flex and flex
direction I want to be not column but
row like this book and make sure you use
this as a string and I think we're good
now if you wanted to you could add icons
to this instead of just the word edit
didn't leap but I'm just gonna use this
cuz it's simpler
alright so cool in the next video we're
gonna be setting these up but before we
do that I want to show you guys a quick
security flaw that we have in our
backend so right now if we look at our
resolvers our post resolver and our post
or product this guy right here not that
one this guy oh wait no we put this in
query I forgot we split up our queries
and our mutations inside of this our
products so right now we're just
forwarding to the database which is fine
and because we want to have the same
functionality right but anyone can
access our products right now and we
don't want that
we only want users that are logged in to
be able to access and look at the
products and let me show you what I mean
so here is me requesting low-cost 4,000
and I'm trying to get some products
right and I can run this query and I get
all the products back and I'm not logged
in I don't have any headers I'm just to
show you guys I can even access this
from a postman so this is me just making
an HTTP request to our server
I have no tokens look at this header no
headers not logged in nothing and I can
access all our products so anyone could
see our products which we don't want now
on a client it's you know we we make you
login but right now on our server we're
not making you login so let's do that
and actually before we do that too I
wanted to fix my imports because you
guys showed me how I could do this with
imports intact so import as star and now
we shouldn't have a problem with
importing it and same with the short ID
that I was doing over here so nice okay
so I'm not really sure the best way to
actually do this because we're using
this forward to function so I'm assuming
the Ford to take like you know creates
this so I'm thinking I can just do some
stuff before I return it so what I mean
by that is the way I protect this
endpoint so we're gonna get the parent
args contacts and info is by running get
user ID because remember if we take a
look at this this will throw an error if
there is no token right so if there's
token we do it law authentication
otherwise there on air so now if we do
this check before forwarding and I'm
just gonna return forward to and I'm not
sure if I have to like pass in like
parent args context and foe like that or
if I can just return like this I'm gonna
try this first if this doesn't work
we'll try the other method but now we're
checking this before we're just
forwarding it on to the database so now
we can check authentication so let's see
we should get an error here and nice we
cannot read property replace of
undefined
so it looks like we just need to change
our thing over here
oh this so we're gonna say if
authorization
so I'm going to say what token is equal
to an empty string and if there's often
than we said the token looks like
authorization was just no alright
alright
we don't need to look at the parameters
let's just rerun that and cool now we
get not authorised and now over here I
try to make a query not authorized
perfect but now from our app because we
have a token we should be able to access
this just fine
it's refresh and alright we don't see
any products so I don't think we're
having a problem and we can see what our
air is it looks like we're just
returning nothing I don't think our
problem we didn't get the knot what's it
called not authorized right we just this
just didn't work so I'm gonna try
calling it passing the parent args
context info and see if that works
better and cool it does so we are good
now and now our products route is
protected so you have to have be logged
in to access this so we won't have any
just random people accessing it they're
gonna have to login through our app
first perfect so this is looking good I
think there's just one other thing I
want to check before we end this video
is the edit and delete button if we log
out you know and log in with a different
user we don't see it so right now we
don't really have a log out button on
our app so let's close all that so in
check token I'm just gonna say
I'm just gonna set item and I'm gonna
set it to an empty string so that what
that'll do is that'll just lock us out
right because I'm setting the token to
an empty string and now I'm gonna get
rid of that so we don't do that every
single time but so I'm logged out now so
my name is gonna be Bob 10 Bob 10 Bob 10
I don't think I'm we're checking to make
sure this is a valid email so I think
we're fine putting that and we're not so
I just create an account we could take a
look we can not edit any of these
products but if we add our own about a
10 pick from a camera roll there we go
I have my product did we crash we did
crash can tree property only so it
what's it called the my star thing
didn't worked I used the wrong syntax
again so in our products
oh yeah import pass huh
I fix this but he's the wrong syntax
again all right so now we should be able
to click add product and not get an
error unless the server's just crashed
and done for which it might be I don't
think are okay so our servers running I
think we just crashed on the front end
when we did this so we're after refresh
it
all right so we don't see our product
we'll create another one b10
all right so missing the seller ID and
our update but we do go ahead and see
the edit and delete just for this one so
it's perfect let's fix this real quick
the reason we're getting that is if we
take a look at our on our front-end our
new product now we can't just push
create product we can but we need to
select seller get the ID of that seller
and did we just do the emulator just
crash missing field seller all right
looks like my emulator just crashed but
this should go ahead and fix that error
cuz now it's gonna grab the seller ID
the arrow is saying that seller ID did
not exist and was expecting it because
if we look in our products we are now
grabbing seller ID so expects all the
ones have the celerity now I think I can
just go over to Expo and rerun this and
then we couldn't give it one last try
and then we'll be good all right so
create a product I don't really care
cool so no longer get that warning
that's it for this video guys sorry it
dragged on a little bit but we were just
kind of fixing some errors walk down our
security of our products and point so
that tells you by default all of our
endpoints are not secure and to secure
them with at least to secure them in
some way right you could add more
security if you needed it but you at
least need to run this if you don't want
unauthorized users to access your graph
QL endpoint so that'll get you protected
right there and then we have our nice
little button showing up just on the
products that we own so that's perfect
and so now I want to be able to edit and
delete so when we go over that will
actually talk about permissions right
because I should not be able to edit or
delete someone else's even though we
don't show the button on the front end
again we need to make sure in the
backend we stop users so we're gonna
create a permission to make sure you're
the only one editing your products but
that's it for this video guys thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
