download instead of es want now
specifically I'm going to show you how
to get it set up with the Airbnb style
because it's not as easy as ESM makes it
out to be because there's this nice tool
the s-1 has it's a command line where
you can just run excellent on it and
it'll set up basically it makes it look
like it sets everything up it actually
does it and I'll show you what's going
on but first you want to run npm install
so - g guess what if you have not have
the Esalen command line - why we have
this some good to go
and i am c deed into my project my
project is called led ting and it's my
react application and i would like to
set up a yes lint with Airbnb style here
so go ahead and run this if you haven't
I already have some not going to run it
and then after that I'm just going to do
an LS to show you guys will - my
directory right now so package.json no
modules you know to react application
and dot get ignore but there's no des
'luntar c which basically tells you you
know it's the rules for lifting so but
if you're on es lint and it ill step us
through creating setting up configuring
our yes lint so for me i want to use a
popular style guide and I want to choose
Airbnb and choose different if you want
to but I really like Airbnb
and we are using a react application and
I'm going to set up with JavaScript not
last step is you could take a different
one it doesn't really matter
that's whatever you prefer editing and
as you can see it's going to now install
these five plugins into our package a
JSON well I guess there's more packages
but you'll notice there's this little
warning yes what has a peer required
peer those not installed and but you
know notice it says it successful down
here and if I were to say
just open up mgs went RC this is a new
file it creates for us I can see that
there's some good stuff here it this is
all good and nice this is our
configuration file for 20 you want to
change stuff here if you want to change
how it works and if I were to go into
package on JSON what I could do is I
could create two new scripts here first
is lint I'm going to create one actually
and it could run
yes lint on source so if I save that I
can then do is lint run lint and it'll
actually link the project right and look
it looks well and good it has these
problems it shows up and it tells me
what they are right and I can go and fix
them one by one right well it's not
quite working like you think that peer
dependency is talking about earlier is
actually a big deal so I'm just going to
open this project up in Visual Studio
code and we get rid of release notes and
I have this set up with an es with
plugin so if I just open up a GS we can
see it'll actually show me what yes what
problems are and Wow everything is red
this looks like a fine react though and
if I hover over some stuff they'll say
JSX href not no hash hover over here
same thing same thing and this air href
no hash has actually nothing to do with
it
that actual air is when you have an href
tag that looks like this or something
right and you leave the hrs blank or
something or you don't even put an href
for an anchor tag which we're not doing
that anywhere there's not even an anchor
tag on this so something else is going
on and it's missing what's happening
these projects actually missing some
dependencies that use so to fix this if
you actually go to yes what config air
B&amp;amp;B package it actually tells you this
that there's actually you should install
it the way we just did
instead if we run this command here
it'll actually tell you what peer
dependencies this project needs so these
are the peer dependencies that Airbnb
needs so that means for Airbnb to run it
needs these dependencies which we
actually have if we are going to package
on JSON you'll notice we have all of
these except they're different versions
and that's the problem so you can see
here but we have slept for and we
actually have a newer packages of I
think most of them and that's the
problem they're too new and they're not
they don't work well together so we
actually have to install the older
versions of these for them to actually
work so how do we do that well it's
actually pretty simple
you can just do NPM install and do save
dev and go through each one and do es
one AK and then you want to do the same
thing you see here three point nine
point zero and you can go through and do
this for each one right JSX li 5.1.1 I
can go through and do this for each one
but what's nice is you come to this page
which I'll link in the description
there's this nice little command you can
run for Linux and Mac users which will
just do it for you windows guys they
have another one you can use or you can
just type it out like I was showing you
before but if I go ahead and run this
it'll install these packages at these
versions and it'll actually work for us
and we can get the nice gear flip
blunting with Airbnb Styles because I'm
actually a big fan of the Airbnb styles
it looks really nice in my opinion so
now I'm going to close this project and
reopen it again and see what it looks
like with the new version of what we
just had so it hasn't loaded yet it
takes one second to boot up the es wood
server but what we do we'll notice now
there's only two red lines and if we
come over this this actually makes sense
and says their component should be a
pure function so now if we wanted to we
could say
app is equal to and we could just do
that right making it a peer function and
now we can see our little way so now we
have a new one because this is an
undefined variable and get rid of that
and then we can look at where a problem
is here does JSX isn't allowed and we
could go through now arias Linear's and
fix our project because now we know
we're actually getting good errors so
it's for this video guys I hope that
helped
this is load file is not anything
special this RC if you want to see some
of my RCS what they look like I
recommend looking at some of my github
projects with JavaScript I have some
good is lent RC files that you can go
off of and I'll put a link to my github
in the description below so you can go
check that stuff out so that's it I'll
see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
