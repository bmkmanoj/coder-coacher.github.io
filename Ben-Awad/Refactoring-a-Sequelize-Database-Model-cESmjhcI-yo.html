from working on the authentication for
our web socket or a graphical
subscription I'm gonna comp in the
comment this out where we're trying to
grab the member and we're gonna work on
refactoring how our member model works
so currently right now our member model
is empty and then our team has a owner
which is a foreign key to members and
this is a suggestion made by someone in
the comments that I really liked and
that was just get rid of this owner
field instead of having an owner on the
team object itself or the team model is
actually put it in members so now
members is gonna be have a type here
that's gonna be admin now you could make
this generic and make this a role but
I'm just gonna say this is an admin and
the type is going to be a boolean value
so just like with our team we now have
we can do comma data' types up here
comma datatypes and did we capitalize
the t yeah we did and I can say data
types doc boolean
and then default value I'm gonna do this
false so now I just check the member
object to see whether they're in admin
or not and like I said we could call
this a roll and make this an integer and
then say roll zero is a regular user
roll one's an admin and roll two is a
super user you could do something like
that but I'm gonna make this simple and
just have an admin which is a boolean so
now to update this in the database I'm
just going to say force true when we're
sinking so this is gonna drop everything
and we're gonna lose all our data which
I'm okay with because it's all dummy
data but if we are in production what we
want to do is a migration so now what
we're gonna do is we're gonna change
some of our stuff so it works with this
new admin rule so the first thing we're
gonna be doing is with our team resolver
over here so when I create a team notice
how we had in all teams and invite teams
we're not gonna have that anymore but
we'll fix that in a second so now first
thing I want to work on is the create
team so right now we should get an error
so here's the front end I'm gonna
refresh all our data should be gone it
is so we're just gonna walk through all
the things that we can do on the website
and make sure they still work and if
they don't we're gonna fix them so user
I'm gonna create a Bob one Bob calm copy
and paste on paste them okay so
registering looks like registering works
okay and let's login and make sure that
works it shouldn't affect anything cuz
this is our team so we're good and our
view team should get affected so here if
you team we just get an error because we
don't have an owner object now our owner
property
and then our crate team to be able to
create a team should air out - so if I
do team a we get a little air let's see
oh looks like it created okay that's
good let's look at what our crew team is
working so it looks like we grab
whatever arguments we have and then our
owner argument for create team is just
gonna be not existent it's gonna be null
for that field so let's get rid of that
so in our schema I'm gonna come over
here to team remove the owner and all
right yeah so in our team over here we
don't need that don't need that anymore
I was in our team resolver oops not that
okay so we're setting the owner with
this user ID we don't need to do that
anymore instead of doing it like that
we're gonna create a new member and
associate the team so we want to make
sure and do this within our transaction
that way we don't want to create a new
team member if the team doesn't get
created so like we created the channel
we're gonna come down here and create a
member and here
our team ID is going to be equal to the
ID of the team the user ID is gonna be
user ID and then admin is gonna be true
and so that's it so now when we create a
team we're also creating a member and
just real quick I'm gonna pop back over
here and get rid of the force true that
way we don't just keep dropping the data
consistently I forgot about that we just
dropped the new user that I created okay
so now when we create a team we're also
creating our Channel and we're creating
a member which is then associated to
this team so now when we grab all teams
what we really want to do is really just
grab the member and then grab that
members or that users teams so maybe we
want to like move this query into the
user and to like get user and if we look
at our schema our user I believe has a
team teams yep maybe we want to just do
something like that now and I think
that'll work out pretty well for us so
let's do that
all right so to do this we're gonna hop
and our team we're gonna get rid of
these guys I'm gonna copy them over and
move them to our user so it's gonna be
similar to our get users working except
now we want to grab teams so get user
and then our team I'm gonna get rid of
the query since we're gonna have no
queries and our team now and for our
team we will be grabbing channels so and
you know what we can keep that here this
is fine to keep here because this is
associated to our team okay so for users
so all users I think is fine let's call
this get user one
so forget user we're gonna requires off
requires off dot create resolver and
then just wrap it and let's not require
any arguments for that let's just pick
up the user based on the ID that we're
from the JWT token so in our schema we
can close that open up our schema user
the where's our queries there are get
rid of the requirement for an ID all
right so we just grabbing the user so
you're that all right so now with our
get user we also need to import our
requires off from permissions so copy
that paste it in here okay so for a get
user we're gonna say requires autocrat
user models dot find one where the ID is
equal to user ID all right cool so now
for all teams so when we fetch the user
we also want to fetch actually do we
even want to fetch the user we actually
only care about the member but we are in
our view team we're also showing like
the users ID so we can either just store
that in the JWT token or fetch it here
let's just say fetch it here all right
so we're gonna fetch our user next thing
we want to do is fetch the team's like
this so kind of how like in our team
schema how we grab the channels and if
we look at that we created a team and
then channels we're gonna do that for a
user so we're gonna create a user object
up here and then we're gonna create a
team's resolver which takes the parent
args and then models and then returns
all the teams associated to that so
really the arguments we care about for
this
is basically all the teams that is
associated with this person so we're
gonna do kind of basically going to do
this query right here so I'm gonna copy
that and paste it in here and I'm just
gonna get rid of this stuff cuz we don't
need it anymore
and we'll put a comma here I think we're
I think I have one too many parentheses
maybe area so let's look at what this
query is doing one more time so select
all from teams and I'm gonna add in
aliases so this is easier to read so I'm
going to say teams as team or will say
yeah why not team and members as member
and so here we're looking at the area
the ID of the team so that's gonna be
team de ID versus is equal to the member
team ID and then here we're checking
where the user ID which we get from the
member is equal to the user ID we pass
in and we just need to grab that from
our context again so this looks good
let's review what this query is doing
one more time because it's been a little
bit so we're selecting all from teams
and then I said as team which is an
alias and then we're joining against
members so we're getting all the teams
and the way we're getting which teams we
want is by joining it with member table
and we're saying we're the team ID
matches up with the member team ID that
means that member is with that team and
then we're filtering down by the user ID
of the current user and we're passing
that in and finding if that's equal and
so that's what's teams are gonna get
returned all right so let's test out
this new query that when you made the
get user query we could also just call
this
me you see that pretty commonly so I
like that name call it just me so
instead of get user just me sit down on
our front end
let's bring the front end over here
let's do a meet query so here we're
gonna say me and this is gonna be all
this is gonna be a meet query now so
thought that thought graph QL slash team
so right here so instead of doing these
two parallel queries we can get rid of
it and we're gonna say me and now we can
grab the user name ID if we want to
what other weather do we have weather
fields I mean email username and email
why not I'll to grab all those actually
I don't know if we'll need the email but
we want to display the username at least
so here we're gonna grab teams and then
from teams we want all these fields so
let's put in the me query here so me
query and then our team's here oops
we're just going to D structure it from
me so because we know that one of the
properties of me is teams we can just
grab it here and I'm just gonna console
dot log me so you guys can see the other
values and now instead of I believe it's
in we're passing to our channel we're
not passing to our channel sidebar so if
you look at sidebar and we look at I
think it's yeah see how we're decoding
this token to get the username and then
we're passing the username in here
instead of storing the username in the
day WT token which could go stale the
username anyway because it could be
changed we're now going to fetch it on
each time so that's a little plus from
using the strategy too so let's see this
in action and see what we have wrong
team does not export a name called me
query oh yeah let's change that the name
of that so me query oops
me query about this refresh team does
not contain any export named all teams
query so this is add channel modal so at
channel oh okay so this was updating our
teams so now we're gonna say me oops me
query so now we need to update the me
query so me query query so this is gonna
be a little bit different than how we're
doing it
so we need to go to data dot me dot
teams and we do data me dot teams there
we go so let's see you know I think yeah
I think that one oh yeah we didn't
create a team or we didn't create a I
think your database is empty so let's
create a unless I logged in I can't
remember if I logged in or not
let's login again anyway it's a crate
Bob - Bob calm copy it copy it alright
we create our user and I login paste it
in here and now I'm gonna create a team
we'll call this GG create it and working
in air so let's take a look at what's
wrong with this so cannot reap Robert II
teams of undefined so here's the data
that we're getting oh this is for our
create team so let's refresh
okay so we're getting undefined for me
so interview team here it looks like me
is undefined for some reason so I'm
gonna do comma dot dot dot other props
and we're gonna console dot log other
props and see what we're doing wrong it
could just be my query is wrong and so
we'll give that a test in a second - all
right so here's what it looks like we're
not passing any variables I don't think
nope failed looks like we're just
getting a bad request let's see if
there's an error on the server side
doesn't look like there's any type of
error okay so let's look at our query
looks like that's what's messed up so
this thing right here so I'm gonna copy
this oops
copy it into graphical and see so
anytime I have trouble with queries not
working what I like to do is head over
to graphical and try running them so I'm
first just gonna pretty fi it and run
this so cannot query field owner on type
ok so that's something I you get rid of
and cannot read property ID of undefined
okay so that's fine that's we should get
undefined because we're not logged in on
graphical let's see if getting rid of
the owner helps though so nope still we
don't get an error now we just get
undefined still and we're not getting
anything back okay so I want to get this
graphical one to work so if you look it
looks like we're getting an error now
can I read ID of undefined so I don't
know what oh it looks like our just our
user was undefined when we were
selecting the user here so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna hard code the user
ID so here I see how being request that
user so instead
that I'm going to hard-code it to user
and then the ID is equal to one this way
I'm basically permanently logged in and
now I can just run it on graphical and
get get this query to work so here we go
cannot return null for non knowable
field user died ID so now we can quickly
iterate and fix our back-end so let's
see what's going on with our back-end so
this is gonna be our user resolver here
okay so with me we're finding a user
where the user is 1 so we hard-code the
value 1 so let's make sure we're
actually is a user with oops a user that
is ID 1 so I'm going to connect to slack
and select all from users alright so we
have see we have an ID of 1 and we
should be getting an ID of 1 but yet it
says the ID is null so the next thing
I'm gonna try is just oh look at that
I'm being silly
requires off that create resolver needs
to wrap I wrap the wrong thing basically
all right so let's give that another try
and failed the fetch just means the
server's restarting cool so not
authenticated that shouldn't happen
because we were hard coding the user but
let's comment you and bring you back in
and see if our front-end works now
okay connection error so the server's
still restarting awesome so now it's
good okay so that was just a silly error
on my part I'll get rid of that so it
looks like we're able to load this in
now so refresh so we're able to see GG
let's look at our team and make sure
we're not using owner anywhere so I'm
just gonna do a quick search of the
project and look for owner and I'm gonna
look for just searching source so I'm
not using owner anywhere so we should be
okay but let's just test out the rest of
the features of the site so I'm gonna
create another user and we're gonna
invite that user to the team so this is
Bob - right now I'm gonna register a Bob
3 oops um Bob 3 at Bob calm and we're
gonna paste paste now while we're here I
wanted to also fix a quick little air
that we get I'll show you what this
areas so notice how I go to view team
oops we didn't login let's log in real
quick login again ok so we are
redirecting when you go to view team if
you don't have any teams so notice how I
get redirected here but when I create
this team here what's gonna happen is
it's gonna keep me on this page now at
first I thought this was a race
condition because maybe we weren't
creating the team so I'll show you that
real quick so Q so notice how I submit I
stay on this page so I redirect to view
team and then I get redirected back to
here because it thinks I have no teams
at first I thought this was a race
condition like the team was getting
created wasn't getting created before we
were fetching it but the problem was
actually we were catch caching the data
for view team so when I created a new
one it was still caching the data that
we had no teams so to fix this we're
gonna do is on our front-end and our
view team we're just going to
a network only as our options
so options fetch policy network only so
some things you don't really want to
cache in this case we don't want to
cache requesting the teams like that
because you can get invited the teams
and create teams often and we want to
make sure it's up to date all right so
now I'll show you this error is now gone
I'm gonna create a new user call Bob for
and we should be good to go
login bambam head over to view team man
so now when I create my team QW notice
how we redirect here just fine and we
don't get shot back all right so now
let's invite people to our team and
notice how our buttons gone so let's add
that again so if we don't we're not
showing whether you're the member of a
team or not
let's show in our team
let's make an admin field I feel like
this will work but I'm not entirely sure
so okay let me check describe what the
problem is real quick to you guys so we
were using owner right before so if we
head over to our sidebar and our
channels we're displaying whether the
user can invite people based on whether
the owner so see how we have passing it
and this is owner and how we're checking
is we're checking it's the team owner
and now we don't have a team owner
anymore so this is always false
but oops I went over one too maybe we
want to look at the server so on the
server we want to pass back if we're the
owner if we're an admin or not so the
way we know for an happen or not is with
this query we're actually returning
we're selecting all in one of our fields
for mess or what's a called
member artists is admin so we can
actually display admin back so I believe
what I can do is in our team I can
create an admin field which will be a
boolean and we don't have to always
display it so I'm gonna make it Noble
and let's just see if this works I'm not
entirely sure if it will and this is
kind of a hacky solution to because it
doesn't make sense to have an admin
field on a team it makes it more sense
to be like in relation to a user so
here's the team's
okay it looks like the admin is null so
we're gonna have to change kind of how
we're selecting this in a way maybe we
select the members and then that
grabs whether we have an admin or not so
basically we need to change our resolver
here this guy our user resolver this
thing that way we also get the admin and
we can pass that to our user so this is
not a good way to do it how I was doing
it anyway with this little admin we're
gonna be doing it in a different way and
that's what we'll be doing in the next
video is getting that to work but so
we're gonna continue to transition to
this admin strategy in the next video
so that's it for this one we got rid of
that condition where we bounce back and
forth when we create a new user and we
create a team so we got that out of the
way
and then we started to refactor the code
with this admin and creating members
when we create teams so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
