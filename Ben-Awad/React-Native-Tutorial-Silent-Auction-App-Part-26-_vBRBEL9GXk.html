going to be implementing bidding so what
I'm thinking right now is to add a
little icon here that we can click on
and press and when you click on the icon
you bid on it and so we just have like a
list of bids there auctions here and you
can click on a bid on the item so I was
looking at the available icons and I
honestly couldn't find a great one this
arrow drop down up with like kind of the
best thing like maybe a Bitcoin one I
think I saw a Bitcoin one yeah maybe a
Bitcoin one would work there really
wasn't any great bids and actually not
everything we'll just use a Bitcoin one
up-arrow kind of makes sense because
you're upping the price I don't know
we'll see which one we like better about
logo Bitcoin in there now and see which
one I like better but there's not a
great one that I really liked that look
good so this going to be in View
auctions and this is going to be in our
little cart view here and top better to
the right of top bitter so I'm thinking
I can use the left and right thing that
we learned from the other that we use
the with the header and I'm thinking I
can just do left
and right capitalize that and in here
we'll have my icon name a little bit
coin and that'll hopefully be on the
right side so if you're refreshed loud
see I'm not sure if the left and right
only works on what's it called leather
and it looks like it did work but it
also looks like it's way over here and I
don't really like it so small maybe we
can make it a little bit bigger and add
some padding so if I come over to the
components we can look at how we can
style icon here so there are size font
size and we can do color on size 28
color green style give it a margin
bottom of 10 and a margin right of 10
I'll push it off the side a little bit
give it some room I'll - how that looks
and that kind of off-center top bit over
here I wonder if I give all these the
left to give it a nice padding and this
did not change really did it see color
include this prop Oh
both of these need to be within style
color green font size 28 and we should
drop that too actually we might not have
to drop it in your line because we're
grabbing you're deleting some stuff
let's see if that that fixes anything Oh
much better
and I want to tab all that over so I'm
gonna wrap everything in the left copy
all these tabs right over
so putting everything a left so they all
have equal margin all right
yes Flint was just lagging a little bit
so that push it off the side here a bit
I think it looks pretty nice I want to
push this up more and make it even
bigger and then give it a non press so
make that say 40 and it was through 2020
all right
and better ending me an even bigger
though whoops let's go like 60 30 30 all
right ah see how big it's missing out
because it's it's grabbing this whole
thing what I really want to do is do a
left and the right like this so what if
I do this left so I find the best thing
with this stuff is just experimenting
and seeing what work I am NOT great at
layouts so what we're going to do I'm
thinking this will work out because we
will have wrap some card items in left
and then put that in right now I'm
thinking it'll treat this whole thing
here at the left side and this thing at
the right side and that might change how
that's and that I don't even know what
happened
just put underneath card item card item
I think it's because he's all I need to
be card items get rid of that let's see
we just need a closing tag so I think if
we just drop those to a new line that
would look pretty good so carne item I'm
not sure putting card item and in the
middle here does what we want it to and
it doesn't really what if we car died on
the right now that won't do it so we
want the text to drop down to a new line
if each one of these to drop to a new
line tool is the best way I don't know
if it's a container or what if they're
like a grid we can use be a layout there
we go grid and we can put column oh your
acne of easy grid what is this
okay this is kind of interesting what if
we did a list instead that might work
out
list and list items let's see how that
look that might look really bad though
1d is great but look like grid I have to
do in our library and I don't want to do
that right now I want to try this first
so the left side will have a list list
item
if I got rid of this bar here that would
look pretty good and can I remove helps
to organize item header item divider I'm
assuming is this the divider render row
callback takes a chunk of data from the
data rating and returns a component I
think maybe it's render row render row
text is equal to text that's all we want
we don't want that bar in between nope
still doesn't do it
thumbnail icon first item header button
data rate item divider now dividers this
thing huh I don't think there's any way
of getting the default line list
separator here you are
nope separators this thing oh well I
think I'll leave it for now it doesn't
look awful just look a little bit awful
let's get this Bitcoin thing going
though so I want to Center it more if
you can want it like right here it gets
high enough margin right I'll give it
like double that looks good
and then make it like maybe 90 I really
just want a huge button I can click on
that's not talked about okay
let's give that a non press so let's
just see you and we click it see if we
get high and we do all right so we have
our icon all set up now that we can
click on in the next video what we'll do
is we'll actually hook this up and we'll
watch when you click on this will
actually tell the server hey this person
voted on this one I'll date it so we'll
do that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
