learning react and he got really
confused and had a lot of questions so I
wanted to make this video to answer his
questions and hopefully help some of the
people I have similar questions
so to start them off I told them to
either download node and you create
react app or use something like code
sandbox which is an online react editor
where you don't have to download your
setup anything you can just start coding
react in the browser but he opted to
setting up node on his computer and
installing create react app and now
that's what I have open right here in
Visual Studio code so his first question
was why do I need to install node
because he didn't actually use node to
you to do recreate react app and the
reason you install node is for something
called MPM so NPM is called node package
manager and what it does is keeps track
of lets you install packages or install
other people's code third-party
libraries that sort of thing for your
projects so you needed this and you
actually need to install create react
app with this npm module so you don't
use node directly but your install node
because you need NPM and NPM comes with
node so you can use NPM from the command
line and first he needed to install
create reactor so to do that I told him
to do NPM install Dashti create react
app like this and he didn't know what
this - G thing did here and what that
does is it installs it globally and that
means that all pack all you can
basically use it from the command line
now like a utility and installs it
globally on your computer whereas
regular NPM packages are installed per
project basis which I'll get to in a
second so after that he needed to run
create react app at first he thought
maybe he had to do something like this
or MPN run create react tap like that
but when you install like this it
actually just installed kind of how npm
is where it's just the command-line
utility so you can run it just like this
create react app and then the name of
your app so hello world if you wanted to
and once you get in there if it
installed correctly it'll go ahead and
install a couple packages using NPM and
it'll it'll you'll feel a loading bar
and then your package will be your
project will be set up and you'll see
this stuff on the left now when you open
up this you don't see it on my left pane
right here but if I were to LS in the
command line there's this folder called
node modules and he didn't know what
that was and if I look LS in there
there's a ton of junk and node modules
is all the dependencies or third-party
code or libraries that your project uses
so every time you start a NPM or
JavaScript project you'll have a
different node modules so if I did
create react app in a different folder
I'm gonna have two node modules and when
I install react I'm gonna have reacted
the snood modules and the node modules
over there so this is just the folder
that contains all of that stuff right
there so now when I install dependencies
without that G flag like npm install
react Tippie or any kind of library
what's gonna happen is it's gonna save
that code into my local node modules but
if i don't want to install it to my node
modules
I want install it globally let me do
dash G and that's why we did - G before
because we didn't want that to go to our
node modules folder since we didn't have
one we wanted to use it globally so then
there's this package a JSON file where
has all your dependencies and things
basically for your application so it's
kind of like a config file for your
application here you see this script
section we'll talk about that in a
second but here you can see there
depends dependencies installed in the
dev dependencies so react react Dom the
difference between these two is
dev dependencies are ones you don't need
for production or if you were to deploy
your application so then to start this
now that you have created app open oops
and running well we don't have it
running yet to get it started running is
NPM start so running NPM start in the
folder that you have it started what
that does is that actually runs and
you'll see it's gonna start up a server
and at localhost 3000 I should be able
to see the code that comes with create
react app and when I do MPM start with
actually being run is this script here
so npm start runs react scripts start
and react scripts is something that
create react app gives us and basically
just used to start up the server and to
use code reloading and what code
reloading is our hot reloading is when i
start typing over here so here's some
job here's javascript file if i were to
save a change what's gonna happen is
this is gonna automatically refresh with
the changes i make so they have
configured a server for you to basically
dental development servers so as you're
running and developing code you can see
it refresh and see your code live over
here so this is what you should see when
you first start and he was very confused
about where the where he should put code
or there's a lot of files that come with
the index or Weekender create react app
so there's testing CSS j/s which one is
he supposed to start in just to
javascript ones so in general you're
gonna focus on the javascript files and
there's two here so index such as in app
KS and he saw render here and render
here and that confused him because he
wasn't sure what each render was doing
and if they were different so if in
excel jeaious is the start of your
application and look at what this does
it says react Dom render and it's
rendering this thing right here and it's
saying document I get element
by ID root so you should have gotten a
public folder and inside of that a
index.html and there is this div called
root so it has an ID equal to root so
when they say render app what they're
saying is look at this and this is
because creator act got this set up this
way it's grabs this index.html and puts
your react app right here and the reason
it puts it there or at least it puts
this code there because we got that
document by the ID here root and then we
decided to render it and so apt is you
can think of as your main function or
main component and everything is going
to stem from this and the reason for
that is this is what's being rendered on
to the HTML and so that's what you
actually see here so if we go into app
KS we can see this correlates all the
code here so this is where you want to
put all your code in this return
statement so everything is gonna stem
from this app yes so he also didn't know
what to do with printing so you can
console dot log in JavaScript and he
wasn't sure where that would go because
there's this thing over here right this
console and a lot of other programming
languages it'll pop up in the console
but with react at least with create
react at the default is if you go to
right click inspect and then console
you'll see all your console logs so
that's how you print stuff so if you
want do print for debugging and notice
how I have this outside you can also put
this inside your render function and we
should see this you notice how this
refresh is and we see hello here again
so it takes our code I just changed it
and it refreshes the browser for us so
he wasn't sure what was going on with
this render function to so this
component this is called a component
we don't need that anymore this thing is
called a component and we're exporting
the component and by exporting it that
just allows this index to import it so
we can't import something that hasn't
been exported so it's been exported so
we can import over there and this app we
have to tile and this is the way to tell
what a component renders is by its
render function and you can think of
this as what it displays what it shows
on the screen and for the most part
you're going to be returning what's
called JSX right here is JSX so JSX is
uh basically a little bit different than
HTML but you'll notice this looks very
similar to HTML but there's a few
oddities like what's going on here right
you've never seen curly braces like that
in HTML before so it combines HTML and
JavaScript and allows you to show HTML
and JavaScript together so it wasn't
sure where do you put your JavaScript
code right so notice how this is a
JavaScript variable up here logo and we
want to use this javascript logo a
variable inside our HTML over here so
use these curly braces so anywhere in
your application that you want to use
JavaScript you have to use curly braces
at least when you're returning up here
this is regular JavaScript so I can make
a variable say Const a is equal to I'm
variable a right I'm variable a and we
can render a right but notice it's white
so visual studio code how that works is
it tells you when you haven't rendered
it as a JavaScript so it doesn't know
that I want the variable a to be
rendered in my application all it knows
is I want it thinks I'm saying welcome
to react right here's an a here how does
it know I want to do that with the
variable a up here so you have to wrap
it with curly braces and notice how the
color changes on that and so that's how
you know at least in Visual Studio code
that this is going
interpreted as a JavaScript object so
now it's gonna say I'm a variable a here
but if I get rid of this it's just gonna
show the letter A right and inside these
little braces I can do a number of
different things I can do addition I can
do map through arrays we can see three
but this is not you can't just do like
for example kant's B is equal to six
everything you put sign inside these
curly braces I believe has to evaluate
to something so three plus four that
evaluates to seven if I put a that
evaluates to this so it needs to
evaluate to something that way that can
be rendered in react so whenever you
want to interpret what you put in here
as JavaScript you use curly braces
otherwise you just do regular stuff and
that pretty much answered all his
questions at least to get him started
with this I hope that helps some of you
guys that are struggling to get started
with react or had a lot of questions and
we're really confused because there are
a lot of tutorials out there that each
say different things so I hope that
helps some of you guys that's it for
