started with coding up our Android app
today so first thing I want to do is
make sure you have Android studio
installed and we're just gonna create a
new project so I'm gonna call mine
Munchie - and then just set your company
domain to your name so mine's been Awad
comm and then next I'm gonna do API 19
this gets most of them most devices so
each one of these is a software version
that a phone uses API 19 captures most
of them like on my phone I have nugget
but some people have older version not
to me have jelly beans we don't worry
about this and this gives us most of our
functionality as you know you support
more versions you can't use newer things
so you have to be careful about that we
just can use an empty activity
I mean activities fine and we're gonna
finish let that build and the first
thing that we're gonna do once this is
finished building is go into our layout
and create a the layout that you saw
we're going to create some text views
and a image view and a text view at the
very bottom and then we're just kind of
today we're gonna hook it up using
Picasso so I'll show you guys that real
quick we're gonna hook up the image view
with Picasso load in a view and then
also get the swipe gestures working so
there's this really good Stack Overflow
post that shows you how to create on on
swipe touch listener and we're just
gonna actually just copy it straight
from here cuz this is a good code and
then we override these functions to
swipe right left top and bottom so I'll
show you guys how to integrate that
let's see if it's finished building and
it is cool so it's gonna build up the
bottom that's fine so I first thing
we're going to go into a res layout our
main activity and we're going to go into
the text and we're gonna create a text
you so this will be at the very top and
we'll give this an ID I don't have to
give this one second to finish indexing
so we can get our autocomplete working
there we go I'd eat this will be the
title title label for now let's give a
demo crap pizza shop and then let's
create our image view and we also want
to make sure our image view is going to
be at the top so aligned parent top true
and we want the width to match parent
this makes the text view expand across
the whole width of the screen of the
phone screen which we want and we want
to give the gravity center this centers
it in the middle of the screen and then
we just wanted to be as tall as it is
and then we're going to create an image
view below that and we're just in K way
out with it's going to be a match parent
and the height is gonna be matched
parent as well we just want it to be as
big as it can be and then we're going to
give it an ID main image and it's gonna
be below our title label and then we can
close that and we're gonna create a text
view there's gonna be at the very bottom
again we can match the width and the
height will wrap and this is gonna be
below our main image again we want to
Center this in the middle and instead I
want to sandwich the image view between
these two right now if we just leave it
like this the image view will be on top
of this text view so
gonna say a line parent bottom parent
bottom is true so right now we have that
this textview at the top and this one's
at the top it's forced by this Alliant
this one's forced at the bottom and then
what we want to do with this image view
is just sandwich it in between so we're
going to layout it below the top one and
we're going to layout above our we
didn't give it an ID yet give this guy
an ID so we can say this is still have
the cost and the category actually it's
not gonna have the cost gonna have a
rating so rate and then cap rate cap and
we'll give it label so we're gonna do
we're gonna lay out above that so what's
happening is we have this guy at the top
this guy at the bottom and then we're
sandwich inga Simha Jai you in between
so it's below the top one but it's above
the bottom one okay so those are there
let's just give this some sample text
oops we want just text oh just kidding
we want to give that to our bottom to
our cost category not that so let's say
this has a 4.2 rating and this is
Italian food
now our layout is good and our main
activity in our oncreate we're just
going to create some text views textview
this will be import the class this will
be restaurant title and then we're also
gonna have a rate and then category and
then we'll have our image view which is
going to be the main image
so we're have em restaurant title is
equal to this is a text view I'm just
gonna use fine view by ID card ID got em
title label this grabs initializes the
text view I'm gonna do the same thing
for our rate cat and then we're do it
for image view and we need to import
this class and main image is equal to
attack the image view my view by ID are
that ID don't like main image okay so
now if we running that I'm gonna run
this on my emulator what's gonna happen
is right now we have nothing in our
image but we should have the title and
the category showing up at the bottom
and then what we need to do is we're
going to load in that image with Picasso
so we're gonna loan in a dummy image for
now so let's go ahead and see if it's
built on our emulator looks like we got
no resource found like given the falling
name it looks like main image so let's
looks like we have oh this this we don't
want to do below anymore
we're not doing this below the main
image we want the image to be below that
so rebuild that that was our text view
at the very bottom I originally was
thinking we want to have the text view
below the image view but instead want
the image view we want to lay it out
this way so the image view fits in
between so to add Picasso this is a
external library so what we're going to
be doing is at the very bottom of this
web page there's going to be here it is
a little compile for Gradle so we're
just going to copy this and we're gonna
use that in a second here
but let's see it finished building it
nope Gradle still building we love that
finish building if you go to here module
app we're just going to paste in Picasso
right here when ever this is finished
building so it looks like it's your
spell finished building we can go take a
look of that when that's finished
watching that activity and here we are
so we're not seeing the text up here we
are we're seeing the text now cuz this
pizza shop in Italian and then our image
is blank so let's add that image in next
so you're going to go into Gradle
scripts build.gradle the one that has
module app and then the dependencies
we're just going to add Picasso as one
of our dependencies and then we're gonna
sink Gradle now you go back to our main
activity and we can use Gradle so I'm
just going to copy the example that they
have we're just going to use that come
on in here and now our context that's
where I'm passing this then our image
view is main image and let's go ahead
and put that in stack these nicely
okay now let's rerun our application now
we should see a little image in the
middle there and then the next thing I
just want to do for the last thing for
this video is you're just to add in that
it's alright finished building alright
and hopefully in a second here we should
get Picasso load in the image let's see
if we can get our monitor see if it says
oh yes so if we come in here we should
get a err
mmm doesn't look like it looks like it's
silently failing so if you notice what
Picasso does is it loads an image from
the internet
and an Android to load it in to image
off the internet you have to first ask
for permission to use the internet so
we're going to create a permission uses
permission and it's internet okay so we
just need to add that to our Android
manifest now if we rerun our application
hopefully Picasso will show up with our
image this is now it should have
permission to actually go to the
internet and grab the image and there we
are now we have this image pulling from
Picasso very cool next thing I want to
do is actually detect swipes so for
example if I swipe this way swipe that
way nothing's happening I want to be
able to detect swipes on that image view
so I'm going to go over here and copy
this code I will leave a link to this
stack overflow page in comments of
YouTube our description below and or you
can go to this link right here and add
it so we're just going to create a new
file please it was on swipe listener and
we're just gonna paste it in get rid of
that stuff
see what doesn't like just go over here
and go ahead and implement it all up and
looks like I missed name the file so we
shouldn't rename the file and very cool
so that should be working now so you
create our listener and then to use it
all we're going to do is set an on touch
listener for image view so I'm just
gonna do M main image dot set on touch
listener new on swipe touch listener
which is the one we just made is that
right on swipe listener yeah and then
we're passing in this and then
and then we're just going to add we're
going to override these public methods
right here okay import these we're just
passing in this main activity of this we
want main activity instead of my
activity delete that okay so we just
added a non touch listener to our main
image and then for now when we swipe to
the top we're just gonna make a toast
when you swipe to the right and make a
toast and for each direction we make a
toast so I'm just gonna restart the app
and then go see if our on swipe listener
is correctly working and then once we
get this working the next step is to
actually load a new image when we swipe
that direction so I'm gonna swipe up
says top cool now if I swipe down oops
this is bottom swipe to the right get
right swipe to the left I get left very
cool so we that's gonna be the end of
this video for now what we got working
is we got a basic little app going we
got our image view loading we got text
at the bottom in the top and then we
also got a swipe listener for our image
view so we can now detect which way the
users swiping and in the next video
we'll be loading in different images and
talking to the Oh a P I so thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
