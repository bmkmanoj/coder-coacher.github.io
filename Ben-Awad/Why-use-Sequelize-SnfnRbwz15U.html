run from Express sequel so let's say you
want to run a sequel mint from Express
how would you go about doing that what
are your options one option is to use
something called node Postgres core for
PG or that's acronym they use so is to
just run sequel from as you can imagine
and here's a little example what it
looks like you're just collect and you
just pass as a string write what you
sequel to run and it allows you to get
the data back of course and then you can
do stuff with it right and they have
this for languages so like if I want
there's probably if there's a Python
version of this elixir version there's a
ruby version or it just allows you pin
and that sequel will get run that is one
option and this is a decent option if
things complicated and you want to
really optimize your queries written
here but one thing you can do to speed
up development something what's called
an arm which is stands for object
relationship mapping and basically it'll
write the sequel for you pretty much
at least a lot of it for you in simple
the heavy lifting for you and there's
three my opinion for JavaScript at least
these of the that are JavaScript arms at
leisure using sequel and the first one
is called sequel eyes so as you can see
you're not actually writing sequel here
now you can do a query similar to this
for the most part you'll be doing stuff
like this like this where you're passing
in a JSON object I'll be building a
sequel career here sequel eyes does that
for me
so these are the guys that will actually
help you you know run your sequel fast
that's the one thing when you do sequel
eyes or you do any other own you're
losing performance this is going to give
you the because there's no overhead see
equalised does extra think you should
things happening but development speed
is important and that's why arms are
used that's actually equalized
over say something like this because
it's slow to write out all these queries
whereas eagle-eyes done and this is a
lot easier and more intuitive right
especially when stuff gets more
complicated but in the querying section
here there is a raw query okay I don't
know oh here it is raw queries where
even from sequel I is just a query like
this but for the most part it like this
and now I have you seek wise for
projects and that's what I'm using right
now to build the sequel statement and
run it on Postgres but other options
I've heard are good our next is and
bookshelf uses next under the hood but I
actually personally actually don't like
sequel next I'm using it but I don't
like it very much I think I picked it
first to try because it was the most
popular I want to switch over to trying
out next yes Mac looks pretty good this
is an arm as well and I think I might
maybe I'll try both bookshelves next I'm
not sure we'll try out but I definitely
not really happy with how sequel eyes
works I mean it's the job done right
it's not awful I'd say I am its medium
but honestly I'm also I want to try
doing this like just good writing like
this will be the most performance and I
like having keishon the only thing that
I don't know about when for example I
went I don't know where I would call
client end and client or when to open up
new connections and that sort of thing
like for example see equalizers handle
hood for you and I'm not too skilled on
how if I create I mean I assume you're
not making connection every request that
someone does your server but I'm not
sure when you should be creating
connections how many connections you
should make that sort of thing I
actually need decade myself on this and
get better at it because this is a very
important thing to learn and it's very
helpful with the performance of web
applications about how to do this so I
want to spend more just using it and
writing the raw queries myself but
you're a
it well this is good also if you want to
learn sequel as well sequel eyes next
they help you write Postgres sequel gets
database super fast development
experience is super fast better if you
want to spend more time and get better
performance this is of course more
customization you can do because I'm
sure sequel under the hood - but yeah
that's that's it for this video - how
you actually create V sequel statements
and Express these libraries here so if
you see people using these that's why
and these also work for not just
Postgres but some different databases my
see the sequel eyes works for some
different ones as well so eyes have any
questions about these feel free to leave
a comment below and yeah I'll see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
