UI form a little bit ago and if you were
one to see how I would add these columns
to a table so I'm going to show you guys
how to use the material UI table here
and we're going to submit a user and
you're going to come to this little
table here put a table and so so all
right now I'm capturing the JSON they're
typing right instead of RAM for a nice
big table down here using material ID
tables and populate the rows as I submit
stuff so I'm just going to come over
here to tell you I use their simple
example and we're just going to copy
this and we're going to make ours
differently of course but this is a good
starter template so we can copy alright
so here is the app Taj is the code for
this coat and the link in description
below if you want to follow along I'm
going to say table dachi is it just
paste this guy in and I'm just going to
go ahead and simplify this a little bit
the export default here alright so then
our app instead of doing app dot JSON
let's stringify I'm just going to have
that table down here and I'm gonna
import table below all right so let's
come take a look at what that looks like
all right so now I have our table
there's a couple things left to do now
first we need to be able you know type
and then hit submit and then put you pop
down here so to do this we're gonna have
to like fold previous values beat the
data into here so I think the first
thing we should do is make this table
dynamic so right now we have static data
right
instead we'll take two profs data and
header so header
I'm gonna assume is
come on your app over here say our
header is going to be just an array of
strings oops
so here I'm going to have what eat first
name last name username email password
so first name last name username
password and email so those are the four
headers and I'm also going to pass in
data right the data I'm going to pass in
is basically for now I'm just going to
pass in empty array but eventually what
we're going to pass and for data is an
array of objects in each object lies the
key first name last name user name email
and then we'll go ahead and populate
that in the table so yeah so then our
table here we're just going to actually
you know what in our app let's do
instead of making this array of this
let's make these objects
so let's I'm going to mid to distribute
I make this as a generic table so you
could be any type of data in so I'm
going to say name and prop is going to
be called first name the hours doing it
capital in okay so capitals in here so
this is going to be the name in the data
here's what we want the column header to
be and then we're going to do this all
the way down right so so name and you
guys will see why this is cool later
this is just going to make it so no
matter what your day looks like you
could reuse this grid and your or this
table in your application and it's great
to make components like this so you're
not duplicating code so user name
I just wish we didn't have so many
fields here all right
so name crops email and last one here
password alright alright so now our
header is complete and now in our table
here instead of just having static
column headers we're going to say header
with the object dot actually no headers
already in a read I would think I was
thinking Pettit was an object that
header is just an array I'm going to say
header map X comma I and I think it's
fine to use the index for the key and
here we go so we're going to save table
header and here we're just going to say
X dot name and we're going to give it a
key because we're doing a map of I all
right so that's good and then here we
can just comment out our table body
pretty much right now we do not need it
and I just want to show you guys the
rendering of the header so there we have
first-name lastname using email password
you might want to remove password if you
want to show you the table but why not
we'll show it for now since this is not
as issued as an example and then our app
over here so in our form we weari have
an on submit right so just uh prop the
on submit let's go ahead and do that and
we don't care about on change anymore
all we care about is when they submit so
on cement we get the piece of data that
we want so in our app instead of doing
on change we really just care about
on submit and we're going to say data or
we're going to say submission and we're
going to go ahead and just do set state
and we're going to say in our King we're
going to have data here which is an
array and we're going to say whenever we
get a submission data is going to be
equal to a newa are a thought thought
thought this thoughts state data and
then just adding our submission to that
so go ahead and say that so every time
we submit we add a new data element and
we don't have to rehear rid of on on
change their since we're not using that
alright so on submit we grab the
submission we set the state we add the
data we have before and in our new
submission and then we're just going to
feed data there's this thoughts state
data to our table now we have to handle
this right actually let's keep the
comment that way we know how to create
it so we're going to say data that map
um
and then here we're going to say X I
ideally you have an ID associated with X
but we don't that's okay and let's go
ahead and just put it up here so it's
simple so calm what row we'll call it
and it's going to take an X and I and
then we're going to put all our GS x
there so we're going to map a row and
then this is what our rows go look like
there we go and actually we're going to
need to pass in the headers so we know
how to how to do this right and what I
mean by how to do this is we actually
need the header has the prop so we don't
know what cropped access
max we have to grab it from the header
so we need to pass in sex comma a comma
header so we're going to map X comma I
we're gonna call row passing X I and
then header header we're grabbing here X
and I are getting from there so just a
little lambda function there and then
here we're going to say table row and
then we're going to do another mapping
so header map where we go through each
header and here we're going to say key
is equal to I we're looping through each
header we're going to grab the prop that
we need and then we're going to render
it with a table column so we're going to
say we'll call this Y then K and we can
go ahead and render it here that's fine
do not need to paste everything there we
go and so we're going to set the key
equal to K and Y so Y is going to be a
header so we want to say Y cross we give
us the property name and we're going to
say X and we're going to get the Y prop
and then we're going to show it also the
key we should make this unique right now
it's not so what we should be doing
something like table row column - then
our key here will be table row which
we'll call the table row - all right so
that's our keys and then this key will
say table header column K we'll header
column - dollar sign okay and like we're
all done here
I'll think I'm using keys anywhere else
come down here delete the comment and
let's see if we have any heirs I think
this looks pretty good though so let's
try submitting something Bob Bob Bob Bob
Bob hi guys I am forcing some stuff I
forgot what I'm enforcing using IV at
least five characters Caloocan Bobby and
we submitted this stuff props on change
is not a function that would be in our
form
I just forgot to get rid of this since
we're not we don't have a non change
function anymore
come back soon as the skin I don't think
it was a problem with us though yeah
this form okay so Bob Bob Bob email
password is broken but we got these
three so let's see why that is I'm
guessing it does not line up email
password what I call the prop email
password so let's go to the state and
see what the values are come here go to
react we can see the state of our
application so table here um she's teeth
data your script 12 one here so data
we're passing in passing an email first
name last name password we don't need
this error garbage we showed clean that
out but that's okay it's time to keep it
there maybe we want to show if there's
an error or something header first name
last name username I don't know fire to
the email so email oh we call this props
that should be crop that's why all right
now we have it complete so a ABC TSG
Oh shouldn't add validation would be so
much faster to add these all right so
now we can go ahead and add as many as
we want oh we don't even have to add a
pastor if you don't knew we could leave
it blank all right that's how you do it
guys so we can now submit make this fold
it longer there we go oh that's a little
bug did you guys see that so notice how
I submitted even though the validation
did not happen or even though we didn't
pass validation we still submitted
successfully real quick so that isn't a
reform here the reason for that is on
our onsubmit we are calling on submit
before we even validate so we should put
that down here right so we should clear
the form and then submit it well we
should submit and then clear the form
but we should only submit if there's not
an error right so that's a little silly
thing we had next but now we're all good
to go so that is how you do it guys
thanks for watching you have any
questions please feel free to comment
below because I know this code might
look a little confusing here right so
this is going to be up on github come
check it out we're just mapping a few
times or the bodies could be especially
confusing because we're mapping across
each data element and then inside of
here we're mapping across the header and
creating an each column you can just
think of it like we're mapping through
each row and then we're getting each one
of these we're mapping to create this
this but the cool thing about this is
it's very easy to now change what data
you pass it so if I just don't want to
show the password like I told you guys
like maybe you don't want to BAM I just
cut it off right and then everything
will reformat we now have for spread
across nicely and if I just come here I
can go ahead and submit and bam we're
good so it's easy to like manipulate
your data now with this header
crawl that's what I like about making
the data grid like this or the table not
cater grid so yeah thanks for watching
guys this video is over I'll see you
guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
