project with Prisma to see how it
actually works
when building something bigger and how
all the features come together when
using it so here's what I'm thinking
I'm gonna be creating a react native
application with this that's going to
basically be the view and it's going to
connect to our Prisma server
but I really want to focus on Prisma
itself and so I want to make the UI as
simple as possible so this is gonna be
an e com ecommerce application and
there's five things that I really want
to focus on at least with checking out
with Prisma and the first is how
authentication works so we're gonna be
setting up authentication with this
there's going to be these are my pages
right here so I want to have a register
page and then you log in and then we're
gonna have a product view where you just
see all the different products that you
can purchase and you can also from that
screen create your own product to start
selling and so we'll also create a form
where you can edit / create products and
then we're have a nice long list view
and now for these products I want to
also handle permissions for example you
can't edit someone else's product you
can only edit your own product and then
also image uploads so I want to be able
to upload an image from my react native
application to Prisma so I can see a
picture of the product and then we're
gonna be trying out typescript for the
server I'm not a big fan of typescript
with react so we're not gonna be doing
it for react native but I'm gonna give
it a try for Prisma and the last thing I
want to check out is pagination so
Prisma has pagination by default I
believe so we're gonna be using that
with our list view over here we're gonna
be able to sort filter the different
products and then also have it
infinitely scroll through the products
and in the background we'll be making
calls to Prisma so that's what the
series is going to be I'm going to be
starting it very soon
and we'll get a deeper understanding of
how Prisma works and this will kind of
lay the groundwork if you or anyone
wants to try to do a more advanced
Prisma project you now know how to do
all these things and have a good example
for them so that's all for this video
guys I'll see you soon when we get
started on this project
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
