trick to speed up your react
applications so if you're familiar with
react you know there's a couple ways to
make a component here's one way we're
using a class and this is just the basic
create react app template write the
application here and they're just using
extending a component and this is a
class component but there's another way
you can create a function so for example
Bob over here is a function and he can
render some JSX
like h1 I now there's a difference in
how these two work or this guy can't
have this guy can't have lifecycle
functions or state right so an app you
have state and maybe component did mount
and some functions that you need but if
you don't need those things it's better
to use just a function like this but
right now fire to render Bob like this
so there's a slight overhead in creating
a component like this like this class
because it has to render create the
object for the component but under the
hood right now this guy right here does
the same thing there's still a slight
overhead and now this is something where
I believe react wants to change in the
future and optimize how these functions
work now they're already optimized
because they don't worry about state and
stuff but further optimize them and not
have to create a component but I believe
right now they're creating a component
under the hood so when I do this there's
a way to speed up faster to just using a
component like this but I'm sure this is
what you're used to using and you'll see
me use this a lot right we can just
treat this like a regular component and
let's say I wanted you know some text
here I can just pass the tab
and render that like that it's like it'd
be like text is equal to hi and this
this all looks fine and good but what
you can do to speed this up is to
actually instead of rendering Bob as a
JSX tag like that you can just call them
as a function so I can be like Bob and I
can just pass parameters in because it's
just a function right so I can say text
is equal to hi and so what this will do
is it'll crack it'll just call a
function right and it'll return app will
just return the JSX and so this is
actually more performant performant
currently than what you just saw this
guy so if you're having performance
problems give this a try and see if that
helps speed up your react application
but here we are talking about optimizing
and I have to show you guys a quote that
I really like and this is by Donald I
believe it's enough there Knuth I don't
know how to say his last name but he
says premature optimization is the root
of all evil or at least most of it in
program and I entirely agree with this
99% of the time you don't need to
optimize your code and you don't need to
optimize this but it's definitely
something to look at and for example you
what you you haven't seen me doing this
and the reason for that is a lot of
times it doesn't matter I like the speed
increase unless I'm working on something
that's really performance intensive if
it's five ten percent slower it's not
that big of a deal and another reason I
would just use this version right now is
what happens if I want to change Bob
into a class right okay I need to use
state and Bob now I'm gonna term into a
class so everywhere I use Bob now I have
to change it from a function back to a
component so basically I'm not even
using this right now but something to
look at if you need to increase
performance and
but this is something I actually think
about a lot because I am definitely
proved over optimizing that's one of my
biggest weaknesses I think in
programming it's all spent way too much
time optimizing things that don't matter
at all and I am sure some of you are
like this too and I I think about this a
lot and I really try not to get too up
into optimization until it matters right
so until there's problems with
performance until it's noticeably laggy
noticeably things are going wrong then
it's time to look into it and prove it
but this is something I've been learning
instead of just perfecting and tuning
one thing and too-perfect move on to
other things get everything working
together and decent optimization right
you're not just making slow code but get
it to a point where it's good but not as
fat maybe you're not making it as fast
as it could be because it takes longer
to do that and so using your time so
you're not just optimizing everything
very important and this is something to
keep in mind when thinking about whether
to use these two methods so that's it
for this video guys I hope that was
something you can try out in your
application see if that speeds it up for
you personally and I've actually never
ever even had to use this because I've
never had performance problems with
react so far but I have heard it's
supposed to speed it up and make sense
because this guy's creating a there's a
little extra overhead in him compared to
this guy but again check react google
lists see at the time you're watching
this it might have changed react might
have made some changes that change
whether or not this affects things but
that's it for this video guys thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
