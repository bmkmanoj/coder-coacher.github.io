subscriptions right now for real-time
messaging so I can chat with other users
that are online and in the same channel
so I can send a message and they don't
have to refresh their screen it just
pops up over here now to do this we're
using the default pub/sub implementation
well this is great for development it is
not recommended for production this is
the Apollo graph QL page and they say
any serious production app should not be
using just regular pub/sub and instead
should be using either Redis or MQTT so
in today's video i'm going to do is walk
you through setting up Redis pub/sub so
you're ready to do graph QL
subscriptions in production if you like
to now before we get into that real
quick we're gonna fix a small problem we
had in the last video where we would
crash when changing two different pages
so here I was pushing after after we
created a direct message or started
direct messaging someone and the reason
for that I found out was me would
sometimes go undefined just for a second
so all we have to do oops is here we
return null if me is not defined so if
we're loading or if this is not
available now for whatever reason when
we switch pages me is undefined for a
split second and then it is good I don't
know why but it is what it is and that's
how we can protect against that so now I
can click Bob for I'm currently in
hashtag general and if I click start
messaging I see Bob for over here now
you notice we have a little warning
messages about updating when mounting
that's because if we come back to our
modal over here we have this stuff here
so if I get rid of the on clothes and
stuff we don't need it because we're
going to be rear-ending the page anyway
and those components get unmounted okay
so now I can click on this and let's say
I want to see Bob - and Bob for start
messaging them I pop over there to that
screen and I can even do this with
someone I've never messes before so Bob
3 I've never messaged so come over here
start messaging Bob 3 we pop up and what
I like hey Bob 3 so there you go that's
all we need to do to fix that if you
know why this is going undefined
I'd love to know I'm curious I'm not
sure why because it should just grab it
from the cache which it does do after
another render I'm not sure why there's
an a middle render where it's undefined
but anyway I want to also get rid of
this little warning message we have
right here someone gave a comment on how
to get rid of this so thank you we just
have to go to our add Channel modal and
instead of using value for this checkbox
they use the prop called checked so give
that a refresh and that air should go
away and now we're ready to start
setting up Redis yep cool so that's good
and if I open this cool so to get this
set up first you'd have Redis installed
on your computer so if you don't come
over to reddest IO and install it you're
gonna want the server itself and I have
the CLI if you want to grab the CLI -
and yeah so make sure you install that
and we can get started next we'll be
using this package over here graph QL
Redis subscriptions and so if you want
to make sure you have Redis installed
you can just come over here and just say
Redis COI
this will you have to first start your
server so if you did write a server you
can run write a server like this I rehab
my running because I download it with
homebrew and I said brew services start
Redis so I have it running in the
background so either of those work and
then once you have it started up I'll
clear this you can do Redis CLI and if
you're able to connect and you see this
that means you're good to go and you can
just ping it to make sure it's working
and if you see pong there everything
good so once you have written stalled
and you're at this screen with me you
can go ahead and get started take note
of what this is and this guy cuz we're
gonna need those in a second now on your
server we need to install this guy our
graph QL Redis subscriptions so I'm just
gonna copy that
oops and yarn it so yarn add and then
all we have to do is come on over to our
server and change our pub/sub
implementation so we have a pub sub KS
file right now we're grabbing pub sub
from graph QL subscriptions instead of
doing that we're gonna be using this
right here graph QL Redis subscriptions
now this is the for development they
said you could just use this but for
production they recommend passing in
your own Redis object so notice how they
create a new Redis object for you here
using the IO Redis library by default I
believe they do that under the hood
anyway so we're just gonna use this one
but if you were putting this into
production make sure you do switch over
to using this but I believe it's roughly
the same thing but if you wanted to do
another Redis client maybe that's why
they use this option so paste this in
here and we can delete what we have
before so we're importing the rightest
pub/sub and we're gonna export it to so
export default and then here our domain
name oops
that's just what you saw over here so
one two seven the singing
and then there port number is this thing
so that's mine and it'll probably be the
same for you and then here is just the
retry strategy I'm just gonna keep the
default one and give that a save and a
comma there and well two of you got
going wrong did I delete one too many
things no I feel like something is sing
connection strat all right I'm just
gonna try reformatting this why is it
getting a NER okay so this lines up here
oh we should we have one too many area
and get rid of dangling comma cool so
now we're good we don't actually have to
make any other changes let's make sure
this thing restarts awesome notice we
don't have to make any changes to how we
did subscriptions before it's just gonna
start using Redis and we're good so come
back over here I'll just refresh both of
these for good measure and we don't see
any errors here so let's go back to
general and check this message is subbed
by Redis and BAM Bogg 2 over here is
seeing our message and we can just
message all we want now so now we're
serving these subscriptions using Redis
instead of the default pub/sub
implementation awesome so that's it for
this video guys as you can see it's
actually quite easy to set up with Redis
which is really nice so you don't have
to change a lot of your code and you're
ready for production subscriptions so
that is it for this video guys thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
