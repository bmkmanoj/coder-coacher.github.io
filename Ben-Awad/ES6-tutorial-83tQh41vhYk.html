the newer JavaScript features a lot of
these are es6 and it'll be really
helpful for you if you're trying to get
into react view or angular pretty much
any of the front-end frameworks you'll
see it code like this now this isn't
meant to be a comprehensive guide but
more what I use the most when I'm coding
react and what I think is most important
and you'll use the most yourself now to
help me out with this I'm using a
plug-in called coca and what that does
is just evaluates my JavaScript code as
I write it so you're gonna see up
throughout this off to the right is
going to be like the little blue thing
and that's gonna be basically the
evaluate JavaScript code but we'll get
more to that in a second and so if you
want to follow along you can download
this plug-in but let's get started with
this so first off the variables are a
little bit different so if you've done
vanilla JavaScript it looks like this
you use var you pay the name of your
variable and now there is constant let
and I actually don't use var at all I
only use constant lat
so what are the differences well with
constants you can't reassign so Joe I
can't set him to 9 for example zenit
telling me an air assignment to constant
variable doesn't let me but with let I
can so tom is equal to 9 and now I can
see Tom and the value when you get rid
of Joe since Joe doesn't work now you
can see the value of Tom is 9 and so one
would use cons for well if you need
to reassign it you most of the time
how I do it this is a little
controversial statement I use
Constable's and then whenever I need I
basically I get an error or I need to
reassign I'll then use left I never use
var anymore at our bar anymore at all
and I'd recommend not using it okay next
up is functions so functions used to
look something like this this is me
assigning a function to a variable at
and so use the function keyword here
your parameters and then you curly
braces and then you return so this is an
ab function adds the first two
parameters
be and so we're taking 1 &amp;amp; 2 adding and
we get 3 right make sense it looks cool
so now there's a new syntax you can use
with it it's called an arrow function so
you'll notice it's very similar to
what's up here
new ad works exactly the same way we can
also console out log the addition of new
ad and we will get 3 just like we did up
here so the difference is instead of
saying the word function we put our
parameter list first and then we do an
arrow and then curly braces now there's
a little thing you can do extra so
notice how we don't have other stuff
here like maybe I'm gonna say can't see
is equal to a plus B and then I return C
or I do some other stuff right you can
have more stuff here that's fine if
you're using curly braces but right now
since we're only doing one line right we
only have a plus B here there's actually
a shortcut you can do where you just say
you get rid of the curly braces in the
return statement and you just return
that right away so this is what it looks
like here's new add 2 and we can
console.log that show you guys it's the
exact same so you get 3 and so we just
pass in our parameter list our arrow so
instead of wrapping this with clearly
bases returned like this right we can
just eliminate those and it's assumed
whatever the value of this is is going
to be returned from this function now I
usually this is really nice and is good
for shorthand functions that are in line
and you want to past other functions
which I'll talk about in a second and so
the differentiate between these two I
use this whenever I can
but if I need to do more than a
one-liner function then I use curly
braces and I can put more stuff before I
return also here's another shorthand if
you only have one parameter you do not
have to put curly braces they're not
creative parentheses I mean so I can put
them if I want to write I can say X is
equal to X plus 5 or I can just remove
them
and just have X so this function takes
one parameter and adds five to it so
that's optional put curly braces around
it so here is an example of where you
use functions like this it's really
handy all these above i've assigning
functions to a variable but you can also
just use them to pass to other functions
so for example I have nums here which is
an array of 1 2 3 and then here I map
through the array and then for each
element I pass in you know I apply this
function so this function takes one
parameter and it says X plus 5 so here
we are just adding 8 sorry not plus 5
plus 8 so we're adding 8 each number and
we get 9 10 11 from adding this so
that's is much better to when you know
you used to you might be like map and
then you actually type function in here
a B I guess you don't do a B you just
have X right so here's the equivalent
like that so you take the function
inside of here and oops don't do error
functions and we can console.log that
and you get the same value so these two
are equivalent right but instead of
using word function we can shorthand
arrow which is really nice I love that
all right and actually we can keep that
we don't need to delete it all right
next is default values and functions so
now you can have so right look we have
this equal five thing so before I just
had X by itself but now you can have a
default value so here I called multi
without a value so see how it defaulted
to 5 here so 5 times 2 is 10 so when I
called multi with no parameters I got 10
and I can also call it you know passing
in a 5 I get the same thing or I can
call multi and actually pass in a 4 and
now it's equal to 8 and now this is not
restricted to just one parameter right I
could have Y as is another parameter and
this could be equal to 10 right I guess
that a default value there and I could
just add Y so all of these did not have
Y right as the second parameter so it
defaulted to 10 you can also don't have
to default it right I can only have a
default for X and now these are all not
numbers because Y was undefined so you
can have defaults in your functions now
very nice and handy next is the spread
operator this is a new thing in
JavaScript actually a notation thingy
and so I can do dot dot dot places and
it does different things the first thing
is in a function so here's another
function and I did dot dot dot a and
maybe a better way to say this is doc
our works so what this does is it grabs
all the arguments and it's put it into
an array so notice how usually when you
call join if you know what join does why
don't we actually just console.log what
join does real quick so if I have one
two three and I call join on it
I had a space what it will do is it will
just concatenate this list into a string
and it'll put spaces in between so 1 2 3
so my join me function here I'm passing
it so he was me calling it I'm actually
calling it with arguments right so the
first argument is 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 I'm not
passing in an array but because I use
this dot syntax here what the dot syntax
does is it puts it into an array for me
so I can grab all the arguments and this
basically passed to my function and it's
given to me an array so that's why join
me instead of passing an array like this
right I'm just can pass them in like
this and then it'll have as array and
I'm joining in now this grabs all the
remaining arguments so I can have an
argument out in front like first and so
now see how it's just 2 and hey because
the first is now equal to 1 so I could
say first and I can add a space or maybe
I want to put a dash so see how first is
back and it's 1 - so I can also you know
do this as many times as I want so
here's second so now I got rid of - 2 is
being stored in this parameter and I'm
not using this parameter anywhere so
let's stop that thought in functions
next over here we have you can actually
use it when calling a function so here
is a sub function and I just want to
subtract a and B and here's array 5 and
3 so I want to subtract 5 and 3 so one
way to do it is I can grab the first
value in the second value right and pass
it into sub and it'll subtract them but
I can also basically expand the array so
here we have there a 5 comma 3 so when I
do array or dot dot dot array and
calling the function sub it takes these
and just this is gonna be the first
argument this gonna be a second argument
passed to the function so if you were to
unravel this
it's like I call it did five three right
with this dot that dot it's like I took
the Ray value zero and Ray value one and
see how they're both getting two so
that's when you basically you have an
array and you want to pass each value in
as parameters not the Ray as a whole
that makes sense
next area you can use this spread
operator is when you want to basically
create new arrays so here's a new array
here so I have nine comma dot dot dot
array and what this does you can see the
value of new array and this might make
sense so now the new value is nine comma
5 comma 3 so it took all the values that
was in our original array and basically
just put it here so we have nine comma
three now I'm not restricted I can do
this as many times as I want so I could
do dot array again and now notice how
five three five three we have it twice
and I could also put it in front dot dot
dot array and now I have a five three in
front so all that's doing is it's taking
the value of this array which we know is
five comma three and putting it in here
and this is really handy for creating
new arrays I guess we'll keep that okay
next thing is with objects so here I
have a color map blue maps thread pink
maps to yellow and I can create a new
object so here's me just creating a
brand new object that's the exact same
right blue stir red pink sea yellow so
these are equivalent right now and you
can do the same thing with arrays right
so I could say consignee array 2 is
equal to dot dot array
and it's basically just creating a new
copy of array it has all the same values
in it five comma three so I'm doing the
same thing with this object here and the
reason why you might do this is you want
to keep all the same values that are up
here and add another so like I might
want to say black maps to light blue and
now I have black blue pink yellow right
I have all my mappings plus this extra
one so there's some special things with
this too so what happens if say I add
blue here right and I already have blue
up here so let's say blue I wanted to do
I actually wanted to map it - I don't
know white notice how nothing happened
blue still goes to red the reason for
that is this overwrites the blue up here
so that's very important and you can
also do this multiple times as well so I
could have da-da-da color map and now I
am spreading it twice but nothing will
happen right because they overwrite each
other but what I can do is I can move
blue below color map and when I move
blue below color map I can now overwrite
whatever is in color map up here so you
can think of just this dumps the values
of whatever is an actual object so here
that's how you would overwrite a value
with Dogbot spread so we have blue is
now equal to white so that's pretty cool
and I use this a ton I really like
spread operator and I use it with arrays
in objects all the time objects use it
the most and important with this
overriding thing make sure you know when
stuff is getting override and when stuff
isn't okay next thing is string
templates these are nice as well so
normally you might concatenate a string
like this so we have first name last
name and if I want name together I'll do
first name space last name like this and
I'll just do plus signs in between and
we get Bob space cool now the new way to
do this is with backticks
so I can say Kant's new name and in here
I have my string template is going to be
backticks so up here I didn't I didn't
do back ticks right I have just
quotations and stuff but I can have back
tick and here I can put string stuff so
I am a string so anything I type there
it just renders it as a string here but
notice how I put dollar sign curly
braces and I can evaluate JavaScript
variables so that's how I just add a
space these are equivalent statements up
here and I can do other things in here
like oops five plus seven so twelve
space cool is now equal to what new name
is I can keep it to first name if I want
to and I can put a dash in between so
it's how you create new strings and
passenger off-script variables and stuff
all right next is creating new objects
so this is how you would create new
objects that have the same property name
so you would say first name so this is
your key and your value is first name
right so Bob so now we see first names
Bob but last name is cool but this is
you know it's annoying after I write the
same thing twice so there's a shortcut
now you just have to type first name and
you notice how we don't specify the key
and the value
we just have one thing so when there's
one thing it interprets the name of this
thing as the key and then whatever the
value is it grabs from the variable so
see how these these are equivalent
statements right so first name is equal
to the first name variable it grabs in
does it automatically it's very nice
it's a little bit of a shorthand the
next thing is what if I want actual
string right so here I actually the key
is called first name but what if I don't
want the key to be first name what if I
want the key to be Bob well here's an
example of that you have to use brackets
around it so first name I am a first
name all right we have that key is first
name values I am a first name that makes
sense and then here I did brackets which
gets the value of first name which is
Bob so that's why the key is Bob and we
see I am Bob
so this grabs the actual value of first
name versus just calling it first name
here and you can also write we can see
you can mix these things now okay well
I'm mixing it but notice how this is
getting overwritten again so if we put
it below we see first name and we get
Bob there okay and I'll get rid of that
next is functions soaps so functions
inside of objects there's a couple ways
you can do this I tend to do it mostly
like this but you don't have to so here
this is kind of how I was doing it
inside of the map so this is our
shorthand arrow functions so the
property a is equal to that but you can
also do a function like this and these
guys are equivalent
now notice too you can't really
shorthand the return statement here so
that's why you see curly braces return
but notice how I didn't have to do a
right so this is shorthand for that so
instead of typing colon function I don't
have to do that I can just say B and
here's me calling the functions they
both give me an eight all right but most
of the time I end up just using this
because it ends up being shorter most of
the time right this is shorter than this
so I'll usually just use arrow functions
because those are my favorite all right
D structuring this is really sweet this
is one of my favorite things about
functional programming languages and I'm
glad they started adding some support
and JavaScript so here I just have an
array called alpha that we can run stuff
on and this is me getting the first and
second value of alpha so look at me
console logging first and second it's
equal to a and B so this is kind of
weird right so I'm currently D
structuring an array so in destruction
your array you put brackets around like
this and then you can grab values like
this this is the first value second
value if you get the third could get the
fourth and so this variable name is now
I can use and the other thing I can do
is spread operator in here so I can say
dot dot dot other or arrest for example
so what is rest equal to check out that
that rest is now an array and it has all
the other values so it's like I popped a
off put it inside of this variable
called first and then I pop the I just
grabbed the rest of this bundled it into
an array and I put it into rest so
that's what the spread operator does in
conjunction with this which is really
cool and I'm not limited to this I can
do a second third right and notice how
I'm popping each value off and I can get
second here is now equal to B and my
third of course oops it's gonna be C so
that's how you do D structure and array
and you're not limited to destruction
just arrays you can also do objects
which is really fun so here's an object
that I made a little person dude age
height weight so let's say I want to get
the age of someone and I want to store
that in a variable so you might say
const age is equal to object age so
instead of typing this because it's
redundant see how i say age here and age
here i can do it like this and the
reason I had that commented out is
because notice how I have age here and
age here named conflict someone calm at
this kid out okay so const age so how
does it know what you know what is this
doing so notice how my age is five ages
five here so what this does is i want to
destructor an object when d structuring
an object i have to use curly braces
like so and I'm grabbing the age value
out of this object now I'm not limited
to just grabbing one value I can also
get hyped for example so height
it's 60 I could also get weight here so
wait and now the name needs to match
what we have up here
and I can also say dot dot you know
other for example or what do you know
whatever want to call it and what others
gonna be is all the other properties
that we didn't choose so this is me
grabbing age out so it just like with an
array it's like I pop the age out of
this object and rather there's left is
height and weight and now I can do stuff
with the rest of that object if I want
to and again you can grab the weight out
of here so if I grab the weight now only
height is left and if I grab all the
properties out others just going to be
an empty object and there's gonna be
nothing left well this is really cool
when I use this a lot now you just saw
me have to comment these out so
sometimes there's gonna be naming
conflicts when grabbing the name out of
this object so you can rename it with a
colon so this is me renaming age to
bacon so I'm getting the aged property
out of object and then renaming it to
bacon and then bacon is equal to five
which is our thing
and again you can do this as many times
as you want so height and maybe I want
to call this I don't know SDF and we can
render a SDF there and a high oh i
misspelled it a SDF there we go so
that's 60 so we're grabbing the height
out of the object and let's just get rid
of that so you can do that as many times
as you want and here is me setting
default values so like functions when we
could set default values you can also
set default values for objects so I
don't have an a yogurt property in my
object and here's me trying to D
structure yogurt out of object and high
here I set a default value of blueberry
now if I were to get rid of that and so
here's the value of yogurt it is equal
to blueberry if I were to get rid of
this equal sign oops
you see it's now undefined because it's
not inside of our object so I can mix
and match this so I can grab the age
maybe from this guy and I can rename
that to bacon too and a cool thing to
note you can also rename so let's try
you guys that I can rename this to just
Y so Y is gonna be undefined right but I
can also set a default value so I can
rename and put a default value so Y is
now equal to five which is really handy
when you're not sure if a property is an
object or not alright so next thing is D
structuring inside of functions which is
really fun so here's how you might a to
string function for an object so here's
my person object same dude we have up
here and I'm passing an object and it
does 5 - 60 - 180 so here we're using
the template we're saying person to age
person about height person not weight
right so we're having each property and
displaying it here but we could do
structure it like we're doing here now
notice we don't say Const out in front
when we're doing this so this is a two
string - notice how we're getting the
same value from our object 5 - 60 - 180
and we can just destructor so the first
parameter here right is our object and
so we're destructuring the first one and
you can have more parameters like per am
- and I don't know what you know maybe
we just stick pram - at the end here
Quran - pram truce undefined currently
you can set a default value of ten so
now I have ten at the end and my second
D value at the end here is gonna be
hello so now we have five 6180 hello at
the end so I'm D structuring the first
parameter and then my second parameter
I'm not destructuring so this is
important this guy Maps here this guy
maps here so from object I'm getting
three parameters
the age the height the weight which is
really cool so instead of doing person
that age person I hire person not wait
eye candy structure him inside the
function and same thing counts for you
know and by the way you can do the same
kind of restructuring with the dot dot
stuff we are doing above as well same
thing with a race
so here's grab first function so this is
grabbing just the first value in an
array so grab first and then I'm
returning a one because it's the first
value here and I could again do with the
spread operator dot dot dot rest and I
could just return rest from that if I
wanted to and that grabs two three
instead of first and it's popping off
the one cuz that's in our first
parameter okay next is these structuring
with deeply nested so you can just
basically keep d structuring things and
just go on so again we're gonna be
working with our object that we did
above age height weight so this is me
creating a nested object so i have a
property called one which is an object
and I spread object so it has an age
height and weight and then there's
another property called two which also
has the object and now notice how I did
dot data object I could have also just
said object like that those two
statements were equivalent so what's
actually to simplify it to this so it's
not confusing okay so I have one and
then inside of one I have two and they
have all these basically it's an object
inside of an object so this is me
unraveling the first layer so nested
object here's I got one out of it so 1
is equal to age height weight all that
junk so now what happens if I want to
get the age I can say age and here I'm
gonna rename this to what's a variable I
haven't used the variable Q I don't
think so Q what the heck is q equal to q
is equal to five so notice what we just
did there we got into one and then one
was an object so ID structured him
and then I got the age and then I
renamed him to Q so that's why I got
five here now I can D structure again so
I could say two and now I could get the
age oops
and I could reassign that to Q so this
is me D structuring twice so you can
basically D structure them as many times
as you want right so that's really cool
and now this comes up less often because
you don't usually have to me nested deep
objects but that does happen a decent
amount of time so it's good to know the
other thing is I could just be like you
know I could say 1 is equal to nested
object and then I could then D structure
1 so let's put that up here I can then
have Const 2 is equal to 1 so I D
structured 1 now 1 is an object I can D
structure 2 so you can do it you can do
structure in steps like this too if you
wanted to and now this is me getting the
height which will say is T will get it
from that and get 60 so you can do it in
steps as well this is us doing it and
like one blow now we did we got the age
value instead of height but same thing
okay and you can also do this with
arrays this is really handy so let's say
we have an array here the first value is
an object like this so I have array
object is first value age five sixty
eighty one eighty right I can grab the
first value in the array and I can be
structure it so this is me getting the
height of the first object so pretty
cool I can say five six
okay they say da rest of array rest ray
alright so that I combined it so I D
structured here and I use the spread
operator to get the rest of the array
there so you can get some really wonky
looking complex statements where your D
structuring spreading things and it does
get some taking use too but once you get
used to it it's actually really fun and
really nice don't let this and don't let
the nested D structure you scare you you
don't have to do this right the
equivalent statement is doing like
object dot object array zero and by the
way you could do structure it like this
right height h2 so this is us getting
the these two are this is equivalent
getting the H this is h2 so this is
meeting the first value then grabbing
that so there's multiple ways you can do
this it's pretty much up to preference
well that's it for this video guys I
hope that was helpful and you got sound
some tips on some of this new syntax it
does something get some taking use to
but hopefully you'll enjoy it like I do
once you get it down now I'm gonna be
putting up this code on github if you
want to check it out run through this
example yourself and stay tuned for
tomorrow I'm gonna be going over some
async/await
and how you do asynchronous code that's
it thank you guys for watching
