to be setting up the front end which is
going to be built and react so the first
thing what you guys to do is to open up
terminal and we're going to need to
clone a repository so the policy that
we're going to be cloning is this react
template that i created this has a bunch
of boilerplate for redux and some other
libraries so it sets it up when I worry
about that and we just focus on the
sockets and how those are working so go
ahead and run that I rate cloned it once
you clone it you're just going to want
to move inside of it and do MPM install
I install already because it takes a
little while this one's all the
dependencies and there's a few extra
ones that will need for this project and
I'll put this in the description below
if you want to just copy and paste these
this mpm line which we will be using
those libraries for all right but I very
installed them once you have all that
you should just come over to if you
start that up you'll should see a screen
that looks similar to this so if you
wanted to start up a server with NPM
start in the background after you didn't
install and make sure they all work I
recommend that okay so the next thing we
want to do is we're going to first
configure the store so just go to the
source and then the store is and we're
just going to import a few things so
we're going to use super agent and we're
going to be using feathers there's
client we're going to be using web
sockets of course poor IO from socket
i/o client and last import is going to
be the REST API
funny enough they do not let you
configure a socket and a restful
feathers application so we're gonna have
to make two different basically feathers
objects but both are going to be
connecting to the same host the host is
where your server is set up so our
servers at localhost 3030 that's the
default port if yours is a different one
you can change that up to wherever you
have your feather server and then we're
going to create an a rest app which is
equal to feathers and configure and we
should you rest passing the host got
super agent passing in super agent then
we're just going to configure hooks so
they're just I looks okay and then we're
just going to create a service item
service is equal to rest app dot curve
asst pressing in items this is the item
service that we set up in our back-end
server in the last video and this allows
us to use it in the client side and
we're just going to pass this into the
middle where I don't service and you'll
see we'll use this in our saga and later
videos and then the other thing we need
to set up is actually our socket this
this right here was just for the rest
for making restful calls and you'll see
the difference later so for sockets
we're going to do the same thing korea
feathers object we're just going to
configure it a little bit differently
and notice also i'm exporting this very
important we're going to be using this
and another file so socket i/o io
passing the host configure and
and feathers dot talks okay so we have
both the configuration for our feathers
client for the rest in the sockets the
rest allows us to make post requests get
requests to the server well the socket
allows us to get real-time information
which we're going to be using both in
this application okay so that kind of
configures our feathers client now we
want to go into the components and in
the main file we're just going to
initialize our sockets so first actually
let's import our socket app from store
and then we're just going to do
component oil amount this is a function
that react automatically calls when a
component is shown on the screen or is
mounted to the Dom so first we're going
to create a item service from the socket
app just like we saw me do for the rest
this time with the item service we're
going to start listening for with
sockets so to start listening you say on
and then you say what kind of event you
want to listen for and we'd like the
listed were created and when a new item
is created what would we like to do with
it we're going to create a function
called created item and we'll pass in
the item in the next video we'll set up
the function for this and we're going to
do two more we're going to also do
removed and update it and we're going to
remove item and updated
updated item okay so already we have our
client set up to listen for sockets so
whenever a item in our other server is
created removed or updated it will call
this function that we created right here
in the next video we will set up these
three functions and more to actually
start doing stuff once we get something
from our sockets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
