and redux saga and a cool little trick
to make this easier so here is my sagas
right here and as you can see I'm just
saying export default my function here
and it's listening for this action here
but let's say Melissa for another one so
I'm going to copy this so want to say
you know we'll just and maybe will some
action right so I have a thing and what
I want to do or second saga here
analysis but we can only D if you only
export one function at a time so how do
we actually support this so redux toggle
is even for multiple sagas at once using
the all and the tools and how this works
is you'll have a routes up a export
default we're going to create a function
generator function it's going to i'm
going to call it route saw guide we're
going to put all our sagas in it and
we're going to say yield all turay and
the array here is just your and we have
to fork them so we're going to say my
saga fork my saga to get rid of export
default here okay so now this route saga
this routes all it's doing is it's now
able to listen for my saga and my saga
too so that way action is called this
function will get called if this action
is called being listened that's how we
do so we're using all and fo one thing
that it's pretty handy that maybe you
have a lot of sagas is you come out
right so having a sagas folder i'll put
my sagas in here i would like to have
maybe a bit broken out between my users
and maybe i have and i know these are
just random things like to organize
maybe i'll put all my accounts all goes
in one and all my other sagas i'll use
so let's say i want so those are my
sagas let's copy the imports - so that's
my saga
here my you use the counts obvious it is
paces and and also I need to keep their
word statement at the top because this
page uses fork my saga to sorry all in
mirror those okay so what I want to do
is all this kind of like the index of
sagas and I want to import my Agha oops
and I want to import my youth and my
account Saugus right so let me use your
sagas what I'll do I get rid of all and
fork is I'll now export the Saugus
export my saga to and my saga and then
maybe in accounts I mean you know let's
change the site here it'll just all go
one and notice how we're doing exports
so we can have both of these users so
these are both getting exported and then
over here we have our ik so this is
account saga one and export account saga
to having these two files and what I
could do is I could go user saga one
user saga to from users and I can do the
same thing for account right so account
so and to and I could fork off each one
like this right you use your socket to
for accounts I'll go one account so I'll
go to this all this would work actually
don't notes will see it so module it
doesn't like and you just want to be
missing the file reason for that is we
turn this into the thing and run okay
we're about to find out but the great
descent I mean it is perfectly fine the
from the code will work but from a
developer point of view psych have to
import all these things twice it feels
like all I do forking off each one and
as you get more sagas let's say we have
here these audios but like three we have
three more files right maybe a
taxes or something else you know as your
sagas grow you're going to have this
massive for I like to actually do is
instead of doing this and let's see if
the scat oh that my paths got messed up
build to pass so this needs to be dot
dot because it needs to go up same with
this guy folder what we're going to say
is now instead of doing to you an
equivalent that is a lot less Kabul
instead of importing it like this
importing then naming it user so what
this will do is you now have an object
with all the sagas are all the exports
from user and I can do the same thing
but you can say star as account so now
this will look something like its enemy
not it's been another user we're
exporting user saga one one of the key
one and it'll be our function right and
I'll have what we're in it so what we
want is we really want to fork all right
so what we can do even there is we can
say we can copy this is instead of
calling fork on each one of these is we
can get all the values off sagas by
calling object on users augo's of all
the functions here and we can expand
this so it's all the functions and user
sagas on a call map on fork so it's
going to get all the functions that we
have in users it's going to and it's
going to call all so that's the same
thing as this right these all go one
user saga to we put it here then we
called for Connor and so I can just
paste this and we're going to do the
same as and bam
so as you can Gill's a lot better than
this when you get more sagas because
that he'll this is a lot easier to type
right so this function this is a little
tip I like to use when creating a route
saga and have it do that way so well
it's common terms the bad way
inefficient way
because the code will work this is just
a little bit nicer on the developer so
okay so as you can see Phil renders it
doesn't break your code and that's what
go on so yeah that's what I recommend so
work is what you need right here to
Magos and I recommend this method if you
want to spread out files this is just a
nice way to handle it guys thanks for
watching hope that helps
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
