docker and I found these two cool tools
that I wanted to do some short videos
today and tomorrow just highlighting
them and thought you guys might get some
value out of this as well if you're not
using them so the first one is called
port caner and first let me show you the
problem it's solving so usually when I'm
doing stuff with docker it'll be I'm
looking at the logs I want to kill a
container so I'll first list the wall of
my containers it'll be right alright so
I have this Prisma container running
let's take a look at the ID I'll copy it
and I'll be like docker container logs
and I'll print out the logs alright cool
i see all this junk for my Prisma server
I'm like alright I'm gonna take a look
at the logs for my other thing so I'll
do docker container LS again I'll come
over here and I'll look at this other
one here's my sequence tense and I'll be
like docker container vlogs or I might
then want to be like alright something
looks wrong with this let's turn it off
so then I'm like all right it's pull
that up and we'll do container and I'll
kill the container or I'll stop it and I
just found like I was typing a lot and I
was constantly just doing docker
container LS and it didn't seem like a
really good way to do it so what I
wanted to do was find maybe a UI or a
dashboards type of thing that would help
me solve this problem and basically do
docker stuff easier and that's where I
found port ainur pretty popular it looks
like with 7k stars and it runs in docker
so you set this up and it's actually
just a little website you visit and then
you can manage your docker containers so
to get this set up you run a command and
I think it's on their website but I'll
show you guys the command right here
docker
we can just go up a little bit I just
ran this guy so here it is right here
I'll put a link in the description below
if you want to try running this as well
umm and I had to have a little bug in
this so I made a folder called port
caner so the only thing is you have to
bind a volume that's this thing right
here
so I made a folder called pertain err in
this folder and that's from storing all
the data that this uses but I'm starting
it on port 9000 and then notice you have
to also give it access to the docker
socket because it's gonna be doing
things so I really have it running as
you saw my dad docker container LS you
could see this guy right here started
started two hours ago and this is what
it looks like when you start it up you
first have to create an account and get
it running but it's a really nice
dashboard I just was like I didn't even
realize how many features there wasn't
docker and the only things I've really
been using though is the images and the
containers one the rest of it I'm not
really getting into yet but I just
started using this tool so I'm sure
there's a lot to do I definitely don't
know enough to really do a full tutorial
on this yet but maybe later when I get
better at it but I just noticed some
interesting stuff while doing this I
just have like some old containers that
are just kind of sitting around that I
could probably delete and this is much
easier to try to delete I just click on
the little checkboxes and Mike alright
let's kill them or whatever so I really
liked this interface right here
and Mike this is where I could be like
alright here's my prison image right
here I can click on that and I can look
at the logs for it and hey take a look
here my logs and then I could just right
I can just go back a tab and tab between
the two if I want to so that was really
nice and then the other thing I really
liked was in the images being able to
filter so I have currently just looking
at my unused ones and I have currently
them all listed so I could just be like
BAM remove all my unneeded ones but
there is a command from the command line
also you can run for docker kill all of
them but I just wanted to show you guys
real quick this tool that I feel like
would be really useful at for using
docker and you haven't heard about it
before I'm still playing around with it
and trying to learn it but I really
enjoyed it so far much nicer using just
the CLI but yeah that's it for this
video guys just wanted to highlight this
and go give it a try if you haven't
already</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
