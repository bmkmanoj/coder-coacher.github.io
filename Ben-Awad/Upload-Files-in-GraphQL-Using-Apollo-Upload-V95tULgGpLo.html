prototype I just built of uploading
files using graph QL I first thought
this was impossible but there's this
library called Apollo upload server
which makes it really easy to have your
Express graph QL server handle file
uploads or image uploads any of those so
here is just a quick and this is
basically as lightweight as you can get
it here is my index table js' and i'll
walk you guys through the backing code
the front end code and the whole thing
of how I got this to work so you can run
this for yourself and I'll also put this
code on github if you'd like to check it
out okay so this is looks very similar
to how you treat a regular Apollo server
if you know how to do that the only
difference is this line right here line
20 where I say Apollo upload Express and
I provide a upload dur so this guy is
coming from this library I was talking
about and here we just specify where
we'd like to upload files so for me I
put dot slash that means the current
directory so I'm gonna get files like
get downloaded here so whenever I upload
a file it's gonna pop up right here in
the same folder but if I wanted to I
could say you know I could do a squiggly
and do My Documents folder if I wanted
to pretty much anywhere I want to I can
have it download too so you pass that
string and so we're getting a schema and
the resolvers like you would in a
regular graph QL scenario and we're
creating a graphical endpoint we're
still using Apollo data server that's
this guy right here graphical server
express and we're passing in the schema
and then we're listening on port 30 30
let's take a look at the schema and
resolvers schema looks very basic and
you'll notice you can ignore the query
it was making me create a query so I
just have a HelloWorld query basically
but all I'm doing here is a mutation
where I'm uploading the file and upload
file mutation and you'll notice it takes
an upload type this is an input type
right here this is mandated by the
library
you have to have it like this this exact
shape for the object and you use that as
your input so that's how the basically
library tells that you're uploading a
file and in here I'm just passing back a
boolean true or false whether the file
correctly uploaded and then my resolver
here here's all of this my query of
course you can ignore that but in my
mutation I'm just saying upload file and
I actually don't need to handle the
uploading this is middleware right here
and the middleware itself handles the
actual upload it does it for me but what
it will do is I'll go ahead and pass the
file object here in case I wanted to do
anything with it
and the numbers returning true that it
works so that pretty much the only thing
that's special about the server there is
Oliver's not anything special is you
have to have this input upload thingy
you can call this whatever you like but
it just needs to have the shape or at
least I think you can name this anything
else and their example you they use
upload so I'm actually not sure if you
can change this or not you probably can
though maybe not I don't know give it a
try and then Apollo upload Express have
that middleware in there so now I'll
show you you also need the client for
this to actually send this over so here
is a quick and dirty react application
I'm as two files in it and index and the
FKS you can see here's a side panel of
everything and get rid of this NPM debug
okay so here is my index edge is all I'm
doing here is I'm creating a network
interface you know notice normally this
comes from react Apollo which is
normally how you do graphical on the
front end the only difference is we're
getting this from the upload client
everything else is the exact same so
notice we create an Apollo provider here
passing in the client which we created
right here we point this to our end
point of where graph QL server is I'm
running line on port 30 30 if we pop
back over here we're listening you want
the same port to match up there and here
and then I'm just rendering my
application and that's what's being
rendered in the
dumb I'll check out what the app looks
like so here to actually uh basically
allow files to be it you know an input
I'm using the drop zone this is a
library I just really like it for
handling file uploads this is what it
looks like right here so it just has
creates a little thing you can click on
it to do stuff I can go to my desktop
and click on a picture and upload it if
it want or I can drag stuff here I'll
show you the drag how you drag stuff
it's pretty cool
and then what happens is it gives you a
call back so whenever the user drops a
file this is called and it's possible to
drop multiple files so I'm just grabbing
the first file in that array I'm be
structuring it and then right here I am
just calling this stuff prop stop mutate
so here's my mutation here I'm expecting
a file so if we take back over the
schema I'm expecting one parameter a
file this upload file so I'm passing the
file which is a variable and the type is
an upload type and then all we do is we
say this dot props let mutate passing
the file in that we get from drop zone
and then we're passing that as a
variable and we pass it to our server
and then this down here is same as
always if you used graph QL before we
have the reactor Paulo library graph
queuing gql here we're creating the
mutation like I was talking about and
here we're just injecting the mutation
inside the app using a higher-order
component and then that's how this dot
props that mutate is coming from this
mutation props coming from doing this so
let's see this guy in action and as you
can see I'm console logging loops that
resolve right here so we can kind of see
this object here is me console we can
see it pop up when I do it so I'm gonna
go ahead and drag any picture I have
here my little team out and note the
side right here this is where all the
files are you'll notice there's no
pictures right down but if I come over
here I drag you'll notice how a chain
that's react drop zone just the default
style so I'm gonna go ahead and drop it
here and we get no access control allow
origin we get this air but it still
works so I don't I don't know exactly
why that's popping up but if we come
back over here we notice the upload goes
through and here's the console log of
the file so we get Teemo web image the
upload this is what this console log
just showing you the file and we can see
the upload file here so I don't know if
this is just something that graph QL I
don't I don't actually know why this is
failing to fetch right here it were it
works just fine I assume I have to like
past the cours or something there's a
course library you can install and then
you can do app cores and then pass a
star and then import chorus from cores I
believe is something like that to get
rid of that air but it seems to work
without it so I didn't even bother
getting trying to investigate it so yeah
so now we see this file uploaded here
and if I come over here I can open it up
and we can see it's timo if we come back
over here here's the file notice it
gives it some random name that's
something they actually need the library
is terrible on documentation and I just
have a look at the source code and it
looks like the source code does not let
you change the file name and it looks
like if you want something you know
different
instead of doing Apollo upload Express
here so let's show you the code here's
the two libraries that I'm using so
here's the client that we're using on
the front-end
he was the server we're using on the
back end if we look at his source code
here you notice he's using this process
request is the name of his function and
he's handling all logic here and
he's only expecting one parameter upload
derp which we're supplying but instead
of doing that what we can do is actually
grab process requests and then put
process requests here and then implement
our own basic layout logic for it
because if we come back over here they
do have one piece of documentation that
says right here how you can grab the
process request and then actually do
your own if you need to do any kind of
other thing if you want to handle it
basically or you can look at a source
code to see how he does it basically
copy this in and then change because I
would want to change what the file name
and stuff is so that's why I recommend
doing if you want to go further in
deeper with this I personally don't like
uploading files just to the folder like
this I prefer using like third-party
stuff when I'm going into production
stuff like cloud meri or AWS but if you
are interested and downloading it to
your own basically your computer or if
you're running a server the same thing
that's running the Express server
whatever come take a look at the Apollo
upload server I would look more in-depth
and do it this is a basic example how it
works I'll throw this code up on github
so you can check it out but there's I'm
sure a lot more you'll probably want to
go in-depth with it this just gives you
a taste of how will starter how you
might get started with it so I hope that
helps gives you an idea of how you can
use this that's it for this video guys
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
