workflow that I talked about in our
previous video and I want to come
discuss some different ways you can mix
this up and the advantages and
disadvantages of it it's just a quick
run-through of how it works is you log
in from the client passing the email and
password you get a token which you store
in cookies and then whenever a client
makes a request they send along the
token and when that gets hit to the
server the server will do a couple
different things so first check the
validity of the JWT token make sure it
hasn't expired and use the correct
secret they'll then check whether the
JWT is in a table where we're storing
all valid JWT tokens and then lastly it
validates the permission whether they
can now that we know what their
permission is based on the JWT body we
can fetch the data or throw an error if
they were not permissioned and each step
if it does not pass they throw an error
now the first thing we want to talk
about is right here I'm storing the JWT
token and cookies and I'm just gonna
make this very generic we don't even
need to talk about just it returns the
JWT token from the server and the client
can store that however they want and
cookies and local storage maybe do
double submit with local storage and
cookies but either way will it just like
forget about that for now we'll set
we'll make that a separate discussion
altogether but we sum the client stores
the jbg tokens somehow and then each
request it sends along the token somehow
to the server so the token knows what it
is all right so now the first thing I
wanna talk about is using Redis this is
something you can just make to make the
queries faster that's something that
would replace this component so if I
wanted to instead of basically instead
of putting in your database putting all
the valid JWT s you could put all the
value valid JWT tokens in a Redis
in-memory store and the reason for that
is it just makes it faster queries just
to speed things up so Redis does not
change anything just tries to make
faster when querying the tokens
now one one like kind of like method
that I think is just basically strictly
better than what I have here is
something that uses multiple secrets so
when you sign a JWT token you have to
use a basically secret password to do so
traditionally you have basically one
secret that you use to sign all the
tokens that come from your server now
instead what you can do is you can have
a secret per user so whenever you sign a
token by that user you use their special
secret now what you can do is have the
secret actually and the reason why you
want to do that is because let's say one
secret gets compromised then doesn't
compromise
everyone's tokens only one person's
token is compromised and then that's an
easy to fix you just narrate a new one
for them and bam they're off good to the
races it doesn't mess anything up so
that's like the advantage of multiple
secrets and I think it's actually
strictly better than what I have here
because what you can do is I'm keeping
this table in my database or in Redis of
all the JWT s that are valid what I can
do instead is instead of storing the JWT
itself is store the secret that I want
to use for that user or for that token
so then what I can do is whenever I want
to invalidate a token I just integrate a
new secret for that user and then that
way when I go to verify we just check
against this and if we try to do so one
way to fix this up here is instead of
doing it like this is by just checking
this so check if the JWT is valid we
check if the secret is good so what
we'll do is it'll change this up a
little bit before we check where the JWT
is valid is well actually fetch that
user secret and then check whether the
correct secret was used to sign and then
whenever we do an update on that user
let's say we make them an admin or like
we demote them we don't make a lemon
admin anymore or any kind of permission
what what we do is we just generate a
new we give them a new token with a new
secret and so that immediately
invalidates all out old tokens so that's
one nice way to do it one disadvantage
of that though is if you just want to
validate maybe a token on the compute
like let's say you have two applications
your phone and the computer but let's
say you don't want invalidate both maybe
just one token so it's not as granular
when we just swapped the secret that
changes that invalidates all tokens that
user has so that's something to be aware
of but I think it's just about better
than checking whether the JW's in the
token just do a secret per user and then
swap that out
swap this piece out and then just fetch
this person secret and again you can
store the secrets and Redis for fast
queries now the next thing is this is
something someone mentioned and I agree
with strictly not strictly better but a
better way than just storing the JWT
tokens and the table is instead just
lists the JW T's that are invalid so
this is something that I actually do
like and I want to just change with this
is instead of checking whether the JWT
is in the table check if Jo she is in
blacklist table so basically we will
create a table with all tokens that are
invalid that we say are no longer good
and so what that allows us to do is just
check in that table and the table should
be smaller than all the JW T's that are
out there that we've issued so that's
the reason just because the table will
be smaller and again this table we can
put this in the database or in Redis but
just check whether do the jbw T's in
there and also good note you just want
to make sure when the JWT expires that
you're have like some kind of cron job
or something that I go ahead and clear
old JW T's out so your blacklist table
doesn't grow too big
so yeah that's one way to increase this
just like the speed of this is to just
have a create a smaller table using
blacklist instead of listing all of them
and then lastly what I want to talk
about is refresh tokens so this is
something that I really like that I'm
gonna be using when I implement a off
indication method and the reason for
that is it's kind of annoying to have to
check this blacklist table every time I
want to make a request especially if the
user you know 99% of the time the user
is the it's their token didn't just get
blacklisted right so one way to get
around this is to basically have two
tokens one token that lasts maybe a
minute maybe 2 minutes and if it's wrong
like let's say it has the wrong whatever
like you're storing in the admin
privileges if it gets wrong like
incorrect for some reason it expires
after a minute and it's gonna get
refreshed so you have the wrong
permissions for a minute which is not
that big of a deal at least for most
applications now some are critical and
this is a bad idea but for a lot of
applications if you're have the wrong
token and the wrong permissions for a
mint that's not bad
and also that should really never happen
where you have the wrong token this is
just a corner case where you have it for
a minute it's off and then you have a
second token which is a Refresh token
which is what you use if the Refresh
token is valid this might last a week or
a month or whatever you want to use the
Refresh token so this is a two token
architecture with you doing Refresh
tokens is the Refresh token is used if
it's still valid you've basically signed
in within a month then it goes and it
will check the blacklist table where
you're only storing the Refresh tokens
make sure that refresh token has not
been blacklisted and you go ahead and
you create a new JWT token and that's
just you know you request this once
every minute or so instead of requesting
it every single time which is nice so
what I'm going to be trying out is
this with refresh tokens and a blacklist
table so keeping a blacklist table
either in Redis or in database of all
the tokens that are old have been
invalidated and then what I'll do is I
will just have a refresh token which
they can use to get new tokens every
minute and that way we'll make this
request to check whether the token is
invalid every minute instead of every
request but of course we'll still do
these two checks as well but this one
doesn't happen every single time now you
don't have to do this the Refresh token
if you want to simplify it and don't
worry about that extra check or if you
don't care that you're doing these extra
computations but that's like a nice
little trick that'll decrease how many
times you have to hit the database so
that's when we trying out I'm going to
try out an implementation of that and
it'll be coming out soon and that's it
for this video guys let me know what you
think if there's any other
recommendations you guys would have for
changing up this authentication method
I'd love to hear it or if you see any
flaws in this because I'm sure it is not
perfect but with security it's all like
relative and sometimes like you can only
get so secure you're giving up freedom
with the security that you give so it's
important to keep that in mind and yeah
so that's it for this video guys thanks
for watching I'll see you in the next
one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
