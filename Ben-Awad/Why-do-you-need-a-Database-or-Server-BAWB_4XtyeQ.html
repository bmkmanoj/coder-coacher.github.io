and front-end and when you don't need
one and what each piece is doing because
there's lots of different ways to make
web apps I want to explain why different
pieces are necessary and when you should
use them and when you shouldn't so I
want to first start off it because you
don't have to make a website with react
or anger or any other JavaScript great
what is it getting you react here if I'm
using Express I could be using something
like this static files and I just have a
bunch of HTML files I'm written boda
HTML right and the reason I am using and
also by the way you can serve static
files to so but why am I here basically
and using react and the reason for that
is it just has a ton of interactivity to
be users they can just do a lot more
stuff like I really like that so it
seems really when you're making a
advanced web application with lots of
different functions and stuff so that's
what I really like about react easy to
do that and yeah I react is being used
but you don't have to use react if you
want more static content that you don't
need a lot of the user you know clicking
on buttons doing different stuff then
you could just do HTML CSS JavaScript
you don't need react react is for when
you want to do heavy javascript or a lot
of it so that's why I am using right now
what about Express why do I need a
server ugly actually let's explain why
you need a vaporous because this will
make more sense so basically a day to
persist data it's a way you could
persist data without a database is used
using some like local storage which I'll
show you why not so if you go inspect
here you can go to application close
this you can go to local storage and you
can see I you it's kind of like a
dictionary and you can store stuff
in here for that just for a single user
but you can't tell storage that's why I
database is good and database a good
central storage right local storage is
on everyone's computer central things
you can query across lots of users my
databases are good and one thing you
could do actually it's not necessary for
things you could just have you know your
front database you don't technically
need a server right technically you
don't need a database either unless you
want to persist stuff if I have a user
that wants to you know we're saving a
hit and they use the site databases are
great you should put data in it a good
book it but let's get into this you
don't actually need just directly
connect with your to your database you'd
react
why don't people do that though one
reason is and I think this is the main
reason I could be wrong though is when
you you can look at like I can expect
this thing right here email here and I
forget what it's under it mixes there it
is and you can actually see the
JavaScript that on this page that's
getting run so if I were in my database
from just the client from Rio from the
front-end then I would have to put my
credentials on the client so then anyone
could go look at my job my credentials
are to the database and then they could
go into the data corrupt the database do
whatever they want so that's bad right
you don't want if that's when a server
comes in that's why I servers they're
useful for other things as well which
we'll get into but one big really
protects your credentials right so now
react e you know the access to database
now you have this other layer of
protection which is your server there
and protects it so now your server talks
to the database act talks to the server
and the server talks to the database
that's just any data that react once and
feeds it back and that's what graph QL
it just makes it easier for the react
and I'm going to get into exactly how
these guys talk to each other and then
video but I just wanted to go over real
quick why each piece is necessary and so
thing or is if I want to run background
tasks for example maybe I want to do
something that takes some time a
client-side you want to run it on the
server that way the user can see your
application while this background job is
being run important note servers when
you're doing react it's all running on
the person's server it's running on you
your whatever computer you choose you
get to choose a server that runs on so
the server is just someone else's
computer right like when you go to AWS
and make an account and create a ec2
instance or if you were her oh
absolutely just running on someone
else's computer your code servers are
good for basically two things right we
use them for is protecting your database
and you know format back to react and
then to pass that you want to run so
those are the big fql this just makes it
easy for the server and react to talks
that's it for this video guys next video
I want to go over how exactly R is this
database type of server time for you to
react and how that works
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
