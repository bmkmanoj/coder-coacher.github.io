of work on the backend setting up our
graph QL server and I want to spend a
little time on next yes and show you
guys how to actually combine you know
use everything that we created with the
backend so today what I want to do is
create a register and login page flush
it out create some forms and show you
how I'm going to persist the login and
actually use all the features that we
added to our back-end now if you haven't
been following along and don't have the
graticule server code or this next jasc
code and you would like to i'll put
links in the description below but let's
just jump right into it so here is the
server that I have setup and here's the
schema for it now we need to make some
changes
not to the schema but to or resolvers
because we've been making some changes
to our models and just how everything is
working and I already have the server
running and terminal and I have the
client next application running to so as
I make changes is just going to restart
and reload so I'm not gonna worry about
starting those up again so resolvers
here here's that register mutation I was
just showing talking to you guys about
that we're going to be using this guy
right here and we're going to need a
little bit different and the reason for
this we split up locals off and facebook
off into two and then we have a user
here and they're all related right local
offices the email password and we're
storing all the user information here so
what we're going to do now instead is
instead of just creating this user right
is Bryna well we're going to still
create user rights but we're going to
actually take out some specific
properties so we only need is admin and
the user name
and then for local off we need email and
password so we're using a lodash
function here called and both these
should grab from arcs so args passed in
is going to have all these fields and we
need to split up because our user is
going to need these fields and local
author can need these fields so we're
going to use a load F lodash function
called pick and before let's just go
ahead and install not install query
habit but import lodash so what this
function does is it actually just take
the email password property from args
and just puts it in here same thing here
so it's going to have an object with the
username and admin property and the
first thing we're going to do here is
actually create a user and here we need
to change this to local off because we
need to hash it for local off not for
the user and we can actually what we can
do is actually do some cool magic you'll
notice how this thing is a waiting write
what we also need to do is so here I'm
going to write out want like a
inefficient piece of code well it's not
this is inefficient but it could be more
efficient so created user and we could
say a wait and then we're going to
create a user or passing in user that's
good and the reason why we need to like
break this out is because we also need
to create a local off to so return
models dot local off create and we're
going to do dot dot dot spread open our
local off and then we're also going to
pass and the user ID from created user
ID right so the reason created user oh I
was like why was I getting grayed out so
the reason why we need to create user
first we need that user ID pass it in to
create a local off that way we can
relate these email and password to and
actually user and if you weren't with us
on why we split the user and local off
up that's because we also have Facebook
off so if the user decides to log in
with Facebook we have them separate
alright so this is a piece of code here
and now before I talk about the
performance of this I'm using the spread
operator and if we come to console here
you'll notice hey we have a crash and
that's what I realized
we did not put a Babel for this spread
so let's do that real quick because I
love the spread operator so we just need
to say stage two so in the babel RC add
that to it and then come on over here to
terminal do yarn add is a dev dependency
babel preset stage two and then this air
will go away all right so let's talk
about the performance of this this is
decent performance right but we could
actually make it better and the reason
for that is this does not depend on this
both of these can happen in parallel but
right now they're concurrent right why
94 runs finishes we hash the password
store here deadline 95 ends or wait for
this to finish and then runs this really
they could be run parallel so why not do
that so comp password promise I'm going
to say pass 4 a.m. why not it is going
to be this guy and then concreate user
and then and why not we'll type it out
create user promise is equal to that and
then what we're going to say is password
created user is equal to a wait promise
dot all and then we're going to pass in
our to password promise and created user
promise and let's put an eye there
so notice how we change that there and
now we can just say password here and
bam hope that just gives a lot of airs
so let's fix those created user or okay
though this should be create user
promise and then we scare the D here and
then we're going to take comp password
create user okay cool
so now notice how we are getting
promises for both of these so they're
going to be running and then we're going
to wait for both of them to fish so now
why 94/95 will run in parallel so just a
little thing that'll speed up
performance alright so now we get the
password create user I'm going to do the
same thing here right nothing changes
and that's all we need to do with the
server everything else with the server
is already set up and good to go let's
just hop on to the client side so we
need to create a new page here it's
going to be register J s and we are
going to need to import react because we
are going to be creating a form on this
page and we're going to use the state to
store that so I register extends react
component and in our state here we're
going to have a username field we're
going to have any email a password and
an is Advent which is going to be false
by default and then we're going to have
a render function and what I was
thinking is we could actually instead of
making an ugly form here is we could
spice it up and I'm going to just move
that Visual Studio code over because
we're not going to do surfer stuff for a
little bit and use ant design just easy
to set up and makes it look a little
nicer so we're going to install this
dependency here hop onto the server and
do it yarn add ant you could switch this
out for another UI a library if you like
and we're just going to use the import
element and the check box and maybe a
button to
so we're going to put an input here and
put and we're going to put a few things
name going to be user name and there's a
reason why I'm filling out the name as
you'll see later placeholder user name
and then on change we're going to say
we're going to get the events in the
value and pass it to this dot on change
housing in the event and do value and
then we're going to create on change
evey and we're going to do some stuff
here
okay-dokey and actually we can just make
this an arrow function cool and then we
can close you and we need to wrap this
in a div because we're going to have a
couple of them okay I just want to first
make sure this renders okay and also by
we getting red lines closing for input
OH alright let's make sure everything
renders okay we see it on the the page
thank you excuse me
make sure everything worked okay looks
like it's taking a little long to load
let's go to terminal real quick see if
anything's happening it looks like it's
building that page
okay well that's fitting we won't break
anything we're adding a couple more
inputs we're going to email we can do
password as well and we need to actually
specify the type as password that way
when we type stuff it doesn't show
default like oh we didn't see file
export here Explorer default next gist
is so nice and tells you if you don't do
export default all right we have some
fields here and password cool um you
know these will actually look styled so
I wonder if it's ant design if you need
to actually add a stylesheet and I'm
gonna add line breaks so these pop down
cool and then we need to do a check box
just like this guy
so let's import you and let's add check
box and we can copy that because it's
going to be the same thing so I think
they use placeholder we'll see so is
admin notice how matching up the names
with what I called it in the state
that's important placeholder here is
admins put a question mark why not type
we don't need to worry about on change
goods and ok so they wrap it like that
so they don't do a placeholder so I
should be like this say admin checkbox I
think you're it place ok now if we come
to register should see admin nice and
yeah it doesn't look like it's getting
styled worry about that at the end of
the video making sure the CSS pops up
let's also do a button so I have no idea
where that is here you and let's just do
a primary button so type primary
checkbox button type primary and it's
going to be submit and glad some line
breaks here and here and our form should
be good to go let's see it and I'm just
going to actually this is not going to
work quite yet it's going to say make
sure on change functions working but we
actually need to make that so
this dot set state that way every time
someone typed something or clicks a
button right we're going to update the
state of our application and to do this
we're actually going to get this name
field to know so notice we're calling
the same function no matter what we're
input box do this so to differentiate
them and know which part of the state to
update we're actually going to grab the
name field so we can get that by doing
EDA Target God's name and I'll actually
give us the value that's why I'm using
brackets here I'll guess the value of
this variable and store it so that'll be
like username here or it might be email
and then we can get the value all right
so now if you have reactive tool you can
go to that and we can actually see this
change as we're typing so go register it
you can see all the fields here as I'm
typing if we did it correctly which we
did we would see it pop up there okay so
something went wrong because we didn't
see it here and you can use this to
check your own code too so if I hit
submit for example what we can do is do
on submit and we don't even need to do
pass anything we're going to just
console dot log this thought state so we
can see if the values of these are
changing to which we know they're not
because we saw that and I think just we
don't need to do is the I was thinking
the value would be passed as a second
parameter to that's how they do it in
material UI but for this it doesn't look
like it is and that's a okay up here
instead of taking two params take one
and you can get it from a target value
all right now coming back here other
right this will Auto refresh for us I
was like waiting for it to refresh but
it already does that for us
so V is not defined
we got row
let's say we got rid of the forgot to
get rid of it from actually passing to
the function all right cool now if I
start typing stuff V is not defined
Oh didn't restart yet there we go and
submit we actually need a wire submit up
so when we do on click going to actually
see it this dot on submit and by the way
we're going to hook this up with graph
QL as soon as we get this going and
sorry we just restart hit submit Vista
on some it's not function what I call
you on submit this dot on Smith Y is on
some another function I see you right
here whoops a console dot logs
hi make sure it's there on submit this
dot on submit this looks fine I'm not
sure why that's not working I'll just
click it again this Don cement is not a
function that is super weird we'll see
if the state the state's not changing
either so what we can do is we can
console log Y target value and we can do
a dot name now we can see what field is
changing and what the value is and if
it's doing it correctly so I'll get rid
of that and for whatever reason it's not
even being called on change is never
being called for this input field all
right things are acting up whenever
things are acting up like that I just
like to restart the server and make sure
that's not what's causing these weird
things to happen um if it still doesn't
work usually we can come here and see if
I need to do something besides on change
like maybe aunt doesn't have on change
mates on type or something so let's see
type value default so it tells us what
the values we can give our on search
sister when you click on the search icon
input value oh we actually need to set
the value of these that's what I was
doing wrong to the sub state dot email
sorry user name I mean that was
obviously not a problem because the
value was being changed to there but
it's good to have the value reflected in
the field the start state is as then
cool and let's see what this looks like
nice so you know the value is undefined
here input is changing and uncontrolled
so now we can type this here that works
so with our check box I think this the
check box passes a value in so we can
actually grab it like this so now here
we can get the value and we can say the
for value so this doesn't work because
the boolean might be false right so what
you're going to need to do is say equal
to undefined so basically if if this
parameter is not defined then you get
the value otherwise it is defined and we
want B so you can also print B out and
that's just to get this check box
working and to sort of start back up
we're getting undefined but then we're
not getting a crash I think it's working
because it's not printing the value
something's not getting printed I'll see
when I submit it up it's still getting
one to find interesting so for whatever
reason
the checkbox maybe so let's go to this
real quick we go to checkbox
let's select we can look at their props
so ok checks is whether the box is
selected on change ok so it as one
parameter event so we don't have to
worry about the V thing I was doing
sorry about that guys you can forget I
was doing that and check so we don't set
value well we see I saw value here but
here's checked
ok so value here should be checked on
change you pass just E so it should be a
dot value but it could be for check
boxes checked I'm actually just going on
total in there I'm actually not sure if
target dot check do the thing we're
about to find out though because if
value is undefined I don't know what
else they'd call it so notice how it's
undefined right but we're only getting
printed that one so I'm curious is the
values undefined
what we can do is we can say console.log
a target and we can see what values are
available to us because I'm not sure
what the value of check is because like
notice how this works
emails sign ball Bob calm see how that
works just fine when we print this okay
this is not working right because
console dot log target cannot happen I'm
going to put some console dot log
statements here so you can see what the
value each one is
there you go so I just took a random
symbol and now we know what should be
under it so whichever one is missing let
me click on this check box okay that's
fun
I'm going to uncomment that state
nothing is getting console.log right now
yet is admin is being logged I'm doing
so many more console logs I think it's
just need to refresh the page so some
stuff is getting hot reloaded some stuff
isn't alright so true so II thought
targets I checked is actually a thing
all right now I know exactly what to do
so if this is a undefined then e dot
target checked else it's just a regular
field BAM all right we're good to go now
guys sorry it took longer than expected
to get this up and running user named
Bob Bob at Bob calm Bobby and we're an
admin and bought a pop calm Bobby admin
BAM and we got us a nice little forum we
going on let's finish off this little
forum with a little bit of graph QL so
just like we did index page we are
needing with data and these too so come
back to register you're going to import
those guys we need to wrap this with
import data export equal
sorry not import data with data and pass
our so comps we're going to have to
create a we're not export dating
following here so first we need to wrap
this register thing with a graph QL
so we're going to say graph QL register
is equal to graph QL we're going to pass
in a mutation so register a mutation we
actually need to create that mutation
and then here we're going to pass in our
component so here's our component here's
the mutation we need to create create a
new variable that's what we need to pass
here that's we're going to export not
sure why this is read export to you
fault with data this looks fine I don't
know why that is because register
mutation is messed up
all right so Const register mutation
this is going to be our mutation that
we're going to pass in here alright and
we don't need compose still don't know
what's going on there I just actually
I'm curious if this will even refresh
and it might not which is fine so I'm
going to go to local slash graphical to
help us create this mutation and here
run out of mutation and we're going to
have a few variables
the first is username which is a string
which is not mandatory actually we
should probably make a mandatory email
which is mandatory password which is
mandatory and then is admin to the
boolean and that's not mandatory and
here we're going to register passing in
username and then our email email
password password is
then is admin run that we don't really
need anything back from it so we can
just grab the ID to make sure it worked
and so we just need to pass those in so
the cool thing about graph QL is to run
this mutation we added it in with graph
QL here so now it actually creates a
function called the stop prompts dot
mutation for us and we just need to pass
in variable and our variables are this
stop state so it's important that your
variable names here user name email
password variable or sorry is admin
that's what we're passing into variables
and variables here are your variable
names here those all match up all right
now let's run this guy in action here so
we're going to create Bob Bob and Bob
calm Bob and we're not going to make Bob
and admin submit this stop mutation so
something went wrong let's make sure
everything is good because we should
have a mutation one if we did it
properly and register oh it's mutate not
mutation you tape with that refresh
itself and we can race them in cool and
it's refreshed here all that Bob calm
BAM
alright so nothing happened which is
what we would expect because we went we
were in it we're not you know doing
anything to see if it worked
so maybe if we just get all users here
grabbing username email we can see if
Bob shows up and of course my query
doesn't work because we changed some
things and emails going to be in a
different field now
email actually we can't grab and user
names non-noble okay so this thing is
just messed up we're off to fix this
query some other time
what did to make sure this mutation did
work I'm going to check the database so
if I type P sequel I can connect to test
graph QL and I can select all from users
and I did not do that right and all
right cool so we have Bob here you'll
notice how we're not in EES non-admin
we're not storing the email here that's
in a separate table what we could do is
we could select a notice house ID is two
it could select from and what do we call
it local storage
Luke walks Bob at Bob calm and his user
ID that he's assigned to is two so it
lines up nicely all right so this is
toriel's getting kind of long just to
get this set up so I think I'm going to
end this guy here we have this nice
register form set up and we're able to
submit do a mutation create it but the
magic is really going to happen in the
next video when we log in now and I'm
actually not going to in the video I'm
just going to debug and see how you can
get ant designed CSS to pop up here too
so if you want to stick around you can
I'm going to be doing that but that is
it for the graph QL next GS part so
let's see why this guy didn't I'm
assuming I'm just missing a stylesheet
that I need to import
let's just go to getting started or
using and create react out because it's
going to be basically the same thing cv
into ant demo we add it here
and let the button and we just needed to
add our ant dist at the top of source
CSS
all right so let's just import this guy
I don't know why they're doing a
squiggly here let's just try that and
refresh oh that's fun
err module parts you may need to prove
your loader the handle this file that's
disgusting
because my theme through probably
libraries we also we're out there for
libraries first example so basically we
need to actually add the CSS so let's
just google this will be easiest
I think ant design next yes I don't see
how everyone else is adding the CSS in
this is know all those clips of modules
don't care styles and design just I'm
pretty sure I'm doing that yeah I mean
okay I can do that import styles from
I'm not sure why that wouldn't crash
still we can try it though well it's
loading we're going to keep looking
because I don't think it's going to work
and did it no yeah same here
alright nothing
actually he got five of both what did he
do add to import on demand you should
add Babel plugins we should have to
touch a Babel for this add ant design
example download
can we just view this file um yeah cool
this is exactly what we want two
examples of how to use next years along
with ant design all right so we're going
to pages index and they're not showing
how they're getting the stylesheet
though I wonder if it shows I actually
don't know where else would be maybe
they're babbled or doing something yep
looks like people are doing stuff in
babble let's do that to da Pavel RC
let's create a dot babble RC a skew here
and we'll get rid of styles all right
cool so work
reactionary is markup and container but
the checksum was invalid this means that
the server rendering the market your
answer was not respected injected new to
compensate not no idea what that
actually was trying to say I'm just
going to restart the server allows our
errors from doing queries bundle err
import specified I think we just crashed
everything failed to compile with one
air a node plugin import specified and
hello world dot we might need to install
something in our package that JSON yeah
we're going to need to install this guy
is there anything else here next we have
everything else so yarn add the one
thing I've noticed is nothing just works
and next yes I have to do extra stuff
okay we have that now I don't know if
the server will auto detect it and then
fix it doesn't look like it did so let's
restart you I'll click it's reading from
the Babel RFC looks like it's actually
maybe building it looks kind of
promising and it's not don't see it at
all still okay I think we have the exact
same thing as this guy here we have ant
D we have babel plugin only our babel RC
we copied him our only thing is going to
be index that could be different
Oh what was that he also
oh he's actually just doing this this is
what we need to do guys I'm a noob we
don't need this I don't think and we can
do yarn remove yarn remove babble
plug-in import I think he was using this
for something else that's where the
magic is right here you can put it in
our head and is he in a local provider
cool dude
alright so we're doing a head here
passing in a link and we're just getting
the CSS so Shane we can't just import it
locally I'm not sure why it didn't work
because I stopped the server is that why
yeah we did okay
I don't like I don't like adding style
sheets like this
I much prefer it's much better to import
it it's faster that way
that's how create react app works you
can just import them in up here like I
was trying to do that's actually what
the tutorial on inside does I wish I
could do that here they're adding it to
the header and then letting it do it
their heads not defined oh I just need
to import it so that's coming from
straight from next to s so it's a next
chance thing and pasted in here so far
I'm actually liking just create react
out better I think
then using next yes but BAM a little bit
extra work a little bit but we finally
got these guys rendered these are
stretching across the whole screen
I wonder if I can get those down a
little bit let's go at inputs here we go
size large let's do a default size the
placeholder default size so why is this
one stretching the whole screen basic
usage these are the same thing
there are three sizes of input boxes
largely called small okay this looks see
this this input here right is mapped to
this default example will figure exact
same is this so this expands the whole
screen this doesn't think it's just that
input group I mean we have an input
group I don't think we need to do that I
guess it's fine it's not the prettiest
form it'd be nice if we added some
padding on the sides so it looked okay
anything else I want to add on looking
at this height based on content length I
was kind of interesting kind of laggy
what else well because it to a custom
this is not doing the whole lump
max links 25 characters up to the max
length on ours we don't need a Mac we
don't need it that long should be typing
a pass for that long the capital L yep
give you 100 characters max links
hundred characters all right let's see
if that looks any different guess it
doesn't because it just expands do they
do anything oops we're too here please a
little blur they did nothing else I bet
they have some style or something
they're using yeah probably this well I
mean that's the min with it's expanding
okay we're just going to leave this as
is it looks semi nicer I'll let you guys
style it and make it look at pretty I'm
not a designer let's get rid of you guys
and bam so thanks for watching if you
guys stayed a little longer to check out
how ant design was working without
working so that's nice in the next video
we will be doing log in and saving that
store and localhost and persist sessions
so that's going to be pretty neat so
again thank you guys for watching
oof looks like we could actually please
use a Babel plugin import using the
whole using a whole package of auntie
please use babel plugin to reduce app
bundles sighs so that's why like I was
using that
that way it was not ginormous now we
could probably add that why not so yep
that's it for this video guys we'll
