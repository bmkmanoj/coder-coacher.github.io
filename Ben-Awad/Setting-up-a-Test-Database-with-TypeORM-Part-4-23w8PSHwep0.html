working on testing and I mentioned these
three things that I wanted to do and so
we're gonna be working on those and the
first thing we're gonna set up is
basically a new database that we can use
for testing now this is actually pretty
easy with a type arm so we have this
thing called arm config over here right
and this specifies basically all our
information to connect to the database
and if we want another connection for
example for testing we can so what we do
is I'm gonna just add an array here
instead of just an object and I'm gonna
copy this and paste it and now I just
need to add a curly brace and a comma
there and save and awesome so now I have
a second connection so now to
differentiate these connections I have
to give them a name so name I'm gonna
call this one development and I'm gonna
call this one test and then I can change
pretty much anything I want here so test
I want to change up so it does a few
different things the first is I don't
want to see blogging with type or
whenever I'm testing the other thing is
in my database I want to call this test
at the end so this is gonna be a totally
new database here and then lastly I want
to drop the database whenever I create a
connection basically I want to reset all
the data and get rid of all the data
that was that was another thing one of
you guys recommended instead of dropping
all the data at the end do it at the
beginning and I thought that was a
really good idea because then we start
fresh and we make sure it's consistent
that we have an empty database so we're
gonna be doing that okay so here like
the connection options that we have all
the options from type arm and I'll link
this if you want to check this out and
see all the different things you can do
but the one we're gonna be using is this
thing called drop schema
so I'm just gonna copy that and put it
in here and we're gonna say true so now
we're gonna drop the database and
synchronize it and make sure all our
tables are good to go so I'm gonna have
to create this database so I'm gonna do
that right now so I'm gonna copy this
and just say create dB if I want to I
could change any other parameters but
I'm gonna keep them the same I could
create a new user but I'm gonna keep
that one of the same - all right so
we're good to go at least with this
connection so now we basically need to
conditionally connect and what I mean by
that is when I do yard start over here
so in my package a JSON
I'd like to connect to the regular
database and when I do test I'd like to
start up the test database so what I'm
going to do is create a new command here
called start I'm not gonna call it start
we'll call it test server and it's just
going to say TS node source slash index
aw TS now the way I'm going to know that
this is testing is some in the pass
environment variable so I'm just gonna
set the node environment to test so this
is a way how you can pass an environment
variable to your code right before it
runs so we're now have access to this
environment variable and we can
basically do different things with it
and I'm also going to set one up here no
damn equal to development
and I'm also going to set it in tests so
note and yes now I'm I assume just
probably sets this to the right thing
but just in case in case it doesn't I'm
gonna set it there all right so we're
good now we just now need to in our
whenever we call create connection now
we need to conditionally create
different connections connections so I'm
going to do is create a folder called
utils and I'm gonna say create type
armed connection and let's call this dot
es an export to cons create type on
connection and I'm gonna make this
asynchronous so we are going to use this
but now before we actually just call
create connection before it was
automatically at reading the arm config
right and it was able to know which one
it was but now we have multiple so I
thought we're gonna solve this is by
saying connection options and we're
gonna await connection options and this
is something from type arm oops
I don't think we want the reader its
connection options I actually can't even
remember the name of this it's for
overriding so it's in creating a
connection I believe overriding so we
want to use the get connection options
alright so get connection options
so we can either manually change these
or we can actually pass in the name that
we want so I'm just going to pass in
process stem Snowden okay so what this
is doing is it's grabbing the options
based on what the new environment is and
we are just going to return that
connection options and we're just
importing both of these from type warm
okay so remember how here we specify
development or test so whenever we're
running whatever environment we are
we're either passing the string test or
development and then if we pass and test
it's going to give us the test
connection options if it gives us
development we're gonna be grabbing
these and we just pass that in to tie
form so it knows what can tripe
connection to build for us so now
anywhere that I use create connection
I'm just gonna say change it to my own
connection called create type worm con
and I'm also gonna do that in my
register function so create type worm
con and now it's gonna drop the
databases whenever it creates this one
so I'm gonna just do it at the very
beginning here and that way when we
request this we don't we add a user and
then we drop the database I don't want
that to happen okay cool so now we
should be on every single test dropping
the database and we might not
necessarily want to do this so another
way you can do it is here with Jes they
have a couple functions we can use so we
can use their use before each so this
will run before every test or we can use
before all which will be run before all
tests so for now I'm just gonna say
before all and we might change this to
before each
in the future and I'm just gonna say
async and I'm just gonna remove move it
up here so basically before I do any
tests what's going to happen is we're
going to create the database connection
and wipe the database because we
specified in our or config that we're
gonna drop the schema all right let's
give this a try now and see if this
works
so now to start up my server I want to
test it so I'm gonna run the yarn test
server test server and we'll let that
boot up and we can just and if you want
to notice how we didn't get any logging
just do yarn start to make sure that
works too and here we should see logging
perfect so notice how I was able to read
different options because of Lee passing
that government variable so start that
server and then I'm just gonna come over
here and do yarn test to test it out and
let's make sure it finished starting up
perfect and we'll see if this works
okay so connection default was not found
so looks like something went awry okay
so I found a workaround to this air
right here so it says the connection
default was not found and what I think
what's going on there is type warm uses
the default connection when making
queries and when we went over here to or
config we changed the name to
development and the other one to test so
that was causing a problem because we
are feeding it and so what I did is when
I create this connection now I keep all
the options that are there and then I
just pass in the name of default and
it's now able to run okay
here's the test working and we can just
go ahead and test this guy again so yarn
test and it's able to drop all the
databases or the database and running
and I can just control see this running
again and we'll have no problem with for
example duplicate users being created
because we are dropping the database
each time we run it so that is perfect
so that's what I wanted to do in this
video we still have not done this part
right here we're currently starting the
server in another tab so there's two
things I want to try the first is this
library right here what it does is it
starts the server waits for the URL at
the finish to basically come up and then
it'll go ahead and run your test and
then after that after it's done testing
they'll shut down the server so this one
looks pretty promising the other one I
want to try out is super test well super
test allows you to do is actually pass
in your Express object so see how it
says a pupil Express and I can just
directly pass that in so instead of
actually starting the server up I would
just basically use the Express object
which has some nice benefits so I'm
gonna try this this is my preferred
option and we'll see if this works with
graph QL yoga the downside of this one
though is if we wanted to do this in
production and I want to just run the
test in production this would be more
like how the production tests would
happen I would could hit the server but
that might be a separate issue for a
different time but that's it for this
video guys thanks for watching
