about the tech stack that I'm using for
this application that you're seeing
right here and why each component is
needed and wanted springing to the table
so I here I have the readme up and as
you can see this is what the stack is so
in the backend I'm using Postgres equal
Express and I'm using graph QL and then
in the front-end I'm using react so
let's start off with react why am i
using that why is it necessary or can I
switch it out for something else because
what you can do is you can eliminate
this guy altogether and just have these
guys reactors are standing JavaScript
and you don't need your off script you
can just create static HTML pages
without it but the nice thing about
react and JavaScript is you just add a
lot of interactivity to your application
and it's really nice so for example I
have this little input form here and I
can type a new suggestion and then when
I hit enter it's gonna pop up right here
so we're changing the HTML of the page
now if I was not using JavaScript but do
you have what you would have to do is
when I enter you know a suggestion here
and hit enter
you'd have to reload the page and then
you'd see the suggestion here but notice
how there's no reload it just
automatically pops here so that's really
cool and the nice thing about JavaScript
so that's one that's one reason you use
JavaScript is for these sort of things
interactivity inside of the page the
HTML is changing as the users clicking
on stuff pushing buttons sliding things
doing different stuff so that's what
javascript and react saggin if you don't
need any of that if you just have you
know static stuff or if you don't mind
if the page loads and it's simple then
you don´t need react you can do it
without it and you can just serve static
HTML pages without JavaScript and then
you can do JavaScript without react
reacts just nice if you wanna need to
write a lot of JavaScript so that's
that's why I'm using react for that nice
stuff and also this will be why you need
a server to but I'm also using WebSocket
it's in subscriptions which you need
JavaScript for so here I am if someone
clicks on this button from a different
browser so someone else's account I will
see the vote here the votes right here
nothing's happening now because every
voted on this item but as you can see I
can put on this one now if someone else
votes on someone else's computer I'll
actually see it here without refreshing
the page so that's really cool so that's
one of the things that you could do a
JavaScript as well okay so why am i
using now for the backend I'm gonna
start with the database why that's
necessary so the big thing with database
is to persist data so you guys see I
have all this stuff here right i refresh
the page it stays there you know it gets
reordered I need to fix that but you can
see new suggestion that we just created
here newly created right so I created it
and then i refresh the page I come back
at a later date it's still there right
so that's because we're storing in
database and it's gonna be there so
anything you want to store for a user
persist and use other times they come
visit the website you want to put that
inside of a database and then grab that
and why are we using a server the reason
for that is kind of an in-between
between the database and react so if we
didn't need to store anything in a
database we wouldn't even really need
you know if we don't want to persist
anything if everything is what the user
is interacting with and in that session
then you don't need a database at all
and then if react needs to connect to a
database it can connect directly if it
wanted to but the one thing that's
really bad about that is if I inspect
this right here if I go to sources I can
see all the code for this I think it's
here yeah so I can see all the
JavaScript code that's running in my
browser like this is really ugly and
stuff but this is the JavaScript code
that is running this so what I can do is
I can actually put my credentials for
the database and react and I could
connect directly I don't need a server I
could connect directly to the database
and there you are you get your data and
persisted right well you saw how I was
able to just access the source code for
this application if I put my credentials
in there everyone could see my
credentials it'd be off op it would be
hidden for users that are not you know
technical but anyone who had any
technical knowledge could go in there
see your source code see your
credentials and then mess up your
database so you don't want that
that's where server comes in one of the
nice things about a server is and react
can connect to the server we can you
know talk to the server we can
authenticate with it log in do request
and the server holds the condensed roles
and we can't see the code for the server
all we do is we interact with it with
HUP so it's a nice little layer that
will kind of hide and do authentication
hide our credentials so that's one
reason the server is good another reason
is for like I was saying WebSockets so
we can know when someone else in another
computer or on their phone somewhere
else in the world is clicking our thing
it goes to our central server and a
server lets everyone know that stuff is
popping up here so that's really nice
third reason why is server is good is
for for background tasks so if I want to
run some wings gonna take a lot of time
you don't want that taking the person's
computer you don't want to like take it
a bunch of CPU power and run for like 30
minutes and have to have the window open
right there's something you need to run
in the background you can do that on a
server and then the user doesn't have to
have the window or the application open
here and it could still be running so
that's really nice so those are the
three things that are nice about a
server so now you kind of know why I'm
usually react the server and the
database and kind of how they are all
interconnected now graph QL this is just
cherry on top to make the talking to the
server
Henry
act easier.you this is not necessary at
all and it's basically just a ease of
life you know I enjoy using it makes
programming this easier and faster so
that's it for this video guys that is
how each component what it brings to the
table if you have any questions feel
free to leave a comment below and I'll
see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
