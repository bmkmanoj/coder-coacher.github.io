animations to our calculator and to do
this we're gonna be using this react
native aníbal library that's really nice
and easy to add animations here are some
of the things you can if you scrub on
that have some examples of what it looks
like we'll be adding a few of these and
just as a quick side note if you want to
do more advanced animations highly
recommend this library it's called body
if you haven't heard of it it's by
Airbnb and haven't used it personally
because I don't have Dobby after-effects
which is they used to make these things
but they look really nice some really
cool animations you can make with this
but that's for another day another video
tilted started with this and see if we
got an animation to our populate er so
first things first go ahead and install
it
I've reinstalled it by running this
command NPM install react native animal
and first thing I wanted to do was add a
little animation to the button there's
basically two places we can add
animations to the buttons here into the
text up here so I have animation to the
button what we're going to do is very
similar to the example up here we get
reference to a object here so text and
then we just call that reference with
whether we want to happen to it so
transition we can tell it to fade any of
that stuff and then we're gonna import
and it all like this so copy this that's
step number one
importing it step number two we need to
get reference to this text object and/or
this text component and we needed to
make it an embeddable and Thibault dot
text
area and next we need to get referenced
to it and we should see should rebuild
over here we shouldn't see any
difference and we don't with her buttons
nothing should have changed right
because we haven't specified the
animation that should occur now we can't
actually just add an animation on there
like this
so here's them adding a little pulse
animation we can add that tars too it's
gonna look silly all our buttons just
saying they're pulsing but we could have
at it like that look see all our buttons
are now pulsing with that animation you
could even have a little flash once you
have this setup you can just actually
switch the animation to have them do any
animation you want so here they're all
flashing and stuff but we don't want
them to just like animate all the time
right we have them an infinite loop
right now what you can do is just add
one here but you can see this is how
easy it is to add an animation all I had
to do was use this animal tag instead a
regular text tag and then just specify
the animation like to see and just bam
bam bam bam now it doesn't look like
there's a flash animation oh iteration
count didn't like one I guess I need to
do like that they're real so they're
just flashed once it's done but what I
want to do is actually have an animation
occur when I click on the button so
instead of doing this junk here we're
gonna get reference to this guy so ref
and how ref works currently is there is
a callback function they pass you with
the reference so here's the reference
and the way to do it is to say this dot
text is equal to ref so this is
something you can call this as a
variable I can call us anything I want
and I have reference to this in my
component now this is a functional
component right so we actually can't do
this so we need to turn this into a
class so class
stens react component and then make this
our vendor function so we're gonna keep
everything the exact same and we're
gonna get all this stuff from the props
and we're gonna return like that and
then down here we can add two curly
braces give that a save okay so now that
this is a react component class we can
use the this keyword so we're gonna be
setting this dot text equal to the
reference so now on my own press over
here I actually have reference to that
animation component so the animation
component whenever I press the text I
can have it also so up here but I can
here arrived before or after the on
press event what I can say this dot text
I think it's best buy the animation I
want let's say I want to bounce and then
here you specify the time I believe this
is milliseconds I don't know for sure so
800 milliseconds bounce so when I click
on eight because I have reference to it
here and I'm using it here it's gonna
bounce so there's nine bouncing here's
eight in now I can just do whatever
animation I want to hear it flash and
then I can specify the time I want to
see it and just have that every time I
push a button and that's much nicer to
see just you know responding to the
event for - you know and I think the one
I like is just having a nice subtle
pulse very just like 400 milliseconds
and sit just like a nice little subtle
bang after we click it we're like it's
very subtle you might not even notice it
actually but yeah you can pretty much
change it to any animation you want here
all the choices though if you come over
here to the docs you can specify the one
that you like the best
here they are
so bounce have a rubber band shake swing
the rubber bands kind of an interesting
one where it's just like zaps it rubber
band I almost picked this one but it's a
little bit too extreme actually it's not
bad I should know like the rubber band
it doesn't squeeze the container it just
squishes the number okay I'm gonna keep
that a rubber band I like the squishy
numbers okay clear next thing we you
might want to animate is this guy right
so we're gonna follow the same steps we
did over here so we can import animation
up here so import star as animal from
the library if you haven't seen this
before this just instead of expanding it
like we're doing right here this is just
putting an object so we can access all
of them so instead what we could have
done is text I believe but that I'll
conflict up here so and you might forget
that this is an animation text so this
seems like a better way to do it okay so
we can just animate the first one or you
can animate any one like again we can
make this thing and well we can make
this thing pulse all the time by adding
that whole bit of text they had up here
for the pulse or we can make it slide up
and down let's try that so it does it
what five times huh well I might be
actually kind of cool every time you
click a button it slides up
let's see if we can get that to work is
there an another slide so slide in up is
what I want to happen I believe so again
I want to have reference to this text so
we're gonna be using this dot ref or
setting the reference so when I click an
eight we make the animation pop up up
here too or you know whatever button I
want to trigger the animation here so
again we wrap to make this a class so
react app extends the icon component and
we're gonna render and we'll get rid of
those I'm gonna say Const and we're
gonna just get these from the props and
here we shouldn't return what we had
before and add this at the bottom and
then we can get rid of this stuff oops
just these props up here and I want to
give the reference to it so Rath I don't
say this dot text one is equal to so now
I can access this down here so for
example maybe I only want that to happen
when I hit a number so like maybe I do
54 and I do 23 I hit plus I want to
slide down in that case actually we'd
want to have the second one slide down
not the first one so like let's make
this in animation text - and a little
text and here we're gonna reference it
and I'm gonna get call this text - so
then down here whenever I press will say
plus for example we can call the
operation to happen as usual and then I
want to run text to dot slide and down
so we'll see if this works I want to
slide down I have no idea if this
actually will 6525 plus okay so actually
I do want text one because I what it's
gonna look like it's gonna slide from up
there so 98 enter 2 plus broke this our
code anyway and we broke it with an
animation I think does the plus need hey
let's see if I don't animate so clear 98
enter 5 - that works
98 enter 3 plus with a get a 0 here I
think I'm guessing the slide down oh we
didn't specify for how long
let's try like 500
I'm missing the slide down is just
messing it up let's just try like flash
that might look nice or it might just be
weird
interior five and okay that's just
broken let's see I'm gonna do no
animation 65 and here four plus we broke
it
oh I need to specify the text my bad we
can have this anim slide and down so I
forgot that we were passing and are on
press the text so we need to pass that
there okay 54 65 plus that actually look
pretty cool 98 + + - 17 slides down
could have a flash so what flash looks
like a 7/16 cool
I think either those look pretty good
and there's a whole host of other
animations you guys can play with but
yeah so now you can just go and add the
animation to whatever you want right now
we don't have it like on the - for
example or any of others but we could
add an animation to any one we want
right we just pick the thing we want to
cause the animation we pick our
animation for how long and that's it so
I'll let you guys now I had animations
to your projects and let you play around
with this and see the ones you like I
think what we'll do next is we'll put
this on the app store or at least Xbox
store and in the regular app store and I
think I'll probably just use the version
from last video without the animations
since I could see where these might be a
little bit annoying for a real
calculator but this gives you guys an
idea of how to add animations to your
project and now you can see how easy it
is to add these things and especially
using this library that's it for this
video guys see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
