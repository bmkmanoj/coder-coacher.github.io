going to be adding a button right here
a floating buttons like scroll and I'll
be able to click it and then I can add a
new auction so to do this we're going to
be using one databases component called
a fab have a click this add just a
little nice little button here so we're
just going to literally copy this
example here and we're just going to add
fab to our import at the top so again
today I'm going to be working in routes
view auctions and view and then here I'm
just going to try adding this tab here
so you get a lot of red notice in their
example and they click on it all this
stuff pops up we don't need that that's
all these buttons in the middle are you
can remove those just eat one and then
we can come over here and then just tab
everything oops
tab everything over and then we don't
need an on press for now get rid of the
position the default is the right one
this looks good
active we're always going to keep it
active basically just paring this down
to what we need so come back over here
close up refresh we'll see what it looks
like and notice it's not here but if we
scroll to the bottom we see it here it's
kind of like glued down here you notice
we have this icon worried about the icon
in a second first I would like to see
this right here
the whole time as I scroll I want to see
it so the way we're going to get that to
pop up there is by using a container
element and we're just going to wrap the
content with container
and we're going to move our fat button
right here and okay so now we have a
container the container we have content
here and then at the very bottom we have
our fab so now if i refresh we see the
button here all the time and that's
exactly we wanted so now as I scroll
notice stays where it's at and I can
click on that and then it will take me
to would like to take it to the next
page and look we have a little error
here - that is must be aligned
containing the opening tag just one more
I'll get ever yes Flint was just angry
so what I'd like to do is change this
icon now and what I did is I just went
to their icon component here and I saw
that says it uses the ionic icon so I
just looked those up and what we really
like is this plus and we nice like a
nice thick plus which is a Tyrael design
if you'd like a different one you can
scroll through here and see what the
different icons are I'm going to use
this material design material design +
and so to do that you do material design
you have to prefix it and then add I
believe and notice how this is of icon
is inside of the fab that's important
okay refresh and cool now we see the
plus that's it
so that's all I want to do for this
video I just wanted to set up this
button in this corner here that looks
nice in the next video we'll be wiring
this up to a new page so then I click on
this it takes me to a new page and I can
then fill out a form and create a new
auction so that's it for this video guys
and I'll see the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
