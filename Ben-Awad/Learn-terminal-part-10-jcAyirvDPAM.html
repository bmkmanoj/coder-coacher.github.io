tutorial for the command line or
terminal it is piping it is very cool
very powerful and lets you combine
different commands so let's go straight
into it so basically what it allows you
to do is take the output of one command
and put it into another so for example
LS the output is this right well let's
say I want to take that output and I
want to send it to something else
I would pipe it when you do this pipe
and they could do a different command
for example less and notice how it puts
all of them in a less now why would I
want to do this in this case and makes
more sense if you have like a lot of
files you're looking at like for example
notice when I did LS - a it showed a ton
of files so what I can do is I can do LS
- a it gives me all this output I can
pipe it all up - less so though I do the
pipe and then less and I just hit enter
and then it takes me to this basically
less that I can then look at I can go up
and down with J and K and I can't space
and I can just look at all the files
that LS files and folders that LS is
showing me that's pretty cool another
use you'll see is for example maybe I'm
looking for a specific file that meets
the criteria maybe I want to grep you
know maybe I'm looking for I don't know
all the things that start with M's or
maybe you're looking for so in this case
the directories and like it I don't know
I don't know what else you grab for I
haven't grabbed as much for LS
would say the most common use of piping
is for with the use of something called
PS which shows your processes I use this
a lot so the command PS just shows some
processes this is like a very smallest
if you do PS ox it shows those all
processes running like on your system in
a lot of times when I'm coding I'll
wonder if like if I left a database
connection or a database server up or
something so what I can do is I can type
PS ox so as you saw this dumps this huge
thing to the screen if I want to look
through that again I could pipe that to
less if I wanted to and I could look at
it a little easier I mean this isn't
that much better but it'll send it to
less but the thing I can do is I can
graph it and then I can do like for
example if I'm looking for Postgres I
can do PS ox pipe and then I'm grepping
and then I'm looking for this so as you
can see it returned me two lines and I
can see I have some Postgres instances
running right now and I can be like oh
crap I left those on let me go turn
those off so it allows you to look and
that can be pretty helpful if you're
newer to basically programming and using
frameworks and databases this won't come
up as much and using the pipe you won't
need to use as much this is kind of a
very niche again tool but it's very cool
being able to basically chain commands
together another use you may have for it
is for example I'm just going clear real
quick there's a command called sort so
for example I could do LS and pipe that
to sort and it sorts the output for me
and as you saw I can do - a I can sort
it and there's no you can sort you can
pipe more than once so I'm going to pipe
it to sort and then I'm gonna pipe it to
less so what's happening is it's getting
all look it's spitting out LS then it's
sorting it for me then
it's putting in a less prompts I can go
through so notice how starting with a
here I don't know why webstorm I guess
it doesn't I don't know how its sorting
with the dots it's kind of interesting I
think its capital W I think it's
capitals go before lowercase I'm
guessing but as you can see there's
aides BC so it's been sorted another one
you'll see is unique to Gera duplicates
so to show you that I'm just gonna go to
my downloads real quick and I'm going to
create some files ABCD yeah so if I do
an LS LS and I pipe it to sort you'll
see it just looks like this now let's
say I create some new clips touch ABC
again so when I do LS sort I now get Oh
what the heck Oh because I touch the
same thing let me make ders Oh what am i
doing you can't do it without us
I'm sorry we should be doing this with a
file so if I echo a new line be a new
line a new line see okay and we're gonna
put this in a file so for example Q and
if I cat Q well that or doesn't do new
lines do I need to do - are maybe sorry
like cat Q nope doesn't work for that
either so what I'm trying to do is put a
new line to show you how unique works so
I'm just gonna go over to what's this
called Visual Studio code real quick and
create a new file so what I'm trying to
show you is let's say have a couple
words like line 1 line 2 line 3 ABCD and
let's say we have some dude it's a B
DB but they're in different orders line
one and I'll just save this to my
downloads so this will be do okay so
let's just clear clear this if I do an
LS okay so I'm in my downloads folder I
have dupe here and I just want to clear
up some stuff so I'm going to do it
remove RF and I'm just gonna do get rid
of everything and I don't want to get
rid of dupe so everything that starts
with an A
everything that searches a b c and that
cleared up a garbage okay so i have du
pere and if we just cat dupe we'll see
we have a a b and we want to know if we
sort this cat dupe and we can just pipe
it to sort and they'll sort it for us we
see a a b b b c and let's say for
whatever reason we want to get rid of
duplicates you could do unique and
notice how that will cut out the
duplicates for you so you're able to
chain these pipes as many times as you
want this we print out the cat week when
we cat dupe it prints out what's in dupe
which is what we wrote right here then
it sorts it for us and then once it's
sorted it's in that I'll put the unique
and unique gets rid of duplicate lines
so it kills double A's double B's and
double d's and lets us just see the
output and then from there if you want
to we could then grep for the word line
if we wanted to and we just get the word
lines that get line so as you can see
you can do all kinds of combinations of
commands together and get creative for
depending on what your situation needs
when you're programming all kinds of
things can come ups whatever it could be
useful
so piping can be incredibly powerful and
when it comes in handy it really comes
in handy so you learned how to use pipe
you learned what PS does PS it just
brings up a basic processes that are
happening that you started in your shell
so right now I don't really have much
goes into much you do PS a UX or aux it
will bring up more system processes
they're going all over and then you can
then pipe greps which is very helpful
you can pipe anything but we were piping
graft and you can look for different
things we could look for log D you could
look for you know different processes on
your computer that you're wondering if
they're running and check on that and
then you also learned about the soar
function in the unique function which
you use commonly when looking at the
output a file so we cat it doop and then
we sorted it and then we unique tit to
get rid of duplicates so that's some
cool stuff you can do with pipes I hope
that made sense
again piping can be a more confusing
topic if you have questions do let me
know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
