react native tip in case you were
suffering like I was so randomly the
Iowa simulator was super slow more slow
than average slow on random operations
some things took extra long for no
reason it would pretty much just freeze
up and I thought it was maybe my code
but when running it on Android or a
physical device it would not happen and
I'll show you guys what I'm talking
about so in my app you can click on
guess this is just an example one I made
and click on a little card and then you
can click this button and what pops up
is a little alert now you sell that slow
that's not absurdly so that's fine that
was fading in there but what's really
slow is me trying to click on this
button so you that was me clicking on it
and hopefully could hear my clicks I was
clicking on it nothing happens and it's
like gonna be like this for maybe an
hour ten more seconds maybe 20 seconds
and the reason for it is just this
little window is still loading and I
wasn't sure why random other things that
this would occur with until I found a
little setting up here in debug there's
this thing called slow animations and
for my Xcode or iOS simulator it was on
by default and that was what's causing
this super slowness there we go finally
I can push okay here but now I'm gonna
show you guys with this slow animations
turned off and was refresh exact same
operations but the window pops up
immediately and you can push okay
immediately without a problem
so if your iOS emulators having that
make sure you come over here to debug
turn off little animations hopefully
that'll help you yeah but all right
let's click into this and did I break my
app let's give it a second to load
there we go all right click on this come
that and pops up immediately I can push
okay so it's ignore my a super buggy app
in general but you can see that window
pops up and I can push okay right away
so yeah if you're experiencing the same
thing with iOS emulator that might be
your problem make sure to take that off
so it doesn't happen to you
hope that helps some people thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
