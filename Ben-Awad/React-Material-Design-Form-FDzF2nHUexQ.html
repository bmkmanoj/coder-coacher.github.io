form and react just using no other
libraries just the basics and it looks
like this you can type stuff and it'll
pop up down here below and I showed you
how to connect these two together so you
see what you see here down here and what
I want to do now is show you how you can
add material design to this form so it
looks a little bit nicer and just go
from there so we're going to follow
along with the installation of material
UI you need to install the library and
then add this inject half of an podium
so here's the code here I'm going to pop
over to the command line shut down the
server and start installing stuff so the
first thing we need is material UI but
we also need this react tap of plug-in
because they need to do UI actually uses
that and then when they're done with
that we can actually just get started so
we actually need to go to our right here
our main page I guess we should just do
act yes no I find this is actually we
should do in our app because you are
forms that we need to add a material UI
just a little provider so copy this
I'm going to paste it in here and we're
going to separate split those and then
we're going to wrap our component like
that we also need to make sure we call
this I'll copy that your real comment
put that below our imports okay like I
said we need to wrap our whole thing in
this new theme provider and then our app
can actually use the nice material UI
components that they have all right all
right so now anywhere in our application
now as long as it's between these two
tags we can either tell you I think now
in our form we can use material UI so
I'm going to go to the component section
here and I can go to fields text field
in particular is what we want and the
real reason I want to start doing
material you eyes I want to show you
guys how to handle errors so the nice
area fields which we'll be using later
but for now I like I don't like it
popping up as much I like like this is
my favorite one where it's fixed so
we're going to copy fixed floating label
text that's the one I want so actually
before we copy that we want to copy the
import - so we're importing our text
field and now we're going to copy and we
wanted the six floating so pay Sekai in
can get rid of that okay so I'm going to
copy the name here hit text I'm going to
put first name and we'll just put first
name for both of those and we can get
rid of that same thing and then value
and unchanged we'll grab now I believe
text field we can actually the
on this page notice the props are I
believe there's a non change yeah
and cool as the event and the new value
believe the event shells have the value
as well if not we can change it there's
a problem but now we can just copy this
all the way down so now I'm going to
have a last name here and then we can
get rid of those that last name and text
and I actually want to real quick
through this just want to come over here
start the server so NPM start and make
sure we actually see the material design
make sure we have no errors before we go
and change everything so this looks like
it's in favor for the server to load up
lots done we should see our field and we
do so I can start typing Bob and cool
notice how it integrates quite nicely so
I'm going to go ahead and add that to
username email all the rest of them that
way we kind of the whole form look at
nice so if a username username and you
guys can change the context and whatnot
actually want to give it a different
description at all username and we can
get rid of that same thing with email
and by the way you can use you can set
the type of that type the email if you
want to I'm not going to but it actually
provides a little bit more restriction
on what the user can type all right so
you email here and then last but not
least our password and I believe we can
just put type password and it will go
ahead and hide it when we're typing oops
not hide password
okay now we have all those fields popped
over to material design we have user
name cool so first name last name
username email password and look like
password doesn't pop up though if you
have a material you'll need that anymore
at the bottom here it will show us how
we can tell it we want to hide it
we don't here style type specifies such
as password oh I didn't set the type to
password that's why now let's see if
password makes your password is blocked
here cool it is and now I want to
actually get a nice button as well so
let's come over here to buttons slap
button again raised button the grades
button looks nice through copy that
and you'll know this with material
design orbital UI they have you
importing things like this as opposed to
doing something like this having like
the text field and the raised button
from material do I write I mean I didn't
spell out I in spell out text field and
raised button here but if we want it we
could do it like this too but this is
actually more efficient so that's why
you'll see the material design
documentation doing it like that ok look
at our raised button down here so read
button and let's see how they do it to
raise button
you know label and a style label is
primary for us we're going to say submit
and we're going to say primary is true
we don't need any style but we do want
an on-click so let's copy that over here
oops and we actually need to
coppy like that okay now we have our on
click and then we're saying on a primary
button and we were the text is going to
be submit and cool now we see our stuff
we can sighs been getting hit submit
clear the form cool so now we have
material design added to our form and
won't be showing you guys in the next
video it's how you can actually make
requests to a server so when I submit
this maybe I submit to a server to
create a new user and then if there's
any heirs we can actually like I was
showing you guys earlier pop up this
some red text and you can be like hey
this is a required field like if I'm
only typing this we don't want them to
leave all these fields blank we can you
know tell them hey those skills were
blank so that's it for this video guys
coming up soon we will be adding
basically air validation to our form so
thanks for watching and I'll see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
