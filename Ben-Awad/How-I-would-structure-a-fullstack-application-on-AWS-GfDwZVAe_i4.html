application that I would use and what I
would put where I basically separate out
it out into the cog front s3 elastic if
you're not too familiar with elastic
beanstalk under the hub to so it just
makes it elastic being Roku
it's a QuickStart helps you get set up
really bad so I would use that which
uses ec2 so that's why these those
receipt to here so here's how this would
work so I'm splitting up so this is my
Express server it's going to sit on
elastic plug and then I have my Postgres
sequel database on artis and I would
have react on an s3 and cloth now
CloudFront what this guy does and here
is the flow of so it's going to go from
cloud front cloud front is basically
Satori so this is its own thing this has
a URL to it to it actually all three of
these each has a separate URL it says a
you know URL access database URL to
access the website so cloud fronts of s3
and basically I believe it helps it
performance when you have a lot of users
I'm using I actually haven't used cloud
from before but I have for you know when
you have a users spreading this three
efficiently and handling requests
evidently so but I have used these three
before I want to be sitting up
CloudFront soon with this but that's
something I do want to try a good to
have in front but again this is
literally just for routing nothing to do
with you could run it without cloud
front omits and then s 3 s 3 sites on so
react if you're using create reactor
which I like to use you can actually
that is you can create the script HTML
CSS files from that interview which
really is really nice it loads really
faculty like that
and so really well you can also put any
type of website on s3 just static HTML
which react lets you you nice that were
able to put this on s3 so this is
running on its own SSDs too
PCs right if we have just a static react
application that talk to a database we
can just run s3 and this could be rain
this is all you need for a react but the
part here elastic beanstalk easy to ec2
is basically a server key it's a
computer that you can run anything on
right and I'm be running my expels
expressed wrong here
are there okay so express is going to be
running on this for the request from s3
and one thing you can actually say a
near lastic Beanstalk only take requests
from your s3 from that and make it very
secure which is nice and then is where
you can put relational I believe it's
relational data store this is where you
can store database stuff so this is the
post I seek will be running on so
elastic Beanstalk and again Express is
where graph to go for elastic Beanstalk
it will be running Express and Express
on that book both of these so that's how
I would set the best if I were to Trant
like you know switch this over so big
individual important parts RDS which is
its Express which is his own thing and
s3 which is own thing late individually
I could set up RDS to just query it I
could set up just Express and you know I
could go to that I just three separate
entities and then we're basically
they're talking acting all together
which is kind of neat so yeah that's how
I set up with Amazon thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
