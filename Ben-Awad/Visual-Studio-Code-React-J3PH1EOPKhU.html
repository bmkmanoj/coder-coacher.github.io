visuals to your code for pretty much all
my JavaScript development especially
really good with react and really like
it this is coming from usually I use
them so it is quite a big change but
with one plug-in I use is and I'm going
to go through my employees and show you
why I like it is the vent plugin this
makes it usable for me basically because
now I cannot use an IDE or a text editor
that does not have them key bindings
that's just the way I program now so
this makes it usable for me and the
things that make it really nice these
two plugins here prettier and es lint
and this is not just for a year this is
prettier es lint which is different this
I'll tell you is I get so starting with
EF lint this basically just goes through
your code and tells you what you're
doing wrong so I have my can come over
here my es lint you know it reads this
file my es went RC this is basically my
rules and then as you know it just done
as I'm coding if I code something badly
a redline pops up like I don't know what
fog and like mineral line will pop up to
any of you like EF lip this is something
bad you're doing and then you can get
rid of it so that's pretty much but most
textures have that that's not that's
nice and I like it but it's not the main
reasons the main reason I am using
Visual Studio code is this plug-in right
here I absolutely love it it's called
prettier excellent I had a hard time
trying to set this up and them and other
IDs so I just said you'll see your codes
pretty nice let's just use that because
it has this nice plugin that's really
sweet so what's this what does this do
so prettier if you don't know what this
is it basically makes your JavaScript
look really nice and that's really
important to me actually because I
really like when I'm coding my code to
look formatted nicely so I can read it
faster and then I'm coding faster and
prettier helps me do that and why like
prettier ZZ this that I've been a lot of
text editor but not in combination
yes one per dear sometimes it breaks yes
Lent for example some of the prettier
rules may not be like it changes the
formatting of your code so like maybe
see how this is for my like this maybe
it reformats it to look like this or
something whatever and an es lint
doesn't like it right because the eslint
has rules too so what this plug-in does
is it it runs the prettier for matter it
format your code all nicely and then
runs it through es one six and then it
fixes everything so it's compatible with
the estimate and this is really nice
when programming and the only other
really setting I use is format on save
so this is a setting I have for Google
Co code so it runs this pretty recent
every time I save this file just
basically format it for me and I really
like it so let me just demo how this
works some coding let's say I have a
variable and I'm creating stuff so the
and then maybe other I'll but look how
ugly this is formatted this is before I
save so I'm just going to save the file
and notice how format it'll nice you
notice how to format the whole page like
to undo
notice how state was all like this as
well it makes sure it's not doing that
fold it under look on my code formatting
I just love this plug-in so much so
every time I save it it runs it picks my
stuff now I don't have to worry about
like if I'm coding stuff and I forget to
tab something over normally I have to
like come back yeah oh crap I forgot to
pull this up go through here and it's
just a lot of extra work have to do to
format this all myself it's like it's
going to format nicely like this because
I'm going to now add more and I just
don't like doing this right let's
suppose I forgot to put a comma right
I'll add the Colin for me and just I
just really like this boy and so does
the main reason why I'm using visuals to
your code now Visual Studio code is
pretty nice just
general I'm using the default color
scheme I think cloche game looks nice to
react and it's pretty pleasant to code
with its spinner I'm not missing them
too much using this for react especially
when it will match my code makes it look
so nice and the vehm you later is good
enough it's not amazing good enough
though and I can use it so I highly
recommend this if you're doing a type of
react development get the EF Slim plugin
for sure and prettier your cellent these
make it so nice to program that's it for
this video guys if you have any more
questions about my visual studio setup
you can always leave a comment below
there's not too much customization I'm
doing I'm pretty much just using the
base and looks nice about visual studio
coders are always improving it like they
just had an update and now I have these
cool little icons on the side here and I
have this nice little mini-map thing I
don't know how much alive she's and then
yeah but that's kind of nice
and I'm actually sure these settings
were default I just don't know there's
like a billion settings I could go
through here and you can search through
some nice settings I might do that
sometime
yeah that's it for this video guys and
I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
