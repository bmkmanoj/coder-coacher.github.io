you how to set up a local WordPress
website on your own computer now you may
be wondering why darlin on my computer
don't you want it on the Internet well
the reason why you want to first put on
your computer is because it's easier to
develop a wordpress website on your
computer and then later transfer it to
your to the internet basically there's
two reasons you want to first start off
on the local on your computer the first
is whenever you make a change it's not
live on the website so people can't be
using your website while you're
developing it the same reason is it's a
lot easier to develop when it's on your
computer whereas if is on another server
so if it's like for example if you have
it on godaddy hosting and go daddy's
hosting your website every time you want
to change file for your website you're
going to have to download it off of a
godaddy you're going to change it and
then you have to upload it back to your
hosting so that's two extra steps
whereas if you're on local all you have
to do is change the file and
automatically updates you don't have to
upload or download anything so it's a
very handy so a lot of word press
developers do this they do it on their
local and it's very easy to set up local
websites and then you can later move it
up to the online on the internet so
that's what I'm going to show you how to
do today so the first thing we're going
to do is download Sam and this is for
Windows and Linux and for a mac and you
just Google examp X a MPP it'll be the
first link and then we're just going to
download it so choose your operating
system I'm on a Windows computer so I'm
just going to download that and it'll
download a little dot exe gonna wait
till that's done and just open that up
and so this is going to be a zamp it
will basically come
apache and my sequel and what this will
do is this will act like godaddy on our
computer and it will post our website
and just from our computer so once
that's finished downloading it'll open
up we're just going to allow it to run
on our computer all right you'll see
this little will step up when the window
will come up or just click Next you want
to keep all these checked the main ones
we need our patch you my sequel but you
might as well keep the rest next and
then right here you want to choose where
you want it to be installed I recommend
just keeping the default c / zamp click
Next and okay you see ya I had an old
Sam um install so if i just come right
here and remove that if you get that
little air just come to your c drive and
remove their azam folder okay now click
Next and I would uncheck this learn more
unless you want to do bit nah me but I
recommend not doing that and click next
and then it's going to install this
takes a little time so I'm going to let
this finish installing and then I'll be
right back installing and and I want to
make sure it's starts now I'm gonna
start this control panel this is how
you'll actually turn your server on and
off so you should see a little window
like this pop up and if you look right
here I would suggest pinning this to
your taskbar if you want this you'll be
using this a lot to start up and stop
your server so we want to use apache in
my sequel so we're just going to click
start for both of these this starts the
server and that's basically all we have
to worry about for servers
and if this says it's blocked or Apache
doesn't work for some reason if you have
skype running make sure to quit out of
that sometimes skype uses the same port
as Apache does and that can mess that up
so once this is green you know it's
working it's good so we're just going to
close that off for now and now we want
to go to that directory that that Sam
folder will say so mine was installed to
the C Drive so see this is where the
default one is scroll down and should
see for called Sam I'm just going to
click that we want to we see all these
files we want to go into HD htdocs right
here flip into that and you'll see some
of these default files we don't need any
of this stuff right here so we just
delete it all oops okay so next we want
to do is we're going to just make the
website so create a folder and then name
it what you want the website to be named
don't worry about putting ww just put
the name of the website calm or what
everyone so pretty exists this example
let's say I'm going to say blue shoes
calm is the website I want to make this
you want to make sure this matches the
URL you want on your website so blue
shoes.com so this type in the URL right
here worry about putting HTTP or any of
that and then this will actually if you
come into your browser right here and
you just type localhost like that you
should see a little file now and this is
a website right now so right now there's
nothing in here but we're going to add
WordPress in just a second so you should
see once you make this older you should
see that there so the next thing I do is
actually install WordPress and put it in
this folder so we just want to go to
wordpress.org not calm and we just want
to download
press ok so it should install a little
zip folder and once that's done stalling
we're just going to extract it and we're
just going to come back to downloads
we're just going to extract this I like
to extract it right here and once that's
finished extracting we're just going to
copy all the contents of the word press
download and we're just going to paste
it into that website ok so click into
here we're just going to copy all this
so this is the core wordpress files and
we're just going to come back to our C
Drive go back tues am htdocs and then
the website we have we're going to paste
it in take a minute to copy over files
now we're ready to just start
configuring the WordPress and just by
the way if you want to make another
website you can and it's the exact same
process each create a new folder and
this will create another website right
here and you just want to paste in the
WordPress download go through the steps
we're about to take so interested up an
hour don't need it ok so we have our
wordpress install in there now we need
to configure it so if you come back to
the index we're your local host just
click on this now and you'll see now a
little wordpress symbol and just pick a
language you want i'm going to do
english and ok so now we need to get the
create a database and get the database
username database password our host and
table prefex so let's go and this is
just the default stuff but we actually
have to make the database to do that
we're just going to go to localhost /
PHP myadmin
okay so you should get paged like this
and for some reason this doesn't come up
make sure this is cream you have my
sequel right here ok so now I want to
come over here to databases and we just
want to create a database so blue shoes
I'm just gonna call it blue shoes and
you just put right here keep this at
collation and create alright cool and
our database is created so we're just
going to come over back to our we don't
need this anymore come back to our
WordPress paper here and the name of our
database is called blue shoes and then
the user name so by default username is
root and the password is blank you can
change this later but we're not going to
worry about that just leave it put in
ruse username password is blank for now
keep local host the same and then you
can change this table prefix but I
recommend just keeping it work WP for
now and then you can always change it do
something else later so click Submit and
if you put in all the correct
information it should come to this page
if you didn't you can it'll be like oh
no and just try putting in the
information again and creating another
database and then click run install and
this will actually make the WordPress
and we're wordpress install onto your
website now it's almost done all you
have to do is fill out this information
for the site title and this is like the
name of your website so follow up boo
issues and then this is a username
password to actually log in to WordPress
this is for your use only so pick one
you want put in the information put in
your email and this email um it's
important actually putting in a real one
because once you move this to the live
website you'll actually get emails in
case your site goes down or something
and then you want to make sure this is
allow search engines index the site for
now this is not going to
because it's a local website but once
you put this on the internet you want
Google to find your website and i
actually have before uncheck this box
and you forget to turn it back on when
you've moved to the live site sometimes
and so for a while google was not
indexing one of my websites so make sure
you have this clicked so you just don't
forget to do it later and then just
click install WordPress and so this is
the last step and we're press should
finish installing it'll add all this
information and should take you to the
wordpress dashboard and then you're all
done okay and just click login and then
enter the information just put login and
here you are the worst wordpress
dashboard and congratulations you have
yourself a wordpress website locally
installed on your computer and right
here we can go visit the site and as you
this URL up here is localhost / blue
shoes com alright so this is the website
very cool and you can go ahead and just
build out this website and then and a
future video will actually show you how
to put it on the Internet bring it on
there so also don't forget you can make
as many websites as you want following
these steps you just create an hour
folder and do the same steps and you can
have multiple websites hosted on your
computer so that's how this works thank

questions about this or rant any
