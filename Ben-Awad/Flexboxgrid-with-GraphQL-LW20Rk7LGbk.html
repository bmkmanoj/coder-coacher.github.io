have gotten this little board set up
here where we have a bunch of items and
I believe I could be able to type create
them I do and they pop down here I think
the list is getting too long now yeah
that you can't even see them do you see
or maybe like there's an action in there
so we're just gonna continue off for a
reason left off
can I read prop the idea of undefined
encountered two children's the same IDs
it's all kinds of problems I thought we
got this working and refreshing okay I
thought I broke it and I don't see the
new ones that I created so I'm gonna go
ahead and we can see what we with heirs
are in the back end here can every
proper your ID of undefined for creed
suggestion and auerbach a lot of
resolver so I'm going to go ahead and
open up this code in Visual Studio code
and we can check what's going on
so this is gonna be great suggestion
resolver so go to resolvers this is
gonna mean crazy suggestion user ID oh
it's been a week since I've logged in so
our login session is has expired
so let's log back in I have no idea what
I logged it what I use for my login I
always create like a bob but user
account of and I'm programming so I'm
gonna sue my I made it here so that no
idea if that worked I think we didn't
put confirmation into this I don't think
I should really add that though why does
it take so long to load that that's
weird Bob all right we see Bob at the
bottom so that was a problem so this is
all good and well let's do that first
thing that I was talking about though
when I first log in if it's a successful
login I'd like to get redirected so
let's put this here put chrome here put
the terminal there all right so this is
gonna be in our login page here so if
there is a token and a refresh token
that means we successfully logged in I'm
gonna say if token and refresh token I
want to redirect and I guess for now
will redirect to the home page which is
just that and to redirect we're gonna be
using the history that we get passed in
the props this not props history and so
we're gonna do slash and that'll take us
to the home page now this history
is passed in thanks to react router and
we come over to our index here for login
to be able to get that you just have to
get the props here pass the props in
alright so now let's see what a bad and
a good Logan looks like I want to go to
slash login when that boots
ok so Bob this is a bad login we're
getting Val on in here good now if I
actually type it correctly submit this
stuff props that history is not a
function okay so something wrong is
happening because we should have those
props passed in through this so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
that page login and I'm just gonna
console dot log props oh no not I'm
supposed to push I was doing it wrong so
it probably worked I'm just doing it
wrong so Bob at Bob calm Bob password
and bam all right so we successfully now
redirect users when they log in that's
nice now I want to work on the layout of
this page too so I should be able to
create new boards and I should see
multiple boards on a page now if you
guys remember I'm using neutral UI to
get these components here
the thing about material UI is it
actually doesn't have anything to help
with laying out stuff and I don't I'm
not very
at CSS so what I like to use is this
thing called flexbox grid so let's just
open up material you line go to
components in case we're gonna do any
more components
how about open but this flexbox grid is
what I'm going to use so if I go to the
github page and what this allows us to
do is basically make grids with our
stuff and just like with grids you can
basically make whole layouts if you look
at me layouts they're basically all
grids we'll just have a grids inside of
grids so now we can install flexbox grid
here just through MPM or through yarn so
and now in my index page and now just so
you guys know that is only this is just
adding CSS classes so then I'm gonna
then add these classes right here to my
code and now I'm gonna have to import
that and now importing this is a little
bit interesting because it's flexbox
grid is the name of the component but we
actually need to go into we're not you
know importing this like a regular
JavaScript module because it's actually
CSS that we want so we have to go into
the distribution folder and then there
there is a folder with CSS in it and if
we just go into node modules we do not
need to see all those node modules and
what was it called flexbox grid flexbox
grid distribution we can see we want to
get this been CSS flexbox great and then
CSS flexbox great document dot CSS and
then that will be imported into a
project so we can now use that so now on
my home page here we're rendering a
single board but i want to refactor this
now
and I'm going to refactor by the
homepage is gonna fetch all the boards
and then feed that data into board so
instead of our board component here
being the one that is come you know
fetching the board we're gonna get rid
of that so we don't need compose anymore
so we're not going to be fetching by an
ID anymore instead we're gonna just pass
in boards
all right so name and suggestions so
const ford and then board will have a
name and suggestions we shouldn't have
to do default values because we should
get that and then we'll get this stop
board so we're getting the name and the
suggestions now from the props and we're
ganging this board prop so we need to
actually pass that in everything else
should be good though this mutate should
work the same way but now we wrapped our
update function is going to be different
because now we're gonna update a
different thing parsing token that's
fine okay
so in our queries instead of gift board
what I want to do is get all boards so
graphical and actually easily on 3030
that's where my graph kill server is
alright so I wanna grab all boards and
doesn't look like I have that so I'm
going to pop over here to my back in and
create it real quick so query called all
boards and it's going to return a list
of ports
and we're just gonna come into our
resolvers here and now we can copy get
bored do all boards and we can actually
there's nothing you have to change you
because we're gonna do a joint monster
for this as well now we can come in to
join monster and we're gonna get all
boards and we don't even need a where
clause actually yeah I don't I don't
even think we need to do anything here
because I don't need a where Clause
because we're getting everything just a
total grab from the database where is
their resolve their yeah I think this is
good to go we're doing find we should be
creating and finding all the boards so
I'm gonna just test this out real quick
and make sure to working how I like
before I actually call in the front end
so all boards from here I can get ID
name and suggestions in suggestions I
can get ID and then text alright so cool
um looks like we have one board here
with a bunch and that's it so an ID name
we're getting everything and we're
gaining array of it I'm gonna copy this
and we're gonna come over here and I'm
gonna do an export Const all boards
query and I want to change the name of
this see how the name here is its name
of the same name here that conflicts
list stuff it makes our update function
have to be a little different I like
this little cleaner if I do this at
query at the end for naming these okay
so now this is the query I want to
execute on this home page
so that's good we're an import graph QL
from react Paulo and then here we're
gonna have to create our component Const
home is equal to this at the bottom here
I will explore default graph QL passing
in our query that we want to run who you
want to run is all boards query and this
goes up a directory and convene queries
all boards query and then pass in our
component home and so now here we should
be getting a data object and I'm gonna
create a div here and then all we're
gonna do is we're gonna say data dot all
boards and now this should be a ray of
board to them back to us and we're going
to map and then for each board which
we'll call B we're gonna render a board
component with the key being B ID and
the board is gonna be B alright that
looks good this guy's complaining
unexpected token important default not
sure that's about missing prop type
validation we're gonna go ahead and turn
this rule off in my yes lint cuz I don't
plan on doing prop types because they
slow me down so I get to I know I didn't
react prop types this is how you turn
off
yes lint rules you don't like or don't
want to follow
all right now can close up
all right so grabbing the borage and are
passing the board into here let's see if
that renders can every property map of
undefined at first is gonna be at all
undefined so what I'm gonna do is set a
default value of empty array that way we
don't get undefined now let that refresh
can read propria name of undefined so
board is undefined so I'm gonna come
over here and I'm just gonna console dot
log this dot drops so you can see if
it's getting passed and properly
there's board and then there's mutate so
there's board weight it's there we have
board here name the board name
suggestions that looks like it's there
okay and that's why I was just expanding
it in broccoli that's better now if we
let that refresh its Dubourg so I either
put the board here I put the board here
I shouldn't do it both all right so
where this looks good
but our suggestion here is not going to
be working and the reason for that is
notice in our update what we're doing is
the query we're doing is get board query
now should be all boards query that's
the query it doesn't have any variables
so we can get rid of that so all boards
query and now we're gonna say new data
dot get board talk suggestions this
would be all boards dot query and we
actually need to pass we need to look
through this and find what board
position we are or we can pass it in the
props so I think that's what I'm going
to do so come back here this will just
be make it faster if I pass in the index
so I know exactly which guy actually
what am i doing
actually yeah that's right I was like
because I thought I was creating a board
at first but I'm not all I'm doing is
updating a suggestion and a board so I
need to know which board I'm updating
now I could loop through and check the
IDS but that's slower if I just know the
exact index so that we're getting the
exact index or gangsta the suggestion
and then we're pushing that suggestion
on here
and now what I can do is actually to all
boards query here actually now that's
fine I thought for a second I could
change this but I can alright this looks
good now let's try running that make
sure it works so now I'm gonna try doing
adding this suggestion can every
probably zero of undefined oh this
should be all boards so our query is
called all boards but if you actually
look at the query it's called all boards
here and all boards needs to match what
this value is
okay we should see I just I would have
thought last what I showed up but for
some reason did so first bad request
board ID required but none was provided
um alright let's look at why this is
happening
oh we're looking at the props for the
board ID we should be looking at board
died
okay now we see first cool so now this
is correctly refactored so now what this
will allow me to do is create more
boards and then we'll see the boards
just like kind of like take over your
individual things and before I create a
function so let's pass in here let's
write a commit message I'll pick
refactor board component to pass a board
in so now all I want to do is create one
more board just using this just so we
can get how it should be laid out then
once we fix that or get the layout how
we want it I'm gonna do programmatic
access of creating boards
okay I woulda thought the board showed
up it could be okay the board's at the
bottom here so did show up but I want is
more of like a side-by-side view and
that is where this comes in our flex box
so I'm going to create rows here and I
think I'm gonna make rows of four and
can't remember if I have a low - in here
or not we're gonna grab low - cos I love
lo - imported be listed okay it doesn't
look like I have low - there's the yarn
add low - so I want columns of 4 or Rosa
4 so I'm gonna say constant Rho is equal
to boards and then I
and what we're going to do is map the
boards here and this is gonna be a class
name is gonna be row and then let's see
when to wrap this board now and a div
okay
first let's show you guys why I'm doing
this
that way I can do low - thought chunk
passing in all boards now what groups of
four
now chunk is does exactly what you think
it does it basically just makes takes an
array and groups them into fourths so
then I'm gonna map that to row that way
in our row here we'll have rows of fours
and have rows of four will put row and
we want each to be at the same you know
call size so we're gonna copy this we're
gonna say div class name is equal to
that I'm gonna do threes oh eight evenly
splits up
and now for i-ight is not this simple
now I is gonna be have to be I I think
it's I times I to is to get the position
because well let's think about it so I
is gonna be 0 so 0 and this gonna be 1 2
3
nope I think it's just I plus I 2 we
might have to fix that later if we get a
problem
this is gonna be boards now and is there
anything else this is good expected
assignment okay
data data is missing in hey I put this
in react slash prop types react /o prop
types
still I was like I added that to the
slim filed ignore it okay well let's see
what this looks like
okay so now we have it in force if I go
ahead and create a bunch of these things
just to show you guys they're all called
second boards they're all nicely
sectioned into fourth cool and now let's
make sure this works that one didn't
work I tried doing B here and the B went
there so we're doing something wrong
it's gonna be x then I don't really want
to I'll go ahead and do the math if this
it doesn't work on this one oh it won't
work on this one because I is gonna be 0
at first so it's all gonna be 0 things
could be a I plus 1 know
okay let's just do the math okay so we
have 0 1 2 3 so this is what the what
this is what I 2 is gonna be oops I 2
and in this grouping we're gonna have
four five six
okay so I 2 is gonna be equal to zero
and it's going to go to one is equal to
then it's going to go three and here
it's gonna equal 4 and so on
no it's not here let's copy this it's
gonna repeat itself
don't let me copy easily that's a shame
ok and this is I is gonna be zero for
this group I is equal to 1 so what I
need to do is come up with a formula
where we do something with I and I 2 and
it equals this value so for the first
one if we do I plus I 2 it works out the
problem is when we get to this it should
then now before oh it should be 4 times
I plus I 2
comment you out put this at the top for
nice little formula that we created
unexpected mix of no mix operations why
are they mixed I don't know I don't care
so now if I do this one this one this
one should they should probably should
have been doing different letters to be
sure but it looks like now we're working
good yeah alright so now we can add
stuff to all the boards correctly and we
have all the boards of laying out nicer
and we can scroll down to see more
boards so now we have a bunch of boards
what do we want next I guess now is a
good time okay so there's two things
pertinent one how do you create boards
too how do you create how do you vote I
want to be able to vote on these and
show the value of the vote and I want it
to be a real time too so you can see the
votes just go up and down as people are
doing them so that's gonna be cool the
voting thing is gonna take more work so
let's do creating a board first
what I'm thinking is I'll just put a
pop-up I might do the to fill out like a
dialog so this is a terrible design but
like I told you guys I am NOT a designer
at all what we'll do is we'll go ahead
and I'm just gonna have a button at the
top to trigger this
and I'm gonna have to create this into a
regular class so this a class um extends
react component render function and in a
render function will return this and we
can say Const this stuff props all right
letter e format it won't why I don't
know why it's not liking this
just keep coding state here we're gonna
have open dialogue is equal to false but
then when they click on the button it'll
be true there go sometimes when you just
keep can you coding my editor will fix
itself
and now I see the problem is there's a
semicolon there ok so when I click on
this raised button it's called on touch
tap is what it's called this is the on
click version for material UI we're
gonna say this dot said state open
dialog is equal to true
and then what we'll do is we'll actually
display a dialog so this is a button
they have what I will do is I'm actually
gonna create yeah let's put at the
bottom that makes more sense
I mean the dialog is going to be hidden
anyway but this will be create board
dialog and then we'll import that from
components tray for dialogue and then
let's go create that create board dialog
grab footage s we're have to keep
stating this so I'm gonna make this a
class
and we'll have a state and the two
things we're gonna have are the name
actually I think it's only name what you
can do her board will automatically get
your user ID based on the token that
we're storing for you
in local storage so let's put the
dialogue here we're gonna have to add a
text field that's fine open is gonna be
this stock drop stop open dialog
actually you know what this have props
that open is fine there we pass and that
in to be a stock prob stoppin dialogue
dialogue with actions we have this
actions things modal is false I don't
know exactly what it means I modal tell
us forced easier to use with action
dialogue looking outside at i/o and on
trigger okay that's fine to have it
false open on request closed handle
closed so we're gonna call handle closed
and here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say this thoughts that state
but name is gonna be equal to empty so
to clear it and then I'm gonna call this
table props and I'll close
and then we'll handle clothes here let's
say this thought sets state open dialog
equal false actually here well I'm gonna
call this handle I'm gonna call this
toggle open this will take whatever the
state currently is and we'll say state
open dialog it'll be the opposite of
what time the value is yeah so talk when
I call toggle open it's gonna take
whatever the open dialog is and do the
opposite of it that makes sense right
yeah I mean we will never call that from
here it'll just it'll always be handle
clothes so we'll just say call close
dialogue put this to false
zero in our career dialog so this will
call clothes dialogue and then we also
need a handle okay this is if they fill
out the form this one no there's one
with like a field in it yeah custom with
yeah we won't cancel and submit let's
copy their actions they have flat
buttons it's good with us on touch tap
will handle closed on submit we're gonna
handle okay primary is good this will be
submit this will be canceled handle okay
here we actually do a mutation to
actually create the board and then we
close the dialogue reset the state
that's good actually this is repeating
code code so I'll just go ahead and call
handle closed so after we do it a
mutation I'll just close so these are
our actions actions they're getting in
here that's good
so we should see these two now we need
to actually import flat button I'm
surprised we're not getting here we need
to import dialogue and flat button
we also need import graph QL round react
Apollo and we're gonna have to import
this will be create board mutation
problem going up one going into
mutations we haven't created this
mutation yet but we will then at the
bottom here we're going to export
default column graph QL create board
condition passing in our great board
dialogue all right this is looking good
our meanie create this function I'm
surprised it's not barking at us
I'm here we need to go ahead and mutate
which would be the stop drop stun you
Kate
we need to pass in variables only
variable we're gonna pass in is the name
so this thoughts state dot yeah if this
out state will have that and then we're
gonna have to have an update function so
we need to go ahead and get the all
boards query from queries you can go
ahead and copy the suggestion update and
it's basically gonna be the same thing
so we got a store all right and constant
new data store dot re-query all right so
now instead of creating a suggestion all
we're doing is we're adding a new board
on the boards gonna have a name equal to
this dot state name and we need to await
this so let's make this an async
function actually we don't need to await
this state is equal to this we don't
want to make this async that's fine
actually we can call handle closed right
away and close the dialog
but it's important I didn't want to
reset to stay here make it null and then
use it here so I'm gonna grab the state
here to save it so state dot name and
then suggestions is gonna be equal to an
empty object and you know what we don't
even have to worry about creating this
here we should be getting it from our
data object data dot create board so we
can just say create board dot creep
board I think should have it and I'm
gonna console.log trade board to make
sure we haven't actually created this
mutation yet create board mutation so
let's go ahead and do that and it might
change how our code is here but for the
most part I think this looks pretty good
actually we forgot a big thing let's do
that I need I
forgetting something we have to do text
fields one text field so I like this
this one so I'm just paste that in there
and go ahead and get the import get rid
of that we should not have equal true
it's the same thing as this
just putting primary on there in text
this will be named floating label we'll
just do the same thing values gonna be
this thought state name and then on
change it's gonna be equal to e we're
gonna this dot said state name is equal
heat
target daunting and sorry that should be
value now let's go ahead and create this
mutation great board so we can put this
at the bottom here export Const
and I don't think I actually have the
code for yet or the back end code let's
see so notice how we're passing in the
owner we should only have to pass in the
name so let's go ahead and fix that from
our schema and we should be picking up
the owner from kind of like how we're
doing create suggestion here we know
what the creator ID is because we're
passing it in the context because we
actually know who the user is because
we're passing a JWT token in so for us
owners maybe user ID and we're grabbing
user from the context here that's why
you saw a crash at the very beginning of
this beauty or not a user we weren't
logged in so you need to be logged in to
create stuff so we're gonna have to oh
we're gonna have to create some
authentication logic to make sure people
are not like not logged in doing stuff
because then they're gonna cause errors
so let's go ahead and put name here
which this is just the string so name
which is gonna be name and from that
should get everything pretty pie
good name and get the suggestions go
ahead and copy that create board
suggestions copy this here also good to
note this is actually I think it'll fail
because suggestions is going to be empty
are gonna be null it should be null and
the reason for that when we create the
board here it doesn't have any
suggestions it doesn't know if
suggestions exists so what we're gonna
do is this I'm going to say async conce
board this is what we get back and we're
going to just return whatever board is
and then suggestion suggestions is gonna
be an empty array and we just need to
await this all right now we're good to
you
and let's see if this works we just did
a lot of coding with not checking so
looks like we're have to restart the
server just because I can't find the
file
looks good close down surveys tab
getting all open
sitter versatile and yep just booting up
look at all this equalize Co that's
getting around there's equal code that's
equalize equalize is running it the
other thing I want to do is do
optimistic UI on this so let's go ahead
and add that room and it's going to be a
copy and paste from this this is gonna
be called Cree Ford the type name is
gonna be board the IDS gonna be negative
one the name is gonna be whatever state
dot name is and then what's this last
one suggestions it's gonna be ray
alright so coming to the home page here
let's make this full width make it
primary three primary billets do like
that label is going to be create board
and looks like the refresh didn't get
triggered it's not refreshing
do not save this no I did and just not
refreshing for whatever reason so now we
should see the bar re there we go
there's your keyboard across the top I'm
assuming the graph Gilcrease still
loading yeah all right let's go ahead
and run this and test it out did we
break everything go to our console
yeah we did we're infinitely recurring
so let's see what's going on so we're
not setting the state I could be a text
field that's causing it make sure text
field is no on change is legitimate
I know because sometimes they change
what it's called I'm not saying the
state anywhere else except on these
callbacks it's got to be at home on
touch tab so it stayed close dialogue I
have no idea why we infinitely recurred
wearing said state cannot update during
existing state transition alright so
something we're doing drastically wrong
here I'm not gonna do this component
here we're gonna try not rendering it
and seeing if that's the problem on
touch tap we're setting the state it's
gotta be something in create dialogue
that's just like Oh notice I'm using
props open dialogue this should be state
that's probably what's causing it it
looks like it is and also we need to set
a key here the unique key for this group
is just gonna be the index I mean let's
refresh this I was being silly I guess
when you pass in null as open it craps
out nope still infinite rendering so it
wasn't because I was passing in NOLA
here though we're passing it right here
so create dialogue there's something
wrong actions modal open is the props
that open this handle closed
okay so we're only setting state here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
console dot log handle okay
I just have to do this I think those
functions are just getting called if
they shouldn't be getting called yet
that might not be it but I just have
like a suspicion it is if that doesn't
work what I do is I don't put console
logs and every place I'm setting the
state all right didn't work then we can
see which function is causing it
close okay I don't think it's on change
so I'm just gonna get rid of it and then
I can always add it back if it was
causing it we could see why it's causing
right it's none of my functions it looks
like this might be inside of update
during existing state transition to
check your side effects or anti-pattern
but can you move put a little top I
think this is something wrong with the
actual material you I because we're not
calling okay we're not calling state
material UI is calling state infinitely
for some reason and I believe it's
because of our dialogue here so false
will render the dialogue else will just
render hello we should see hello and not
infinitely render go Starbuck ass is
graph QL a complete solution for it back
end or is it just a query interface it
is just a query interface so I can show
you what I have this is my back end
right here it's running on an Express
server so you see Express here and then
so I have that I create an Express
server and then down here I create a
graph QL endpoint and then I have a post
gross sequel database and here are the
models for all of them and then I have
resolvers we're on resolving fields and
basically all I'm doing here is doing
database queries to pass the data so I
still need a database I still need a
server it just is in between those two
layers okay so let's see what's going on
with this or infinitely recurring still
it's not the dialogue it's something
else
oh it no it could be
no still same thing okay so it's not my
dialogue I don't think alright just to
make sure yeah no problem
each one I thought when I commented this
guy out in my home page
it did not infinitely do this so I was
expecting the dialog to be the thing
that's causing it nope okay so a dialog
is just not what's causing this oh this
is a function I was being so noob close
dialog is being called infinitely all
right solved it scared of this
but er we have a pair of code back now
we can test and make sure this dialogue
is working and I don't know why audio
format put a semicolon there what the
heck I'll let my dialogue up here yes
there yeah and there we go that renders
correctly one there now hopefully they
don't render forever no way I'm using a
function now I must be doing it here too
no not I kind of feel like it's cached
or something because I really think that
was what the problem was just to make
sure I'm not
no it's spinning no sound spinning each
challenge in a rare shot unique key if I
change that this has a key
oh I need to put the key here be tidy
instead of a key here YouTube so alright
so we know the problem was just that it
was sometimes it does that where it
caches the past queer you've done so
that's why it was still broken hopefully
now it'll refresh itself and be ok looks
like it's good
go ahead and pop this up dialogue with
actions I should change that
but let's try it
dialogue board submit alright get an
object back with crib creep or thunks
good field suggestions of type must have
a selection of subfields did you mean
suggestions Dada okay so here we just
learned a lot of good things first we
should change this to be create a board
and I'm gonna say save instead of submit
I think what kind of capitalize it and
let's not capitalize it and then in our
mutation here suggestions we need to get
the ID and the text but either way I
think now we actually added wouldn't
know fired of the most I thought I would
it was a problem with our update
function it wasn't alright so create a
board
hi it's save cannot return
all four Nobel filled board ID all right
- up cool so mutation we're asking for
the board the were asking for the ID so
we should not get Nobel for the ID creep
board I was printing it out let's just
do this again the ID is negative one
this is not NOLA not return null for non
knowable field board ID I think what's
happening is and our back end here what
we're doing create board for whatever
reason board doesn't have an ID so
console this guy out to see this is a
very odd I would have thought an ID
would be there for sure
refresh I think I just made a change on
the server so the server is restarting
so now if I come over here I can see the
logs
so insert it into boards I get an ID
okay I need you to do dot data values I
think data values you can see all that
other nasty stuff that gets print out
that's all see sequel eyes object
metadata that it gives you back when you
insert stuff in the database again my
server didn't restart or fast enough
all right all right BAM now we should
see F down here we do so cool now we can
creep boards have them show up here what
I want to do next is voting we're gonna
remove this console logs gonna need
anymore we know a tray blowing next is
voting so the idea behind this is
suggestions okay my suggestions here all
of them will have a little upload area
you can click on and vote on them and
then we'll have a little counter next
each one where you can upload in real
time we also need to keep track FIFA
uploaded on things that way you can't
just keep uploading but okay this is
good progress where we'll create boards
now and we have it we can make tons of
boards on the screen so I think that's
it for this stream today do next stream
is do loading we're doing graph QL
subscriptions of that so I'll be
interesting with WebSockets so we'll see
stuff update in real time so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you guys
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
