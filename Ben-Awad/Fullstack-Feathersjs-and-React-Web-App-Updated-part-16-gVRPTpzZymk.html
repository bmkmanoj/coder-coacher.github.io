going to be continuing here with the
upgrading and we have all these
components here and some of them are not
really components they're pages so now
we're going to work on those and how I
think I'm going to do it is I'm just
going to like copy I don't know how I
actually copy all of them I don't know
if there's an easy way to do it I don't
know the hotkey is I actually want to
copy all of these components into routes
here and then just go one by one through
them and check if their component or if
they're basically a route and then fix
that so I'm just going to start moving
them over this might be super
inefficient I'm a bet there's a faster
way but I don't know it so I'm just
going to do it real quick
Bam Bam Bam okay so how I was kind of
working before is this main thing was
wrapping every single page and every
single page basically would have like
would be put here in this main would
have this there and then would have this
this clone would basically get all
children put it here
and we would pass down all the props
which are giving from app here let's
this app does app gets the stuff from
Redux and adds it what's it called get
some Redux and adds it to the props but
notice how every page basically we have
the same props that way at least from
Redux that's not a great way to do it
because each page could possibly need
different props and then some props that
Paige is not using so why are you asking
for them so what we're going to do is a
different kind of setup now with this
page so every time we have a page that
we need I think we're going to start
with maybe like we start the login page
notice how like for example it needs
this prop right here what we'll do is we
will create a folder for it so we're
going to create a folder called login
page we put login page inside of it we
call this view because this is what the
actual code looks like and then we
create
new file called index is so we import
login page and what this index is going
to do is basically the same thing as
this app does so we can copy that paste
into index all this app is doing is its
grabbing all the states and all the
actions that we need so we can actually
just open this up and again I don't know
why the D I need to change my default I
think I think we need tilt is four
spaces and you look into that I should
be too okay but here you can add all the
things that you need from redux for your
view and it's different for each page
select for the login page just like a
quick scan looks like the only thing it
really needs is login so I don't really
need to have anything else and then also
we're now passing stuff and like this
like an object so the login this should
be email because username is not how you
log in in feathers password and then
next row and I'll to just space at the
end yep what's going on here missing
prom validation okay we're about prop
validation at later time so if it really
only needs login you don't have to map
all of these things all we really need
is one action we don't need these action
creators and now we're going to import
view which is that local view right
there and we are and then when we map
that and then we're going to export
default export to you volt and we don't
need to name it okay and don't eat that
so that's the plan so now on import log
in from go up to module user actions
so now we're going to call that login
action that we created and we'll add it
to the props right here so now the login
that we use here is given to the props
here so now we're just gonna do this
actually for every single page so for
example single recipe believe that was a
page right um looks like it was a page
yeah so new folder single recipe move
single recipe inside for your name to
view and then copy so now this view what
does it need it needs looks like it
needs the fetch recipe and it looks gets
it so we going to come over here you can
just do fetch recipe and we can grab
that from fetch just be let's close this
let's make sure those action there's
actually not a fetch recipe here I'm
assuming it was like requests my recipe
okay I'm just trying to think of which
action we should call that it's
expecting so it's expecting this kur
recipe oh so we should grab that so
state Caressa P from state Crespi so
we're grabbing that and then we need the
one that I think it was called the
action that will use is here to that
I think it would be your quest recipe
I'm thinking I'd love to play with this
so now my view here I should be calling
request recipe quest recipe this stop
props params SPID I'm assuming that's
coming from react router at all prov
alle Dacian that's okay for now and
everything else looks good okay so we
good with that page I guess let's do
signup page next new folder signup page
name to view copy-paste close all those
so now starting with the view looks like
we need signup and I call it username an
application but really ship an email so
we'll use email here no extra space and
it looks like the only thing that we get
from redux is signup so on add sign up
there and recipe list is a component I
remember SP card is to nav bar this
should be a component as well my recipe
my recipe is not though my recipes is a
route
recipes change you to view and copy you
so here we need to fetch my recipes and
see request my recipe what we called it
so request my recipe and request my
recipe so now that's the proper calling
and then once we call that we get my
recipes here so that's coming from the
state so we can grab that from the redux
state and this stuff props and notice
how we're passing in the date ID so
remember how with this one we said we
would pass it like a query we're going
to come in and actually do that later I
just want to break these out into pages
right now so we're now getting my
recipes and request my recipes both from
this index that we're connecting
so my recipes and request my recipe ok
this page looks good recipe card is
missing we'll come back and fix those ok
so we have four pages right now
the video is getting a little bit long
so I'm going to break it here and next
one will continue converting these into
views like this they're in two routes so
I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
