out what was wrong in the last video
instead of updated and you do use the
word patched because we were technically
patching and they use the word removed
instead of deleted so now for example if
I delete I don't know the first one
refresh that you can see it says deleted
here so we get our console.log and if i
patch say xx whoops that explodes but we
should get an updated call back updated
socket gets called and we get the new
thing here and notice how when we update
this we're not having on the seller so
that is the problem so we have to fidget
with the date of the server some more
that was a problem of why I wasn't
getting called so let's go to our server
again and I think oh it's just good
we're doing patch not update so I just
need to do that so add pop data values
and populate to the patch restart my
server and then give this a try
all right so I'm going to do a seller
rose here auction offer rose number 25
now I'm going to try to be number 25 and
you notice how the Rose disappears there
so cool the lead is working now let's
check out patch so now if I want to bid
on something
Gallants singers sure it's making our
Rose get the rose here run a bid on that
that was what gonna be 28 not found well
this is 25 so this will be 26
mmm up and may get this problem again
maybe I just need to not pop values okay
refresh see if you can find the rose
here that's following yep because it's
on here 227 so it did work so now I do 7
more Shinto this is 34 and cool alright
we get 34 there so now delete and update
is working quite well I can just go
through here and I could clean up we
have a bunch of these and kazooie so you
know as I am coming through here
cleaning up some of these values we have
a lot of them this this is so right now
I am posting to this using postman but
this is like a user going in and using
the app on different phone and they're
updating their action making bids and we
can see as it changes on our phone over
here okay so we have a lot less now I
think fine so now we're able to bid and
see it update here I think what I'd like
to do next and work on the next video is
actually creating a create page so we
can actually create auctions like
instead of just like posting here
actually maybe like little floating
button here that we can click on take
this to a new page we can type in some
data for our new auction you can see a
pop up here so that's it for this video
and then that's what we'll do in the
next video see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
