customizing your terminal shell so right
now I've been just using the basic
terminal that comes with Mac but this is
all right it works fine but I can do
everything I can do all the commands all
that works nicely but there's other
types of terminals and basically
terminal language this one's called bash
that you can use that I found that I
like some of them better so this is this
is fine if you're starting out use this
but then once you you know get you to
this I recommend trying different ones
and seeing what you like so for example
what I use is usually I use something
that looks like this this is my usual
terminal program this is well you looks
like this is how I do most of my stuff
and what I'm using right now is I term
you can see right here this is basically
a terminal emulator for Mac so I don't
think this is on Windows or Linux I term
isn't that special what I'm going to
talk about next is and you can get both
of those on Windows and Linux no matter
what this just basically made it nice or
easier to customize things it has a
whole bunch of different features so if
you're on Mac I definitely recommend
taking a look at this you might like
this better than using terminal and
there's other terminal emulators for
Windows and Linux so definitely take a
look at different ones than just the
ones that come default with what you
have the next thing I want to talk about
is a ash so as I said this uses bash
which is a basically the type of shell
it is how it works is you know the way
it's coded the arc structure
architecture is bash there's other ones
and it's not just bash what I use what's
the time is something called this dish
it spelled zsh and there's a few reasons
I use this
over bosch and i want to show you them
right now so one of them this is kind of
a quirky feature I like it but it's for
example unjust in going to my desktop
real quick and for example goal and two
books okay so remember how I was saying
that with the bang sign and you type the
command and it will run the last command
you did well I like to know that last
sometimes I don't remember what the last
CD command I did or you know maybe it's
a different command maybe it's a move
command I'm doing or a graph that I did
a while ago and I don't remember what it
was and so what I really like about this
if I hit tab what it will do is it will
just expand it out for me so if we go
back over here if I were to do bang
signed CD and hit tab nothing happens
you know it doesn't do anything I just
have to guess that that's the hopefully
the right CD command that I wanted I
really like the woods ish that it
expands it out for me I you just hit
bang signed CD hit tab hey yeah that's
the thing i wanted or maybe a that's not
but i can fix it real quick to the way i
like so i really like that part of it
the second thing is and this is where it
gets a little it you might not like this
I like it though is when for example if
I'm trying to CD into someplace and
let's say a spell desktop wrong on
accident I have it so it auto will
detect when you do something wrong and
I'll try to correct it so you'd notice
how you type desktop an accident and
asked me what i like to do desktop and
now gives me some options i can edit my
command with e i can abort it with a or
i can say yes thank you please change it
to desktop and look at that we went to
desktop and if we go back and you'll
notice it also changes my history to the
right thing we can abort it or we can
edit it and it brings this back and then
we can then type the right thing so I
kind of like that it stops you and it's
like hey you can do it this for really
and then the last thing that I really
liked the dish is for example when i'm
using the
button if I'm in my desktop and I'm a
desktop my home directory just going to
clear real quick and let's say I type d
now there's multiple things if I hit tab
right now there's multiple things that
will match d as you can see when i hit
tap and then I can't tab again and it'll
start cycling I can just tab through and
pick the one that I want I like going
being able to tab through like that
whereas in bash we do CDD I hit tab or
let's go back to home CD d and I hit tab
notice as many times I hit tab all it
does is it spits out these guys unlike
with this how it cycled through you
could see it hovering over each one so I
really like that those features there's
also some other small things that I like
about Dish and that's I've changed and
I've been using this and I i really like
it and i'm not going to move back
probably to bash but notice i was still
able to use bash just fine because it's
basically the same thing there's just a
couple small improvements over it that i
like that make my life a little bit
easier when programming that i've been
using this ish four and the last thing i
want to talk about is notice the color
of this this uses a solarized color
scheme they have a light in a dark i'm
using the dark right now if we go back
you'll notice it's dark blue and you'll
notice i have colors see composer i
think it some different binary files are
colored it's just different colors
different things you'll notice how
directories are bolded and files or not
I just kind of like the way that the
colors look and especially when you open
up text using them if you don't want
them is don't worry about it but I like
how it looks that way so you can go and
edit your stuff and with I Turner makes
it very easy you can just go into
profiles and then the preferences for I
term and you can appearance profiles and
you can pick different ones that you
want colors
so I really like that I like the color
scheme out my terminal so do know you
can make it whatever color you like
there's lots of different themes out
there I definitely recommend going
googling for the terminal that you're
using how to set up different color
schemes so you can make your terminal
pretty and make it fun to program and
the color that you like so i just wanted
to share with you guys what my terminal
looks like from them actually developing
things and coding things i will be using
this is what it will look like i will
not be using this regular terminal so
take a look at the other options that
are out there i'll put the links in the
description below for I terms ish and
Solarize if you're interested in using
those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
