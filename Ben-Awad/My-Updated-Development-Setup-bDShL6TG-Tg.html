of where I was at with my development
environment last time I talked about it
I was trying to decide whether to stay
with Visual Studio code or go back to
vim and I was in the middle of setting
up them trying to get the themes and
whatnot set up trying to get you Slynt
and all the draw the script tools that I
want to use setup and what I ended up
doing is just actually stop tinkering
with them I was kind of tired of like
trying to figure it out and I'm just
kind of been happy with Visual Studio
code lately and one of you guys
suggested to use the terminal built in
the Visual Studio code and I've been
using that and I've been really liking
it so if I you hit ctrl and then the
tilde it opens up this little terminal
here and this terminal is the same as
any other terminal and then the cool
thing is I can actually run tea mugs so
now I can do split screen here so I'm in
Visual Studio code but I have two panes
open right now using T mocks so I can do
an LS see what files are here and stuff
like that that's super cool and the cool
thing about T MUX is I can attach to
this session anywhere so I have my
terminal here I can do T MUX attach and
now I'm in the same thing as over here
now this looks like there's like a site
display change because there's these
little dots that show up everywhere I'm
not exactly sure why those pop-up it's
when you have two tea mugs that it
opened over here and I term as well but
we can kill that but I've been really
enjoying using T MUX with this and this
is pretty much how I've been developing
stuff as of late it's using this right
here maybe doing an NPM start to start
things up and then doing stuff over here
but just using this little panel and if
I hit ctrl tilde it'll close and I can
reopen it and it saves that so that's
what I've been doing lately and I've
been liking it
that keeps terminal there and I'm still
able to just code JavaScript right here
which has been really nice and I thought
I'd go over real quick some of the
plugins that I have and also my settings
because I forgot to go over those and
there's a few things that I've changed
so I used to have a prettier es lent
extension but that actually has been
basically depreciated and now there's
only one prettier extension for visual
studio code and what you do is you say
prettier es Lindt integration is equal
to true in your user settings and what
this does if you don't know what
prettier is it formats your JavaScript
code it makes it look really nice so
whenever I'm coding if I save the file
it'll reformat everything and it'll look
nice and that's why I have formate
format on save it'll actually run
prettier
whenever I save the file and also the
CIA's interrogation what that does is it
integrates it with es lint so you're
following all the es lint rules what
it'll do is it'll run prettier make your
photo your code formatted nicely and
then do an es lint fix to make sure yes
lint is working nicely I mean you're not
breaking any rules when prettier format
stuff so that's that and also the only
other plugin that's new for you guys is
the graph QL plugin this is really nice
it just adds syntax highlighting for
graph QL so you might have noticed how
my graph QL is nicely colored like this
you can see the string are green because
there are types and then the mutation
here that's because of this nice little
plug-in right here it's graphic ul for
visual studio code and at formats not
formats but syntax highlights that I
also have a reason plugin but that's for
using reason that's pretty obvious using
reason and then of course the usual them
for doing all the key bindings Python
for Python of course and then just es
lived which is basic now under will quit
go over my user settings there's nothing
actually too special here I'm just
setting one vim basically setting which
says if you're aware if you know how
them works basically there's an insert
mode and the way you leave insert mode
is by hitting it
scape and I like to add a little hockey
where I type JK to escape out of insert
mode so that's what I have set right
there so if I type JK it's like pressing
the Escape key and then I just have my
font sizes formatting on save that way
prettier runs and then also run yes lint
and then here we have just some files to
ignore node modules is the key one here
this thing gets giant and I don't want
Visual Studio code trying to load in
node modules over here and get nice and
large and then just a few other like it
you don't need dot get files as well you
don't need to see that these other ones
I think these are default from something
this is a Mac thing I forget what these
files are why they were here I had this
a little while ago and in here this is
the text JavaScript files so all your
JavaScript files will be tabbed over by
two spaces just preference of how I like
my JavaScript but style is two spaces
and then or I guess this is two tabs or
yet to tab spaces I mean so a tab is
equal to two spaces so here you can see
this is two tab spaces by default I
believe it's four so it look like that
whereas I like it to have a tab be there
okay and then these right here I
actually don't know where these come
from just like randomly one day they
showed up my settings file I don't know
if a plug-in added these or what I
actually don't know exactly what these
do I can only guess this gets rid of a
message of some sort I don't know what
the zoom level thing does let's put that
back there and then the startup editor I
assume this is just the name of the
default file when you haven't saved it
yet but not sure exactly but that's what
my setup is for my settings for visual
studio code and I will be using this as
my main editor pretty much and pretty
much I don't even need to open up I
don't even have to have an eye term
session
been like this anymore because I have
the terminal here and I have everything
that I want so I'm gonna be using this
more and yeah that's it for this video
guys thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
