use the field arrays component from
Redux form and entwine it and get to
work with the material UI table now
before we begin with this a quick little
announcement I'm gonna be starting
blogging on medium or I'm gonna be
taking some of my videos and then
writing them up so this is gonna be the
first of that so if you want to check
out the link in description below I'll
have to the medium post which walks you
through this exact video as well alright
so let's get started so right here I
have a create react app location and I
have it set up with a few things if we
check out a package.json I have Redux
form Redux react Redux and material UI
now important to note I'm using the
latest version of material UI and you
can see they have a new look and feel to
their components and a new version just
came out 1.0 so make sure when you're
installing this to get that one and I
just stood up Redux form and Redux I
have a store and then I did the provider
but if you're unsure how to setup bre-x
form and redux the medium post will
explain that okay so first thing I want
to do is to just take the fields array
example that they have simplify it and
to get it to work with the material UI
so that's this thing right here so I'm
just going to copy this giant thing and
then I'm just gonna explain what's how
it's working and then cut some of it
down so I'm going to create a new file
called my form yes and we're gonna paste
it in so first thing I don't need to
validate or I'm not gonna worry about
validating for this and I'm gonna call
this my form
and I'm gonna call the component my form
now I want to get rid of one of these
fields too just to simplify it all I
really want to render is a field array
now you'll notice we could just move the
destructuring up here this is kind of
how I prefer to have it so move it there
so we're destructuring the props all
these are coming from redux form and
this is for submitting this is for
knowing if people have touched the form
and then this will s reset the form
which we are calling when we click on
this clear values button and then
submitting is just telling us whether
we're currently submitting or not so we
are now rendering this field array which
you'll notice we're passing a component
render members so this is up here and
this is basically how the field array
works now right off the bat they're
doing another field array inside of this
field array I'm gonna get rid of that to
simplify so we'll get rid of that and
that's rendering this guy up here so I
don't need render hobbies all right so
let's look at render members so you'll
notice we have the fields and other than
that we just pretty much map over the
fields and we display them and you'll
notice how with the fields will have I'm
just gonna keep the default of a first
name and a last name but basically we
ran out to index and you just prefix it
with this member right so the name needs
to be different
per field in your field array which is
very important so you don't have
duplicates or whatnot but take a look at
this code it's pretty self-explanatory
the other interesting bit is they're
using this component right here called
render field which is where their
rendering the input field up here and
you could replace this with material UI
inputs and material UI buttons if you
wanted to and that would work out really
well
but I'm not gonna worry about that
because it takes a little bit to rework
that so here is my application I have
not actually rendered my form let's do
that and we can see how this looks like
and I forgot to export it
no I didn't I got my form is not defined
I lied it I didn't import it okay and we
need to get rid of just validate at the
top of the my form because we're not
gonna be using that okay so now we have
these buttons right here so add member
just like adds a dude in the array and
we'll notice what that's doing so fields
dot push and just an empty object so
fields is just an array of the fields
and so by default it should be empty so
that's what that's doing and then where
you can remove a field basically fields
is what's giving us access to all the
things we want to do and this again is
coming from a Feliway
filled array component that Redux form
is giving us okay so we could type stuff
here and you'll notice we have this
little block right there that's this guy
right here removing a member I'm just
going to move the title so we can
actually see it
so now when I add a member I also have a
remove member and so if you set this up
right you should be able to type and you
see the stuff is there and you can
remove a single member here's me killing
remember - and it moves up or I could
clear all the values so that's pretty
much all that's going on with the Redux
form part of things at least with the
array field now if you wanted to you
could add more fields so right now we
have a first name and a last name you
would if you want to add another field
you copy this and you'd put a different
last name or a different name here and
then the tool not the type you might
have something different besides text I
suppose and you might render a different
field and then you can have your label
or whatnot any kind of fields you want
to render right if you're familiar with
redux form look at the field component
so next what I want to do is take this
so whatever I'm typing here I would like
to have this reflect and render a mature
UI table so what I'm going to do is copy
the example from this material I won and
then change it to get to work for ours
so my table J s or you know what yeah
that's fine we could also call it simple
table either one works
so first off I'm not going to worry
about prop types or any kind of styles
so we're just gonna import or not
import/export the simple table if we
scroll up to the top we can just kill
both of these imports and we can kill
styles and create data all this stuff
and we can keep just a function here and
again I'm gonna remove remove the
destructuring to up here and we don't
need to have crazy braces we can just
return there so for us we're gonna have
two table cells so this is basically the
name at the top so we have a first name
and a last name and we can get rid of
numeric you can also get rid of the
class names and then here it's mapping
through data so where are we gonna get
our data right well redux form stores
all of its data and redux so we can use
the connect component and what this will
do is allow us to grab state from redux
and if we look at the selectors hurry
ducks form it looks like this so we can
use the get form values specifying our
form and they'll return the array of
values back to us
so what's looking back so I'm first
going to import connect from react Redux
this allows us to get to the Redux store
and I'm gonna import that function so
there's a whole bunch of functions we
can do we only care about the form
values you could get other things as
well though if you want to do and that's
from redux form
so now I'm going to connect and then
here's where I map the state to the
props so we're gonna say values and
we're gonna say get form values and
we're passing the state and we also put
in the the name right so what is the
name of our form there you go back to my
form over here scroll down to the bottom
you'll notice we have this Redux form
thing and we pass when the properties
form this name should match so I called
it my form so I'm gonna say my form here
so now we're actually going to be able
to get the values from here and the
values that we care about is our field
array and we can look at what the name
of it is
so it's called members so I can do
values dot members dot map and when I'm
mapping over this the key I'm going to
set as the first name so we could call
this M so member dot first name - member
dot last name so this is a key for when
we're iterating through these and I just
need to close that
and we don't need curly braces for this
either so you get rid of those if we
wanted to and I'm gonna just get rid of
most of these fields and I'm gonna say
remember dot first name and we don't
need this numeric field and then
remembered last name okay so if we ran
this right now we would actually get an
error and we can see that if we come
over here and we just want to come over
to app and we'll render my table and
we'll give this a second to restart and
we'll watch it crash and the reason why
it crashes is by default the the form is
empty so there are no values so what we
have to do is we can come over to our
table and just set a default value for
our values so if I'm fault
we should have a key inside of here
called members and it's just going to be
an empty array and now we can see here's
our empty table so if I were to add a
member we now have a single row in our
column and now I can start typing so
first name one and I can do with last
name hay or whatever I want and I can
add as many guys as I want right and I
can start typing here or good start
typing here and I can remove fields if I
want to I can remove a member and I
guess they add some spacing between them
it's just kind of interesting looks like
we have an extra space here so if I
remove number one and I say well I guess
that's just space at the top I'm not
sure why we have an extra space I'm just
the top right here is that always there
so one two
it looks like for whatever reason we're
holding like an extra value for our rose
so we can't investigate what's going on
with this so if I open up the console
looks like we have some undefined things
so I'm just gonna say console dot log
values because we're just looping
through and rendering this so we can see
what the value of that is so by default
we have no members here's me adding a
member that's another member and that
looks like where we have a problem
so we have two guys right here that are
undefined so I guess it's bad to specify
the key as the first name in the last
name like this because they can both be
undefined if you keep clicking that so
to solve this problem we can just make
the key the index as well and in that
case we probably don't even need to
specify the first name and the last name
there we could just do the index but now
we shouldn't have any problems we don't
get any errors there and we should not
be getting extra fields so now I start
typing and if I want to I could just
clear all the values add it but you'll
notice as we type here we're getting the
same values at the table so that is how
you would connect the material UI table
and the redux form and this would work
pretty much for whatever type of thing
you do with Redux form in this case we
used field arrays over here but yeah
that's it for this video guys
I hope that helped if you're struggling
with material UI and redux form
