yesterday at UT Arlington and I thought
I'd show you guys the project that I
worked on so I created a react native
application I worked in a group of with
three other people on it and here's what
it looks like right here I'm running on
iPhone emulator and just a side note
they just changed what the emulator
looks like so now you can actually see
the phone itself which is kind of
interesting but anyway the goal of this
app and actually before I talk about the
app itself if you're not sure what a
hackathon is this is something where
schools usually universities host where
they give you either 24 hours or 36
hours or you're basically it's like a
lock-in where you're just like locked
into a room and you code for 24 hours or
36 hours on an idea build something and
he present and there's prizes and stuff
so let's take a look at what we ended up
building in 24 hours this hackathon was
24 hours so the goal of application and
the theme of this was social impact and
natural disasters so for us what we were
trying to build was something that was
kind of like an Airbnb a donation Airbnb
so when national disaster happens and
people don't have homes stay in people
might want to be donate their homes to
allow people or churches or other places
that want to be able to basically give
up their home say hey you can come stay
in my home for now so like a marketplace
where people like hosts which would
donate their house or some room to like
let people stay there that need to stay
there
and on the other side are people that
need help which we're calling the guests
that would like to stay that need help
so this is what the application looks
like it's built and react native and
with this is our home screen we made a
little logo right here and then we have
two buttons hosts and guests so to start
off and if you click on guests you can
see a little bit
of all the different houses that you
could possibly view of course this is
all dummy content because it's a
hackathon and you can see what they have
available so at this house I can see
that they have eight rooms I could
possibly stay at if I need if I wanted
to and they have a shower and food
available to help out maybe this one
only has a shower and you can see the
different things that they have so I
click on this and we made another little
screen here this was a list view of
cards and the layout here is actually
using something called native base will
show you for all the components and
stuff so here we had another screen
where just like a more description about
this you want to put more information as
a host about what your house offers and
then here at the bottom as a guest I can
request housing from this guy so I can
say let's say I have a kid with me and
me and my kid want to go stay at this
house I can put we request housing for
two people and I can request housing and
we made a little alert that pops up that
says hey you've been added to the hosts
list and please wait and for that person
to confirm so that's it let all guests
can do basically and then I'm gonna
refresh the application now you can see
I'll show you what it's like to be a
host so host we have a little forum here
that you can fill out to actually create
the shelter you'll notice here we
actually don't have an image place to
upload images but you saw images over
here like if we saw a guess we just
basically have dummy data here for now
because we couldn't because we have so
little time that's how we cut corners
they have this little form you can fill
out to create shelters and then we have
this other you can see this is a little
nav bar at the bottom between this and
this this page right here is the actual
once a guest would like to stay in your
home you can see who has requested to
stay there and you can either accept or
you can decline them so maybe I'd like
Valerie to stay or this is not this this
right here is the actual name of the
home the person's name so David Park a
David parks house John Day would like to
stay so John Doe would like to stay at
David parks house and of course you see
we have some dummy data here so I can
say no I don't want him to stay but I
want him to stay um and this is using
graph QL so you do see the amounts they
should update so let's see I'm gonna go
click on I don't know if it's this house
let's accept this kid I don't know if
that was the house that as for so as you
can see it was a little buggy a little
static for eight theoretically we should
make it request for three it should pop
over there I don't know if it's still
working I basically had to like get this
working last minute mmm looks like
something's wrong but it's supposed to
pop up over there when I make a request
it actually does work if it looks like a
little template but anyway that's what
we presented there's a lot of things
wrong with it um and we have the thing
is you have such a short amount of time
to make it I did make this with graph QL
and I used my nodejs server so I can
show you guys the code so this is the
back end right here there's a lot more
features that I wanted to add on to this
but just ran out of time I actually
ended up only sleeping for like two
hours of this 24 hours and I just got
exhausted so the code is super sloppy
and kind of hacky so I actually even
bothered with authentication as you saw
the way I do it as I'm storing basically
the users ID and a sink storage and then
I'm passing it the guest ID and the
donor ID so right here like when I click
that I just set the guest ID to - I
think I'm hard coding it to one oh look
it does update here so it actually does
update you see how it's one in five now
oh you know what I think the problem was
I wasn't a refresh
I was basically invalidated the cache is
what I think happened
okay anyway notice how they don't login
they just go directly to this page we
actually created login pages but so it
didn't take up time the people logging
in and not waste as much time we just
basically hard-coded that and so we get
that in the header that's how we know
who the guests and the donors is and
this is just my regular nodejs server
here if you've seen any of my other
videos on graph QL you know this is how
I like to do things I use join monster
here are my tables so the donor name
email password you didn't see me create
a need owners basically we just put
donors in the database this is the model
for it guess we were just doing a name
and phone number the ideas they login
with their phone number kind of a like
snapchat or some other companies do it
and then a request when you request a
room you can say how many rooms you want
and then you can say whether the person
was accepted or not and then touched and
viewed these were for other things I
wanted to also do push notifications and
stuff so it actually like when I accept
a dude I want the other person get a
notification but didn't get that working
in time and then shelter here all the
fields for that yeah we use the Postgres
sequel database and resolvers are pretty
standard stuff here's my schema regular
stuff going on here have different graph
QL types and I'm using how I like to do
the errors in this even though I have no
error handling in the front and I did
write it like this in case I wanted to
end up wanting to do it and then my
resolvers are pretty much what you'd
expect and I wanted to do some
subscriptions but it just was not
working for me at that time and I had it
was on a crunch so I ended up just
taking that out but I ended up using
join monster that made it nice and easy
and I also had to end up like writing
some my own queries because it was
taking too long to try to figure out
with how it would work with sequel eyes
and stuff and I was too tired he was the
front end so I guess I was made with
react
and we're using the Apollo client on the
front end and we're using native base
for the UI so you can see I grab all
these components from this native base
library and now we're using reactor I
tried a new router actually so I've
never tried the I think it's in this
index page yep I've never used react
router native before I've only ever done
react router DOM and I liked it it
worked pretty well
I didn't notice really any too many big
differences to create this little back
button that was kind of interesting
she's back button here what we did is we
ended up just wrapping a container
around these routes so that way the
header is always there and then history
go back is how you actually do like
basically pop back in history and then I
have to actually create a history object
so I can access it and I create a
history object here and it's a memory
history for react native we can see the
different pages we have and you notice
there's this thing called like guest
register we actually coded up this page
but you notice what I did is on the
component will mount I said just set the
guests ID right here and then go to the
next page because we're like oh we
wasted time actually coding this up and
then I was like at the end like - let's
just skip it because like watching
someone log in is not that interesting
so we just had them click on Capone
wall-mount and jump to the next page but
there's a ton of other things I wanted
to do with this application but I just
ran out of time I I think the one thing
that hurt me at this hackathon is I
actually try to do way too much and I
should have tried to like nail down
focused more I tried to do too much and
couldn't get enough working so next hack
if I'm gonna try to get more focused but
this is idea we didn't end up placing in
the top five we're not sure if we got
any sponsored prizes so companies
sponsored these places one of the
companies we were thought we
chance of winning was Allstate Allstate
had a disaster or leaf challenge where
you did something related to a disaster
ours was supposed to help in disasters
where people could stay in houses all
their home was destroyed or whatnot but
we're not sure how well we did but I
this code is up on github if you want to
see any of it I'll put links in
description below if you want to check
out what we did but this gives you an
idea of what you can make in 24 hours so
that's very it's very hard to create
something good in 24 hours but this is
what we had ended up doing so thanks for
watching guys I'll see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
