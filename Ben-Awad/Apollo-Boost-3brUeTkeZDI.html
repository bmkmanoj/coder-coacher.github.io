boost this is the new library out of
Apollo and I think this is super smart
by them they're now covering basically
both audiences the beginners and the
more advanced users so before they had a
bunch of packages that let you really
customize how your graph QL client works
and now they've bundled it all together
in Apollo boost and put some really good
defaults so if you're just starting out
you can just install Apollo boost and
this will work for you know a majority
of the cases and they still let you
configure it after that if you need to
and now you're not having to install a
bunch of different packages if you're
first starting out so I think it's
really nice and they also add a few
other goodies into Apollo boost that
we'll talk about in a second now you may
also be wondering what is up with react
Apollo so this is the quick start for
Apollo Boost why do you need to install
react Apollo and Apollo bust
why didn't they put those together too
well Apollo actually works with a more
than just react so that's the reason
they could have put it in Apollo boosts
but this Apollo beast is like the core
of Apollo and then they want you to be
able to install this for using angular
using view and then you'll install a new
package for each one so unlike Kirk 'el
the package that we looked at yesterday
that one specific to react only works
for react and they that's one of the
things in the readme they say they
specifically want to target react
whereas Apollo is you know the core of
it and then they separate that out and
have a react section so that's important
that they have this basically install
graphical but I think that's fine
so let's take a look at what this looks
like so instead of grabbing things from
Apollo preset which are they had before
you're pretty much just now gonna grab
it from Apollo boost and they also added
a few other things in there like Apollo
or graphic you'll tag so you don't have
to grab that so now you can grab gql
from apollo boost instead of having to
install graphical tag as well you'll
notice this looks very similar to what
you've seen before you setup an Apollo
provider you add a client really the
only difference is when you create this
new Apollo client from
Paulette boost you now only have to
supply one thing the URL to your graphic
you'll end point you don't have to worry
about setting up the cache or setting up
a link none of that stuff you're just
good to go with that but you can always
configure it right if you need to and
they added this new component and react
Apollo
it's a query component this is similar
to the connect component from Oracle
where you just pass in your query now
you do note you need to pass a gql and
it's not just passing a string in but
you now get a function with the loading
air and data and I think this leaked
this makes a lot more sense than having
a higher-order component just you can
kind of see where the parameters are
coming from right query is creating
loading air and data and you notice they
changed a little bit how this works
right they used to have loading and air
inside this data parameter they seemed
to have taken it out which is kind of
interesting which I kind of like that
was actually a mistake I used to make a
lot is I would do it like this and
loading would be inside of data and so
they don't just have Apollo client
inside of there they also have Apollo
link-state which is pretty nifty so now
you don't even need to install another
package and you have state management
known no longer do you need to install
Redux or mob X along with this you're
pretty much good to go you install
Apollo boost and that's pretty much
you're fetching you know getting your
data from your API and also any kind of
state you need to handle so Apollo boost
is looking really nice and I'm glad they
made this and now again here's how you
can configure it if you need to so you
can get into adding headers right so
we've done this before adding
authentication headers that you do in a
slightly different way you just have
request parameter and you can see you
now just like change stuff in this
Apollo client so there's still all the
amount of customization you can add but
now you add to here so when I was
looking at this one of the questions I
had was I saw a query component was
there a mutation component and I looked
at the react Apollo
and notice they're still in beta for
this so don't use this in production yet
but it'll be coming soon which is really
nice but I was like they don't mention
it in this blog post either if they just
talk about the query component when they
talk about the next version of react
Apollo but then I was looking at the
issues for react Apollo and it looked
like there was a mutation component so I
was like alright maybe there is one but
they don't mention anywhere what's up
with that and finally I just went into
the code and I saw in their source code
they do export a mutation now and a
query so it looks like you can do it and
this looks like how the usage works now
this guy's having an issue with it so it
might not be the best but this gives you
an idea of what it looks like and this
was actually struck me as a little bit
odd that they actually created a
separate mutation component as opposed
from the query component I guess that
they are pretty different and so
separating that makes sense from
components the only thing that makes
this interesting is now if you want to
have for example a mutation and a query
in the same component you're now having
to add two right because you have your
mutation component and then you inside
of that you to have your query component
so you now have two components whereas
before you could just use graph QL and
pass I guess before you would create
multiple higher-order components for
that as well I'm also curious with this
mutation if this handles more than one
mutation so I really liked with Oracle I
could just pass it multiple mutations
and it would handle all of them at once
instead of creating a new mutation for
each one so I really hope Apollo does
that as well I'm hard to tell so far if
they're doing that or not I'm gonna wait
a little bit till this gets out of beta
to try it that way
they might change the API or how it
works especially with the mutation but
yeah I'm excited about this release I
want to dig more into Apollo link-state
I had a little trouble setting that up
in the Prisma tutorial they looks I had
I ran to some bugs and stuff I'm hoping
those are
ironed out and I'm gonna try that again
because I think that has a lot of
potential and yeah also try out Paulo
boosts because it looks pretty sweet and
by the way
Apollo boost works you don't have to use
the do query and mutation component it's
quite yet if you don't want to you can
just use it with the graph QL I or
component two so that's it for this
video guys I'll see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
