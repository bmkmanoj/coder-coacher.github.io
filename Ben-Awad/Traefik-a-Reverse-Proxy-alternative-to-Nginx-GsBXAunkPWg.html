started using it's called traffic and
it's an alternative to using nginx
it is a reverse proxy and it's made with
golang and I really liked it and I
really also like this cute little logo
it has right here and here are the
features it has and it's really awesome
I was having trouble with engine X it
was working for basic things but one of
the big problems I was having was trying
to get it set up with AC PS I got it to
work with let's encrypt but I didn't get
it in an automated fashion where it
would auto update itself or renew itself
because you need to update the
certificate every month or so so what I
ended up doing was I I would set up like
a cron job that would check and then
restart the certificate had needs
updating it would update and then
restart the engine X comp configuration
but it started to get complicated and
not work very well so I was looking for
other options because I really wasn't
using nginx for much stuff and the
configuration was really cryptic to me I
didn't like how they did their
configuration files and I wasn't really
happy with engine X I was just kind of
using it because I saw that as a popular
option so I was seeing if there was
anything else I could use and I came
across this guy and I really liked it
when I started using it it's pretty
popular and github too I think has like
14 K stars and the killer feature here
is twofold
the first is super easy let's encrypt
support this is awesome because I wanted
to set up HTTPS for my server and what I
had to do they have a nice little
documentation tutorial on it that I
ended up doing and this is all you have
to put so I specify my domain right here
this is what the configuration file look
like that I used and my email and that's
it it'll automatically fill this Acme
JSON script with all the things it needs
to do to connect to let's encrypt and
make sure you get the certificates and
get
all set up and it was super awesome so
that was one thing I really liked about
it and the second part was metrics so I
wanted to keep track of basically what
was happening with engine X but it
didn't seem like it was very easy to do
and it looks like you had to pay to
upgrade to get metrics or any kind of
logging with engine X at least more than
the very basic stuff so with traffic it
comes with and it has this nice little
page here just default and then also
hooks up with some other places there's
actually this one blogging place I'm
sure I'm gonna be looking into it's not
a place but it's an open source called
Prometheus or something like that I
think they talked about it here
I forget how to say it here's metrics
this place I'm gonna be trying this out
I've seen a lot of people recommend it
but I haven't tried it yet but you can
hook this up into that and get that
working so I want to try that out and it
looked like it had a lot of the same
features or the features that I needed
and seemed be easier to set up so I gave
it a try I'm enjoying it and I'll let
you guys know more as I'm using it more
but this is the default will admin page
you can see and I can just like it's a
docker container too that I just start
running if i refresh it a couple times
we can see the average response time and
it takes account of the status code so
it was 400 on't have any containers
running right now yeah I really enjoyed
this so far and if you're not enjoying
engine X and you're thinking of adding a
reverse proxy I would recommend this if
you're not even sure why to use nginx or
use a reverse proxy for me I was setting
up a I was running to run an Express
server on a VPS so digital ocean or
vulture or ec2 instance on AWS and I
needed something to load balance and to
sit in front and direct traffic so maybe
I want to send some requests to my
Express server and then other requests
somewhere else and so this sits in front
basically protects my server so it's
recommended to do that instead of having
your Express server or whatever server
you have directly connected to the
internet is to have this sit in front
yeah so this is the other cool tool I
just started using that really liked I
just want to let you guys know I'll
probably be doing a tutorial with this
soon as I get better with it and start
using it more and figuring out some of
the cool stuff you can do with it but
that's it for this video guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
