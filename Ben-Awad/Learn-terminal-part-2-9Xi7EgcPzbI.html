you how to make folders using terminal
so the first thing I want to do is just
I'm starting at my home screen I'm in
the home directory I'm going to move to
My Documents folder so I'm just going to
type CD documents and then from here I
can start making different directories
or folders directories and folders are
the same thing so to make a folder I'd
say make der that's the command to make
a directory and then I give it a name so
let's say folder one and i'll say i want
to make more than one folder you could
do for 2 folder 3 and it will create
three folders for you and you just hit
enter so if I do an LS you'll know as I
have folder 1 folder 2 for 3 so now we
can move into the folder 1 using CD and
we can do nel s and we'll see nothing is
in there as expected we could move out a
folder to to folder 1 root folder to
nothing in there too now move to folder
3 now next I want to show you is how to
make let's say I name something you know
this big nasty folder like this and now
I'd like to CD into it well cool thing
about terminal is this thing this thing
called tagged completion so if i just
type the first three words of this
folder right here and then hit tab
you'll notice it autocompletes it for me
it types the rest of it and then can
just hit enter and I move into this
directory well the cool thing about
terminal is it knows what all the
possible different types of folders that
you could move into so I'm just going to
move back up so when I type CD ASD it
looks for all the different folders in
this location that start with ASD and it
tries to match this with it so when I
hit tab this was the only one that
started with ASD so it just expanded the
whole thing but let's say for example
I do CD into folder well it doesn't know
if I'm talking about folder 1 folder 2
or folder 3 so when I hit tab nothing
happens hit tab a couple more times it
will then spit out all the possible
matches for folder so i do folder 1 no I
wouldn't so this is but this makes it
very fast to you know move around in
terminal so I for example I can just do
folder tab Oh looks like we don't know
whether it's folder or fonts so i type
another one I get an L and now it knows
it can only be one of the folders so I
hit tab you have so many fold area
folder too maybe I see you back out go
to fonts and then I go to that big I go
back out and I go to this big long thing
so notice how I'm just like weaved in
and out of each one so when to fold or
two I went up a directory I when two
fonts went up directory and this and
then I went up in directory so where do
you think I'm going to be after i'm done
seeing all these places take a guess
well let's see it takes me back to
documents because i was just going in
and out of each folder cool so I meet
all these crappy empty folders how do i
delete them um there's a command called
rmdir remove directory and then you just
give it the name of the directory so
folder 1 by x and let's also get rid of
this nasty thing so now i do an LS all i
have is folder to and folder 3 now
important to know remove dirt only
removes empty folders for example if i
move into folder too oops folder too i
do make der let's say folder 2.1 and I
move back out and I do remove their
folder to it says directory not empty
and doesn't let me delete it also before
I go on I hate how cluttered my screen
is right now notice how there's all this
garbage in my prompts is at the bottom
here
to move to the very top if you type the
command clear it'll take you to the top
and it cleans all that stuff up that's a
very important command to remember so if
I do an LS I see all my files here and
we were trying to remove folder tune it
wasn't working now what I can do is I
hair first have to remove the folder
inside a folder too so just like this
this will remove folder 2.1 but it will
not delete folder too because we're
telling it to remove we're telling it
the path to the director you want to
move remove which is folder 2.1 just
type that and it deletes it and now
we're able to remove folder too but
that's a lot of work what if we have a
bunch of different folders inside
folders let a bunch of files how do I
just delete it so there's another
command called RM which removes files so
let's say I have let's go into folder 3
the touch command just creates empty
files so i just created doing touch
ABCDEF with spaces in between will
create six different files that are
empty so if I do an LS I'll see ABCDEF
if I do remove a it removes it so if i
do LS it's gone so there's a something
called remove dash RF which removes
everything so if i come back up if i try
to do remove der on folder 3 it'll fail
because their stuff inside but if i do
remove RF on folder 3 everything is
deleted so if i do an LS no it's notice
it's all gone so that's a lot in this
lesson let's just review real quick what
we just learned okay so one you can
clear your screen using clear which will
take the prompt to the top and don't
worry it doesn't actually delete any of
the contents if you scroll up you'll
notice it's all still here now that's
different for some commands on Windows
or Linux depending on what you have it
may not show it above but at least for
Mac if you scroll up you'll see your
command still there
and then we learned that you can make
directories using the make der so for
example I can create a directory called
ABC and then I can remove a directory
using remove der just like that and it's
gone and we also learned that if I make
a directory called ABC and then make a
directory inside ABC for example toast
and then I try to remove ABC it won't
let me kill it because toast is inside
but if I do remove RF on ABC it will
delete ABC and it's gone so these are
important commands to remember you
pretty much all most of what i do on the
command line is I do a ton of clearing I
do CD and i do LS and then removing and
then making directories also removed ER
I don't really use that too much I
almost exclusively use our mrf almost
all the time so that's kind of how to
create folders and delete them and also
do not forget tab completion is amazing
I use this all the time just use that to
just like whiz around the command line
just always hit tab so that's how that's
that thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
