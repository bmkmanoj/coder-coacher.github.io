use Express session this library in
conjunction with a craft QL server and
this is what I like to use instead of
JWT tokens and it's a little bit
different because now you're gonna be
storing any data about the user on your
server and not in the token because with
JWT tokens you actually embed it or
encrypt in the token and so you can
access this data from the react
application or JavaScript any of that
with this it's all server-side and it's
all stored server-side so it makes some
of the things a little bit different but
let's jump into the code and see how
this works so here is an example of what
I had with the JWT token but now I
swapped it out with using Express
session and we're gonna see how this
works so here is me adding session it is
middleware for Express so apt I use and
then I pass in this session object the
name is what you want the cookie name to
be you probably want to change this to
something random or just I just did the
queue IDs basically so it's different
than what everyone else is is that way
people don't know right away right it's
I think it's fine to keep it have like
ID in there though and then a session
secret so this is just a string random
string that is used to sign your token
and make sure it's secure and then I
have a few settings right here resave
this is just so it every time you have a
session it doesn't every time they make
a request it doesn't resave the session
and then save initialize this is kind of
a choice so how the sessions work is it
won't save anything until you actually
add data and that's only if you say
false here so this is how I like to do
it so basically I'm not tracking the
user until they log in but you could
make this true and then you can do any
kind of
checks before they log in for example
and that's a fine way to do it as well
but for now I'm not doing anything until
they log in and that's by setting save
on initialize to false and then you'll
notice this look very similar these are
just the settings that are for cookies
so next you'll notice I don't even need
cookie parser at all in fact it handles
all the cookies itself and so you'll
notice I just add like custom ol
middleware right here to console.log
recto session and what this is is the
session object this is something that
this middleware adds and this will
basically be where all of our data is
accessed through and so you'll notice
when I pass in the context I actually
don't need to send the response all I
care about is the request okay so then
how do I actually save some data in this
right well in my register function and
now instead of creating token and all
that jazz I just get my request object
and I say request that session that user
ID and I said equal to user ID so it is
now stored in the session and how this
works is any time it detects a change in
this object it'll automatically save
this for you so in this case right here
this session would be saved and you may
be asking where is it saved well by
default it's just gonna be like an
object that the session library holds
for you but if you wanted to use this in
production or in a real scenario you'd
want to switch this out with either a
database or Redis and if we come over
here real quick they have a whole bunch
of what are called connectors at the
bottom and these are all the different
things where you could store the session
data in so MongoDB pretty much anything
you want to you can store it and but by
default it's just in memory and some
object that they have so here it would
save the user ID and then how would I
access this user ID on further request
right well that session object is now
going to have that user ID in it so I
just say if
cost us session not user ID and if it's
there we just send it back this is the
same thing I had before to checking
whether the user ID so let's take a look
at this in action I think it'll make a
lot more sense so here my server has
just started up and we're gonna just
look at the logs so you can see when
this is called what the session looks
like okay so here's the application the
simple react application I had where we
couldnt see authenticated pages and what
not so here you'll notice there is no
cookies or anything so first if I just
go to the off page it says hey you don't
have any cookie and you'll notice
there's no cookies here but we did just
make a request to the server and so we
can see here is the session and you'll
notice there's no data except for like
this empty cookie object and we told it
not to save uninitialized so we said
false here
and that's why the session was not
stored because we didn't make any change
to it but if we had set this to true
this would actually store this cookie
and the user would have an ID right here
but we didn't so we have to wait till
there's a request so if I come back over
here I can just refresh and I'm just
going to now make a submission so now
you'll notice there is a queue ID so
that's the name we specified earlier and
there's this garbage value thing here
right so this is actually meaningless
this is basically just the key to what
we're storing in the session so we
basically pass that key to the session
middleware and it actually gets the data
for us and puts it in the session object
so now you'll notice here is that
session right there it did not have a
user ID in it but the next request I
make so if I come to the auth page
you'll notice it now sees my ID and we
printed out this object so you'll notice
here's that cookie that we saw earlier
but now there's an extra thing called
user ID
so that is how the express session
middleware works with graph QL and this
stuff and maybe I'll just show you guys
what this save initializing is doing
these are kind of like some default
settings that I really like but we could
turn this to true if we wanted to and so
I'll let this restart and if I come over
here and clear my session and I refresh
and this could not find my cookie but it
did just add a new cookie there but my
cookie is meaningless right now it just
doesn't have a user ID in it and we can
see here's the cookie in each one and
this time the cookies not changing it's
the same cookie each time because we
actually saved a cookie for it and again
if I put this is false let this restart
and get rid of this we wouldn't assign
the user a cookie
until a session object has changed and
it'll save automatically okay so it
refreshed so now if I'm refreshing we
get no cookie no matter how many times I
do this okay so a quick recap of how
this is working we add this middleware
to express that will basically handle
every single request that comes in and
it will check if there's a cookie if
there's a cookie it will take that
cookie look it up in the wherever it's
being stored so that might be Redis in
this case the default is just in memory
some object you know put the data in
this request dot session if it can't
find it or there's invalid one it'll
just put as we saw here a blank cookie
for example and then we can do whatever
we want with this session so we can look
at it which we did in off hello to make
decisions or we can update the session
and that's what we did here and then
that will save the cookie and forever
now whenever that person makes a request
with that cookie it'll have the user ID
in there so that's it for this video I
think this should work with Prisma angry
fq l yoga so that's what i want to do
tomorrow is try it out and show you guys
how you might change the default
authentication template with Prisma to
be using this instead of JWT tokens so
that's it for this video guys thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
