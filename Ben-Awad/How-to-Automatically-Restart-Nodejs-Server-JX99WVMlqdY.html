show you a cool node library called node
demon this will to auto restart your
server every time you make a change to
your node application so it's very nice
for developments you don't keep
restarting the server now I'm going to
show you how to install set this up and
I'll demonstrate how it work so I'm
gonna hop over here to terminal and I
have open a node project I'm using the
feathers GS framework but doesn't really
matter what you're using this works for
any node project I'm going to go ahead
and start installing it with NPM I and
save dev and then no demon I let that
install now something to note this is
only for development you want to make
sure not use this for if you're putting
this project in production you want to
make sure you're not doing no demon when
you're doing that in production
alright so open up your package a JSON
file and you want to replace your start
instead of doing nodes source for
example or whatever you're noting you
can do node demon and then if we do npm
start it'll start it up and notice how
it says it's walking so usually what i
happen when you're doing development is
you'll stir up a server and then you'll
make a change in the oak over here your
control c and restart the server right
now it's watching the files so if i go
edit a file it will automatically
restart so i'm going to come over here
back good localhost when I go to slash
hi
so right now page not found right I'm
going to do I'm going to open up source
this is just the root of my application
and I'm going to say app dot use slash I
and we're just going to say hi to the
user
there so I just made a change right to
where my files so now I haven't saved it
yet notice nothing has changed here but
when I save that file notice how it says
it restarts the server and look it even
caches and enters research your server
and it catches the air that I just made
and now notice how it doesn't crash out
of no demon though I can go fix that
change and it will you know add it back
so instead of a user should be used now
it restarts it and it's good to go I
didn't have to exit out or anything I
can just come over here go to my path
BAM look hi shows up so that's super
easy to set up and get started with no
demon and I recommend it for really any
note application you're using and
developing it is great but again just to
reiterate make sure package of JSON you
have like a in your scripts you have
like prod and that one you just want to
do note source it's not too bad but no
demon is a little bit more heavy because
it's watching all your directories
alright guys so that's it for this video
