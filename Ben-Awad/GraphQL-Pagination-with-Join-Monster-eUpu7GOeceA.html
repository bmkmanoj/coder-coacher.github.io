on pagination with join monster so I was
looking at their documentation and the
way do they do it is super confusing
they're trying to do with the relay
style which is a good way to do it with
edges and nodes so they complicated for
no reason so I'm going to show you the
simple way you can add keyset paging I
think this is the best pagination
technique because it's just the most
performant and most efficient so I'll
show you easy way to add this to any one
of your queries now the lake key set
works is you're going to sort on a
particular column and then what we're
going to do is just like give the place
in the list we want to get all the items
accurate and then we limit it of course
to so over here I have the code for the
previous video did envoy monster I have
all books query and this is what we're
going to add a cursor to or you could
say we could sit we call this a key
parameter and the key is just the place
in the list we want to get all items
after it so this is going to be an int
because we're going to use the ID field
so I'm going to add one parameter to
that and then in my join Monster
metadata I'm going to do all books and
then here we're going to do a couple
things so we're going to look limit how
much we get back so we can set a default
limit but let's make this more flexible
and actually we can do the little set
the limit here so let's do int as well
um so you can just set a limit hard to
go to here but what we're going to do is
say table empty args and then say we can
expand this and just get the limit area
so we're going to grab the limit args
that we get from the resolver and just
pass it in and set that here so then
we're going to also have a order by this
we are I think it's just going to be
static always going to be the ID but if
you wanted you could pass that in as
well and then we're going to have a
we're similar to this and the where here
is going to do
use the argh key so let's expand this
why not grab the key and here we're
going to say key and we want to get all
the ones where the ID in the table is
greater than our key that's it see how
fast we just added a key set pagination
there's just a couple lines and we
already have it now there's one extra
thing we have to do though and that's
just at the dialect so if you were to go
and run this right now Here I am setting
all books you are going to get an error
and the reason for that as we'll see in
let me just refresh this so we get
autocomplete so the key will save zero
so we start speeding a list and limit
will say 2 so we just get a few books
the fire to run this can't be probably
limit of undefined well okay if that was
a new area that I thought we were going
to get so let's set so this is undefined
are we getting the limit here yeah we're
going to eliminate here okay we'll do
we'll do a function limit in a second
comment this out first let's make sure
this does work with a static limit so
let's say 10 and in our schema we'll
come back to you okay so it resets is no
limit and it keeps here all right so we
get to say the type of pagination not
support and dialect that's just because
we need to go to our resolve rivers and
to specify the dialect so where is it
okay so here's our join monster so the
last parameter of join monster you can
specify the dialect so we just need to
select that we're using Postgres so not
all dialects are supported make sure you
put in whatever database you're using
here and make sure they support limit
and supporter by sorry
so PGs for Postgres and now we go ahead
and run this on BAM we get the first ten
and we can add the title and we can get
their authors too of course
I the primary first name right let me
get the first 10 coming back I just put
a bunch of dummy that I have I have the
books from last video I just put a bunch
of dummy videos or books that are all
the same so if we set the key and so
this is easier to demonstrate let's just
set the limit smaller to um then rerun
this sorry so we get the ID of 1 and 2
if I set the key to 1 then we're just
going to grab two and three get two and
three here and then you can just keep
incrementing the key the last item in
the list so how you would do it is I
would grab I would this is the data I
get backing whenever I want more I just
look at the last item which is at 3 set
that as my key and just keep doing it
every time a lot more data look at my
last item update key so that's how you
would you know page through this now
let's see if I can get this limit to
work I'm surprised it didn't because we
should be passing the argument and then
being able to set it here so here we go
limit it's going to be an ant
if not I mean we should be able to if
this looks like it would work right it's
a copycat where table maybe it's this
first argument for limit because it
doesn't really need a table or it
doesn't need any of these thing so maybe
I need to change that
sorry so this should crash like you did
before all books argument limit of type
integer part of the knock knock over so
let's at the limit here of 3 k95 limit
undefined so let's just keep moving it
over one argument at a time until it
works alright cool network so for
whatever reason for limit you need to
it's the second argument but for the
where clause it's the third argument I
don't know why it's like that but it is
sorry so we're getting three if we
wanted to get more we could you create
10 and you notice we're getting all the
once ID passed six so that's all of this
that's
see how fast you're able to add
pagination enjoy Matsu very easy so you
want to limit order by and where clause
where you want to do you know greater
than whatever your cursor is or your key
whatever you want to call it and then
you want to order by something we're
ordering by ID here
you're wearing your order should match
right if you're checking past the ID
should order by the ID you're doing it
like for example the title so that's
another thing you could do if you wanted
to order by the title you could and so
you would want to do everything pass the
title and then you'd want to set the
schema here the key as a strength
vehicle title the book and by the way
this is a terrible way to do it because
just slower search than ID because ID is
going to be indexed and title is not so
you want this is you want the film to be
indexed ideally because then it makes it
faster in the database IDs automatically
index I believe and Postgres and then
also its integer comparisons faster than
string comparisons what's the greater
than and then in the limit you can set
this to whatever your application needs
both those guys thanks for watching and
this code going to be up on github which
one check out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
