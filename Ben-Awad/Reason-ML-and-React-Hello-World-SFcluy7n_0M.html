language I just found out about ml this
is something Facebook made and very
similar to Oh camel the sin taxes and it
actually you can make JavaScript with
this thing some of how it works at all
but you can even better you can write
react with this just a little hello
world program I made with this and what
looks like so and their QuickStart here
you can get some reason react
application which I recommend it's um
this is I've really been interested in
functional programming with front-end
stuff so I tried out Elm and almost
really cool and I really like this I
really like this works with react and
it's actually weird react libraries to
like redux and stuff so I install the PC
the QuickStart is very easy to get set
up we and then we just do we want to I
want to create a reason react app so I'd
be an it and then I just have the code
so here is what the code looks like this
is a component I wrote the absolute
gibberish to you guys if you've never
seen reason I'm assuming maybe you
haven't but let me just break it down to
you I'm not too bad when you get used to
it and it's actually really cool so here
we're basically just naming a component
I am I'm really new to this too so we
renaming the opponent here we can make
it a stateful or a stateless I like see
it autocompletes there's also the state
list so I use a component will mount
this is this is Vera Hsu mning you can
keep the state with stateful and no stay
tunes and react you can great react peer
non functions or components in this as
well so I have a stateful called it
input and so the render function of this
is couples not the render function but
you you make this thing call it block
called make and inside of make you can
have a river your JSX goes and notice
how we just render JSX
is thing or not JIT is this is not JSX
but this is Joe this I don't know what
to call this I guess it's
is X but like you notice hazard right
you used two curly braces probably what
what this program does is actually very
simple let me show you actually example
right here hello world so it hops up
here so I have an input here and it's
calling this update thing and then on
change and then I am doing an h1 here in
displaying this state so I'm keeping the
state I'm saying the initial state to an
empty string I'm going to element which
basically takes the string and can't
just do strings and a reason where you
could just like put the string and it
renders an HTM a string to element like
this this update thing as you notice I
call an on change here this is a
function taking two parameters
structuring we don't actually need the
state notice both of these or this green
none of them that is standard practice
and reason to if you're not going to use
that parameter so people noting and I
mean this is Visual Studio code I have
open right here and you can see it do
the types of everything so that's pretty
nice so also the nice thing about this
is if it compiles that where Pilar is
very strict and it has static typing and
inference and a lot of cool stuff so but
on pathan chain well it takes an event
kind of similar to this thing right here
is me calling a comment and reason but
it's me calling target value right okay
so that's heightened reason I just did
commit Visual Studio could autocomplete
it for me as an um alright so our update
we're calling this upcoming how we want
to update the state so yeah this reason
update is up number passing it this big
things big thing here is a string string
here or this this block of code within
target value but you can see it's really
ugly additively how to get the value of
it but look at that that's nasty that's
pretty gross
but this is like getting a laughs I
believe is double hash this looks this
looks really foreign to me whenever
we're typing we call us unchanged
functions with Upstate in the states
getting rendered here begin us this is
me D structuring again props getting
past here so pretty cool stuff so I just
this and I want to show you how you run
it to it's kind of I actually have three
tabs open right now
the first tab here I on them start in
this folder which takes this cupcakes it
turns into JavaScript I believe and then
here M p.m. ruling I think it takes the
JavaScript that we created and doesn't
that like webpack does its thing right
where it many things that web pack needs
to do I actually don't know web pack
that much myself and then over here to
open this up it's actually not running
on open and just open this guy this file
and how this is pointed at a file right
here as it's not running on ever so
that's kind of interesting
yeah but that is reason pretty cool
stuff I want to spend more time on it
but I'm a fridge as opposed to
JavaScript and a project right now in
JavaScript so I want to actually finish
it and I try ting JavaScript if I start
writing more this looks really close me
this is the stuff I really like I might
be doing more of us in the future like
right now kind of tasting it and I'm not
going to do too much here I can see
myself getting really into this because
rather than L is element I want to do
more with it but I really like that it
works with all the react libraries so
that's pretty cool you need to do a
little bit more work I'm pro I like I
haven't I haven't actually done it
myself but I've heard you can and I I'm
sure it's a little bit more work to get
work with the library I think that's
pretty cool so for this video guys just
wanted to kind of show you this I
recommend trying it out it's pretty cool
so thanks for watching Alex video
