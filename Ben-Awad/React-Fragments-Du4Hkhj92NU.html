called fragments came out and it's one
of my favorite new features and I see
myself using it a lot now and I want to
show you guys how it works and why it's
cool so to do this I have a create react
app open and just some basic code but
you can add this really to any react
project that's using react 16 so they
have this thing called fragment but
before I show you it I want to show you
when you would use it and why you would
use it so right now I have this
component called header right and I'm
using it in my application then over
here here's what my header component
looks like I have a left header and a
right header and I'm wrapping it with a
div and here's what it looks like in the
browser right nothing too special bold
say I want to get rid of this div like I
just want to return a left and a right -
this will actually throw an error and
crash because you can't have you can't
return two divs from a component at
least not like this now
they had something where you can go like
this and actually I think this was in
react 16 and I believe recently I think
like sixteen point two fragments came
out so actually I think you do need to
upgrade if you want magnets but now what
I can do is I can pass it in an array
like this so this is how you can return
multiple elements before fragments so
each one and if we come over here though
here's the problem with that right it's
an array so you have to add a key to it
so it's kind of annoying to have to come
over here and now I have to create a key
for each one so this will be my left
header
and this will be my right header so this
is a thing you can do right so there's
nothing wrong with this fragments are
just like a nice alternative to having
to do this so if I have X tips I want to
return I have to add a key to each one
now same thing you want to make sure the
keys are unique like if you were to
create a map but now there's a new way
of doing this so now I don't have to
worry about the keys because those are
kind of annoying what you can do is just
return a fragment so you can do oops
okay I keep going there we go
react dot fragment and you treat it like
a regular tag and we can get rid of the
comma and now this wraps your entire app
right but this is the acts like a any
other tag but it's not any other tag if
you look at the source code there's
actually not going to be anything around
it so notice how there's an outer div
but this is coming from our app and just
to show you that we can call this a
section and now if we take a look click
on this we have a section surrounding
the left and right header so this just
allows us to return these two without
having to add keys and without you know
making an array so it's really nice and
I find myself using this a lot if I want
to return multiple things from a
component now it's also useful when
you're mapping so let's say over here I
have an ordered list for example and I
want to just spit out
I want a map over these items here so
one two three and I want to be like map
and then for each one you know no
problem if we just want to say display
one item at a time right well let's say
we want to display two items right so
here we go
this works and let's just make this a
unordered list so we don't just see
duplicates there we go so now what
happens if I want to display two so I
want to display this and I want to
display X times X for example so like I
said before we could wrap this and by
the way I should have been using a key
on this guy right before I'm sure we got
a console log yeah about it so like
before I could add a array around this
to get this to work because this won't
work right now or again this is another
place where you can use react fragments
so I can wrap it with a react fragment
yack fragment and now I can return two
things from the list now we also need to
add a key to him and you can just add it
like this and that's you need to add a
key here because we're mapping and we
just need to close the tag correctly
like that
and save it so now we're able to return
to list items when mapping so now we see
1 1 2 2 2 4 3 9 so perfect so over here
we don't need a key cuz we're not
mapping but here we do cuz we're mapping
that's usual now there's also another
syntax for it but it's not really
supported and a lot of things I don't
think it's supported and create react
app but these two are equivalent so this
is basically the shorthand syntax
they're adding I think it's what like
that there you go so let's see if this
works and create react app currently not
working so you see I don't I don't have
any errors over here cuz this is good
syntax but a create react app does not
support it currently but it plans to I
believe in the future so stay tuned for
that that'll be coming out soon yeah I
recommend trying out fragments they're
really nice for just removing duplicate
divs that you ended up surrounding your
code in right because a lot of times
before I would have this as it just an
extra div that I would create here to
get this to work and so it really helps
eliminate just the amount of HTML you're
spitting out well that's it for this
video guys go check out react fragments
they're super cool and thanks for
watching
