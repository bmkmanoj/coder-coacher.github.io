favorite way to do authentication this
is something I implemented in a previous
video and I'll link in the description
below if you want to see the actual code
for how this works but I'm kind of just
gonna do an overview of how it works and
how the whole thing flows together and
the reason why I like it so much is I
think it strikes a nice balance between
being secure enough but also you're not
making too many requests to the database
where you still get some of the
advantages of using a JWT token so this
strategy what it does is it uses a to
JWT tokens a regular token and a refresh
token one of the tokens lasts for a
short amount of time like a minute
whereas the other one lasts more like
seven days or a month a longer period of
time and it's used to refresh the
short-lived token and every time we
refresh the shorter-lived token we do a
database request so instead of doing a
request to database on every time we
only do it when the first token expires
which could be every minute it could be
every two minutes whatever your
application you want to do for it so you
could end up querying your database for
example every minute instead of on every
request which is a lot better so let's
walk through how this works so here's my
client here's my server the first thing
what my client will do to like get
access to the website is to log in with
an email and a password
now of course will authenticate that and
then will send back two tokens to the
client like I was talking about we have
one token here that short-lived and a
longer live token here so the
short-lived one we're calling just a JWT
token I'm gonna say it expires in a
minute but this could be a little bit
longer depends on your application how
much exposure you want and I'm signing
that with a secret and for now I'm
signing it with the same seeker for
every token and you don't want anyone to
see that and then this other token the
Refresh token it's gonna last longer
I said seven days so a week so if a user
hasn't logged in in seven days then
I can't they're gonna have to reopen to
Kate and so also the way I sign this
token is I did another secret but I also
signed the token with the hashed
password of that user so what that means
is if I want to validate whether the
token is correct I have to get the
secret and the hash password of the user
to validate and the reason for this is
if the user forgets their password it
automatically will invalidate all tokens
that are out there for that user
so for example if someone gets hacked I
can just tell them hey reset your
password and then they're safe no one
can access their account anymore so
that's the reason why you see I'm using
the secret and a hash password to sign
the token itself okay and then every
request that the client makes this is
what's gonna happen down here so let's
say they want to access some kind of
information like they want to get their
you they want to just like see I don't
know how many pictures they have or
something some type of request it will
first come here and it'll check whether
the token is valid and that's this first
token up here the short-lived one if
it's valid it hasn't been you know it's
been within a minute that they've gotten
the token we go ahead just make sure we
check the token and they're restoring
the permissions if they have permission
to store the date to fetch the data if
they do good we just give them the data
and they go on so we make no
intermediate requests to the database
here so that's really nice we just give
them their data and they're good to go
but here's what we do if the token has
expired it's been more than a minute
it's invalid so what we will do is we
will decode the refresh token so we're
not verifying that the refresh token is
valid
we're just decoding it because in the
payload of the token we're storing the
user ID that's associated with the token
so then what we can do is we can fetch
the user so now we have the user
associated with that refresh token and
what we can do is we have their password
right we have their hashed password
that's important we're not storing their
regular password
it's been hashed so we have their hash
password and so we can use that hash
password plus the secret to actually
verify the token is valid so we do that
and again at any step here if it fails
we're unable to encode the toque or
decode the token for some reason if we
can't fetch the user
we're throwing an error or we're not
throwing an error or we just assume the
users not logged in because they give us
bad tokens so we're gonna check if the
Refresh token is valid by using the
secret and the hash password and make
sure making sure it hasn't been seven
days since the user has made a request
and if that's the case that all works
out we will refresh refresh token and
refresh the token so we're giving them
two new tokens here on their request
because they give us a valid token so
for another minute they can make
requests without querying the database
and so we already fetched the user here
once so we just use that to create both
the tokens and then they go on their way
they validate the permission and fetch
the data again and so this is just a
nice little cycle every time they make a
request if it's been within a minute
they just go through they'll have faster
requests if not we check the Refresh
token and give them a new one if they
need it so now this is something where
you can play with this number here
because as you can see it'll slow you
know it slows down requests after a
minute you have to make another fetch to
the database in the middle here so that
will definitely slow it down so you want
to basically make this as long as you
can without basically putting out too
much exposure or threat if something
went wrong with your application
basically the idea here is if the
permissions get messed up
they're only messed up for a minute and
then they should be good again
ideally permissions should never get
messed up this is just kind of a
safeguard if for some reason you send a
Refresh token back and the user just
does not accept it or something or
blocks it or puts a new token in it's
only for a minute
it's bad so this could be 20 minutes for
your application it could be five
minutes just depends on what your
application can handle and so that's
like the main thing you want to tweak
and see and make longer if you can't cuz
then you don't have to make as many
requests but you know you could get out
of order
but this is the this is what I really
liked is you're not having to query the
database on every request so that's
really nice I also like being able to
invalidate the refresh token with
changing the password so if someone gets
hacked they're not just exposed they we
can just invalidate their tokens out
there so that's pretty nice so this is
the method that I just implemented and I
really like and then I'll be using for
applications that I want to add
authentication to and it just adds a
nice little balance
we're not requesting stuff from the
database too often but we're doing it
enough so we're up to date and our
application doesn't get stale so let sit
for this video guys thanks for watching
and I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
