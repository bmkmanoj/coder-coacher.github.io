installing and setting up next Jas now
this is a highly requested video and
I've been really anxious to try out this
framework because it looks super cool
now if you don't know what it is this is
a good description right here but
basically it is a starter kit for react
that makes it easier and faster to get
started so you know start coding react
and the cool thing about this framework
it is server rendered similar to if
you've heard of react ql it's another
one but this is not as focused on it
doesn't have a graph killed built in you
need to add it yourself but anyway we're
going to just go through the setup and
try installing this guy now they are in
beta for next GS 3.0 so I'm going to go
ahead and use that if you're watching
this video and you want to follow along
check and see what the version is the
latest they should have it should say
here it says right here our latest is to
beta 3.0 so that's what we doing I'm
going to be installing it with this add
beta so you might not need at beta if
you want to do 3 or they might be a new
or went out and you can follow along I
also put the link to the github here so
you can follow along if you like to
alright so I'm just kind of hop over to
the command line I'm going to make a
folder I'm going to put this stuff in
what's we call it hello actually I'm
going to make it a directory for next J
s and then we'll go and type that and
create a hello world and then we'll go
into will go into our hello world
directory now I'm just going to I think
NPM M it skip sets up a project cool I'm
also going to yarn to set up the yarn
and I need to do a Arnon it cool alright
next we're going to install these and
I'm a fan of yarn so I'm going to it
with the yarn and we don't you save and
if we pop back over here we just need to
add this to our package on JSON and then
we here can just start coding a way it
looks like
and so I'm going to open this up in a
editor I like to use Visual Studio code
you can use whatever you like when this
is downloading which should be pretty
quickly here yep do code and open up
this directory full screen this will put
it over here alright so now we can put
this in our package of JSON so Agra
giorgia song now scripts we don't need a
testing strip like that right
so I assume dev is what we're going to
want to run the server on NPM start I'm
not sure they've seen start in dev are I
see we wanted maybe these are two
different types of servers we'll try
them out after that says the main API
cool every Jas filed comes a route
that's nifty so we want to create a
pages folder and in deck okay so okay
new folder called pages and what would
they call it index and back watch yes
and is there anything special you put in
this all right
interestingly enough usually when you
have code like this you'll have to put
react at the top but they're not I
wonder if we're gonna get air rescue
excuse me
alright so I'll just try writing this we
might need to import react so I'm just
going to do MPM dev run des to run D dev
script and I'm not sure if this without
putting anything I'm not sure what
poured it starting on okay cool so it
looks like it's ready looks like we
didn't get an air you can go to will
close 3000 and see all right that was
actually really fast to set up there you
got our first web page of wondered and
as we can see here I don't even have to
import react attend
interesting so now kind of interested so
as you can see this is a lot more
minimal than some of the other starter
kits that I've used let's try making a
new folder maybe called hollow and
export default and this will be more
stuff hello page so now what I'm
expecting is if I go to slash hello I
should see that and it's thinking it's
thinking in the redirects here I was
compiling still so that's a really slow
compile time Oh page alright so I want
to see how fast if this refreshes the
page so when I save this file I've
gotten rid of the H let's see what
happens over here so it compiles okay
that was really fast I don't know why we
slowed before and let's see I didn't
notice it's the page refreshed cool the
page does not even have to refresh
that's really cool higher we can put
this back and there's one more thing I
want to show you guys that I thought was
pretty cool and that's good to know and
that's just switching pages there's a
lot of other cool built-in features I
recommend taking a look at this page I'm
just going to go over a few the one I'm
going to be going over is routing and
it's this link so we can import it like
so and we can link to other pages this
way so you don't have to use like
something like react router now you can
just use next j/s will already come with
a router itself so alright maybe we want
to go to splash world we can create a
world page and it looks like everything
we create here automatically becomes our
route like it said and looks like it's
working correctly
so now I have this link when I click on
this button we should go to the world
page okay click on you and we go to
world cool so that is it for this video
guys
we installed next Jes got set up and I
showed you a quick how to make different
routes and how to change routes by
clicking on a link and that's it for
this I'll see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
