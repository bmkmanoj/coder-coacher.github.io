what refresh tokens are and why you
might want to be using them this is kind
of a more advanced authentication topic
and you might not need this but it's
very important to know about and when
you should use it so I'm going to be
just like get right into example of Y of
Y refresh tokens are necessary and the
problem that they try to solve
so I'm have this mutation that I just
ran to get the login credentials for
these guys so I have a token right here
and if you'd like to run this code and
get the server running and see what I'm
doing as I'm doing in running on your
machine output and a link in description
below so you can download it we're going
to just grab this token here and we're
going to come to the desktop client for
graphical and if you don't have this
it's in the link to description below
and I'm just going to run me real quick
and I already added it to the header of
course authorization and pasted my token
in so it knows that I am boba and I am
and admin now for this example to work
or maybe make more sense I basically
have some permissions set up that a only
admins can create boards and if you
don't know how to create permissions you
want to that link in description below
that might be a nice video we'll watch
before you watch this because it's
really reason you don't really need
refresh tokens unless you have kind of a
more advanced permission set up okay
anyway let's get jump right into this
though so we have boba here I'm logged
in as this user I'm just going to copy
this and we're going to do a mutation
and we're going to create a board right
and it's going to let us because of
course we are a admin right so BAM
create our board okay but what would
happen if for example I come over here
and I changed the database so I'm going
to go into PC equal I'm going to connect
to my graph QL database now it doesn't
have to be
direct database change you could have
basically maybe a resolver that revokes
access so maybe you have a resolver that
says revoke admin access and we're what
we want to do is revoke admin access to
boba so I'm going to update the update
boba so he is no longer an admin so
update users set is admin pulse and for
the boba username so update him is no
longer an admin and acquit Alice so he
just got revoked he is no longer an
admin so he should not be able to create
boards right
oh what the heck he was able to create a
board right here but if I come back here
put me hey he's not an admin anymore
what's happening so I come back I can
still create as many boards as I want
but as we see right here he's not an
admin and if we select username and is
admin and I think after afters and
quotes from users oh you go to PC Co I
want to show you guys in the database
select username and is admin in the
database it shows him not as an admin
right users okay so we see Bob or boba
and Bob both not admin so then why I'm
coming over here does it say does it let
me create boards right we should be we
revoked access to it well the reason is
we're checking whether they have access
with this JWT token this JSON web token
so when we created it over here Bobo was
originally an Advent so this token as
long as this token exists
bow was considered an admin because we
don't check the database to see whether
boba is and then we just check this
token and the reason we just check the
token is because it's faster we don't
have to hit the database every time so
basically our token is old and it needs
to be refreshed and that's where refresh
tokens come in so instead like we I
think we set this token to last
like maybe a week or maybe a month maybe
a year an X amount of time right and
then a user would have to read login
this is what keeps users logged in well
here what you do is if you use a refresh
token
maybe this lasts for five minutes maybe
20 minutes and then it expires when it
expires you have to refresh it and you
have another token which acts as your
refresh token and it gives you a new one
and the Refresh token lasts maybe a week
or so and so as long as the Refresh
token is valid you can refresh this
token and that way you when you refresh
this token you get the latest
information you will know if this guy is
an admin and what's nice about this is
also what you can do is anytime you're
updating and you know you're going to
like make this token old as you can Auto
refresh it so now I've already coded
this out so I just want to walk through
what I've created and explain how it
works and how you can implement refresh
token to yourself so this is an example
implementation and I'll have the github
code below if you'd like to take a look
further look at this so this is our
graph geoserver I was talking about I
split out into a new file called off J s
because there's a lot of author
authorization code now and we want to
basically have it's not a ton but
there's a decent amount that it's nice
to have split off and you can reuse
these multiple parts of the site now
okay so the first thing is I created a
create token function which we'll come
back to because it means some context of
what we're going to call this and
refresh tokens
the first thing I want to go over though
is try login so this is the function
that's going to be called when we want
to log a user in so now when we log a
user in we don't want to just give him
one but we're going to give them two
tokens so if we go to the schema here I
created a new type off payload here
caveat over which returns a token and
then a refresh token and so we're
returning that with a login mutation and
now I also create another mutation
called refresh token which takes both
and gives them new ones back but back to
off
so try login here so we get the email
password right and we have some
additional information that we need to
create the tokens first thing we're
going to do is we have to find the user
this is the same as we had before check
if I have a valid password this stuff
right here same as you've seen this is a
classic login stuff and then here after
they login we're actually creating
tokens and I actually do slight a cool
little trick here to actually make this
run faster which let's talk about that
actually so I call this function called
create tokens which returns a token and
a refresh token and that's what we're
returning right so there's two get two
tokens they're keeping track of and
inside create token we're creating both
tokens and a JWT sign is a promise so
one way we could have done is how to
wait here and await here so I first
create the regular token and then I
create the Refresh token right and
notice how we creates the token and the
Refresh token in the same manner and
actually let me talk about that before
we talk about this cool little trick
I'll keep that there but notice how
there's no need store is admin for the
Refresh token because this is really
just used to verify that we have a user
and to refresh this token here so this
last seven days this last 20 minutes so
every twenty minutes what we'd like to
do is we'd like to refresh it you
this token and then they will store a
fresh is admin so that way every twenty
minutes were basically checking if the
user is still using the site of course
if they're still an admin and we refresh
that so this is very useful say you have
a subscription service and it ends after
a month and the user cancels while
you're checking every 20 minutes hey has
the month over yet
and you can revoke their access once the
month is over so it's handy to come and
check frequently because you want to
revoke access or whatnot so that's
that's the difference between these two
but you'll notice we're using the same
function to create them and this is a
async function here oops
returns a promise so we can await it
right so we can do it like this but you
notice when we do a wait and makes it
synchronous we wait here for this
function to finish so I would run this
wait here run this wait here
and then I'd return it right but instead
what I did is I'm returning the promise
right so both of these will return a
promise and then I'm doing this promise
all so both of these can run
asynchronously and we wait for both to
finish so these are both running in
parallel so they can finish and it's you
know creating a token doesn't take that
long but it's kind of a cool thing it
really both for unparallel saves you a
little computation time in your
responses a little bit quicker so you do
promise that all and you pass an array
of your promises and we resolve all the
promises and then down here we're
grabbing those so that's it
so you notice our login changed a little
bit now we're returning two tokens right
now let's talk about our add user
because it's got a little bit more
complicated so I now want to accept two
tokens in the header a X token and an X
refresh token so I'd like to pass both
of those and and the first thing I want
to check is
if they gave me a token if not that's
cool we just keep going that means
they're not logged in that's fine some
of our routes and what you could do is
if your server doesn't handle any
unauthenticated users you can just throw
an error here you could say throw new
error if you wanted to and say need off
right but for my server there's some
things you can do like for example
register you can register if you're not
authenticated right you don't wanna lock
people out so yeah so we check if they
have a token if not they just go right
through if they did give us a token we
first check is the choke and still valid
basically if it is cool we don't do
anything this is the exact same thing
right
we just we get the user from the token
we pass it here and then we go on to our
graphs ql resolvers passing our user in
here but here's where the interesting
stuff happens let's say our token is
invalid it's been 20 minutes and we need
to refresh it how do we handle that hope
that's where this error happens here and
we grab the Refresh token from the
header and then we call our refresh
token function our refresh token
function is going to take our tokens and
give us new ones now the reason why we
only want to run this you know every 20
minutes and you can change that I think
20 minutes is a DML time you could give
an hour depends on your server your
setup and how often to be changing
things right and how long you can you
basically want to wait as long as you
can afford to wait because you're making
less database calls because refresh
tokens has to call the database so it
can get a fresh token for you right so
you want to do this as not as often as
you can
right at least often so it takes the
tokens create some new tokens and I'll
talk about how this actually refreshes
the tokens in a second and then I like
to do this a little bit of magic here we
are also when we create this new Tok
we're getting the user while we're at it
because we have to add the user to the
tokens so you just get a new token site
user so this is pretty straightforward
right we get new tokens and then tokens
are good now and then you can add this
but what I like to do and I check
whether we're giving back tokens because
you know something could go bad and I'll
talk about that and I actually in the
header set the X token and the Refresh
token with for the response and you'll
notice I expose these so that the client
can actually see them so when i refresh
tokens I want to give it back so for
example if I have a react application
that's talking to my server I want to
give them back in a refresh token and
the tokens so they can then use it and
this is how I like to do it so it's very
automated right I don't have to like
actually call the refreshing mutation if
I don't want to I can just keep querying
stuff and I'll pass back new tokens to
the react client on the response so that
what the react client would do is they
would in the response of a graph QL
query they check the header and see if
there's new tokens and if so it store
those in like local storage or something
so that's what this bit is doing here
okay so lastly let's just talk about
refresh tokens so that is this part
right here so here we're again just
rolling through it very similar to the
thing before as we check we verify the
refresh token if the Refresh tokens not
good the user has to log back in right
because it's been maybe a week since
they've logged into the website so the
Refresh token expired so we just if it's
if the Refresh token is not valid and
the regular token is not valid that's
when we just return an empty object we
have no user on we say hey react client
tell me user to log back in but let's
say we the Refresh token is valid we
have a user we're storing the ID as you
saw up here
we save the ID and the Refresh token so
you grab that ID we have a user ID and
so we grab the user associated with that
token and then same thing as you're
doing before we create the tokens
storing the user and then we can pass
back these tokens so very simple very
similar to how we do try log and we
refresh the tokens and that's pretty
much it guys this is how I do
refreshing tokens so that way you're
basically keep your tokens up-to-date
and nothing gets old and if we go to our
resolvers you'll see I just added
refresh tokens and try login so now our
resolvers for example our mutation down
here called try login for login now I
just basically moved the logic over to
auth and then four refresh tokens I'm
just made that mutation and then I'm
calling it here any acts should
off-the-cuff make this async okay cool
so let's it for this video guys if you
have any questions or comments about
refresh tokens or if you have a better
method of doing it I'd love to hear it
hear how you guys set up your servers so
that's it I'll see you guys the next
