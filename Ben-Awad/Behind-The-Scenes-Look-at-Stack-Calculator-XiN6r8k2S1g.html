going over my new app I just released to
the Amazon and Google Play Store called
stack calculator and I wanted to give
you guys a behind-the-scenes tour of how
I actually built this thing now for
those of you that haven't seen it is
what it looks like right here um it's
it's a calculator it's an RPM calculator
has these nice buttons right here and
has a textview here and you can click on
it to change it from a negative to a
positive or vice versa and together
whatnot
down here I have a little Google AdMob
banner and to monetize it a little bit
and that's pretty much what the app
looks like right now and I want to get
into how I actually built it so as you
see I'm an Android studio this is what I
programmed it in I really like it
I write I started learning Android
programming right as inner studio came
out and so I started ever since I know
some people use Eclipse but I've really
enjoyed using Android studio that seems
to be what ever done switching to so I'm
glad I started here so that's what I use
and so let's talk about the layout first
so as you see this is what the layout
looks like on the phone right here
basically this is the base layout it's a
relative layout with I have a text to
you this is this is a custom view that
but it's basically just a textview and
all should get to that later but what it
does is the text size changes depending
on how big the how much room there is so
I can actually give you an example real
quick notice how big the font is for
this let's see if I just add more
numbers
I just notice it if I add more numbers
the fonts getting smaller with each
number that way it doesn't look off were
in the screen or cut off and that's all
the custom
was doing and probably I could tap what
that looks like later this is in this
video I'm just doing an overview if you
guys like this I get into a little bit
more depth of each how the app you know
the nitty-gritty of how each component
works so I have a text view here at the
top then they have a ad view at the very
bottom which is the Google ad and then
in the middle I have these buttons now
these buttons they are sandwiched
between this view and the ad view the ad
view is it takes up the whole width the
bottom and it's just uh it's line to the
parent of the bottom and the number of
you is aligned to the top and this is a
specified height of 125 density pixels I
had this a little differently with my
first version but I switched it because
I want this to be a minimum value so
it's always this certain height and so
these numbers just fill the space of the
screen in between and how I do that is
so let's take a look at how actually
this works so these rows are a linear
layout and then each one of these number
rows is another linear layout so this
linear layout is between this custom
view and the ad view and then I have
horizontal views one two three four and
five inside and for those I have just
four buttons and I have their each have
a weight of one and so they just feel
the weight right here and then in the
code I have them fill the height of the
screen and I'll show how that is done
because initially I have on both like a
square and if there's enough room I have
the
the numbers shaped as a square but if
there's not enough room like on tablets
there's just the buttons get too big the
width that the height can't it doesn't
work as well so they become rectangles
kind of how you see them right here and
so also what you'll notice is this view
only works for a horizontal and I only
made the view for horizontal I haven't
made of you for excuse me this is only a
portrait view I haven't made the
horizontal view yet and right now I'm
content with this and I may go in later
and add some more features so they can
turn it horizontal but right now in my
manifest file I have it so it can only
be portrait and so that's how my layout
is basically made right now if we go
over to the main activity this is a very
simple app and the it only has one
activity and the right here I will show
you how I did the buttons so I have a
get view tree observer so I can actually
get the width of the buttons and if you
notice there's five rows so I'm dividing
the I basically want to split up each
row into equal pieces now I could use a
weight if you come over here I could use
for this a weight for I can give each
one of these a weight of one so they
fill up the screen but vertically but I
did it this way and what I'm so how this
works is I first get the width of one of
these buttons because one of these
buttons it'll always have some default
width because I have a weight of one
and what I'm doing is I'm setting the
height also to equal the width unless
the with unless there's not enough room
and in that case I just divide whatever
space there is for the height by five
and I let that equal that and so that's
how this is working and I'm just saying
the layout parameters for that so that's
what this code is doing right here and
right here I load the ad for the ad view
and over here I'm initializing my stack
and my variables and if you notice I
actually need to set the text let's take
a look at the thing you see this has a
subscript right here and right here and
I have to set that with this HTML so
that's how I did that and I'm actually
so if you know how an RPN calculator
works I'm using it the stack to keep
track of its fat stack object to you
know hold the stack and up here this is
some of my this is the max number that I
allow my calculator and this is the
smallest number and this is basically
just arbitrary I felt like this was a
large enough number that people wanted
and also it gets to the point where the
screen gets the font gets really small
and so I felt like that was a good size
like you take a look oops take a look at
this as the gets smaller I say I don't
want any more than 20 decimal places
because I mean you don't need a lot more
this the numbers game really really big
and this is what my heirs are division
by zero overflow when those occur and so
that's basically what me I on create
methods just initializing some stuff
right here I am sitting up you cool
analytics I'm just tracking you know
people how many people are you seen my
app um right here I'm initializing the a
basically will pop up to come up it's
telling people that they can make this
number negative if they just click here
because that's not exactly intuitive so
I wanted a little pop-up show up and you
saw that the beginning of the video um
and so yeah that's what that was doing
it just saving in preferences and then
over here all these buttons right here I
have on click methods that do different
things and that's just the program for
the how the logic works with stat
calculator if you guys want me to get
into that you can just let me know in
the comments below like show you how
these methods are working but the video
is already doing plenty long and I just
wanted to do a short little overview of
how I made this and so that's how the
lick works and this is literally all I
have in my code it's very a simple app
um that's how it works
and I did a custom background for these
buttons to make them look this color and
yeah that's how I made this app um if
you would like to get it I'll link it
below and the descriptions on the google
play store in the Amazon store this is
my first app and yeah uh if you have any
questions you can leave a comment below
or if there's anything you'd like to see
just let me know I can show you how I
did it in my code that's pretty much all
the file oh yeah I wanted to go over
real quick this this is how I did my you
see up here it's a custom view and it is
right here this is just some Stack
Overflow code that I basically got and
what it does is you guys can see it
right here
what's doing is it's just measuring how
much room there is and picking a font
size that will fit for that text view
space so that's how this works I think
you guys want to be and see that so ya
up tell app works and it's really
there's not a lot going on over here
you're gonna see anything else let me
know thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
