apologizing for the bad videos I've come
out the past week or so what happened is
my microphone went bad and I was still
recording some videos with it without
realizing it I kind of in one sitting or
court a bunch of videos with it and then
when the first video came out someone
mention audio was bad I should have
checked this myself and I didn't so that
was super bad my part and thankfully
someone showed me and told me that the
author was bad and I saw and it's super
choppy the audio is terrible the video
is bad quality and I should not have
released it and when I found out that it
was that I shouldn't have continued
releasing the other ones I the reason I
was releasing those and the reason why I
did like a bunch and recorded a bunch at
once is because I was able to quarrel
last week so I wanted to keep making
videos so I was like no video is worse
than crappy video but I didn't realize
how crappy they were - they're they're
really bad they're unwatchable I should
not have released them and I'm apologize
for that for just they're really really
bad and this week what I'm going to be
doing is actually just going to go back
and redo them I got this new microphone
here that you're listening to right now
it's a blue snowball I think it's a lot
better quality than I was using before
so hopefully you like it better let me
know how it sounds how you like it and
if there's any it's too soft or what you
think about it because well use from now
on yeah I just want to say sorry for
releasing those videos apologize for
just the bad quality of them but I will
be fixing them and they will be coming
out soon and I also just want to say
thank you guys for adding suggestions on
Trello I'm going to be a venom a lot of
really good suggestions on videos I'm
going to be pumping those out as soon as
I finish redoing these videos it'd last
week and I just want to do a quick
