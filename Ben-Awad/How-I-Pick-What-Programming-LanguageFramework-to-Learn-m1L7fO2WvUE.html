text back and what frameworks and
languages I'm using but before I do that
I thought be better to actually take a
step back talk about how I actually
choose well languages and frameworks I
select and what my general philosophy
slash approach I take to doing that
because I have a programmer you pretty
much face a hundred decisions there's
tons of ways to do the same thing so how
do you pick between those or how do I do
that what I'm going to talk about so
with me I kind of like to reverse
engineer the prop like the process so
what I like to do is actually start with
what I want to make I don't kind of I
don't just like pick a language and go
learn it what I'll do is I'll pick
something that I want to learn once I
pick something I want to learn that kind
of narrows down the languages because
what I'll do is I'll look at what the
best languages are I'll just do a Google
search quick research with the top
languages are or frameworks for doing
the thing that I want to do if I want to
build a website if on ability game
whatever I want to build I'll figure out
what the top ones are and basically I'll
just try them out right I'll take a
quick I spend very little time on like
research I find actually trying it out
myself first hand is just the best way
to do it I'll see whether I like it not
super fast and if I don't I move on I'm
not romantic about a particular language
or a particular framework I'm totally
fine switching on meds notice if I think
something else is better so I will pick
something and I've been using react for
a while for building web applications
this is pretty much the first one I
tried and I just liked it so I just kept
using it for up until now I'm still
using it right but like there's other
choices there's view there's angular
extra chose other ones and I considered
other ones I basically just started with
react because I really liked the look of
it and be using it I really liked it too
like there was a no point when I
using it were like you know here and
there maybe I don't like some parts but
for the majority I really enjoy and I
find it really easy to code things and
to make big websites and I really enjoy
the syntax and the building it is
enjoyable so that's a big thing for me
to when I'm choosing these things
there's multiple ways to do the same
application usually 400 again if wonder
website if want to do machine learning
usually there's different ways to
accomplish the same thing they're both
good right so pick the one that I enjoy
coming the best so I really enjoy the
way react looks and the way your logic
looks when you're coding it so I've been
really enjoying it so that's kind of how
I picked that and I kind of stuck with
it but when I hit a point where I don't
like it or I hear something is like it
or could be better than it I totally
down for trying it and switching and if
there I find something that's better
than react I'm ready to switch so I've
been using react up until now I'm going
to continue using it but one thing
that's kind of like peeking mantris is
this thing called reason now I actually
gave it a try and made a video about it
showing you kind of the hello world so I
tried like a hello world version of it I
heard people talking about it I wanted
to try it out so I really enjoy
functional programming and it's a kind
of an o camel like syntax except syntax
a little bit nicer that I think I
actually don't know camel so I don't
know for sure I've never tried it but
they talk about camel in here and so you
can actually build react applications
using reason so I wanted to give it a
try
and I did it actually really liked it it
was pretty interesting and I would
actually continue doing recent and I
want to spend more time on it and I will
I might just do a total switch to reason
right now one of the reasons I'm kind of
using react and not like fully
committing to reason because I'm
building a big website and react right
now and I don't want to switch it all
over to reason because
we'll take a while severa to commune
with react and react is still really
good right the one thing that's cool
about reason is its type safe which is
not a huge deal I mean it's pretty it's
a pretty big deal but it's not terrible
that I'm not it's not hurting me too
badly and I can use typescript if I want
to I'm currently not using it for my
project I probably should because it's
good and gets rid of a lot of bugs but
again trying to convert a whole codebase
over is super annoying
so haven't done that yet but if I wasn't
working on this project I probably would
be spending more time with reason I'm
actually kind of afraid if I spent too
much time with reason that I like it too
much and then I'd want to like switch
over my whole project trees and I don't
want to do that and I'll be like hating
myself having to code react when I like
reason so much more so I don't wanna do
that to myself so I'm just continuing
using the act for now but I might switch
to reason soon I finish up the project
slash maybe I'll just go ahead and try
reason spend some more time with it and
I've only really not a hello world so I
don't actually know for sure I'll like
reason a lot better maybe when I get
into real use cases with it I won't like
it as much the basically as you can see
this came out I'm fine giving it a try
seeing if I like it just like ditching
react for it it's that were the case
where I felt like this better so I don't
have I don't you know I'm staying with
it because I have an application at that
like I'm fine switching if something
better comes out I'm not like I don't
get attached I try not to get attached
to languages or frameworks
I like being flexible and being able to
switch when better opportunities arise
so it's kind of like how I go about
choosing these things in building
applications everyone's just to try to
use the best thing I think that's
available at the time and just keep
doing that for what I want to build so
with that said keep that in mind as I
the next video I talked about what I'm
currently using my full set
like what I will be using for pretty
much any application I want to build
right now because I really like stack
that I'm using so we'll talk about that
next in the next video so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
