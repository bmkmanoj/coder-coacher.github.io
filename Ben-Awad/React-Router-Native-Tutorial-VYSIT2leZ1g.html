like to do navigation and react native
and my favorite library is the react
router library you can use this with
regular react and you can also use it
with react at native now if you can
follow what you can follow along with
your own react native app or I'm gonna
be using the create react native app
boilerplate so if you want to follow
along you can go ahead and install this
and I'll put a link in description below
so I went ahead and already created a
project using that boilerplate and then
I just in a tab I ran yarn run iOS and
then it started up this iOS emulator and
then you should see this a bunch of junk
you might not see all this yellow but it
should start up and in an emulator you
can also do yarn run Android if you want
to do that an Android emulator okay next
thing I just have app dot JSO pijn and
we're just gonna start from here so
first thing we need to install that
library so I'm just going to do a yarn
add reactor outer native and that's the
only package we're gonna need and right
here we can see this is our application
and what the navigation or this library
is trying to do or help with is multiple
screens in your react native application
and transitioning between those pages so
what I'm going to do is just in the root
of this project create new file called
home yes and this is just gonna be
basically my component for the home page
so I'm just going to import react
react and then create like a little
component here that I'd like to be
rendered as one of the pages as the home
page so I'm gonna get this from react
native and I'm gonna do a view text and
a button and I'm gonna export default
I'm gonna use a functional component
here and I'm going to say view and I'm
going to say just render a text and then
say this is the home page and I'm also
gonna have a button and it's just gonna
have the text
I think it's title change page and for
now we're gonna have the on press B just
a dummy function but we're gonna fill in
what this is gonna be later so I could
just render my home component over here
if I wanted to
and I'm just going to import it at the
top from my apt is so import home from
dot slash home and we can see this is
the home page and I can click this
button to change pages so this is well
and good but what happens if I want to
introduce a second page so I'm gonna
call this on page two or you know what
supposed to give it a better name I'm
gonna call this the products and maybe
this will be like a list of products and
I could pretty much copy what I have at
home and render something similar over
here and I'm gonna say this is the
products page or maybe we just have like
a list of products so product one
product two and then when I click on
this button I like to change pages so
now I what I want to do is I want to
conditionally render the home and the
products page and I want to be able to
switch between them so this is we're
going to introduce react native router
so I'm gonna import stuff from that so
react native or react router native
sorry and then there's three things
we're gonna be using native router
switch and route so native router is
what you need to wrap your application
with so I am going to do a native router
in a row now it's very important that
native router only has one child and you
might get an error talking about how it
has multiple child's if you mess this up
and what that means is see how there's
only one tag right here underneath it if
I were to add another tag let's see if
we can show you
err here it says a router may only have
one child so now I have two child's or
children I have one here and one here
so make sure when you're doing this you
only have one so here I just have a view
with these styles for the container and
that's gonna basically these styles are
going to be on every single page because
I did this now if I want to I could
remove the style but I'm going to go
ahead and keep it so next I'm going to
create a switch this makes sure only one
page is rendered so this is an optional
component I like it because it makes
sure again only one is rendered and
that's what I want and I believe this
you can only have one child too but
we're about to find out so I'm gonna add
now around so for each screen that you
want in your application you're gonna
create the route so you need to specify
the path and the component for your
route so the component means what would
you like to render on the screen well
I'd like to render the homescreen and
then the path is the location so this is
basically like a keyword a name and this
actually maps to basically how it would
work in a browser so the home screen or
the first route that is rendered is just
slash so if I say a path is equal to
slash that means this element will be
rendered and I'm gonna just say exact
and I'll talk about what exactly does in
a second
okay so we now have both of these what
if I want another route well I just
added and maybe the path will this will
be like slash products and my component
is going to be products so we have
products imported here I have now two
routes slash products and slash home so
you'll notice that right now the home
page is being rendered if I were to
change these and like add something here
um you'll notice now the products page
is rendering so whatever path has the
slash in it it's going to be rendered
because that's the default one so how
would you for example change pages to
slash products right well notice how we
have made home a component so now what
we can do is if we hop on over here one
of the props that we get is called
history so this is a function that we
can now call so I can say history doc
push and what you want to do is you want
to say slash and then where you want to
go so I would like to go to the products
page and you'll notice that slash
products if we look over here matches
the path here so that's how we know what
route or what screen we're gonna go to
next so here's the homepage I click on
this button you'll notice it called I on
pressed it it called history push and
then we went to the products page now I
can see my products and we can do the
same thing on the products page so here
you can add a history
and now I can say history dot push and
I'd like to go to the home page which is
currently at slash so change page and
notice I can just click this and I can
toggle in between the two pages now okay
so that's how you can basically change
to any route that you want to you call
the history dot push function and they
put a slash there and that is basically
the basics of setting up your screens
and then transitioning between them just
by calling that function and let's talk
about exact I want to see if I can get
this to work so notice how we're on the
products page if I didn't make this
exact what should happen is this will
render any time we have a slash so if I
change page notice how nothing happens
that's because there is currently a
slash in products right that means it's
mapping to it and if I were to get rid
of switch it would see both of them
render I believe so notice how we have
this the home page and the product page
both of these are being rendered and the
reason for that is because it matches
the path of both of them so the current
path is slash products and this maps to
it but if we use the keyword exact now
it makes sure only to render exactly
what page that were on and then if you
add the switch component that makes sure
only one of them is ever rendered and
it's whatever which one matches first so
this one matched first and that's why
and so you actually don't need the
switch if you don't want to just make
sure only one gets rendered so yeah
that's the basics of using react router
native on do another video tomorrow
going into some more advanced usages and
some other cool things you can do with
it but let me know in the comments below
to what some things you've struggled
with with this library and yeah
native and I'll get to those and
hopefully answer them
