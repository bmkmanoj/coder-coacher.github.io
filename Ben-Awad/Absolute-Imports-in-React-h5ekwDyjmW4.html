absolute imports using create react app
now this is the usual way you would
import something so right here I'm in
the routes home folder and I'm in the
index that J's file and if I wanted to
use this header component up here I'd go
up to folders into the components folder
and into the header folder this is
called relative importing because we're
saying relative to this file here we're
going up twice then to this folder than
here now there's another way you can do
this which is called absolute importing
which is like this so import header from
components slash header where it starts
at your root basically right here and
then it goes right here and then grabs
that so it goes to components and then
header and this is called absolute
importing now out of the box create
react app does not work this will not
work if you try to use something like
this for example my es lint doesn't like
it either but if I were to come over
here
we can see it try to compile it you know
crash saying module not found can't find
the header now the reason why this is
helpful is because if this folder
structure gets really deep like if I
have more folders here like maybe if I
have a dog folder and then a cat folder
and my index file is all the way here I
don't want to have to do dot dot slash
like four times so that's when these
comes really in handy and which so what
you need to do to get this to work with
create react app it's actually change
your package of JSON so here you just
type in front of it node underscore path
is equal to source
and then you restart your application
and let it rerun now the reason this
works is because you're telling node to
look at this path right here so starting
from the source when doing these sort of
imports and now it's important also I
did this in the start wherever you want
wherever this code is going to get run
you want to make sure this is here so
you're also want to add that to build
and test I don't think it needs an eject
of definitely for building and testing
when you want to do imports like that so
now you can see it we have to first
restart it so it runs with that command
and we can see it it'll go ahead and
compile and work ok and I'm gonna run
this logic report
so we can see we're getting the
compliation air and hopefully we should
see it compile now that we change that
and cool sure enough it works
so that's how you can enable absolute
imports but there's one last thing I
want to talk about and that is yes lint
for whatever reason this is something I
can't figure out with is lint it
complains about this kind of import
basically it's saying a lint checks to
make sure anything you import is in your
package a JSON file and of course
components is not in the package at JSON
because it's right here it's this folder
so it's doing this check and I'd rather
not get rid of this rule because it's
handy because what if I accidentally
forget to install a package like for
example if I want to use the glow -
package oh but I forgot to import lo - I
forgot to install it - I forgot about
that so it goes ahead and tells me
should be listed in projects
dependencies so I knew I can just go
over to my console over here and I can
do NPM install lo - and we're good to go
right so that's it is a handy rule I
want to keep on for you slunt
but right here we get no experience
dependencies because this is not listed
and I'm not sure how to get the es Lent
to basically know this is a relative
well none relative but this is not
something to look in package a JSON for
so that's something I'm still trying to
figure out let me know if you know how
to get around this air or this way so
Ellen snows hey don't look inside my
node module folder look here look inside
of components instead for this sort of
thing so basically I need to tell Ian to
look in multiple places not sure how I
get that so this is a little bit
annoying I either have to turn off the
es lint rule or don't do absolute
imports and neither of those I'm really
happy with so I need to figure something
out with that but this is how you do
absolutely importing and create react
app that's it for this video guys thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
