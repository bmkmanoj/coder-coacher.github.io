releasing about persist graph QL now
when I started the video I thought this
was a really cool library and I thought
you could use it for white listing
queries and I just kind of made a big
assumption and thought wow I can use
this for everything I can also use it
for mutations I can use this for all my
queries this will be great
because what it's supposed to do is
you're posed to tell your graph QL
server the exact queries you're going to
make on the client side so it knows so
the point of it all is to avoid someone
doing this right just like this nasty
nested query but what I just realized
and made me regret making the whole
video and like making the whole video or
another video but using the library is
you can't use a variable it just hit me
and act right I made the video that like
it uses basically takes each query and
gives it to a number so it can't use
variables because the server doesn't
know what variable it's going to be so
you can't white list based on queries
because at least with this library
because this library does not let you do
queries that have variables or mutations
at variables and almost all my queries
and all my mutations a lot variables
which renders this library useless
question mark I must be missing
something if you guys know how to make
this library useful I would love to know
but I'm thinking it's pretty much
useless because no one is just going to
do persistent queries on static
mutations slash queries with no
variables people rarely have those most
of the time you're going to be passing
variables in so I really don't
understand this library I'm going to go
ahead and release the video tomorrow
though and it'll just show how to set
this library up and do it with queries
if you want to but just know what to
begin the video I talked about how great
it is and
that was before I realized how bad it
was
I'm thinking I'm just missing something
now but it doesn't work for mutations
like here's here's the code right here I
tried to do a mutation here just like
create a user right and it's just like
no and I'm that makes sense you
shouldn't be able to because I can't
pass the variable in but I don't know
let me guys know in the comments below
if you've heard this library if you've
used it before how do you guys get to
work to make it like useful or is it
useless is no one using this thing and
maybe that's the case and is there a way
to whitelist queries flash mutations
with variables I actually don't know of
a way right now so let me know if
there's a way to waitlist the graphical
queries flash mutations that you know if
I'd love to hear I love to implement it
in my graph QL servers so thank you guys
just want to do quick toggle this real
quick because I was really confused by
it so yeah that's it so thanks for
watching guys and I'll see you in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
