mob X with create react app because
there's a lot of content out there about
how to do it with decorators almost
everyone using mob X is using decorators
but with create react app you actually
can't use decorators unless you do some
hacky stuff I know you can for the most
part if you want to stay on the you know
doing the base stuff that comes with
create react app you're not getting
decorators which are the little @ signs
you see above functions so I want to
show you how I created this very simple
application with just a counter I push
it in increments up with mob X and this
is with create react app so I built this
guy using no decorators and it works as
you guys just saw and you can kind of
see how to put this together and how you
can use this with other stuff so right
here this is very simple I have one
store which is called I call the counter
store now here what I do is I'm creating
an object which is going to be basically
the store now this is gonna be keep the
state for like this single object and we
have you'll see I'm using the word
extend observable and I'm passing in
this and the reason for that is you'll
notice I have this increment function
and what it does is increases the count
and so to reference the count that I
have right here I need to use this so
for mob X we're going to be using extend
observable and action extend observable
like I said gives you this action this
is whenever you need to wrap your
function like so here whenever you want
to basically change the state or the
store so you notice how we're changing
the state here we're saying counts plus
equal one so we need to wrap this guy in
an action that way
mop X actually gets update and then we
need to say this dot count that way we
know we're referring to this so this is
what I you could say like redux state
would be equivalent to you can have
multiple of these this is just a single
store and you'll notice I have in my app
dot GS what I'm doing is I have this
counter component and on
just passing in the store so I'm loading
in the store from just the file and then
passing it in there nothing special
going on here and then in the counter
function here I'm getting the observer
from mob ex react and I'm just wrapping
this whole component in this function
now I'm getting the store prop that
we're passing from the app right here so
grabbing that here and I'm just gonna
say store that count
so we're grabbing that from here and I
can also call it increment so I actually
am showing what value of store dot count
is and then when I get an on-click
I call stored I increment and that's it
so very simple when you click this
button it calls the function the
function then it gets called which cup
initiate San action the action
increments and updates the state and
then because we have action here it's
gonna tell all the things that are using
this store to update because we gave
this the observable the store gets the
new values and store account increments
so seeing that again clicking the button
we see it increment and that's it for
this video guys just want to do a short
and sweet one to show you how to get mob
x working I'm gonna put this example up
on github cuz it was a little you know
figuring out you need to use observer an
extent observable can be a little weird
it's a little bit different than if
you're using the decorators so let me
know if you guys wanna see anything I
also have mob ax if you wanna see more
complicated examples because I actually
really like to kind of feel this so this
was the state and this was very fast to
code I mean of course what I'm referring
to is this is a lot less boilerplate
than redux so of course this is fast
because there's this is such a simple
example but compared to redux this is a
lot less boilerplate and I like that so
that's really cool so I could see myself
definitely using this in more projects
in the future just because a lot faster
gets stuff set up
so maybe I'll do a side-by-side
comparison of mob X versus this and
Redux and let me know if there's what
you guys want to see with mob X cuz I
might do more stuff at this if you guys
like it so thanks for watching guys and
I'll see in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
