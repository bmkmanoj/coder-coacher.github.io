the flow works for OAuth how the whole
thing works because there's a lot of
stuff that happens very quickly and
could be hard to visualize all that's
happening and I've been getting a lot of
questions about it and I just want to
clarify how it all works so here's a
diagram representing how it all starts
and how it goes through then after I
explain this I'll show you this how it
works in action so first all starts with
a client wanting to login usually with
OAuth that's usually how it works so
I'll click a button and when they click
the button what they'd like to do is to
log into your website with maybe their
Google account with their Facebook
account with something so they'll click
on that link and what you'll do is
you'll first redirect to your server now
for me I just call this URL F login for
a facebook login and then here after I
you know get the request I know that my
user wants to login with Facebook what
I'll do is I actually can't log them in
with Facebook only Facebook server can't
or Google or github or anyone I want to
do off with so I have to send this users
request and I have to make a request
basically instead of them coming here to
this URL I send them to github or
Facebook or Google server so the client
first comes to ours then we directly
send them over to github servers or
Facebook's whoever we want and then here
the user will put in some credentials or
whatnot but note they're on you know WWF
facebook.com or Google they're not on
our server anymore so we have no idea
what's going on we've basically lost the
state of what's happening and we have no
knowledge of what's going on so whatever
they they do on the you know when
they're talking to Facebook whether they
type in their username password we have
no idea what exactly they're doing but
when they finish what happens is
Facebook says hey either the person
logged in good or they didn't
either way what they're gonna do is
they're gonna send what's called a
callback URL they're gonna call our
server and send some data so they're
gonna give us a call back and say hey
this users trying to log in here here's
their information
so they'll usually send a payload of
JSON with the lot of times and this is
what you really care about is the email
of the user so with that email you can
then create account or log them in you
can get the data on your server and
create tokens and send that to the
client but until Facebook server or
whatever calls our server
we're kind of just sitting there waiting
for the callback to happen but we don't
hang this request right because the
clients actually no longer on our server
so we actually just immediately lose
their request when the user clicks on
this little link there on Facebook's
stuff so we have no control over them
we're just waiting here we don't even
like they could just close the tab and
never come back to our website we're
waiting on them to finish whatever
they're doing with Facebook come back
over here and Facebook will
automatically tell us hey the user is
done here's information and then we'll
go ahead and take this information that
we get here we'll search our database if
we need to for the email it's not there
will create a new user if it is there
what we'll do is we'll take that and
create JWT tokens
now usually for me I'm using two tokens
AJ regular one and then a refresh token
so I'll create both of those and I'll
actually redirect the client back to the
client website so now and when I
redirect them the whole point of this
whole thing was to log the user in so
when everything's all undone I send the
tokens in the URL back to the client and
the client saves those tokens in local
storage so they can do for the requests
so that's the whole thing of how this is
happening I'm gonna show you real quick
this in action and then we can see the
different Network requests that are
going off where you can see each one
where we're hitting our server then
going to Facebook's then coming back and
then finally hitting the client so
here's a react application I have
running if I click on this link
it'll actually take me to login like I
was talking about and start the process
and then we'll end up here at the end
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna inspect
and click the network tab and I'm gonna
preserve the log so we can see all the
different requests that are happening in
the middle and also I have my server up
and running right now so it should work
so we go ahead and click on this and we
notice in a blink of an eye we're
already back here on localhost and you
notice we're on a different page so
let's see all that happened here
so we first started by going to F login
like I talked about and then that's when
we redirect to Facebook server so you'll
notice how we're on we go to
facebook.com and we're telling Facebook
that this is an OAuth request and then
you'll notice we're back to our site
localhost 3000 this is a pretty small
font but it says little clothes 3000 can
we see the headers we can see you we're
going to locos through thousand off
Facebook and this is the callback URL
and this is where Facebook will give us
the information that we need the payload
and then after that we know as we come
back here so I redirect from our server
back here and in the URL right here
these are called query parameters I'm
passing back the token that's 1 and also
the Refresh token that's a second token
and then I'm saving that in local
storage so we can figure out the
application we can see both refresh
token and token are now saved in local
storage so that is usually how baath
works and how the workflow is you'll
send it over to your server which sends
it to your server you want to login with
they'll come back to your server to save
and finalize anything and then redirect
to the client and save any details you
need to so that is it for this video
guys I hope it helps you understand how
it works and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
