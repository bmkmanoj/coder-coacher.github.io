probably just skip to the next video
from the last video and you're wondering
how I fixed it and I want to say first
sorry that I messed this up this was a
little small little air that was
annoying that shouldn't have popped up
but the problem was is in the login page
is one of our components I forgot to
actually add the token to local storage
so it could not authenticate we were not
adding the token the token that I saw in
the last video was from an old thing and
it just stays there forever because it's
local storage so you just need to add
this right here this bit right here and
it's really just these two lines that
changed we're grabbing the data element
and then we're just storing the token
from that in local storage and then I'll
just show you the final product that we
have working now that we added that now
when we click it it works and you can
see stuff pop here we can create new
users and then they'll create fresh
carrying tacos this is global all users
can see it but only the yo user can see
his yo tacos and then also if you want
to I recommend if this is a very small
thing but as you notice I've been typing
login I was just too lazy to make
buttons to actually take me too long and
signup page I recommend trying to add
this on to the project and I hope this
also helps you with your understanding
of graph QL how you would actually
implement graph QL with a front-end with
react and this makes more sense this is
just one way to do it though so we use
the Apollo library to make this work
Facebook has library Facebook Graph ql
client I believe it's called relay I
think I've heard it's pretty good this
is another way to build front ends
I keep saying friends I'm sorry that's
not the correct word to build basically
a client interface to graph QL basically
if you want to make graph QL queries in
your react code this is one way to do it
with relay in this video I showed you
how to do it the palo relay is a cool
thing to check out - if you're
interested in different ways to do this
than just one way to do it and I hope
you liked it I hope this makes more
sense and you'll start using graph QL
and more of your projects so thank you
guys so much for watching if you have
any questions about any of this please
let me know I know graph QL can be a
little bit confusing and harder to get
set up so if you have any questions let
me know and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
