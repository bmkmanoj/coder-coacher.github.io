mentioned how when we create new
products it doesn't show up in our list
so we're gonna be adding that and making
sure that works and then before we start
doing that though you guys had a great
suggestion with flat lists there's a
function called key extractor which
allows you to grab the key given an item
so what we can do what that means for us
is we can say key extractor and we can
grab put a function here that takes an
item and returns the key and for us our
key is the ID so just like that and what
that allows us to do is for our data
just say products and now I can get rid
of mapping so that saves us a whole loop
through our items which is really nice
so let's let the bundler rebuild and now
we're good to go so let's solve that
problem the reason it's happening is
with caching because it does this one
query once so it just ran it right to
load these and then it doesn't load it
again it loads it from cache every other
time so when I go here and I fill it out
and then I go back it's pulling the data
from cache so we need to just update the
cache so how do we do that well when we
call mutate over here we can actually
pass another parameter so this is how
Apollo recommends doing it they have
this thing called update so we're gonna
copy this this is your just a key that
you add to the mutate function and then
this is pretty good commented but
basically what it is is you specify the
query you want to update so for us the
query is products query like this so
it'd probably be a good idea for us to
move our queries in a place where we can
a local place that we can grab them all
but for now I'm just gonna cheat and
export this so that way I can access it
from new products
so what I'm gonna do it just import
product query from products so this is
the query wanna update so I'm grabbing
that and we want products query there we
go so you pass the career you want to
update so we're gonna do that and then
here this is the data that you get back
from the mutations so if we look at what
we get we are only grabbing the ID but
really we want the name the price in the
picture URL that way we correctly update
this object or the cash because we need
all those things and the name of it is
gonna be the name of our mutation which
is create product so trait product and
just show you guys we can console dot
log create product and we can see what
that looks like so after we read the
query from cache because we read it from
cache first so we can update it we then
add something to it so for us we're
gonna be adding not comments but
products so products and then we're
gonna push a product at the end and the
product we're gonna push is create
product because create product is gonna
have name the price the picture URL and
ID which is all the fields we need we're
also gonna need the type name I think we
get that by default we'll see when we
update they'll tell us any errors that
we have updating the cache if we do it
wrong and again you write the query back
to the cache so pass in the products
query alright now we're good to go
so let me switch over here to the
console so you can see if there's any
problems and let's make a p4 picker
picture man I was like slow
choose add products alright so we see
the console out log here it got added
just fine so we're good
actually we did perfectly no changes
that we need to make now this is not
actually how we're going to be doing it
in the final version but I did want to
show you guys how to update the products
like that because that is updating the
cache is important with Apollo so it's
good you know how to do that the other
way you could do it is actually just
pulling from the network every time and
not using the cache which we'll talk
about later when we get into like
filtering and sorting these lists what I
kind of wanted to do next was be able to
edit some of these items at least the
items that are mine
because we should be seeing everyone's
items here and before I can know which
ones I can edit we have to be able to
get the current users ID which we're
currently storing in the JWT token so
one way for me to know is to get is to
use a sink storage which we could import
from react native and we could pull that
make an async call grab the token decode
the token and set that ID and use that
to tell which items are ours but it's
kind of annoying to have to decode the
JWT token every time and it's kind of
annoying to pull having to do an async
call because it's not the simplest right
we can't just add the async call to our
render method here in products we'd have
to make some changes so what I want to
do is actually over here in our check
token is notice how we have the ID or
we're gonna get a token back and we can
optionally get a the user IDs back the
user ID back which is really what I want
so or we could just decode the token
here ourselves if we wanted to but we're
gonna store this using some kind of
state so I'm gonna be using redux
because I like the best but feel free to
choose like mob X or there's many others
that are really good to also Apollo has
one call
Paulo link-state that you could try out
I don't want to introduce too much in
this video series but I will be touching
on that very soon so we're gonna add
Redux to this that way that way we can
have the token but we don't really care
about the token but the user ID globally
so we get asked this a lot how do you
differentiate between you putting stuff
in Apollo and using Redux your mob X and
using them together so here's another
here's a good example where I try to put
everything in Apollo that I can and when
I can't do it I move something to Redux
and usually it's something more I want
to access it from multiple components or
be able to access it from all components
so here I want to be able to see who the
current user is from my components
that's important thing so that's why
we're gonna be adding this to redux so
to do this let's go ahead and install
wrong one here we go yarn tad we're
gonna do redux and we can also do react
redux okay so I'm gonna create a store
yes all we're gonna say is import create
store and this is coming from just redux
and we're gonna create a folder here
that handles it
so in this model if we're gonna create a
folder for a reducers so I mean so we're
gonna have basically our route reducer
and we're going to store it in a folder
called reducers so we're gonna import
that and we're just going to export
defaults create store and we're gonna
pass the reducer so we need to add this
reducers folder and then to add Redux to
our project or be able to use it from
anywhere we have to add a provider
similar to how Paulo providers used so
we're going to say import provider from
react redux and we can wrap this whole
thing and I'm gonna pass this store in
that we create so we created that in dot
slash store okay so now redux is
connected to our react application we
just need to add some reducers so index
j s I'm going to say combine reducers
and this is coming from redux again and
that's what we're gonna do
export combined users and this just
allows us to have multiple reducers
working in conjunction with each other
in case we want to have more than one so
I'm gonna call this user J s and we can
just import user from dot slash user and
we'll just have this thing called user
so our user reducer we can export ponts
add user so this is gonna be our action
we're gonna create a constant and
actually we don't really need to export
the constant itself so I can get rid of
that but here's the action add user and
this is just going to be a function that
takes a really a user right and it's
gonna return the type is add user and
then here what do we want to pass a user
and then we're gonna have a reducer for
this and this is what we're going to
export default and we're gonna have our
state which is going to default to just
an object and then our action and we can
just be structure to get the type
because that's really what we care about
and we can do a switch statement like
they always do for these
and we care about the the type so the
first type is add user and that's when
we just add the user to our state and so
we're gonna take the user and the
payload or in the action here and you
know what we might have other things
let's just keep it action that way we
don't d-structure things that don't
exist so on add user we're gonna get the
action by user and that's really just
what we're gonna return so action by
user and then we're gonna have a
defaults and we're just gonna return the
state looks good
I'll see what doesn't like unexpected
token looks like something oh yeah
export default all this looks good to me
like I'm making a silly mistake here
we're switching on that returning oh we
had case there we go so we need to add
case for each switch that we want to
switch on just JavaScript air right
there but anyway so we got a reducer
here this is good to go
got our action so now we just need to
call our action and I'm just gonna
reload this I think we should not begin
air anymore perfect and so we're gonna
call this from our check token function
and right now I think this guy does not
return a user which is really what I
want because and I think we can modify
the backend to get this to work so let's
look at our schema yeah so it looks like
we're just returning a string so let's
look at our resolvers and see if it'll
be easy to add the user because I think
with get user ID we do fetch the user or
no now it looks like we just look at the
token and the token has a user ID and we
caught that so okay
really the user IDs all we care about
for this so what we can do is
returned two things the token and then
the user ID instead of just returning
the token so then we're gonna have to
change our schema and I'm gonna say type
refresh token payload and for this it's
gonna have a token which is a string and
a user ID which is a string as well so
that's what we're gonna return from this
refresh token payload so now on our
front end and now also just a note if
you guys wanted to make this where you
use you get more than just the user ID
so some of you might need that you can
fetch that and return more than just the
user ID but really for this application
we just need user ID but you could pass
back more and how you would do that is
in your auth here you would fetch the
user based on this user ID and return
like the username or whatever okay so
now we just need to change our check
token over here cuz now it's not just
returning a token it's returning a token
and a user ID okay
so response okay so component did mount
gets that so here's our response
response data is going to be refresh
token and that is now going to have two
fields token and user ID
so here we go so now we're gonna set the
token like so
looks like we have token up there and
I'm just gonna rename this to refresh
token or political call-out new token
it's not really a refresh token has just
been refreshed so that's how you can
rename things let's reload make sure we
don't have any ears
looks like expo just crashed there cool
so now this user ID so I want to do I
want to do call my action right here to
add this user ID so here's how I do that
I'm gonna import my action which is add
user this is coming from producers and
that's up a directory reducers slash
user I'm kind of mixing my actions and
my reducers but I think that's okay
we could really just call this modules
and set of reducers because it's gonna
have both but we'll keep it for now so I
want to call this function but you can't
just call it directly we need to connect
it so I'm going to import connect from
react Redux and help me out I also like
this function called bind action
creators this is coming from just redux
alright so this is a higher-order
function kind of like graph QL so we're
just gonna add it to the end here so I'm
gonna say connect and now connect takes
a few arguments the first one I believe
is a function and that one we don't care
about that's mapping state to props
since this is only matters if you want
to get the user ID from the state which
we don't want to here is where we get
the action so here I'm going to call
bind action creators
and that's where I'm just gonna pass in
and this is a function that takes
dispatch and then binds your functions
with dispatch and this function does it
for us so we don't have to worry about
it and then here we just pass an add
user and I'm gonna name it something
else like add user action and use your
action and the reason I'm naming it this
is so we don't have a naming conflict
but it's still equal to add user cool so
now here I say and I get from the props
add user action and I pass in a object
which has the user ID now the reason why
this is here from the props is because
we connected it right here and okay
length oh that's just getting a little
bit long alright so I think we're good
we're getting no errors here what we'll
do in the next video is actually grab
that user ID make sure we're getting it
from the state and then show you like a
little edit icon if you own the product
but that's it for this video guys thanks
for watching
