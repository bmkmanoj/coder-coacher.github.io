showing you how to do graph QL and
feathers J s authentication so in the
last video we set up how graph killed
can work with feathers in this video
when I actually add authentication on
top of that so if you didn't follow
along and create the basically structure
for using graph QL just make sure to get
clone this repository this has the code
that we'll be working off of and then
make sure to CD into that and do NPM
install to install the packages for it
okay once you have that you're ready to
begin and but before we begin I want to
just kind of talk about how this is
gonna work so there's kind of three
components to it
authentication that is the first is
actually signing up where someone will
pass in a username email or use it will
save email for now email password
they'll send it to the server and then
they'll create a user and then once a
user has been created someone can log in
and then you do an email get a password
and then it goes to the server it
authenticates and if the auth is
successful great it'll send a response
back if not it'll send an error and
after that you kind of want to keep the
user logged in but you don't want to
store their password so what will happen
is a lot of times auth will send back a
token which you can then use to access
basically that users data or only logged
in user data you can get using this
token so what's gonna happen when we use
graph QL is we're gonna sign up passing
in an email password and just create a
user there's not really much that's
going to give it be given back to us and
then when we log in we're just going to
authenticate and then we're gonna give
back a token that those are pretty
simple right but then the next thing we
have to talk about is how to approach
creating like a service so freak this
example that we're using I'm going to be
creating
service that is basically needs
authentication we don't we won't put in
this parentheses but let's say I'm
creating a secret burrito and you can
only create a secret burrito
if you are a logged in user and so house
is gonna work is what you would like to
do is you'd first want to log in right
you were given a token once you have
this token you then are able to create
burritos because you are logged in user
so you're gonna send your token to the
server and you're also gonna tell it you
want to create a burrito and the burrito
is gonna take the token
it realizes you're authenticated and you
can use basically you can create
burritos because you're logged in we see
of a valid token so it's gonna
authenticate make sure the tokens valid
the thoth entik ation is good with the
token then what it's going to do is it's
going to create the secret burrito and
so this is gonna be one of the graph QL
things where we take the token we
authenticate it and then we create the
secret burrito right and basically we
have to attach a user to this burrito
object so we know which user created it
the last thing is as a user how do I see
all the burritos that I've gotten for
this what we're gonna do is we're kind
of gonna do what's called a viewer model
or architecture well what you're gonna
do is you're we're gonna call it a fewer
which what we're gonna do is we're going
to call a token we're gonna pass the
token in to the server so this assumes
already logged in we're bassett token
into the server the server is gonna
authenticate it it's then gonna get the
user attached to it and once it gets the
user attached to it it can get all the
data that this user has so we can then
fetch all the secret get all get all the
secret burritos that that user has
created and this is kind of how we're
gonna set up the graph QL we're gonna
create two new services secret burrito
and you were to handle things the viewer
service is basically just going to take
a token and then return it user and then
once
we have a user object we can then fetch
secret burritos and then we're also
going to set up a service that just
basically that is a service for the
secret burritos this is kind of just a
high-level overview of how it's gonna
work let's actually get into the code of
how this works so go ahead and go to the
source and go into services and then
graph QL and the first thing we're going
to do is we're gonna go into the schema
now we're just gonna start off with
doing the login and the signup so we're
gonna have to create a new type called a
user and all user is is something with
an ID and a email later we'll add on
basically properties that the user can
have like a secret burrito or something
else but for now this is all it has and
we're also have to do another type which
is gonna call authorize and this is what
we're gonna pass back to the user if
they successfully login it's gonna we're
gonna give them a token that they can
then use to create burritos or do other
things once they're logged in and then
we're also going to give them just their
user object back okay now to do these
we're gonna have to create some
mutations so go to the root mutation and
we're going to create two functions
signup and this is going to just take a
username or an email and then a password
and then out spits out a user now for a
login we're gonna take an email string
and a password string and then we're
going to pass back the token with this
which is an authorized type so this is
the schema setup that allows us to sign
up and login let's go ahead and get out
of here and go into the resolver now the
resolvers we're going to do add two more
resolvers
not to me resolvers two mutations that
we just did to it so the first one is
sign up which is very easy we're gonna
pass in route args context and then all
we're gonna do is we're gonna return you
we're just gonna create a user based on
the user and password that they pass in
and to do that we're just gonna have to
get the user service so users
app dot service users okay and then
we're just gonna return users create
passing in arcs and then second thing
we'll actually for this case this is all
it needs we don't need to be
authenticated or anything to create a
user ok then login login is a little bit
more complicated because and we need to
break this down to email and password
it's a little bit more complicated
because to authenticate what we actually
need to do is make a post request to a
slash local and to do that you've seen
in the past if you've watched them my
videos on the client-side what we've
done is use the feathers client to
authenticate and we'll do the same thing
here so you just want to import the
feathers client so import feathers from
feathers client import super agent super
agent from super agent so this is two
packages that we're gonna have to
install that we're going to be using so
I'm just gonna background and open up
another tab make sure you're in the same
folder and do NPM I Shore install and
we're gonna save the feathers client and
super agent and just install that so I'm
gonna hop back to the main code real
quick I'll let that run in the
background and alright so we have this
client we just need to set it up so
const auth is equal to and actually
before we create the actual object we're
gonna have to get the base URL and this
is the base URL first server and we can
actually get this from the app so apt I
get hosts and then : we also need the
port app get port alright that looks
good this is just the this should come
out to localhost P localhost or if we
put this into production whatever our
URL is for the server ok so then our off
we're going to create feathers object
and then we're just gonna configure it
we're gonna do feathers dot rest passing
and the base URL and then we're gonna be
using super agent super agent and then
configure hooks feathers dot hooks and
then dot can fear
so there's dot authentication and then
we don't need to pass anything for
authentication okay now back into our
login down here we're just gonna return
off dot authentication dent ocation and
then here the type is local local just
means you're going to be passing in an
email and password instead of a token so
email password and this allows us to
sign up and login users now so I want to
test and make sure this works to do this
I'm just gonna start the server so i'ma
open another tab do NPM start and I'm
going to just open up go to low close
3030 slash graph iql this brings up a
little interpreter that we can then make
queries with so the first thing I want
to do is do a mutation and create a new
user
so we said sign up and you can make
new user I'm gonna create email I'll say
test at test comm and then the password
it's going to be test as well okay and
just run play and you notice it ran
successfully created a user right
awesome now let's try logging in and we
can get rid of this part because they'll
be different and we're using the same
email same password and off to
authentication looks like I just
misspelled something off and off and a
Kate authenticated not authentication
it's authenticating my fault
and then just restart the server when
that restarts we can run this thing
again and we'll see if the successful
authenticates we know it successfully
authenticates if it gives us a token so
if we just run play we get our token
awesome so that means our login and sign
up is working the next step is to
actually create the two services i
talked about a secret burrito and you
were and to actually create a service
with a indicated user now before we get
into that I just want to show you talk
about the index of the graph QL you
notice that we have a constant provider
and then we pass in a context thing here
right well if you were watching with the
resolvers you'll notice that we have
this context object here we actually
pass it in to this create what this does
is it takes the context here and passes
in here so what you can actually do is
you can pass in a token which is what
we're going to be doing which was going
to be the user's token or that is
associated with them logging in the
thing we just created right here we're
gonna pass that in as a post request
it's gonna be one of the parameters and
then once it's going to do is it's going
to pass it to the function here and we
can use this context
authenticate and to be able to create
secret burritos which you have to be
logged in to do so it's a way to check
that they're logged in and to actually
pass this token in we're gonna be using
postman you can do this through a client
as well I won't show that in this video
we're just gonna use postman for now but
as you can see I have Roo Roo pointing
at the server locos 3030 and we're
looking at graph QL and I like graph iql
and we have a query this is just the
same thing I have here it's just written
in a string and it's flattened out I
mean you also notice I have a token here
and we can actually copy this one paste
it in here for later use and so what's
gonna happen is this token right here is
going to be passed to our graph QL
endpoint here and this is then gonna be
passed to our resolvers that can then be
used to create secret burritos now I
just want to run this to show you that
this works and you'll notice we get
another token
okie-dokie so now let's go into making
these services so I'm just gonna close
this and close this and I'm gonna go
into the root folder you should see the
package.json I'm just a new feathers
generate service so the first thing
we're gonna be creating is that secret
burrito this is gonna use the database
we're just use any DB for easy use and
yes we want authentic it we only want so
I'll often kid users to use this alright
and we're gonna create one more our
viewer service viewer generic
authenticated say no and we'll exit okay
so go into services first thing we're
gonna touch is the burrito service so
we're gonna go into secret burrito
and then index we're gonna kill this
should be sitting on here
oh here this kill this thing we don't
need to have pages that messes things up
and then also in the hooks we just need
to add something to the create hook we
want to associate users to Rios that are
created and so to do that you just do
auth dot associate current user and then
you tell it what property name so I'm
gonna call it owner ID so what this does
is it actually adds a property to every
time I create a secret burrito object it
adds a owner ID property with the
current user that created that burrito
so we can keep track of users that are
creating it okay so this is all done and
then also come back to the main services
folder so CD and the services and then
open up index make sure that graph QL is
the last one so move it down below
secret burrito and viewer okay and then
go into viewer and then index we're
gonna kill all of the service things the
only thing we want it to do is to have
one thing which is find and we would
like to pass in what the current user is
so all we're using this service for is
to get the user so it runs will call
find and it will return us the current
user and also it doesn't make sense for
viewers will just call this viewer so
give her the s at the end okay and then
we just need to actually populate the
hook with a viewer we're sorry not a
view or a user so to do that you just
want to go into hooks and then index and
then we need to create or get the auth
library so require and get feathers
authentication dot hooks
and then when we do the find we just
want to verify that they are a user that
or that their token is valid and that's
a user that we have in the database and
then we want to give it the user data
okay so our viewer is set up now we just
need to mess with our graph QL schema
oops so see a graph QL and open up our
schema so in our schema or be creating
some new types so okay a new type called
secret burrito capital s secret burrito
and we are gonna give this an ID and
also a will say size which is also a
string now we want to show we have
associated users with burritos so all
users well some of them I have 0
burritos but some of them might have
created burritos and we want to know
what users have created what burritos so
we can add a property to the user that
gets their burritos that they have
created so see your burritos secret
burrito so it returns an array of type
secret burrito ok and then in our root
query when it we want to add one called
viewer and all this does oops viewer is
if that users logged in it returned as
the user object and from the user object
they can get the burritos that they have
created which we'll be demonstrating it
in a moment
and then we just need to we race it up
do we set up great no you need to set
that up the create secret burrito so
this is actually when we make it and the
only thing we need to do is pass in a
size so size which is the string and out
pops out a secret burrito okay so our
schema is good
then we just needed to play with our
resolvers and get those set up okay so
the resolvers where you have two new
services that we just made so we're
going to need to create those here so
secret burritos is equal to laptop
service secret burritos second is our
viewer is equal to app dot service
viewer and our viewer the main thing for
the service why we have this is to get
data that needs authentication it's just
basically a roadblock if you're not
authenticated and you try to access
viewer it won't let you but if you're
authenticated it lets you get fewer and
then you can get all your other data
from that object so let's first start
with creep or Udo because that one's
really easy so create secret burrito
root args context now remember how I
told you that the token that we need is
in this context object so we're just
gonna say secret burritos create passing
in the args and in the context so the
context here will have the token that
allows us to create it and you'll notice
because create taco this is something we
did in the last video it does not have
authentication so even if you're not
logged in you can create tacos but if
you aren't logged in you cannot create
secret burritos and we'll see that
because context the token will be
invalid or undefined when we try to
create it and it won't like it so we'll
see that in action so we need to make
sure to pass in the token though so it
can verify that we are logged in okay so
that's super easy the next thing is just
the viewer so we're just going to create
a new query called viewer where and
we're going to take route arcs context
and all we're going to do is we're gonna
call our viewer dot find and remember
what this function does all
we need a passing context it takes this
token right here that we pass in the
context and it gets the user object now
once we get the user object we also want
to get the tacos that they have and so
to do that we need to come up here to
the outer layer of the object and create
a user property so this is going to be
called if the user is trying if
someone's trying to query the secret
burritos of a user they'll have the the
user will be passed in so we'll have the
ID and we'll be using that because what
we're gonna do is we're going to turn
secret burritos burritos stop find and
make sure it's not Capitol and we're
gonna query the owner ID and we want to
equal to the user dot ID so what that
will do is it will then fetch the user
once it gets the user it then uses that
ID to then fetch the burritos okay so
this is all set up I'm just going to
cancel out of that ctrl C and then NPM
start to start the server back up and
let's give this thing a shot so the
first thing I want to try is just as an
unauthenticated user I'm just gonna
refresh let's see what happened
I'm just so I can see the air I'm gonna
go back up I just run Babel node on
source so there's an air up it looks
like I just have a syntax error this
should be a semicolon at the end of your
burrito all right now let's restart oops
so NPM start or you can do it manually
all right servers started up oops
we'll come over here and alright cool so
the first thing we're just gonna try to
do viewer now note we are not logged in
this should give us some kind of
and you'll notice it says authentication
token missing that's perfect because
we're not logged in till what be logged
in we need to either log in and get the
token and then pass that in so remember
how I told you we got this token we
logged in so we can run it again
we'll make a post we'll get the token so
we have this token here we'll copy that
we'll paste it in here we now have the
token so this allows us to get a viewer
so we're not doing a mutation anymore
we're gonna say viewer and what viewer
returns is a user so a user has an ID
and email and secret burritos so we can
copy what we won't copy we'll just
rewrite it and get the ID and the email
of our user you're on that you'll notice
test that test com so it was using this
token it was able to give us the ID or
the email of the user that we have now
has this user let's actually create some
burritos so since we asked to be
authenticated we have to pass that token
in we can only do it from postman so
mutation what we want to do and actually
I'll just write the whole thing over
here so mutation I'm gonna say I believe
it was create secret burrito burrito and
then I just need to pass in the size
that I want and I'm gonna have to escape
the quotation marks and let's say I want
a large burrito and then from the
burrito I'd like to get the size and the
ID so send and you'll notice it give me
back the burrito it created let's say I
want to make a medium one as well and
then create a small one so you'll notice
as the
test a test comm user I just made three
burritos under my user and now we can
then grab that so I can say viewer and
then I can get my this will return me
the user object which is test a test
calm and then from there I can get my
burritos by calling secret burrito and
then I have to say what I want to get
from the secret burrito which is an ID
and a email they're not an email a size
and then close that off and hit Send
oops
secret burritos and you'll notice what
it returns back is all the burritos that
we made so it has the medium large and
small now notice if we get it's a kill
this you we send Oh invalid token so
this token is what's verifying that we
actually are the you see that we are now
I thought this was really cool something
that I really like is you can kind of
nest these things so for example I can
now login as my user so King the email
and that I was test test calm and then
my past where it was test what this will
return is a user object so just run that
and I user object a token and then also
gives back the user and if you remember
that so if we go back to the schema real
quick open up that for you guys it
doesn't just return the token it also
returns the user we just have to ask for
the data field so if I ask for data it
then returns me the user well from there
I can then get say the ID I can get the
email and I can also get the secret
breo's that this guy has so I can then
say get the ID of that and I can get
this sighs so
just running this query what I can do is
I can login to this user and get all the
breo's associated with his account all
months so look at all this data that we
just grabbed we have the token now for
this logged in user which we can then
use for further requests and we also got
all the burritos that this guy created
so that's kind of how authentication
works with graph QL this is just one way
to do it but basically allows you to log
in grab the data you want all in one
from the user and basically you store
all the data that a user has under the
user object and that's important to do
it allows you to do this right here just
pretty nifty and just keep it
authenticated you have to log in first
to be able to access this or pass the
token in as you saw now there's other
ways to pass in the token you can pass
in for example I could make a field I
could call this login and pass in a
token and then the user would pass in
you know whatever right that's another
way to authenticate we just saw did
authentication in one way where we pass
in the token as a parameter to our post
request and if you're using a client for
example making a react front end there's
clients still allow you to do this quite
easily and if you're interested in
seeing that or with another framework
please let me know in the comments below
I'm gonna be creating some more videos
with graph QL soon I'm really enjoying
using this and I really like how
powerful it is this was one API call and
we've got all this data all at once
we not only verified this again but we
were able to get all the data for that
user which is really powerful in one
request so I definitely want to be
playing with this more and showing you
guys how to use this in actual web
applications so right now this is just
setting up the backend
in future videos I'll be showing you how
to set this up in the front-end so you
can access this programmatically with
your client of choice so thank you guys
