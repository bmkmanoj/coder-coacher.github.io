that I want to deploy soon I'm trying to
think of where I want to deploy it to
right now I have it running on AWS but
I'm considering some other different
options cloud providers and some
different places to host it I'm trying
to decide what the best thing is and Ike
I just want to walk you guys through my
thought process and how I'm trying to
decide it because I'm actually having a
difficult time trying to decide where I
want to put it but before I discuss that
I wanted to talk about what the
requirements that I need for my
application so here are the requirements
that I need there's four things first is
a place to store my database I do want
to do like a hosted database I don't
have to actually you know install the
database instance myself and monitor the
uptime and all that stuff like I want it
to be and managed for me
so either AWS or IBM Rackspace there's
lots of different places where you can
host have your database be hosted for
you so I want that and I'm gonna be
using a Postgres sequel database so they
need this to be able to support that the
second my application has images now I
want to be able to store this in some
kind of kind of like a block storage or
s3 somewhere where I can store images I
don't want to pay for something
expensive like cloud and airy but some
cheap storage option and to store the
images and then I also have a node.js
server which I'd like to run and have
that
basically run the server host the server
and then also runs host static files for
the react application in the front-end
so host the front in the backend for
static files for the front-end and then
no GIS application so these are the four
things that I want so with that said
here are a few things that I'm
considering so the first is vulture also
digitalocean Azure AWS and then finally
Google because Google just has their
cloud platform now where you can host
things so basically I am making sure
each one has what I want and then
finally figuring out which one is the
cheapest and basically picking that way
another thing that I really want is not
to spend a lot of time on DevOps and
spend a lot of time having to configure
things and set things up I'd like it to
for the most part just work so that is
first off the one thing that I am less
interested in about digitalocean
or for example vulture or any other VPS
where basically they just give you a
just a machine and you set everything up
and this is one thing I didn't
understand maybe you guys know vulture
looks strictly better than digitalocean
just from a price comparison if we look
at the cost of what their machines are
vulture just has a purely better prices
so I don't know if digitalocean is
offering anything else but I kind of
just immediately crossed out
digitalocean as an option just because
voltar has it for cheaper so for example
let's look at this $10 option we get one
CPU two ear bytes of memory and 40
gigabytes SSD compare that to the ten
dollar option here here we only get one
gigabyte of memory one CPU and 30 gigs
SSD so the SSD and the CPU actually same
CPU but double memory and then ten more
gigabytes of SSD and then each one volt
sure is better
right so we have double memory here and
then 10 gigabytes more and then each
option seemed to be better'n so I didn't
understand why I would choose
digitalocean
over vulture maybe they're offering
something's different but I wasn't just
I just from the first look at it I kind
of just like hey not gonna do
digitalocean
I'm gonna pick vulture over at any time
and then I pretty much was like vulture
is very different than Azure AWS and
Google clouds
so I basically let vulture set aside and
I wanted to compare these three cloud
providers and try to figure out which
one of those I would pick and then
compare that against vulture so when I
was looking at this the first thing I
looked at is just the price of basically
what I would host my node.js server on
which is basically a virtual machine and
then I'm looking at here is the pricing
page fresher so here's the
general-purpose one but really I want to
basically run a web server so I want to
use the compete optimize this is because
it says it's good for medium traffic web
servers so I want that over this and we
can just compare the prices so here two
gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
storage and one core is five cents an
hour and we can just compare this
against vulture vulture eats this up so
we have five cents here we have Oh point
zero zero seven cents and we're getting
more SSD same CPU and we can upgrade to
this more right if we want to match the
memory because the memory is two
gigabytes but look at their one cent one
and a half cent it just destroys a sure
blows it out of the water
but even if we compared the cloud
providers as yours not very good so
here's the s3 will talk about the s3 in
a second
but for example here one CPU and two
gigabytes is 2 cents per hour compared
to the five cents fraser so right off
the gate they're losing right so I would
pick AWS for my virtual machine over
sure and then let's look at the block
storage block storage they actually do
better in so this is storing my images
so EC EC 2 this is or not EC 2 s 3 there
is 0.02 so 2 cents right as you're over
here is 0.01 so maybe there's some
hidden costs that I'm not aware of
because with all of these cells the
other thing that was having a lot
difficulty with there's a lot of
different costs it's hard to add up and
directly compare them but just using
this basically the space price as your
seems to beat it so let's get rid of
Azure for that but the ec2 is cheaper
for this guy for AWS but s3 is more
expensive than as yours block storage
but one thing I don't know
this is blob storage there's also I'm
sure there's maybe static I'm not sure
if I can host static files like a
website for s3 I can like I can host my
s3 I can sort my react application on
that and serve stuff so not sure if
that's the same with this but either way
I can store my images here so that's
nice and so I haven't mentioned Google
so let's talk about Google real quick
this is something that I was pretty
confused about so maybe you guys know
more about this than I do but I was
looking at one option is the at what's
called the app engine so it cost five
cents an hour and that's for the b1
class let's let's look at what their b1
gives us that gives us
1:28 memory limit and the CPU limit is
600 MHz didn't really know how to
compare the CPU here compared to how
many CPUs like an ec2 instant gives us
but that's really expensive
five cents compared to 0.005 cents so
this is ten times less expensive
comparing the same memory right because
it's half a thing of memory oh it's even
less memory it's even worse if we
compare this what is this B 4 B 4 is 20
cents that way we get the same gigs of
memory as this ec2 instance right here
so I don't know maybe this ec2 is a lot
less powerful but it looks like the
memory is the same I don't know how to
compare the CPU but that surprised me
App Engine was really expensive so I was
like all right that's definitely not an
option so then I also looked at one
closest what's called a compute Google's
compute engine so I was checking that
out this looks like more like for
example I sure had the compute optimized
this looks similar to that and this
price was a lot more comparable still it
was more so for example one CPU 3.7 is
almost 5 cents so let's take a look one
CPU 4 and we can't even we can't even
find one that's the same right but we
can't find a two CPU so we're getting
double the CPU same memory and it's less
so that was one thing but then I was
like all right let's go up 17.5 we can
compare that against 8 this is 9 cents
this is just a little bit tad bit more
but we get a tad bit less memory - so I
was thinking wow
AWS looks strictly better here as well
right but here's a quick little catch
that I just did not even consider
they give you basically I plug this into
just their calculator they give you this
called sustained use discount so what
this means is I think does it say when I
hover if you use their thing for 30 okay
here it is 25 percent of the month the
views it from one 25 percent of the
month the EEC air basically the virtual
machine you get a 30 percent off so that
what that turned off to be is I just
plugged in one month of the N one
standard so if we plug in n one standard
and I guess N two standards more
comparable but I just did the N one
standard which gives you one CPU in a
ram with 3.7 and that cost $24 a month
because this 30% off brought it down
much lower
whereas ec2 this guy's costing $34 so if
I look at this this is the two CPU for
memory so we are getting more CPU and
more memory here but if I nosh it down
to the large it's almost the exact same
we can see how much that would cost so
here I'd be paying $70 a month in here
if I bring that there we can just we
have one instance we can add this over
and see what our estimate would be so
$72 and we can close this so now just
looking at this because of this 30% off
we're getting insane discount
there's only $48 where this is 68 so
we're paying $20 more a month with AWS
if we were to just compare these so that
was something that kind of like swung
and changed how I looked at this so I
almost was thinking man compute engine
looks bad
than this ec2 instances for price so I
was like all right maybe AWS is not
something I want to do at all maybe
Google is the best way to go so I was
like all right forget about those let's
use compute engine and Google has its
own storage but it is more expensive
than as yours as yours is 0.08 and this
guy is 0.026 so there is something to be
said about keeping everything at the
same place but what i could do is i
could run google for the compute pusher
for the storage to store my images but
the vulture over here is still the
cheapest it still beats google for
pricing like we can see how much it is
hourly here's hourly rates let's find a
comparable machine so 2 is 8 gigabytes
of memory - with 8 gigs
oh we get 4 and that's 6 cents so this
is 9 cents 4 is 16 we just get more CPU
power with this as you can see you're
getting way more stuff with this so we
even compare the old to compare these
two so pre-emptive price is something
else it'll die prices pre-emptive is
when if you have just have a short-lived
virtual machine whereas this is the
price it would be the last for a while
so that's why I'm looking at this price
but this is 19 cents for 4 CPUs 15
gigabytes of memory we can see we get 6
CPU and 16 gigabytes for 11 cents so
we're paying less and getting more CPUs
so that's really good so the one thing
that's keeping me away from there's two
things really that I dislike about
vulture the first is I actually have to
do all the setup of setting up engine
acts
and my noches application and if it
fails I have to do more things so that's
one thing I dislike but the thing that's
even more I don't like is I'm getting a
lot of 200 gigabytes of SSD so what I
could do is I could actually store
images on this basically this instance
and the one thing I don't like about
that though is what happens if I want to
replicate my instance then I have to
either like copy my pictures across to
and I don't really like that so that's
the one thing why I like storing my
images in a separate in my actual
container for my node.js application so
my node.js application would live here
but I have all this extra wasted storage
here so I would have to use s3 to to get
this set up so I'm trying to decide or
s3 or as your black block storage
whatever I decide on I'm trying to
decide on between vulture and that
whether it's worth it because I could
just store my images and the 200
gigabytes they give me which is probably
what I'll end up doing especially at
first because 200 gigabytes is a lot
it'll store a lot of images and we just
won't have you know this prot like the
user base won't grow fast enough and
like I'll be able to handle a lot of
users with vulture that's what I'm
thinking before I need to migrate to
something else but if I store all my
images on for example vulture there's
two things like I was saying with
replicating if I have my node.js
application and I'd like to have two
machines run it I would then have to
have like a central location the images
are store or store the images in both
places and that's not great because if
we're on two machines we need to somehow
you know sync it up the second thing is
it could slow down the server because
now I'm serving the images from the
server instead of having s3 handle the
images I now have to handle
images my no js' server so that could
take CPU and memory away I'm not sure
how much of a dent it'll do
but that's something I need to test out
so I'm basically kind of weighing my
options if I did not have to serve
images I would pretty much go for
vulture right off the bat and by the way
none of this is talking about where I'm
storing my database that I still have no
idea I haven't looked too much into
where I'm storing my database yet
I need to decide on that and a little
bit but I could store that in number
different places this is mainly just
talking about where to store my note GSR
and then also my images which is the big
deal so I'm leaning towards vulture but
I'm also not at the same time but I
don't know where else I'd want to go
because it's pretty expensive to choose
the other providers to Google cloud
compute is not as much that seemed to be
the cheapest for getting the compute
because I can get a discount on it but
the images thing storing that a
different I really I really don't want
to have serving the images from my
node.js application I just feel like the
how slow it down a ton having in like s3
or something else is really nice block
storage as in xur and actually they have
block storage here at vulture as well
that I could do it just costs a lot it's
10 10 cents a gigabyte whereas this is
one cent almost 2 cents a gigabyte so
much better deal so that's what I'm kind
of considering there's a lot of
different choices a lot of different
things to consider now I honestly could
be thinking about this a totally wrong
way I'm kind of just gonna try something
whatever is pretty much easiest on me
see how much it costs and then see if I
would move to other places if it would
be cheaper because it's a lot of hassle
trying to evaluate all these different
cloud platforms and pick and handle all
these things I'm not exactly sure where
I'm gonna go but that's my thoughts
right now thanks for watching guys
that's it for this video
