differences when doing typescript and
react so to start off I like to use this
boilerplate called create react app
typescript it's very similar to create
react app but it is using typescript so
I'll link this in description below so
I'm gonna be using this as the starter
for today and here's what the code looks
like I haven't touched anything but by
default they give you a nice TS config
with some good defaults and then we can
go in here and change any of these if we
want to and then also they have ATS
Flint which is nice as well which just
Lintz your typescript code so you have
both of those by default you don't even
have to worry about them so let's just
dig into some of the things that are
different so first off how you actually
import react so look at the top up here
I have import star as react from react
and the reason you have to do that is
because react does not export anything
by a default so now you'll import all
react like that and also when you're
installing other third-party libraries
you might have to do the same thing as
well it really it'll tell you when
you're doing it what you need to do
it'll have like little red lines like I
forget where that it's gonna be like hey
this has no default export this is what
the error looks like and that's how you
know you need to switch it over to this
alright the next thing is how do you add
basically types to your react components
so to demo this I'm going to create a
new thing I'm gonna call it form dot TX
TSX and you'll notice your file names
are different that's another thing so
instead of JSX its TSX and I'm just
gonna copy these to make this faster and
don't eat those so this is going to be a
form
opponent and will impede this out all
right so first off this guy might have
props so what I like to do is create an
interface called props and then here
specify all the things that you can pass
to this component so maybe this
component has some text which is a
string and then maybe it also has a age
I don't know is just random value which
is a number and maybe that is optional
so the way you tell your component is
you do angle brackets at the end here
and then you pass in props like that and
now and I'm not sure what it's mad at oh
this is it likes to start with I at the
beginning of the interface this is a TS
lint thing so we can do it like that if
you wanted to I usually turn that rule
off though okay so we have the props
here so right off the bat we'll get some
nice auto completion if we try like
destructuring our props so if I want to
get like text I can now render a div
with text
so now we know we're gonna get this prop
the other thing is state so I might have
for example a name which will set as the
people value just an empty string and
we'll also have an email which is a
string as well so you'll you'll notice
it's already not liking stuff
oh it's sorting it doesn't like this
because looks like we haven't labeled it
public private or protected
I don't really usually mess with this
stuff we can label up private I guess
because we don't want anyone else to use
our state usually that rule I'll turn
off and TS lint as well and then let me
show you guys what I'm talking about
so what I'll usually do is when I don't
like some of these rules they're just
kind of annoying and they don't really
help me I'll copy them so remember
access this thing in parentheses come
over here to TS lint and rules you paste
it and then you put a zero for you don't
want to follow it and then it'll no
longer bug you over here about it
anymore and I think I just gonna do
false there we go so now we no longer
are bugged about that and that's you can
just turn them off like that okay so the
state we also need to have a type for so
again I like create an interface called
a state so here we have an email which
is a string and a name which is the
string and then that is the second thing
you add to the angle brackets so comma I
state and if you don't have props what
you can do is you can just put an empty
object and then the state and then if
you do not have a state you can just
leave it like this and not worry about
it and we can also set our state here
like that so there we got eye state and
we specifically saying what it is and
then we can again we have now some nice
auto completion for our state
and it'll tell me the to property is so
named and maybe I'm showing the name and
the nice thing about specifying the
props on your component is now if I'm
over here I try importing that so get
rid of this junk if I were to do our
form and doesn't look like it it I
wanted to just auto import this guy for
me maybe it's because I didn't call it
for him no I did that's sad
we'll just import it ourselves and we
don't need those two okay
so immediately we get red lines because
we've specified that we need to have at
least the prop text so that's how we
know and we can say hello and then the
red lines go away and if we try added
adding any other type of property like
maybe a is gonna be five it's not gonna
like it but I can't add for example H
which is optional so that's the nice
thing about specifying the props on your
component the other thing here's just a
common scenario is you'll have like an
input element and let's say that's my
name and the value is going to be a name
and on change just equal to this dot
handle change
so this is if you want to do a form and
react so here we're getting the this guy
right here so this is an event so we
have to specify what the heck is the
type for this event right well it's
going to be react top form of it and
then you have to specify the element so
this is gonna be an HTML input so this
is a little bit weird but this kind of
stuff you can just google whenever it
comes up I'd use this one a lot so I
haven't memorized but you expect this
function here to give you and I guess it
just pops up now cuz we added it here
but it's gonna give us a form event and
this is coming from an input element and
the reason why I put input element here
is because this is called an input if
this was like for example text area I
would put HTML text area element and
then from that I can say Const PETA
target and then what I usually like to
do which is get the name and value and
then update the state with those and
with this one it doesn't pick up on the
types for whatever reason and that's
what it's complaining about here so what
I usually do is I just say Annie so I
don't have to worry about typing those
if I wanted to I could say name is a
string and value is a string either way
works
oh I guess name so okay here's a little
old cute thing so now that we have set
the interface of the state here it knows
that we can only have the keys email a
name so we can't just have a generic
name value here
and what I mean by that is it protects
us so for example
right and what is it not like here oh
it's just not assignable we've already
but we won't worry about that part for
now so see how it's I have set stay here
we have named as one of the keys and
that's good but if I were to say name -
it knows that name - is not in my
interface or in my state so I cannot
actually add it so it protects you there
and checks the type of that but anyway
yeah that's why I just like to use any
because that really easily just like
fixes all the types cuz I know I know
what I'm using is correct
the other way you can get around that is
like you can get like the key of this
interface this is a trick I use
sometimes so it's name and we're gonna
say it's a key of I state so in value is
the string okay it didn't like it but
the old trick where key of is now a one
of these things it's either email or
name but doesn't like it I'm just gonna
keep it back to any but that's a little
trick you can use in other cases where
you're working with objects anyway so
that's how you do handle change if
you're doing forms in typescript the
other thing I wanted to talk about was
importing libraries so a lot of times
you'll be importing libraries that are
not typescript libraries for example I
might want to add blow - so let's say I
just the yarn add a low - here oh and I
messed up my node installation so I need
to just add this real quick
and we're on this again
so when that is done we can now import
something from lo - right
lo - and maybe I want to use the omit
guy the MIT function you in first off it
doesn't like that I have it ordered in
the wrong way again this is another rule
I like to just turn off let's come over
here and say false alright so I'm just
going to say omit from the props the
name not name age so those are just me
using omit just to be silly but the
point I want show you is look at this
little error we get could not find
declaration file so we don't have any
types for this lo - right now and
because it's written in JavaScript so we
don't know what the types of any of that
is so one way you can do is just say all
of them are anything and the way you do
that is by declaring the module so here
is images DTS so this is in this folder
you can see they're ready declaring a
module so for some of these things we
could declare module lo - and now it
doesn't have any problems so now this is
gonna be typescript think slow - can be
the type of anything you can also
specify specifically what the types of
all the lodash things are and by the way
you can create other like I can create
my types all that matters is you have
the dot e dot t-- s at the end of it and
so I could move that over here as well
and you can declare your type in there
the other thing is what's nice is this
it's not very nice to have no types for
your libraries and other people need the
types as well so there's something
called definitely typed that adds types
for all these things so you don't have
to go and do this so we can just delete
that
so the way you do it is you say yarn add
and it's actually another package so at
types / low - so this is a at the
beginning at types / and then the name
of the library now they don't always
have all the libraries but they have a
lot of them in this case they have low -
so now we have the types for low - and
it'll actually and we can hover over and
we can see actually what the type of
this omit function is so that's super
nice and I think that's about it when
working with react and typescript now
you'll probably run into some things
where you're using like higher-order
components and it can be really hard to
type them with that stuff I recommend
just Google and go to stack overflow for
that stuff it can get really complicated
or just using the any type with that
sort of thing and then yeah that's
pretty much it with libraries you might
have to be importing like this like with
react and then also remember to install
your types so here's my package so JSON
here are the types and you can see they
already install some types for you like
react and what these are is just type
declarations for typescript that someone
or you just went through and added all
the types for like low - but yep that's
it for this video guys thanks for
watching
