going to be getting another tutorial
today because some people have been
having trouble with the original
tutorial and they want some help with
deleting these items because in my other
video was a little confused so I'm just
going to go back over this and reiterate
how to delete an item with this so right
now this is what my to-do list is
looking like this is the old code I
worked on the last one um this one looks
like click online it works okay for yeah
dude note looking good the database is
good but what I need to add to it is a
delete an item and I assume people are
talking about Leanne item on whole note
like right here if I can just leave that
so that's i'm going to show you to do
right now so let's get right into that
so this is the code i'm using the same
code in my other video part 3.5 and
right here i have the main activity now
what we're going to do is we're going to
set a on on item click listener for this
list view so what someone holds down
this and force touches or you know holds
down for a longer period time just a
single click it will actually just
delete the item from the list so I'm
going to show you how you can do that in
not only from the list also from the
database so what we're going to do is we
have this is our note list view right
here all we're going to do is we're
going to create a notes list view and
we're just going to say set on long
click listen on and this is a on item
lon click listener and we're just going
to create a new object and then we're
just going to copy the code from the
oops the vogue Ella tutorial right here
where he deletes the item which is right
here
so basically what he's doing and Oh make
sure you want you return false still so
basically what this is doing is it's
saying which item should we delete right
here and then it's actually deleting it
right here and then it's refreshing the
view so it changes so we need to change
a few things to get this work it takes
two seconds to fix it though right here
instead of my to do content provider we
just want to put what our content
provider so mine is called we just come
over to the project structure and I come
under i call it note content provider
felt oops just come over here note
content provider and that fixes that
hair and then for the ID we just want to
get the ID right here this long and now
it should work now let's go ahead and
give this a shot run it and it should
delete ok and we can head on over there
and see if what that's looking like and
I just want to make sure if i click on
these items okay so it does break I'm
also going to show you guys um how to
fix that so when you click on this item
that it does not break i'll show you how
to fix this so yeah let that finish
building um
okay now so if we click in this and hold
down it just goes away so just add a new
item item to delete and we go back see
our item we can just hold down our mouse
and it deletes it or your finger on the
item but look if we just single click it
still brings us into the activity and
doesn't leave it so that's looking nice
okay so now let's solve the problem of
when we click this item it should be
crossed out but we're getting in air so
the problem with this is if we go to our
node activity and we scroll up this is
the onclicklistener right here set up
this is in the oncreate method and the
set onclicklistener there's an a bug in
it when so this is when someone clicks
on this item this is a list view it's
all because it's on this item it's
breaking and the reason is this line
right here notice how I it says view
defined by d ID dot item text well we're
getting this their give they're passing
us the text view right here of the list
view item so we don't need to find it at
all this view is a text view so we just
get rid of this finding if we just
change that this view is actually a text
you we this method is returning a text
view as its view right here so if we
just save you cast into a text view then
this should work so let's go ahead and
run that and see that that's working and
that was actually a bug in the last
video I should have changed that I just
thought of it so it should be working
now because what was happening is it was
not able to find this text view to
change now it should be able to do that
and it should be able to cross
alrighty so click on our item and voila
it is crossed out halfway well in later
video I later in the series I'll be
showing you how to when you click on
again it will uncross out um so for now
it it's gonna stay cross but uh that's
how you fix this bug if you are
experiencing that that was the wrong the
reason the code right there also I'll
get into later how to save notice how
when I / out these items and then when I
come back to it it does not save it I'll
come back to that and show you how to do
it do that and later in the series I
show you so I hope this helps I hope you
can it's more clear how to delete the
item from the list view right here um if
you guys need help leading items right
here that's another thing and that's
pretty simple if that's what you were
talking about I can make another video
showing you how to delete these items
right here if it wasn't clear the first
one but that's how you delete items a
whole notes from the database so I hope
that was helpful and yeah thanks for
