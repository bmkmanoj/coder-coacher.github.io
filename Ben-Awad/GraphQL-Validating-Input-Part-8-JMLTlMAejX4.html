throw errors or return errors back to
the user or the client
now the next step with this is the
detect more errors so the other thing
that could go wrong is if they give us a
bad email or bad password so we want to
validate both of those fields and the
thing that I like to use to validate
this is something called yep and what it
does is you create basically the little
schema of what you expect the type to be
and then if it gets messed up if there
was an error and we're just gonna return
that air to the user so we're gonna
install this and then I'll show you how
it works so let's go ahead and just do
yarn add we also need to add the types
for it so we could add them first if we
wanted to so we're gonna add them as a
dev dependency and then at types yep and
then after this we're gonna install yup
itself so yarn at yep all right so we
have the library added I'm gonna go
ahead and import it here so import and
uh yep yep okay so we're gonna create a
schema right here and what you do is you
first say what type of scheme we're
gonna making so for us it's gonna be an
object and I'm gonna say dot shape and
here we're going to specify the shape of
the object that we expect and so what I
mean by that is we have an arguments
email and password so this is an object
so we expect to have two fields an email
and a password so email and the email is
gonna be of type yep string and I wanted
to have a min length of let's say three
characters and a max length of 255 and
this 255 max is also matching what we
set in the database for our entity okay
I can also specify one to be an email so
you can see I have very quickly just set
up basically a schema for this email
these are all the properties expect so I
expect it to be a string I expect it to
be at least the link three and a max
2:55 and an email now I can also do the
same thing for the password yep
string it's gonna have a min length of
say 3 as well and a max length of 255 on
this 255 is more for make sure we're not
hashing something forever we don't
really care that if you have a really
really long password or fine but 255 so
we're gonna cut it off it's good to have
like hard caps on everything ok so we
have like this game a thing in here now
next we're gonna do is basically
validate this argument against this
schema to make sure it fits and now
we're using strings and stuff this also
works for integers and boolean sand
other types and we'll see that as we do
more validation in this series so first
thing I'm going to do is change this to
arcs so call us args and then down here
I'm gonna just email password is equal
arcs and so the reason why I am moving
it down here is before I basically D
structure the arguments I'm gonna
validate the schema and the way you
validate it is by calling validate on it
and you'll notice how I'm sitting up a
try-catch block and the reason for that
is validate will throw an error if it
goes wrong so we're now wait we're gonna
say schema so that's what we called it
right here and I'm gonna say doc
validate and I'm gonna pass in my value
with this arguments so args were
validating against this schema and I'm
just gonna console.log the air and show
you guys what this thing looks like and
I like to use an option called abort
early let's set that equal to false so
if I set that to true the first time I
encounter an air it's gonna stop but
really I'd like to show all the airs so
for example if there's something wrong
with the email and something wrong with
the password I'd like to see that and I
want to see that air ok so let's go over
to the
test and now mess this up so not ID user
but I registered test so I'm gonna make
this a really short password so it's two
characters long and let's go ahead and
just run the yarn test and we should be
able to really see that console log
statement to see what this error looks
like and then from there we're going to
format that error in the format we want
and then return it so here we can see
here's the object that it gave us and we
can see we did get a validation error
which is exactly what we expect and then
we have the inner object here and our
object is really what we're gonna be
grabbing and we're gonna turn this thing
into what we want to return so this is
basically the same shape we're gonna
grab the path and grab the message and
that's what we're gonna return so here
the path was password was bad and the
message was password must be at least
three characters long let's also try
this on the email and you can kind of
see what this would look like so this is
a bad email and where we can run that
again and if we come back over here and
our resolvers so what we're gonna do is
take this err format it and that's going
to return back to the user and the other
thing is you might not like the message
here so all right so here we see the
message email must be at least three
characters you know must be a valid
email so it's breaking a couple rules
right so what we're going to do is pass
this back basically this object but
let's say we don't want email must be
three characters or whatever right you
can pass as a second parameter like bag
length you know you can say whatever you
want to and it's gonna go ahead and take
that message so you can go through and
customize the errors or the messages
very easily as well so we see it says
bad lengthen out instead of what it was
before I'm happy with what the default
messages say though so I'm going to keep
this okay so I'm gonna add a utils
function so I'm going to say format yup
err dot ts just export Const format yep
err and what I want to do is just
returned from the resolver after this so
I'm gonna say return format yup err
passing in our air ok so then over here
we're gonna take an air and this is a
validation error and this is coming from
yep
and what we want to return is an array
of errors and this is going to take be a
certain type so the type of these errors
and we can just look at our scheme over
here is we want to return well I guess
this is and shared so we're gonna return
our array of air and air is gonna have a
path it's gonna have a message so we
look right here we're gonna basically
take each validation take grab the path
grab the message and then get rid of the
rest and that's all we need
so for airs here I'm gonna say an array
and it's gonna have a path which is a
string and a message which is also a
string so then we're going to say err
dot enter
and we're gonna just leap through each
one so for each hair we're gonna say ere
is stop push I'm gonna add a new one on
and we're just going to grab so path is
gonna be eat out path message it's gonna
be eat out message and at the very end
we're gonna return heirs so this is us
just like cleaning up the air object
that we get back and kind of getting rid
of all these extra fields that are on
this object and it's a validation error
not just a plain object okay so now we
should be passing back just a plain
vanila object that looks nice and now
hopefully our test should be failing
because we're no longer passing back a
good response at least to this user
let's go back to our resolvers so
because we're returning early now if we
get a bad validation error so perfect so
instead of returning null which means we
successfully registered a user
we returned an array of this object and
we can see we have three errors here two
of them have to do with the email one
with the password and we can see wrong
characters must be valid and then must
be three characters for the password as
well okay so let's write some test cases
for this so we come over here register
and I just want to just undo and put
this back to what it was before
perfect so after we do these tests I
want to do a third
so here we're check for duplicates and
maybe let's write a little comment test
for duplicate emails and here we're just
going to up here the first one we did
check make sure we can register a user
and then next thing mind you catch bad
email so here is our mutation so instead
of just mutation like this I want to
make mutation a function so it's going
to now take two parameters an email and
a password and that's what it's going to
return a string with these and I'm
assuming because it's shadowing yeah so
I'm just gonna call this E and P will
say e oops and P both of these are going
to be strings
so mutation here I'm gonna pass an email
password and same thing here but then
down here when I call mutation this is
gonna be a response 3 I can keep the
same password so this is going to be a
valid password and a invalid email so
that's what that's gonna be and really
here I'm not checking to make sure yep
works I'm checking to make sure I'm
returning the right response so for
example the email is wrong so I want to
make sure with the response I'm seeing
an area that tells me the email is wrong
so with response 3 we're gonna just
check this so again I expect to have at
a length of 1 that's perfect because I
have one err and now I want it to tell
me the exact same thing so right here I
should have a problem with the email
right now we have a problem with like
the length of the email and so maybe
it's worth putting in the error message
or checking the error message here to
make sure it differentiates between a
duplicate email because right now we're
doing the same check and this check
works but I'll make sure we actually get
a bad password response and here we had
a duplicate email response so in my
resolvers maybe what I'll do is create a
file called err messages dot TS
and we'll export Kant's duplicate email
and this is what we're gonna say when we
get duplicate email already taken
duplicate you know okay so now we have
this over here duplicate email and
that's what we're going to be returning
in our resolver so now we're in this
check right here I want to actually just
confirm that what this guy equals so now
I'm going to say the path is equal to
that and now the message is equal to
duplicate email so before I wasn't doing
this because I was like if I refactor
the message it's gonna break this code
right but now since I'm splitting up the
the error message into its own
typescript file when I change it here
both the resolver is gonna return
something different and when we test it
over here I don't have to now change the
test case so I want to do like the same
thing over here so I'm gonna say export
Const email to email not long enough
and I'm actually just gonna copy the
error message because I'm happy with
what this error message says and now in
our resolvers we'll use that so email
not long enough and then also now in our
test and I guess maybe we can test this
a little bit different and I'll we'll
discuss that after we type this out so
message and this is gonna be emailed to
short they're not long enough you can't
find the name it gives me important area
so both of these I'm I oughta imported
so just make sure you guys are following
along this is from error message got
both of those okay so let's run this and
make sure this works so erm test and we
can see what's going wrong if anything
and then the next thing I want to try is
passing an array okay so email oh I get
I received two error messages let's find
so the first one so really what I want
to say here is twofold so I want to just
actually expect the whole object expect
response three equal to so let's make
sure this works
so I expect to get back in object that
says register and register returns an
array and in this array the first
element should be this guy and we can
copy that oh really
just this and the second one object in
this array should be invalid email and
look at that as our error message and
we'll copy that same error message and
then in a resolver will say invalid
email alright so then we update our test
to look like this and I think this will
be a nice nice way to do it
so do yarn tests and we'll check this
out make sure that the objects do match
because we're actually getting two
errors back and cool so that looks good
next thing on a check for is a bad
password so we'll copy this so this case
will be when we get a good password
you're sorry a good email put a bad
password so like that so we expect one
thing back
and the path should be password and the
message should be bad password or
password not long enough
we'll call up so let's add that error
message password not long enough
and what's copy what that error message
will be cool and we'll use that in our
resolver and now on our tests we'll just
need to import this and then we'll run
this to make sure that works and then
while it's running I want to make one
last test and that is when we both have
a bad password and a bad email so catch
bad password and bad so this will be
email and I'm just going to be like that
so to short end and we can copy these
three now the order might be off is the
only thing so I don't know how I want to
do this to make sure I guess this is
fine for now
but what happens if this array returns
back password is the first element I'm
still happy with that but it would say
the test failed all right so this test
fast pass will do yarn test again I
guess I could sort this maybe I think
for now it should return it in this
order every time so it shouldn't be a
problem and all right so yarn test
passed so now we're doing three tests
which I'm pretty happy with making sure
just the emails bad just the password
bad and here is the email and password
back bad and here's us each time or just
making sure we get the right error
messages back now
and we made a new file over here called
error messages that is now just gonna
hold all our messages for airs and then
our resolvers over here we're using this
and returning back this format err
before we do anything else we validate
it you'll notice I did not add it to
like for example max I'm not testing max
I'm fine with that
I'm fine testing I know yep is gonna
work yup should be testing their code to
make sure their stuff works I just want
to double check and make sure that I am
indeed getting an error message back so
I know men work so I expect to get a
good error message back with max if I
wanted to I could also add some test
cases for max but I think it's overkill
in this case so let's sit for this video
guys and this is how I'm going to be
doing validation for other stuff as well
is setting up a yep object like this and
another thing I didn't mention the
reason why I really like yup is I can
use it both in the back end and in the
front end so I can use this same schema
here in my front end when I have the
user typing so I can check the email and
the password before they even send it to
the server as well so that's super cool
and really nice but that's it for this
video guys thanks for watching
