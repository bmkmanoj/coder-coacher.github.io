different ways I do validation and graph
QL now there's about 4 different ways I
go about doing this
and this is using a nodejs server using
a Postgres sequel database and using the
sequel eyes arm so that's what I use for
the backend usually for my graph QL
servers and I'll go about validating the
input in four different manners so the
first way I'll actually do it is what
you see right here I this is a
permissions based check where basically
I'm checking something in the JWT token
itself so I'm passing the user in the
context so I know the user and I'm
checking something about the user here
but I can do anything and this is before
it gets to my graph QL resolver so
here's my resolver right here and I do
requires off create resolver and you'll
notice I'm just wrapping my function
here with this crate resolver but this
requires off so what will happen is my
requires off function will get run
before the resolver for that whatever
for this guy for all users so before all
users that query or mutation is run
whatever it works for either what I'll
do is I'll go ahead and check this
context and if not it through
throws an error so for requires off I'm
checking if there's a user if there's
not user they haven't logged in so I'm
throwing an error but you can do any
kind of validation you want to here
right
you have the arguments you have the
parent and you have the context so any
of that works whatsoever so grab any of
that do any type of validation you want
so this is kind of the first layer of
the onion that we're looking at so I use
it this is how I do it with this create
resolver right here and this code will
have up on github if you look more into
house has done but this is basically run
before the resolver itself and this code
is very easy to share so that's the
probe doing validation at this level I
can call requires off dot crate resolver
I can easily call it up here I can call
it on this guy to any if
whatever I want I can easily share it in
that same statement is checked on each
one so I use that when I want to run you
know before I do my database query or
whatever so the next thing I do is I
actually check for example here's
example here with me this one I actually
this shows you how you would do requires
off if an if statement I'm saying if
there's a user I'm go ahead and check it
but I could just do requires off here
but in my off function for example try
login you can put validation and the
resolver itself so here I'm throwing
errors if I don't like the input so if I
didn't get a good user like if they
didn't pass me a good email and password
on validating that that they give me the
right thing and I can throw an air and
the resolver itself so up the second way
is actually just throwing errors in the
resolver and this third way is actually
with sequel eyes or the database
whichever one we want to start with
we'll start with the database so you see
how we have unique here actually no it
makes more sense so the database
validation will be run last so I'll talk
about that last but sequel eyes here is
the validations that you can run so
these are run on your sequel eyes
queries or it pretty much it actually
I'm pretty sure it's just run on create
an update but you know what I mean when
you're doing operations on your database
this can check and verify you're not
changing the data in in correct way so
for example if I want the length of my
email to be between something I can say
length I want it between seven and a
hundred characters long so then what
will happen is it'll actually check this
and if it doesn't it automatically
throws an error for me
sequel wise will go ahead and as you can
see there's all types of validation that
you can do so I've been ended up I've
been doing more of this type of
validation lately because it's very easy
very fast
just to set up right you saw how fast I
already have I don't have to do any if
statements and you can always say is I
want the lengths to be from two to three
whatever
once I want to be or any of these values
right sometimes you only want
alphanumeric and other things or URLs
I can easily slap that on here and
sequel eyes will check it before it goes
into the database so the last type of
validation is actually Postgres so
Postgres can validate things for us in
graph QL and throw errors just like
anything else so here I'm saying unique
so in Postgres they're making sure I'm
not adding any emails that are
duplicates so you can add constraints
and different things in Postgres itself
so it validates your data for you and if
you're not getting in you know the valid
data what will happen is an errors
thrown from Postgres and sequel eyes
will throw that error and then the air
right here in your resolver so an error
will happen your resolver because you're
trying to reason people create something
and let's say we put bad data in there
then Postgres will throw an error if
we're not adding unique stuff so those
are the four different ways I validate
data and graph QL and you'll do it
depending on what you want to validate
you put them in different places I tend
to if it's something I want to use a lot
to different places and it's you know at
the very beginning of the query before I
even touch the database I want to do it
I'll usually set up one of these a
permission and it works well with
permissions that's why I call this
permissions checking that if I want
something that's just one-off and I
don't need to check this anywhere else
maybe I'll put it in the resolver itself
if if I can I'll put it in sequel eyes
if it's just a field so notice we're
only validating a field when I do length
2 to 3 or 2 to 30 will do 100 going on
that's what I did before I think or
maybe it was 7 it doesn't matter but
it's only checking the email field not
the password not the refresh secret only
this field so that's really nice if I
want to target particular fields and
then usually upload and Postgres if I
can it's
like this unique field that would be
difficult for us equalized or something
else to check so it's the easiest for
the database to do so that's kind of how
I choose between where I put my
validation logic for different things in
the next video what I'm going to do is
show you how to actually a nice way to
handle these errors because you're gonna
be getting errors from your database
because I usually use a mix of these
right I don't just use one I have errors
being thrown here I have errors possibly
being thrown here and I get errors
possibly being thrown by the permissions
itself so they're all over the place so
the next video I'll show you how to
handle all of these in a nice orderly
manner so everything makes sense and you
stay sane so that's it for this video
guys thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
