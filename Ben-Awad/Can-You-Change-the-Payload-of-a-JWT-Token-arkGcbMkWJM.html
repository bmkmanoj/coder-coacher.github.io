okay to store your JWT tokens on the
client-side
and how your users of your programs
cannot actually change or mess up the
JWT token itself so right here I have
the Jo to you ayuh website to show how
this works
now here's a token right here and you
can see it's color coded this bit goes
to the header at this bit goes of
payload and the spit to the signature I
don't notice it also tell you whether
the token is valid or invalid so I can
you know add some stuff at the end and
invalidates it now also you'll notice
right here it has the signature so this
is the secret that you're using to
encode the token so if I change the
secret you'll notice it goes invalid and
then to the right over here I just have
a single G a simple JWT token library or
JWT library in Python so this allows you
to create tokens and you can see I
create a token right here this is Python
where I said the admin is false and then
my secret is right here so if I type
token we can see that's my token and I
can copy this and I can bring it over
here and we paste it in and we can see
the admin is false and now I use the
same secret here I used here so it's
it's still verified it's still okay now
as a user as you don't want your users
to be able to change this payload value
and they actually can't because as you
can see we're storing whether they're an
admin in this so we don't want them to
be able to say they are you know are an
admin when they're really not and just
basically grant them self free access
and what's nice about JW tokens is they
actually can't and here's why so this
bit is corresponding to the payload so I
can like change what goes here in the
payload changes but you notice as soon
as I change that letter I put it back
we're blue we're all verified but I try
changing one these letters the whole
thing invalidates so I know the token
has been tampered with and so I can
check that to see if it's been messed up
if it has I don't trust it right so they
can't mess with this part and the only
other thing they can do is create a
whole new token and you also notice like
it just messes up the payload - you
can't just easily change this to false
they could try creating a whole new
payload a whole new token so they could
go over here and they could say true to
give themself access but the thing is
they need to know what your secret is
so if my secret is Bob and I run this
and get my token and copy it yeah um
they don't know what to put for the
value of this they might think it's
wrong or Kim what are they used for the
token it's always gonna be invalid
they're gonna have to know I signed this
with Bob now if they know what my secret
is they can create any type of database
you take when they want that's why it's
very important to use whatever secret
you use for making your JW tokens don't
share that because anyone can create
whatever token they want after that but
as long as they don't have access to
that they can't really manipulate this
token without messing it up right
everything gets screwed up if they try
to change it and without that secret
they you're gonna just see it's invalid
when you check the token so you're fine
so there's no real hazard and showing
the client their token or you know they
can mess with the token but they're
gonna mess themselves up and they can't
really give themselves access with the
token unless they know your secret so
that's it for this video guys I'll see
you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
