we're gonna be wrapping up our weather
application all we need to do is set up
that little Yahoo widget that shows at
the bottom and shows the weather so
we're gonna be doing that in the home
page
so if you go into components and then
home we're gonna be using a header from
semantic UI and we're gonna add a
constructor props super props and then
we're gonna create a Yahoo widget and
it's gonna be needing to access the
props to get data so that's why we're
binding it here so yah-hoo widget and
we're gonna return nothing for now and
then in a render function or just gonna
call this thought Yahoo widget and show
that underneath our form and then our
Yahoo would we're gonna be first getting
the query and we're just gonna do some
quick double-checking to make sure it is
valid if it's not valid we don't want to
show anything
so if query and query dot results so it
makes sure's this is making sure that
query exists and that resists or results
exists that we got in fact a good
response if we didn't just return false
return false just renders nothing for
this element otherwise that means we got
some HTML now I want to see if I can
show you guys what that looks like
I'm just gonna give this a try real
quick change this to New York because
New York seems to work a lot better for
some reason and it does awesome so if we
come down here you notice that there's
this description this is a widget that
we're going to be using so to get there
let HTML is equal to query dot results
dot channel item description that will
give us this big string and this string
is actually HTML with if you get rid of
this beginning part in this end part the
rest of it is valid HTML that we would
like to show on the screen we just need
to get rid of those front beginning
parts I'm just gonna do a search and
replace to get rid of them and then once
we do that we just need to render this
string as HTML um react you need to be
careful when doing this because you can
let you get it you know into problems we
render bad HTML code and you could get
hacked
but yeah who's a reputable source
reading it from here so it should be
fine also this is just a little test
site so it shouldn't be a big deal but
react ones against doing what we're
about to do and as you'll see with the
syntax for it so HTML dot HTML dot
replace so we're just gonna do a little
regular expression here we're gonna
either replace we're gonna be replacing
this and we just need to escape these
guys or the bar or we're gonna be
replacing that close the parentheses / G
comma and then replace it with nothing
so that this nasty little regular
expression right here what that does is
it removes this see data and that so it
removes these two guys from that HTML
next we're actually just gonna return it
so give us a little div you will do a
line break to separate us again and then
we'll create our header as an h3 and
we'll line it in the center and then
we're gonna say query results dot
channel description note that this is
different from item dot description this
is just gonna give us the name of the
application that we looked up and then
here we're gonna actually just show the
HTML so to do that you type dangerously
set enter HTML and do underscore HTML
and then pass in HTML so as you can see
react wants you to be very careful when
using this in this case it's fine but if
you're taking for example user input or
something you leave yourself susceptible
to someone doing bad code putting it in
here and it's called I believe it's XSS
or something hack or something people
call it that you leave yourself
susceptible to when doing this but we're
getting your data from Yahoo should be
fine all right so that should be good
this should work let's watch it in
action and we have a syntax error of
course open just forgot to close the div
here at the end of my Yahoo widget come
back over here and reload for me
there's still another heir headers
looking good Dave is looking good
what doesn't like return
Oh my return statement here should not
be a object there we go and okay it
likes it better I have a random
semicolon let's see where that's coming
from
interesting so if I do inspect I come
over to my reactive tools will it show
it to me the tag that guy's coming from
it's coming from my form it's coming for
my submit form okay so I'm just gonna
open up my form real quick components
simple form and see if we can find this
little semicolon on the loose here just
maybe well that's not gonna do it is it
would be from content or something
what's your my button this nope submit
looks okay weird I must have like an
extra semicolon somewhere anyway this
might be hard to track down and for now
it's not that big of a deal so I'm just
gonna not worry about that for now so
let's use this to find the location so
new york and that puts that here and
where it looks like it's not working
unknown prop dangerously set innerhtml
oops looks like I have a little typo
here ding jure Russ Lee set you know
HTML html's all capitals okay so now we
can search for New York again and
closing that off we see Yahoo weather
for New York New York us and then we see
this little icon thing here and the
current conditions okay awesome
so our weather application is done using
Redux forms we can allows us to type in
here and then send data Redux saga and
then Redux saga does an API call in the
background Yahoo getting us the data
updating the state using Redux reducer
and then the UI changes when the state
changes right here and then we also have
some error handling in case you don't do
a location or if you a bad location just
to kind of filter stuff out so our
application is done thanks for watching
guys if you have any more questions
about Redux forms or redux saga please
leave in comment below and I'd be happy
to answer your question and you before
we leave found my little semicolon right
there
see if it refreshes it that guy's gone
and it is alright guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
