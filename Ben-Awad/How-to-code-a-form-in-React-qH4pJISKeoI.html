do forms and react using new libraries
just react I'm going to use Redux form
Redux any of that stuff just using local
state and directly and react I've used
reacts form a lot and other things and I
like this method better for a lot of
forms because you don't really need some
of the extra stuff some of the libraries
give you so I have right here a react
application up that I'm going to show
you demonstrated on this is just using
create react app and I'm just going to
create a new component as you can see if
you don't know create react up is I
recommend googling it create starter kit
I just have the initial kit open and I'm
going to show you how I will create a
form component so for machi s and I'm
just going to import in form from form
yes and we're going to add it to our
project here and display it and then
we're going to put our logic in form
alright so I'm going to import react
from react and here we're going to make
a class now you can't really do a peer
functions if you want to create a form
and react because you want to use the
state so in extends react component and
we're going to have a state here now I'm
just going to do a simple registration
form maybe where it's asking for first
name last name and here's your name
email and password
okay so staying here is going to hold
all the values so as people are typing
in the form what we want to do is going
to update the state here and then we
want to have the values that are here
reflected in our form so in our render
function and do returned here I'm going
to create a form and we're going to
create some input fields now this is not
specific to just input fields you could
be using a UI framework like bootstrap
material UI and semantic UI there's tons
of them you this works just like that
for any styled input so here what you
can do is you can say value is equal to
this state value or dislike state value
and value being whatever you wanted to
be so I'm going to say this is first
name so I'll say placeholder just so we
know what the value is
we'll say first name and we have the
value here so whatever value is here is
going to be reflected here so if I come
over here let's see I'll just need to
restart my sir let that run so whatever
value I have in the state is going to be
reflected here and we can see that as
when this loads I'm going to try typing
in the form and it's not going to let me
because it's going to have what I have
here so if I have dog dog is going to
show up and I need to upper upper cases
area for my import to the uppercase form
expected a string oh we need to export
default that's very important too so our
component can actually render okay so
you see the word dog here and I'm trying
to type I don't know if you can hear me
typing but I'm trying to type and it
doesn't let me and that's because well
we said the value
is equal to levers here right and the
value here is dogs who won't let me
change it but if we wanted to change it
what we would need to do is create a non
change function and on change function
passes a variable called event back or
parameter that you can use and a target
value is going to be whatever the user
just typed with the current value is so
what you can do is you can say this
let's move over
let's try actually drop down a few lines
isn't easier to see so on change this
dot set state so this will update the
state and we could say first name is
equal to e dot target ah value all right
so now as I'm typing in this you can say
dog and type whatever I want and if I
were to go to inspect this element now I
have the reactive tools which allows me
to look at the component I can see the
value you can see the state updating so
and that will help us when we submit the
form okay so this is one way to do on
change so I could copy and paste this
right three more times and I could
change this to last name and we have to
put last name here last name here and
what is this user
this one is username username username
and password start actually you know
right you can fill out all the fields
this way but I'm going to show you a
better way to do on change then just you
know typing all this is this is a lot of
duplicate color right I mean it's not a
ton this duck said state you know but
what if you
to add maybe some middleware or just
something that runs every time as this
values updated nice to have a function
that basically extracts us so just to
show you guys this is working we can
color here type stuff and everything
types okay which is expected right how
do we actually submit this form and see
the values well before we do that I want
to show you another way so on change
works just fine like this but we can
create our own change function I'm going
to call it change which accepts E and
does something kind of cool so what we
can do is instead of specifying here we
can say is give this a name value name
being first name and notice how the name
here I want to match up with the name in
our state what this allows us to do is
here I can say this dot set state and I
could say e dot target dot name is equal
to either target value so what we're
going to do is now instead having this
here we're going to say e this dot
change pass en so now notice it's going
to grab what the name value is here and
put it here so when we pass en to change
it's going to call this function here
and it's going to grab like I said the
name value put it here so it's going to
say first name is now equal to the new
value so now we can just go down this
right and just simplify it so now I have
last name and I figure out the changes
please there's just two placeholders ok
and we can get rid of you and now e dot
this dot change and it does the exact
same thing right we could keep the other
change if there's nothing wrong with
doing itself this way it's just a little
bit less code a little less duplication
right if you wanted to change stuff so
user name copy this come down here do it
for this for this name equal to email
and then name password and we also want
to do type is equal to password on this
field just so it's hidden okay so how do
I submit our form right and actually get
values use it do something with it
maybe call an API or whatnot well what
we can do is we can create a button here
we can call it on I think on click not
on submit so on click what we can do we
can call a this dot on submit and now on
submit is a function we're going to
create here and we can just add it to
our class so submit button so over here
we can add our submit so I can say on
submit and we're just going to console
dot log this dot state so we can see the
values what allows to do you see the
values of when we submit everything and
we could possibly handle it now I also
just want to put some line breaks here
so our form is just separated a little
bit on your lines alright
so ABCD ALP I submit this I don't know
if you guys caught that for a second but
what actually happened is it print it to
the console refreshed and you'll notice
how the URL now looks like this and it
passed all the values that were here up
here now that's just like the default
behavior for when you have a form using
this form thing using the form tag if
you don't want that to happen what you
can do is pass the event parameter so on
click here we can pass in the event
handler and then we can say e dot
prevent default and now the page won't
Auto refresh and put all these all this
junk in a URL right so if I put ABCDE F
you'll notice we just print the object
out we have all the values and now let
that allow us to do is we can actually
you know from this we have this web
state we have these values we can do
whatever you want with it
maybe our form maybe our app up here
wants to use these values so what we can
do is we can say to stop props dot on
submit
now the onsubmit here is going to be
different than here click on props props
we're going to actually pass here to the
on submit we can create a function that
takes maybe some field and we're going
to do something with it so on submit and
field
and then here we can actually say this
dot on submit' field now you can see we
have tons of on submits this to onsubmit
refers to this so we can say console dot
log app component got and then get pass
in the field site you guys got now
coming over here we can just pass in
this dot state so now if we rerun this I
can put ABCD we could submit and look
our app got those values so it can do
stuff with it
so let's see what some say different
things we can do and also before we do
stuff an app what if we want to clear
after submitting you can do this dot set
state and then set all the values to be
empty like this so now when you submit
it'll actually clear ABCDEF run and you
can see that now what we can do is we
can get fancy and we can say state of
our application so we're getting we're
in the just has our form here we can say
field is equal to an empty object great
but then we can save this set state
field and we can actually do stuff with
it now we can render it we can say we
can just show what the fields we get
here so json dot stringify because this
is an object and if you put null comma
two it'll actually format it nicely and
put that in a paragraph tag so now we
can see what you submitted on the screen
field
oh this needs to be this dot state dot
field so it'll be an empty object at
first then when we submit it'll populate
so ABCDE and I submit and bam look at
all the values populate there now we can
even take this to the next level and we
can actually do this kind of real-time
as we're typing in the form we can get
stuff to populate so instead of you know
having an odd submit maybe we have an
oops in an on change and then we call
this on change and we call this on
change so every time there's a change in
our form of an updated fields and show
it here so in our form here we can
actually get rid of our on submit for
props then our change here we're going
to say this props dot on change and then
we can actually pass in a target dot
name just like we're doing for our state
here impasse in the new value valley so
not only are going to pass it to our
state but also to our app up here so now
it's going to get the values right
but notice how we're not getting fields
anymore we're actually just getting one
value so updated value so we can just
pass an updated value here and it'll go
ahead and update our field I think so a
be okay it didn't work let's see what we
did wrong so we have on change here stop
props on change should be called and
then set State updated value so it
actually needs to be filled right
because we need to add this to the field
value we need to unpack this too
so we have to set the state of fields
because we're updating fields we're
adding the new value we also want to
keep the original values that are in
fields already so we're going to say
this dot state dot fields
so just to recap with that this thing is
doing we're going to set the state we're
going to keep the values that are
originally in fields we're going to grab
that new updated value and put it in our
field all right so now as I'm typing Bob
Martin BM BM @ BM comm and then R my
password so as we're typing we can
actually see it update live in our app
right here so it's pretty cool and then
if you want to click Submit it all
clears you'll notice it doesn't update
here that's just because inter on submit
we don't call on change so if we wanted
to we could say this dot see how we're
calling the stock set state we could
also say this stock props on change and
now when they're submitting it will
clear everything and now everything is
clear so you can type more stuff clear
more stuff and do the whole nine yards
that is it for this video guys that time
and liking doing forms it's a pretty
lightweight the basic crux of it is we
have a change function here that lets us
set the value of our state and we're
just setting keeping the state here
passing the value in having on change
for our input and then we just handle
the submission with an on-click here
with our button we could handle stuff in
our on submit do whatever you want when
the form submits redirect page give it
to another component all kinds of stuff
we can do so I'm really liking this
method of doing forms instead of doing
using library
just lightweight and you don't need this
like works very well you don't need some
other stuff so that's what I've been
doing lately thanks for watching guys
let me know if you have any questions or
any troubles setting this up I'd be
happy to help and I'll see you guys the
next video
