video we were playing with this bar here
and I've been playing it with it a
little bit more training it to work and
I looked I tried to find an example of
how they get the current scene looks
super weird I'm not sure how if you do
know how please let me know in the
comments below looks like they set up
some kind of reducer for it and they're
listening in the store and I really hate
how they do it
and it looks super complicated to set up
for what seems really simple and I'm not
liking the way reactor outer flux is
working if I'm doing a new project right
now I would actually use reactor outer
this one reactor Browder neither does
this one is looking better to me this is
what I use for regular react and I would
try it out for react native because I'm
not liking how the other one is working
so give this a try
I'm going to try using this with my next
project but to get this working but I
think I'm going to do is instead of
trying to get this all this junk to work
it's just use the tab layout on every
page so we have this thing I'm just
going to go back I was trying to
console.log some stuff try to figure it
out but I honestly don't think it's
worth it we have the actions here this
is all good forget this children crap
just return the footer and then we'll
use this actually on our page so then we
don't need the container here now we
have this nice tab layout which we'll
just use on our actual pages so remove
this component here and then what we'll
do is we'll just import it ourselves
so like go into view auctions and put
that guy and we'll looks like we don't
need socket I'll get at that and then at
the bottom of our container here
we can have a tablet there we are and
then we can say current page and this
page is the view auctions and I guess we
should do different than what I'm giving
the key so I'm going to add a prop to
tab our layout let's like to do that
right now so we know which one to make
active here for that thing so we'll pass
in the current page as a prop and so on
our button here will say active is equal
to current page is equal to and then
what what is for a list it would be I
guess that's fine we'll do the same as
their key I don't think it'll hurt
anything as their key for the router
okay add it they're out of there don't
need that oh man
I copied that wrong there we go
do that here stay here okay and we're
going to put active there okay add space
here so for this one this is going to be
log in to log in here it's going to be
sign up and that's just for
a little highlight to pop up okay
so then here current page is view
auction actually it should be plural you
auctions and this is this one double
quoted yeah refresh all right so now we
see this the tab bars not rendering
below it now think wants to push this up
with the margin so here we can say
margin bottom 20 okay I think of my need
container style margin bottom 20 instead
of style for the fab nope that won't
even move that's extremely odd maybe if
I put it on the no I shouldn't do it
shoot why is it not doing that I guess I
mean we can just get it to work how
we're doing it before where we have
basically another container here because
that seemed to work and look good and we
can remove margin bottom so now we'll
have another container inside of this
container there yeah how does that look
alright that looks much better and
notice how we see the highlight and
we're on this correct page now if I go
here awesome now that looks good now we
just need to do this tab bar on the
login and the signup page and also the
auction forum page why not
so I guess we should just copy and paste
that container thing because that thing
to work good so we don't need to touch
that anymore the login page will be the
same as this will copy our layout paste
that into the login view and then at the
bottom here will create another
container and at the bottom we'll put
our tab layout tab everything over there
we go now let's see how that looks
Oh
but current page is equal to login and
now we should see it active and we're
going to login nice we can go back to
this one Coolio now we just need to do
the signup page and then the other one
as well actually two more left so the
auction form page can add that here and
here actually shouldn't have any active
because it is not a there's no way to
get here from the navigation you have to
actually click the little button and we
should tab layout here alright and then
finally our signup page oops
copy you taste that here and we just
should we should save this page and copy
this create in our container go to the
bottom tab bar layout current page is
equal to sign up and we still will quote
that
we should be able to navigate to any
page go to sign up log in and highlight
it nicely awesome
okay very cool so that's it for this
video and the next one what we'll do is
we'll actually work on this button right
here so when I click it it does a little
kind of like a little highlight thing as
well so guys for watching and I'll see
you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
