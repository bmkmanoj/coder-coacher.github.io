message any members on our team using
this little plus sign and then we can
just type their name and then BAM we can
start chatting with him but on slack
whenever you start chatting with someone
and he starts sending messages their
little icon or name appears over here
under direct message so I should see
like Bob 2 right here and I can click on
them and I can open up our message
history and start chatting from there
also I don't want to just like hit this
plus line every time I want to chat with
someone so that's what we're gonna
implement today so I talked about in the
last video real quickly about I'm using
the distinct keyword on this query so
get team members because I was worried
about getting duplicate members but you
can't have two members or you can't have
the same member be part of the team
twice so I think we're good and won't
have any duplicates but we will be using
the distinct keyword and a little bit
when we make our next query so how are
we going to do this direct messages
thing here so one one way to do it is to
create another field or model to store
every time me basically they keep track
of who we've started a direct message
message session with but I want to avoid
creating more fields and more models so
the way we're going to do this is
basically to just look at our messages
our direct message model and see who
you've sent messages to or receive
messages from and then they'll pop up
there okay so we're gonna start by
changing the schema a little bit so we
have our team schema here instead of
members I'm gonna call this like direct
message members and it's going to return
an array of users so this field right
here is gonna be the users that we
display here so now we're gonna go to
our resolver and actually resolve this
field so we're gonna come down here to
the bottom of our team resolver and I'm
gonna copy messages are not messages
channels and we're going to do
let's copy over that name Direct Message
channel direct message members and then
here we have the team ID the models have
a user and now we're gonna be doing a
query so we're gonna do models sequel
eyes dot query now we're gonna just do a
roll query cuz it's gonna be the easiest
to write out for this one so we're gonna
select all and let's move this down so
you guys can see this better so we're
gonna select all from users and so we're
going to select all users right and what
users do we want to select we're going
to select the ones that we have direct
messaged with so either we've sent a
message or we received a message so
we're going to say join direct messages
and I did camelcase yep we use camel
case for the name of the table so direct
messages and I don't know if you notice
how I have s is at the end here whereas
I don't here sequel eyes automatically
add to those s is there okay so I'm
gonna use aliases so users I'm gonna
call you and then direct messages I'm
gonna call DMS and we're gonna be
joining on two things so you can either
join on the so of course we're going to
be joining on the users ID and it's
going to be the DM and we're either
going to be doing it on the sender ID or
so or UID is equal to DM receiver
idea and then we need a wear cloth so
for a where clause here we basically
want to see whether our current user is
either the sender or receiver and we
want to make sure that we are selecting
only messages from our team so add
parentheses here you saw above here that
I used a question mark for this query to
do replacements you can also do named
replacements if you're going to use two
multiple times which is going to be the
case for us so I'm gonna do a little
colon here and say a current user ID is
equal to DM dot sender ID or current
user ID and is equal to DM dot receiver
ID and then we just need to do an and
and we're going to say direct message
team ID is equal to team ID and we're
gonna pass in the team ID and the
current user ID as parameters or
replacements to this query and so yeah
this team ID at the end is so we do if
we message a user or a different team we
don't want to fetch that user so we're
just walking that down here so at the
end here we're gonna go similar to how
we did above here we're gonna make this
a Roth query paste that in a raw query
we're gonna be returning user model and
then replacements instead of using an
array we're gonna have an object so
current user ID we're gonna pass in user
ID and team ID we're gonna pass in our
ID all right cool so we have our our
thing right here our property or field
we built the resolver for it so now we
just want to call this on your front-end
and display it so let's come on over
here here is the me query which we're
fetching all the teams so now we're just
gonna fetch all the direct
message remembers and I'm gonna grab the
ID and the username of them and then in
view team for now I'm just gonna say
console dot log team dot direct message
users or sorry members so we can just
see who they are and let's just make
sure you spell that right yep so I'm
gonna click on general and we get seven
so let's see make sure we get the right
stuff so we get all these bob thingies
and we're getting duplicates the reason
for that is we never said distinct oops
and I talked to you guys about adding
this in and this is we're gonna be using
it so I'm gonna say distinct on UID so
what this means is we don't want
multiple users with the same ID so if
you if we queried the same user twice we
only want to display at once and the way
we know we displayed it there we have
multiple is I want the ID property here
so distinct on and then we're still
selecting all so let's rerun this and
see what we get now we get Bob and Bob -
perfect because those are the only two
users that I've sent messages to so I've
sent messages to myself because I'm
currently logged getting this Bob and
I've also just messaged Bob - so now on
my front end I want to use that and
display that so we're gonna be passing
direct message members in here and we're
gonna feed it into
our our sidebar there so we're ready
passing the team in so we can actually
just come on over to our object here so
I believe it's in the it's gonna be in
the sidebar I think and it's gonna be in
channels and we're passing in the team
right team name doesn't look like we're
sending in the direct message here we go
users so instead of that I'm now gonna
pass team dot direct message users so
now instead of slack bot and user one we
should see different stuff and that
should be members I keep typing users
okay and now in our channels we just
need to change how we're selecting it so
users don't map and then our users up
here it's gonna be username because
that's the field in the object cool so
we see Bob and Bob - so next when I
click on that I would like to be taken
to the my messages with them so I'm
gonna wrap this whole thing in a link
and it looks like I already have yet by
rehab link so we just need to go to so
where are we gonna go well I want to
take them to their direct message with
them which is view team I can copy that
in slash user slash this is the team ID
so we need to somehow get the team ID
here and then also the ID of the user
that we want to chat with which we have
right here so this team ID how are we
gonna get that so we passed the team ID
in here so when we're mapping through
our users we're going to say a user
where a call user by passing in the user
and also this team ID so now we have a
second parameter to our user function we
need to grab the team ID so up here I'm
gonna say team ID so now let's see if I
click on this if this works alright so
I'll click on that and we broke it
because I didn't add a little slash in
front
and go back and we see no messages here
and no messages here so we have like a
little problem so let's fix that so I
don't know if you noticed this or not we
were getting different IDs than what we
should be look up here five and if I
come over here to our database and I
connect to slack and I select all from
users my idea for Bob is one so when I
click on this I should be taken to one
here but I'm not taken to six so why is
that well come back over here so this
actually has a problem with our thing
right here our query here it's actually
returning the ID of the direct message
and not the user so here we're just
gonna say user dot ID and user dot
username now if there's anything else we
wanted we could also grab those fields
as well but those are the only ones that
we really care about so that's what all
we're gonna select so now when I select
this hopefully we don't get six cool we
get one in two now I notice when I click
on these we see the different messages
pop up so we'll just give this one last
try so what I want to do is basically
direct message with someone and have it
pop up here so I'm going to invite a new
person to the team but first I need to
create a new person so register so I'm
going to call this guy Tom at Tom calm
paestum in and now in my view team over
here i didn't login so i'm still logged
in his Bob I want to invite Tom at Tom
and I want to direct message with Tom oh
I did I did do that okay so I just added
Tom to the team so I would have to
refresh if we wanted to we could update
the cache because direct messages was
reading from the cache there Tom so
here's our message with Tom hey Tom we
need to add add subscriptions to this
but if we refresh we should see our
message and we see Tom pop up here nice
we do need to update the cache though
when we send a message now because we
want to see Tom pop up right away - but
we'll be working that on that in the
next video that's it for now thank you
guys for watching and the code will be
up on github
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
