how to bundle react yes with web pack
now I'm going to show you parcel which
is a competitor to web pack that
recently just came out and it is touting
blazing fast speeds and zero
configuration so we're gonna go through
how to set this up and compare it to how
it took to set up web pack now the
bottom of their homepage they show some
benchmarks and they are saying you get
double the speed of web pack and then
once parcel caches things it is 10 times
faster within one pack which is insane
and it's ain't good so this is
definitely something to look at and
consider when deciding what bundle are
to use so let's see what it's like to
set this up so first thing we're gonna
need to do is install it so we're gonna
say yarn add parcel - bundler now I'm
going to do this in the same folder and
same project that I did the last web
pack configuration so we can kind of
compare and contrast so after we install
that we are gonna do things slightly
differently so with web pack what we did
is we said hey take index J s and turn
it into bundle J s and then in our what
pack config we told it how to turn it
into that we said use Babel loader with
the react preset to do that and then an
index J s we did dot slash bundle J s to
import this and then that's how we
served our files right so this was our
bundle to GS now with Parcel they do it
slightly differently
you don't need a bundle J s well we will
need one but we don't point our
index.html at bundle GS we pointed at
the precompiled so index a is
so now index.html would not work if we
serve to this because it's pointing at
advanced JavaScript or JavaScript that
hasn't been compiled yet so we need to
take this and bundle it up
so what parcel does is parcel says hey
tell me what HTML file you want to
bundle and it'll bundle this HTML and
when it's bundling it it also looks for
any JavaScript finds this script tag and
bundles that as well so it says hey look
I need a bundle this guy as well and now
we're using reacts so we need to similar
to how a pack we use this react very
sorry when we're using webpack we use
this preset for react when you do the
same thing for a parcel so we're gonna
be using this and we actually could have
used this for the last one with web pack
but I just forgot about it so this so
this is the babel configuration that
create react app uses so we're gonna use
the same one because it's really nice so
we're just gonna copy this oops and
we're just going to say yarn add as a
dependency babel preset react app and
then to say to use this we just gonna
create a babel our c file and then here
we're gonna say presets and we say which
preset we want to be used and here we
let the preset is react app alright give
that a save and then notice how we have
no configuration file for parcel all we
said was we downloaded this preset for
react and we created a babel RC to tell
babel what's he do next we just say and
we can clear this MPX
parcel and we tell it our HTML file are
starting HTML file which in this case is
index.html and that's it we run that and
we're done so it's gonna set up a server
for us automatically we didn't have to
install another project for that and
then let's click on i won't let me click
on it we could copy this and our project
is serving right now at this and it's
hot reloading and stuff out
we type it or reload and refresh so that
took five seconds let's look at the
index ah yes let's add a bang sign and
see how long it takes to recompile 77
milliseconds so there's a huge
difference and we see there so as you
can see the cached version is super fast
with parcel the first build looks like
it took some time but you're only ever
gonna build it once right it had to take
all the node modules and notice it
generated a few files so let's talk
about what these are so here we have a
cache that's pretty obvious right this
is just caching this is just parcel
caching our results so that can speed up
and not basically bundle things that
doesn't need to but then there's also
this dist folder and what you'll notice
is there is index.html and in our
index.html this looks very similar to
our index.html over here and it's
pointed at this react web pack and we
can look at react web pack and we can
see hey look at this
this is our project and we can see it's
all bundled up nice and I think it's
called react web pack because that's
what I call it here it's not actually
using webpack even though it says web
pack there so don't be confused but
notice now there's this dist folder so
it takes your index.html and all your
JavaScript files and it puts it in a
dist folder which is pretty nice and
serves it from there so that's how
parcel works and you saw how fast it was
to get this set up and I really liked
that and I see how fast it is to rebuild
things so I'm working on a Chrome
extension right now and I had to choose
did I want to go with parcel or do I
want to go with web pack to get things
set up and actually chose this just set
up with parcel because it was so easy
and nice to get this set up and I really
liked it now with that said we're
talking about web pack 3 web pack 4 is
coming up I don't know how you know soon
it is but I have heard what pack 4 is
supposed to make
very similar to how things are
pre-configured and fast to set up
similar to how parcel is right zero
configuration we made did not make a
configuration file look at all this
stuff we had right in our config file
for web pack right web pack four is
gonna try to get rid of some of this
bloat we're not bloat but setup defaults
like parcel does so it's faster to get
your first project up and running so if
you haven't and you're looking for a
bundler I recommend checking out parcel
because it's pretty nice but take in
mind it's also very new and compared to
web pack so it may have some bugs and
some things compared to web pack that
are not as flushed out but definitely
keep an eye on it it is emergeny
emerging bundler which has a lot of
potential so that's it for this video
guys that's all I have
thanks for watching
