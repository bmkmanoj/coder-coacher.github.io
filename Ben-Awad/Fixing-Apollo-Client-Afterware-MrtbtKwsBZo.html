our layout for direct messages but we're
gonna take a quick pause with that and
jump back to how we were doing our with
filter because I finally figured out how
we can basically check if they're a
member of a team before actually
subscribing that user so I'd like to
thank someone in the comments gave me
the suggestion and it's great it works
and we're gonna do exactly that so thank
you guys if you left comments about
suggestions stuff you guys have been
great so the way we're gonna do this is
kind of how we're doing with this create
resolve or thing here with requires
permission so we're gonna create a new
one here and the trick that we were
doing wrong is we were trying to do it
or I was trying to do it on this
function here so instead we're gonna
lift it up and put it on this function
here before the with filter so we're
basically gonna create a new new
permission here called team member maybe
team member or requires team access or
something like that that makes sense
requires team access whatever you want
to name it we're gonna wrap it here so
it requires team access create resolver
and we're gonna wrap this guy all right
and what we're wrapping is just with
filter so all the way to here and so I'm
gonna get rid of this green stuff here
and now we're going to create this
requires team access function okay so
we're gonna export comments requires
team access and this is going to be
create resolver so the same thing we're
doing here
and then we're going to say all our
stuff and then here we're gonna put our
logic so I'm gonna whoops I'm gonna
paste in our comment and then here we
have parent args user and then models
and then we don't really care about this
stuff here now so I'm just gonna say
args and we we don't even have to do any
of this just an empty function
parameters there so then our permissions
over here we can uncomment this stuff so
first we're gonna check if their user we
can pretty much just copy this here so
if they're not a user or they're not
with the user ID and we're gonna make
this an async function then we're gonna
have this code run so we're basically
going to just check and the channel ID
we're getting from the arguments so
channel ID yeah okay just to remind you
what this is doing alright so this is
just too long that's where you're in a
red line here so we're fetching the
channel that we're trying to subscribe
to then we're grabbing with that we know
what the team that the channel is
associated with because we can get the
channel team ID so we're fetching we're
seeing basically if you are a member of
the team by checking looking for in our
member table channel if this team ID and
the user ID of the user who's logged in
and if you're not a member we throw an
error so that's it and we have it
wrapped over here so if we take a look
at requires team access Cree resolver
and let's take a look over here if we
get any errors we get this thing but you
notice it reconnected so for refresh
looks good let's try to type something
hello three awesome works just fine so
we're able to still subscribe to this
guy but let's see now try to subscribe
with someone so localhost:8080 one and
I'm just gonna striving to that
so subscription new channel message
channel ID and what channel we are in
general is one I'm gonna say one and I
would like to see the text of the
message so subscribe and we get this
object object which is an air and I
believe if we were to open up our
console here no it doesn't really show
any airs really here but this is an air
and if I were to say hello for we notice
we don't get anything here because we
tried to subscribe and we got an error
so perfect so now our subscription
endpoint is protected and now we didn't
have to hard-code anything pretty much
and our on connect here so we're still
just passing the user so now we're able
to support multiple subscriptions which
is really good and have different
permissions on each subscription
endpoint and now there's one more thing
I want to do that is currently broken so
we are storing the JWT token in our
local storage and then we are refreshing
the tokens whenever they expire and in
our index over here we have this add
user middleware where we are sending
tokens back but right now we're not it's
broken so if we take a look I'm gonna
come over here to Apollo so we have
after we're here it is we have after
we're here and what it does is it grabs
the headers which we're sending back so
if we see over here in our network tab
if I search for graph QL let's see if
we're sending back any so this is a post
request and notice these are the
response headers we have an X refresh
token and token those are getting passed
back and so it should update the tokens
so if I put a console log here
of headers this should have our headers
in it but currently it's undefined so
when this refreshes we'll see this thing
come undefined and there's a problem
with it but sometimes it's supposed to
be undefined but here we see we have a
token and a refresh token so we should
see them here and so what we need to do
is not call this get context here I
messed this up we actually need to do it
we need a map over the operation first
and we need to do it here so basically
we just need to move all that stuff down
here
and have it over and now instead of
headers needs to be response headers
because we were getting the response
back and if I console.log this this is
still gonna empty and it's actually not
even gonna work and I just want to
console dot log the tokens as well and
I'll show you why in a second so a
refresh token and token here and the
reason why this is not gonna work and we
can see it I don't know if it will crash
or if you'll just be undefined here we
go
so there you go it is undefined there
we're actually our that's kind of
interesting
headers get so we're getting tokens but
I don't know what's crashing this errors
of undefined could not be cloned Oh
we're not returning this at the bottom
so return response area so this thingy
that we have right here we need to
return that at the very bottom and I'm
surprised usually it wants to need to
put like that put little parentheses
around since this is a function okay all
right so notice how this is nominal and
our headers here are no as well which is
bad we don't want that and I I don't
know why but in this particular version
it's just broken so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna upgrade our packages so
I'm here at SLAC cloned clients so this
is the root of my client directory and
I'm gonna use a package called ncu which
basically updates all of my NPM packages
so we're not just going to upgrade one
we're gonna upgrade all of them cuz why
not so if you don't have this you can do
NPM by - G and then NPM check updates so
you can install that I already have it
so I don't need to run it but what
they'll do is they'll go ahead and
install so if I run NCA ncua what it'll
do is they'll go
head and install a couple dependencies
that must get upgraded or need to be
upgraded so these are the ones and then
we can run and see you actually I think
we would need to run - you first before
we do it - eh I think I messed that up
looks like all the dependencies match
the latest now so that's surprisingly
only upgraded these three I was thinking
we need to upgrade package Oh am I on
the server no I want to upgrade this guy
so this guy right here
Apolo link HTTP up to 1.1 so that's good
that was the important one so I'm all
upgraded now for running those two
commands and I'm gonna run yarn just to
make sure everything is installed okay
and then our tokens should be working
and our header object you'll notice is
always gonna be empty like that so I'm
just gonna refresh
if it's still not working like how mine
was if you just come back over to your
server
make sure the yarn is completely done
running just go ahead and stop it and
restart the server so if that get pulls
in the new packages and we should be
good now assuming we actually get a
token from the server and we can check
the network tab to see if we're supposed
to get a token or not yeah well let's
just refresh and then we'll just check
this tab right here okay so we didn't
get anything here in our network tab if
I type graph QL
or in our response we weren't actually
getting any headers notice how it's gone
so let's go back to our server and I'm
just gonna come over here to auth and
I'm gonna say this token set to one
second just so we can verify that this
is working so I'm gonna log in Bob at
Bob comm Bob Bob calm okay so this is
null so if i refresh and we finally see
something so notice how our headers is
empty that's why I wanted to console.log
the tokens down here for whatever reason
when I was doing this headers looks
empty but it's really not we actually do
have headers so you just have to call
headers dock it and it goes ahead and
grabs them so we don't need that anymore
it looks like it is working we get the
headers back so every time we refresh
it's gonna do new tokens and we could
actually just look here and watch as
they get reset so - e we see we just got
a new token so every time but if we were
gonna set we can come back here and set
this to one hour now if i refresh we
should get a new token but if i refresh
again we should not get a new token cool
cuz this token will last an hour awesome
so we're all fixed with that so now our
refreshing of JWT tokens is good and
we'll stay up-to-date on our data so
that's perfect so that's it for this
video guys the next video we'll continue
working on our direct message API or not
API but setting that up and getting the
component working let me know if you had
any trouble getting this set up I had a
lot of little tricky problems with the
permissions they're not the permissions
but getting this working getting the
headers the important bit is mapping and
making sure you upgrade your package you
want to make sure you go up to one point
so using the thing I used or upgrading
in every way so that's it for this video
guys thanks for watching I'll put all
this code on github
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
