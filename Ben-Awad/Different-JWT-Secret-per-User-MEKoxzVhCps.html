refresh tokens and in particular the
secret that you use to sign them so I'm
gonna show you how to keep a secret
per user now this is something that is
really useful because it allows you to
revoke the tokens for a particular user
now I've done this in the past where
I've kept a secret per user before based
on the password so I would take the
password and I would use that to sign
the Refresh token so whenever the user
would reset their password it would
automatically change the hash of the
password and so all the tokens that were
signed using the old password are
immediately invalidated so if I was
signed in on my phone and I reef changed
my password I would get signed out on my
phone even though I might have made that
change on my computer now in today's
video we're gonna be doing keeping a
secret per user in the database table
itself so right here you see I have a
refresh secret and I'm keeping a UUID
and the default value here or I will
populate this for us so we don't even
have to worry about it and the reason
why you might want to keep a secret here
in the table is because it allows you to
revoke at any time not just when the
user types in a password but let's say I
want to revoke the password or not
password revoke the secret or the tokens
when the user you know updates their
account or maybe their subscription has
the 30 days have run out and you want to
be able to just revoke that secret right
then and have the user get new basically
tokens or whatever so there's multiple
reasons of when you'd want to revoke a
token or maybe you get an email from me
user and they're like my account got
hacked you could just go into the
database change the secret for them and
they're safe now the other reason why
you might want to use this is with OAuth
so if yours if you use OAuth to login
for your website you don't have a
password for that user
right there logging into Facebook so you
would want to use this or else
there's no other way to revoke the
tokens if you're using the password
so let's look exactly how this works so
I'm getting storing the secret here and
it's getting auto populated and if I pop
over here to my index page this is where
I'm actually creating the tokens after
the user logs in so for example I'm
going to take you through how works so
first they're gonna go to F login which
is facebook login after they get logged
in and we create a user for them they
are gonna come to this callback URL now
when they come to this callback URL
we're gonna create a refresh token for
them and a regular token and you'll
notice over here what I'm doing is I'm
actually using the secret this is the
regular secret to sign this token and
the Refresh secret that I'm getting from
the user so this is the user from the
database right there so pretty nifty so
that's what we're using to create that
so if I come over here to create tokens
you'll notice I'm just using the secret
that I use secret to I'm using to sign
the Refresh token and the first secret
to sign the regular token so the Refresh
secret is used to sign that token right
there and so when I create the you know
when I'm creating the token for the
Facebook off I also want that to match
up when they do it for logging in with a
username and password so I'll show you
that as well but you'll notice how I'm
redirecting them to the front-end and
I'm also just passing the token and
refresh token so they have those and can
make the front-end can save that in
local storage so the adding user
I'm calling this function called refresh
token so let's look at that so we're not
refreshing tokens what I'm doing is on
making sure the Refresh token is valid
so first I decode the token and grabbing
the ID and then I'm just fetching that
user and now I have the user associated
with that Refresh token and I verify
that the token is all good and to do
that I'm using the refresh token a
refresh seeker right here that I
actually got from the user that I got
from the database
and then I'm creating the tokens and
again you'll see I'm calling that same
function I call up here create tokens
passing in the Refresh secret and the
Refresh secret here as well and this is
the one coming from the database and
then in try login when I am creating the
tokens again I'm also using refresh
secret so basically the I'm just passing
the secret that I'm using I'm storing in
the database right here whenever I
signed create the tokens so let's see
this in action so over here I'm gonna go
ahead and click well before I click
login Facebook I want to show you guys
the database so right now there's no
users in it I just select it all from my
users table I notice here's the Refresh
secrets token column that we created I'm
gonna go ahead and click log in with
Facebook we authenticate we come to this
page we can see our tokens up here I'm
also saving them in local storage and
I'm gonna go ahead and just select again
and we can notice here is our refresh
refresh secret so let's just see what's
going on with that if I come over here
to my application I can just copy this
secret or this token and of course this
is the invalid one invalid secret but if
I were to say copy and paste the Refresh
secret here it would be valid and bam so
you can see this token was created with
the secret right here so now whenever I
wanted to invalidate this token that
this user has I would just update the
secret in the database so BAM I just got
rid of a character
now it's invalid so anywhere in my
resolvers over here let's say you know
for whatever reason after I create a
book I would like to log the user out
basically well I just come over here I
say models dot user dot update and I
just set the refresh secret to a new UID
so and then you call your new whatever
function you used to create a new you ID
you just set a new one and automatically
they're logged out in the new secret so
if you had a logout resolver you could
do that too to log them out so that's
pretty neat so that's what I would
recommend if you're using OAuth is to
store the secret here or if you want
more you know like I said if you want to
be able to revoke the basically the
tokens of that user whenever you want to
it's more powerful to store this data
this and the database then just to use
the password as the secret but what I
like about the password and the reason
why I want to show that as well as
because hey it's one less column in your
database right you know one column is
not that much but it is a trade-off
so you're storing a little bit more data
in your database for this refresh secret
but with that you get more stuff you get
more flexibility and more power but if
you want to just use the password you
can but you're limited with what you can
do but you don't have an extra field in
your database so it's a trade-off more
often than not though I'd recommend
using the refresh secret here because
it's not that much extra space one
column is not that bad in a while being
able to revoke it whenever you want is
very powerful and very helpful so this
hose up on github thanks for watching
guys the link will be in the description
below and I'll see you in the next video
