creating some cards to show our options
I'm just gonna copy this and paste it
here and we're just going to basically
follow this example from native base to
create a card see what it looks like so
when we don't need that you're not like
that to me that all right
okay this is our stops we'll just see if
this renders and I'm just going to come
over here make few auctions our initial
page and the show that way we can just
keep filling with it
okay so we see a card so we want to see
so let's go back and boots what we'd
like to do is const auction we're going
to pass in the name of the auction and
then we're going to return some stuff so
the name of the auction um what else
let's go to our server real quick look
at the I just want to look at the model
fields so source models auctions Soaker
price so and close this up for this page
all right kara price expiration date
seller username expiration date seller
username and top it so these are the
attributes that we have and we didn't
want to return a card that represents
all that so for now we're going to call
this down here and for the name let's
just pass them in w data here my name is
going to be and you know what let's pass
and object here we can just be compose
it
and let's just grab something from
postman so we don't have to type this
all out so let post and launch here and
then we can just grab that all right
little push man's done the auctions can
copy this
all right top better will say all create
that we don't need ID you'll need these
are the fields that we want and we get
rid of this now just reread do this all
right it looks good and we don't need ID
either just need these five fields for
you yep okay so card header we should
probably put the name of the item then
we should put the current price
expiration date solar username top
bitter so how do we want to overlay the
card I kind of want see if there's cool
icons but we can use
I want like kind of a money icon
possibly three pubic current price of
this there a place I can look at all
these icons
and you put this good thing and then I'm
thinking who we have icons right so we
have an icon for this current price if
you probably have the expiration date um
a pretty actually I think like the price
the price an expiration date should be
the biggest thing and then like at the
bottom maybe we have text I say cellar
slow your name and then we have top
bitter have top bidder do it like that
so that looks like 10 top bitter maybe
we put like a grid to these are in
between have some big text here alright
downloaded so money there we go so
attached money so now we can go to icon
Castle to that icon render and put that
refresh
and in start recognizing it attached
money name see if there's another one
money off okay there's just money those
decent lat like oh
actors here not really showing what the
air is I'm not sure with the problems
filled prob another product names
expected one of okay so homework for
sure your home is showed in their
example to let's see if that renders
that shows up so varieties in this money
things not trying out so what do we do
see if it is maybe a dollar yeah so
dollar and USD we can try if we just try
icon until one of them works dollar nope
us d nope
dollar dollar bill I think I already
tried dollar dollar bill okay a lot of
these are not working there must be
something I'm doing wrong
okay would you see if we see one over
here we don't it's kind of weird see if
there's anything else at the dollar will
do at home is because homeworks iOS home
because these are sectioned think it's
probably under font awesome this home so
let's see if there's a font awesome
let's try user and see if either works
say what nope user does not work so
pontiff home so let's try heart okay
heart works so maybe this section of act
foundation apps it looks like it has so
you can put Bitcoin signs seems fine we
can just say you're silent auction app
is in Bitcoin sure why he's a bitcoin
bitcoin i spell wrong what does it
actually just not happen ha dollar bills
in this section to go figure just some
of them don't work randomly basically
all the ones that i need to work don't
work
one more icon at random that doesn't
work I'm going to scrap icon idea for
now so you want to look remotely like
money very trite money and i did search
for my coin bit coin bit coin via coin
bit coin circle sure we're going to try
bitcoin circle as I didn't work then
we're done we'll just pick some icon
player okay this is our about it all
right and the body here we'll just have
dollar sign grant price drop that with
text okay so we can blackberry for
dollar forty to the top fitter and let's
see can get header
like a big H one here ok so let's just
say style font size like 50 just want
like a big thing for the cash unexpected
token okay need ID do this twice
that's nice but why you getting cut off
these because we have i'm guessing me
because of the body up there you go that
looks nice blackberry dollar for you to
the current price and then we can have a
time and you know let's just have to go
and down cellar and then top bitter here
okay let's see how that looks seller top
bidder then we can have time underneath
here and the font will say is 20 I'll be
the expiration date and then like when
we actually make this we are going to
make it so it's um figure of the dollar
sign so it's taking down okay I looks
fine for now we can come back and change
this later and you can tweak it I just
want to see you now if I do multiple I
can do multiple of these hopefully and
now we just need to make this scrollable
so they have anything here have any
containers to the anatomy it's going to
look for scroll
content component uses school of you I'm
pretty sure we're using content here we
are so you should think we would scroll
automatically but we're not so let's
just do react native scroll view so
let's just get the scroll view from
react native they just shoulder and
porch full view lower heat up our case
and see what that looks like all right
that looks good I kind of scrolling the
wrong way so I'm wondering if content
was scrollable yeah it was i need to
scroll view huh all right so this looks
okay for now okay i want to tweak it
later but this is basically view i'm
going to use for the auctions so I'm
going to leave that for now in the next
video we'll start actually pulling the
data from the server so see you guys in
the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
