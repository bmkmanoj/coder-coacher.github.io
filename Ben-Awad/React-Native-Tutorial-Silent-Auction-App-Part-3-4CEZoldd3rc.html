to be fixing our decimal problem and
then we're also going to be looking into
adding the updated basically the top
bidder for our auction okay so it turns
out that you do decimal like this where
the first value is the number of digits
and here's the number to just pass the
decimal point ok so our decimal should
be good now now for our updating so for
our updating we're going to go into our
user model or we can say an auction real
quick we're going to have a top bidder
top bitter and that's going to be a
string and that's just going to be the
username of the top bidder and where
user model we're going to set up another
foreign key with auctions it doesn't set
of seller ID now it's going to be top
bitter ID so now we have two foreign
keys and I'm pretty sure you can do that
but if it calls in there we can always
remove it so now we're going to get we
actually have to add this top butter
because again that's something and allow
null we can set the true if because if
someone hasn't bid that's okay and now
we basically want to automatically set
the top bidder every time someone
doesn't update any update is greater
than the value of course so we're going
to do feathers generate hook so we're
going to create a hook for our update so
the hook is going to be and top bitter
this is going to be a before hook it's
going to be for auctions and this is
going to be for update and patch
option we're not really going to do full
update only really going to do patch so
we'll leave as patch for now okay so
let's created our hook so it can refresh
getting go into top bitter and we're
just going to do the same thing pretty
much of the last time when I say hook
top data dot top bitter is equal to hook
dot params user username and then we're
also new top bitter ID is equal to use
your name ID and then that should be
good so let's hop back to postman we
have over here and let's demonstrate
this but but actually we just change the
value of the database we actually need
to drop it first forgot about that so
again draw a silent auction create it
and get out of there now we can start
back up and we can go ahead and do this
alright so you can create a user Tim Bob
we can authenticate copula now we can
create an auction BlackBerry's 443 and
twenty cents and top better and talk
better idea or both null and that's
perfectly fine and if I come over here I
can get all of that and we notice how
the current price looks good that means
our decimal is working we still have a
top bitter because no one is a bid on
this item but if we come over here and
we patch this
and we're going to paste in 10 so now I
do say 160 oops 164 the current price
when we grab this the top bidder should
be Tim he's bidding on its own item okay
I notice how the top bidder is now 10 so
if i come pull this see top bitter
as 10 so awesome so now we know who the
top bidder is every time someone updates
doc but there's a small bug that we have
in this the way we're doing this and
that's say I put twenty dollars and I
push send oh look now the current price
is twenty dollars I was just able to
underbid her we need to set up basically
a gate that says your bid has to be more
than the current price or something we
could do is we could say if you're
bidding and the price goes above like
for example let's say if you have two
people bidding at the same time maybe
you have person a bids for twenty
dollars person B bids for fifteen
dollars person see bids for thirty
dollars and the current price of item is
would say ten dollars let's say a and B
bit at the same time these sentences
request then it's above to fifteen
dollars but then a comes in first and
his bid comes in and now twenty dollars
so then when becomes along on the tries
to bid on this item it is now is no
longer fifteen dollars he basically
should we cancel his bid because he
can't twenty dollars is more than is a
corrupted or another way we could do it
is we can say if the price moves by the
time you say bid you can then automatic
we like convert your bid to like $25
like five more than the current price
and maybe when we bid and actually like
this because this possible oxygen things
move fast is when your bid you're saying
I'll bid five dollars more than the
current price so no matter how much it
moves in the current price before the
server changes you can do that and okay
I actually kind of like that so I kind
of want to set up a new service so what
you can do is you can say I want to bid
five dollars more than the current price
so you could do that so in the next
video we're going to do is we're going
to set it up so you can when you bid you
can only bid more than the current price
and you're not having cases like this
all right so thank you guys for watching
I'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
