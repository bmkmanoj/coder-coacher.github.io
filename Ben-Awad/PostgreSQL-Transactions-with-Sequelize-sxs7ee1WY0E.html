code so we're going to fix some bugs and
also change something in our backend so
I want to go over the back and change
first now this is a mutation we're doing
a create team mutation where we want to
create a team then we're also creating a
channel for that team kind of as a
default channel their first one and
we're calling it a general channel but
there's a small problem with this what
happens if we create the team and then
our channel you know gets an error for
some reason then we'll have a team
without a channel and right now we're
expecting all our teams to have channels
so that's a problem so what we'd like to
happen is if our channel doesn't get
created we also don't want to make our
team we don't want our team to be
created so we want to throw an error and
we want to throw the air and have
neither of these created if channel
can't be created now the way we do this
is by creating a sequel eyes transaction
so the way we do that we'll a database
transaction or Postgres transaction and
you do that with sequel eyes by calling
sequel eyes dot transaction and then
we're going to put a function in there
and then we're gonna have the body of
whatever you want to do whatever we want
to create so we're going to say models
dots equalise dot transaction and then
we're gonna have in here a function I'm
gonna create a async function and then
we're to put these guys in here and now
we're just gonna return team so now up
here I'm gonna say cons response is
equal await that guy and their team is
just going to be the response so now
it's gonna happen is we create a
transaction and if there's any error
whether our channel doesn't create or a
team doesn't create neither will be
created and will catch will go to our
heirs otherwise we'll create a team
we'll create a channel and then we'll
return the team to our response right
here and a response we're waiting it
when that's done we'll return the team
which we get from that
so our transaction returns whatever we
were
inside this function so we're gonna grab
the team and put there so now we're
covered if our channel doesn't create we
don't have just some random team in our
database that doesn't have a channel
cool so now let's go back to the
front-end so I talked about some errors
that we were getting here's one of the
possible errors that we're getting I'm
over here at view team and this is when
I'm not logged in so I have no tokens
here so when this happens
I'd like to redirect them to the login
page and this is a really quick fix I
just need to make this a private route
instead of just a regular route so we
made it a regular route when we were
just working on the view and wanted to
change what it looked like so now we get
redirected to login perfect so now I can
log into this and I can head over here
to view team and it should work okay
awesome
but there's more problems so what
happens if I'm this user right here
actually you know it let's create a new
user real quick I create a new user and
we'll call this 17
and I want to come over here I'm gonna
log in with this user and I want to come
over here to view team and check out my
teams oh whoa error the reason for that
is we don't have any teams right we just
created our first team or we haven't
created our first team yet so what we
want to do is in our view team over here
is we just want to check if all teams is
empty so if not all teams dot length we
know the user hasn't created any teams
so what we want to do is we just want to
redirect them to the create team page so
they can do that so we're just gonna
return a redirect and we're going to
take them to create team and now
redirect that's coming from react router
so we're import that from react router
okay so now let's give that a try now
I'm coming over to view team with my guy
and we get redirected if you didn't see
that we can do that one more time I'm
having an over here to view team and we
just get scooted right over here to
create a team first so perfect so that
area is covered now we're kind of
assuming right now that the team ID and
the channel ID are good ones and what I
mean by that is I can cause some
shenanigans here by putting I don't know
hahahaha and coming in here so there's
nothing that says I'll here let's create
a team first team one and now we oh I
think we just broke view team no you
team is good
it didn't redirect though did you guys
see that after I created the team so
let's do team two
okay looks good well we'll check that at
the end we'll come back to that so if I
put up here a bad thing in our route
here we're mapping the team ID but
nowhere do we say the team ID has to be
an integer and we can't really tell
react router we expect an integer we
have to handle all types so if I put
this in here my team ID is gonna be
hahahahaha and we're gonna get an error
right because hahahahah is not an
integer so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say team ID integer it's really
gonna be we're gonna say we're gonna say
it's equal to negative one and I'm gonna
say try actually I don't actually know
how to handle this so I don't know how
node we're gonna pop over here and type
node
I don't know how parse int works if it's
not so if I put hahahaha I don't know if
it's undefined okay not a number and
let's see if that evaluates to true or
false okay that evaluates to false so
come back over here so we don't need to
have a try-catch all we have to say is
we're gonna parse int and we're gonna do
that for the team ID
so team ID integer and if not team ID
integer all we're gonna do is we're
going to redirect redirect to view team
so we're gonna just redirect them oops
what I mess up oh forgot to close the
tag so we're just here we're just gonna
redirect them back to view team which
they'll have no team ID now we have to
kind of you know
be wary of this because this causes a
new problem right if we just redirect
back to view team getting rid of the
hahahahaha the team ID is still going to
be undefined it's not gonna work so
really what we need to do is check the
team ID here so which we are so we
should really pass check the integer we
don't even have to use this so team ID
integer and otherwise we grab the zero
so that's good so grab the first team
but there's another possible actually
there's not a problem I was gonna say
there's we don't have to grab this
anymore we don't have to parse it here
so team ID integer and we want to do the
same thing with our Channel
so channel ID integer so now we're gonna
do a move our channel ID up here channel
ID okay so if we can't parse it to an
integer we know they gave us something
bad or maybe it's blank and so we'll
just default to zero and that works so
now if I put hahaha
we'll just default to 0 over there and
said I was thinking about doing a
redirect and fixing the URL but because
it would be nice to like get rid of that
right so if I put hahaha I want to
change that to now look like this
so hahaha and then we can do
bla bla bla bla right alright so now
we're covered nothing breaks I can
create a new channel and I can change to
it everything's good and then when we
click on these it's good right so one
way we could you know fix these is yeah
I don't want to do it I think it's fine
I think it's fine to display like this
even if they give us a bad URL here cuz
we just default and as soon as they
click something it fixes it up here okay
so now we're handling that and there's
one last thing I wanted to handle and
that's if we don't have any channels now
ideally we should have channels but
there could be a for some reason our
channel does not exist so right here
you're just gonna say
channel and so if we don't have a
channel for whatever reason that will
not display so if you've never seen this
syntax before what I'm doing is I'm
saying channel has to exist and if it
exists then show this it's kind of
shorthand for doing this if you've seen
the ternary operators where you display
this if channel is true otherwise you
show no and that's kind of shorthand so
we're saying if this is false though
then we don't get to this part of the
other side of the boolean statement so
we never get here so this does not
evaluate to true or false what it will
do is evaluate header or I'll show
nothing so we notice stuff is still
rendering now I want to go back to that
one air we saw because that was kind of
interesting that was our create team so
if I create a new user called sky 18 and
I come over here to view team we get
redirected that's cool oh I didn't login
yet
all right so we should get redirected to
create team good so now when I created a
team last time it went to view team and
then it redirected me back here so I'll
show you that so if I go to if I create
the team ABC watch the URL up here when
I hit submit oh my not logged in okay
that's not what I was expecting to
happen let's login again the login work
ok I don't know what this post message
cannot read properly see oh did we break
our back-end so ok can't read properties
sequel eyes have undefined duplicate key
I don't know ok we're getting a rollback
I actually don't know what just happened
so let's come back to I think I maybe
just cuz I pushed it once I'm not sure
what just happened I want to create a
totally new user so I'm gonna call this
guy Bob 19 and let's see if the same
exact thing happens so I submit register
okay nothing weird happens now I go to
login login with 19 we don't get that
weird hook thing here I'm gonna go to
view team we should redirected now I'm
gonna make the team ABC again oh that's
right we don't we're not catching this
because there's already a team called
ABC or getting an error so we're not
handling that so we should handle that
as well
basically we're saying the team name has
to be unique so if we come over to you
to our database team so yeah we have the
name unique because we already have in
our database let's check to make sure PC
cool
however slack select all from teams okay
since we already have a team called ABC
we can't create another team called ABC
but that's not the problem
let's let the problem we need to fix
eventually is just a show and air to the
user here but let's create another one
okay
that seems to be working okay now why
thought I thought it redirected but we
do need to like show the air to the user
so in our front end right now you saw
how I got redirected to login so let's
let's just see that again so ABC I get
redirected to login the reason for that
is in our code for this so create team
we said we caught any errors right here
so we put a try-catch somewhere and yeah
here it is
so any errors that we get we then pass
to login ID like undefined error we
should be just passing the air back so
we're getting a roll back which we
expect right because when we create the
team it fails we get a validation error
we put this in a try-catch though so I
thought we should go to this and return
an error here we should get our errors
should come here not here I'm not sure
why it's coming there cannot be properly
equalized of undefined
oh here so for my errors that's our
problem so for my errors we need to pass
in
the model so see how we have air in the
model air pass in models so now I think
we should get an error message when we
do create team so ABC nope we still Oh
No oh this is an ADD team member okay so
I was doing this wrong multiple places
here's our create team so models so
let's see all the places where I'm
calling for Matt Aires and make sure I
am passing it in correctly nope I'm not
passing it in correctly here either
there's models we do use models there
and then our user we're passing in there
cool so now let's see if we get an error
message
we don't cannot return null for
non-noble field so let's look at what we
did with our schema so great team we're
doing create team response team this
should be null because sometimes we
can't return a team if there's heirs so
we're gonna make team nullable now all
right let's try it again
ABC awesome so name must be unique so we
could probably make a better error
message saying the team has already been
made but there we go we get our error
now so now I have to do a different name
and cool rate we'll come in here and
create our team awesome so we got a lot
of errors out of the way there
so our app is now more robust and
handling anything users try to throw at
us which is good so that is it for this
video guys thanks for watching I'm gonna
be putting this code on github so you
can check it out and play with it
and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
