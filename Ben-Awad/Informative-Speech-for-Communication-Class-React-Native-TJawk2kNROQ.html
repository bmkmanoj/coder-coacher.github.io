speech for my communications class and I
did it over react native and I thought
you guys might be interested so here it
is without further ado this is my speech
for comms class your company is probably
wasting time and money developing mobile
applications most companies are doing
one of two things which I really really
dislike the first is they're having an
Android team and an iOS team because
there's two platforms they you can't
just write code once and it works for
both Android they have Java they have to
use that programming language to build
apps to go on those phones and then you
have iOS over here and you have to use
Swift or objective-c to create apps to
go on iPhones which is really
unfortunate for app developers because
if they want to support both because
it's a lot of people have iPhones a lot
of people have Android they're basically
gonna have to write the application
twice one in Java one in Swift and
that's how a lot of companies are doing
it and it really sucks because they're
wasting a ton of money in ton of time
because they're doing it twice because
if you've noticed look at Facebook SAP
snapchats app it's almost identical
across Android and iOS they're making
the same app twice just coding it
differently I'm using the two different
languages because they want to be
universal they want every user to have
the same experience for their brand
which it's unfortunate they just have to
build it twice and that's one
unfortunate case another unfortunate
case that happens is you just are not
able to support one or the other for
example some companies don't have the
funds to basically pay for two teams so
the only support Android and iOS can't
can't use their app or iPhone users
don't get supported or maybe they're
only creating iOS and then the Android
population doesn't get to use the app
which is super unfortunate but this
doesn't have to be the case and here's
the thing Facebook just came out with a
framework called react native which is
huge because what it allows you to do is
make apps
one time and deployed both Android and
iOS so I don't have to have two code
bases doing the same thing and basically
wasting two teams of developers their
time and money going both ways and you
want the same thing
now you can write it once in JavaScript
using react native which is huge now
there's this other really nice advantage
of using javascript is it's used for
websites as well so what you can do is
share the code you're using for your
website along with your mobile app
because a lot of times with companies
your app and your website are doing
similar things so you don't have to
write it twice so that saves you time
and money which is really important as
well so there's multiple places that's
saving you and for example right now I'm
building a website and I'm using
javascript to use it so I want to create
the app as well so I have a website and
an app for this and now because of react
native I don't have to wait like a year
to redevelop the whole thing using
either Java or Swift and deploy it to
one platform I now in the next month
using the code I already have I can use
that and repurpose it with react native
to also work on phones which saves me
from doing the same thing twice which is
really really nice so I highly recommend
if you haven't checked out react native
you give it a try this is awesome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
