emulator and I noticed a few differences
that I wanted to fix the first is there
appears no border at the bottom of the
text and also you'll notice it looks
like it's meshing in to the top the
little scroll the same the menu at the
top so we're gonna push it down a little
bit so it doesn't conflict but first
this border so how I think I wanna deal
with that is we got the border to show
up here and we just added that to the
touchable opacity which we also have
here because we want to be able to click
them something would just move the
border style to the touchable opacity
for that so what I'm going to do is just
create another style here that takes the
border style that we want which is these
two right here so I'm gonna create a new
one called bottom border and we're just
gonna copy those two styles and move
them here and so that shouldn't we just
need anything different here for now
because we have a need to add it to our
touchable opacity so add our style and
when you say styles dot bottom border
and I'm just gonna add it to the first
two I don't think the last one needs it
since it's right up against the edge
here anyway okay nice so now we see this
little split that we have in the Android
one two and this should work on the
Android app as well since we are using
the same thing for buttons in the button
show up in the Android now this
conflicting up here it looks okay on
Android so I don't really want to just
change padding top is what we're using
what I really want is something for
example this is iOS so it looks like
it's a thicker menu I want it to look
differently on iOS and Android and there
is a way to do that on react native
there's a package called
this comes from react native called
platformer and in the platform we can
specify or I'll tell us what the OS is
so if I say platformer OS this is either
going to be equal to iOS or Android
depending what they are so I can say iOS
so if it's iOS maybe we do 30 otherwise
we do 20 pixels to push it down so we
notice that looks a little bit better
maybe like two more it looks like it's
bashing the top a little bit that looks
pretty good I'm not really sure if I
went up against the edge or not this is
the iPhone 5 I'm thinking this looks
pretty good maybe I want it up against
right about the edge not really sure
what's what other apps look like an
iPhone X I'm going to leave this for now
we might change that in the future but
you can use this to target specific code
if you want only to run on iOS only to
run on Android now I'm pretty happy with
how the app is looking so I kinda want
to get feedback from you guys what if
you want to see anything else features
add to the calculator I'm happy with it
now I'm gonna be using this as my new
calculator because I prefer this over
regular calculators I was thinking
adding one thing as an undo button so
let me know if you're interested and
adding seen one undo button looks like
and maybe a lot a couple if we end up at
doing that so we add another row or if
there's anything else and particularly
like to see add to the calculator I'd be
happy to do a couple features add them
on so you guys can see how to implement
some different stuff otherwise I'm
excited to actually release this guy on
the App Store that's what I want to do
next unless there's anything you guys
want to see added to this so first is
deploying this to the expo store so if
you don't know what that is you know how
we've been using Expo to run our app as
we are the debugging right so I can run
the thing and open up the next blap they
actually have a store online or you can
download other apps and
use them and then we're gonna deploy it
to Android and iOS store so you can now
download it on your phone if you want to
so I'll show you guys how to take it all
the way from developing and putting it
on the store that's it for this video
guys let me know what suggestions you
have I'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
