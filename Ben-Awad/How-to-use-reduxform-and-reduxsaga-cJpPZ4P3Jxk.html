be showing you how to use two redux
libraries the first is redux form which
allows you to make forms and redux very
easily and it also allows for making
more complicated forms that use
air-handling
and other features the second ireon I
talk about is redux saga which goes
about making API calls easily this
allows us to make asynchronous calls to
an API or in the background and not
pause the screen while it's loading or
whatnot and then get data from the API
and then update the state of our
application if that doesn't make sense
stay tuned I'll explain how Redux saga
works in detail when we get there but I
want to show you the application that
we're gonna make to basically demo out
those two libraries so we're gonna make
a weather application where you type in
the location that you would like to get
the weather for so I'd like to get the
weather for New York and then you type
in enter or hit the submit button and
it'll go fetch whether from Yahoo and
then it will spit out a little diagram
here and close the console for you guys
let's put a little thing right here
telling you what the weather is in New
York in the forecast this stuff right
here is coming directly from Yahoo I
don't touch it they give you the HTML so
it's lovely but it's good for the little
sample what we're doing now using Redux
form I was able to submit this form pass
the data through we also have a little
bit of error handling so for example if
I don't type anything
oh look location required I have to type
the location and I can't just leave it
blank I can try to submit and nothing's
happening on the other things I just
have put in gibberish pure gibberish it
says no data for that location it'll
actually go do a API request to Yahoo
weather and they get snow data and then
it spits out this air for us so that's
all using redux form and then actual API
call is with Redux saga so that's what
our application is going to be doing
let's get into configuring it real quick
or setting now so if you just open up a
terminal prompt
we're going to be first thing we're
gonna do is get cloning a repository
that I have it's just some boilerplate
react Redux code that has stuff set up
that makes it faster to code so I'll put
a link in the description below and this
is the link right here and you're just
gonna clone it irate cloned it so I'm
not gonna clone it here once you clone
it we're just gonna CD into that folder
and then the first thing I want to do is
install the dependencies with NPM
install again I re have them installed
so I'm not going to and then there's two
more things we need to install redux
form and super-agent so this should do
npm install and then save these guys
after to do that we are good with the
setup in the next video we're going to
be making the form for the application
you just saw</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
