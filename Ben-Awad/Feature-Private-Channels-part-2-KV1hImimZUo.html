private channels but we're not locking
them down so what do I mean by that
right now I am logged in as Bob and over
here I have Bob 3 so I'm gonna create a
new channel it's gonna be a private
channel and I'm gonna say my private
channel and over here I'm only gonna
invite Bob 1 and Bob - so Bob 3 did not
get invited and I'm gonna create this
channel I see my private channel here
awesome and I'm able to join it I can
say hey guys and I can send messages now
it didn't pop up over here because we're
not using WebSockets for creating
channels but if I were to refresh this
is Bob 3 I can now see this private
channel and see the messages for it but
I was not invited to it so we need to
stop that from happening so the way
we're gonna do this is now in our
channels we're not just grabbing all the
channels for our team we need to grab
the ones that are just private there
sorry just public or the private ones
that you're a part of so this is an art
team j/s and our resolvers on our server
and under the team type how we're
fetching the channels is we're finding
all the channels where the team ID is
equal to the ID that we want but we
should keep that part but also check if
it's public so public is true right but
we also need an or condition because
public or I'm a part of it because if I
just do public is true I'm not gonna see
my private channel now at least on the
sidebar and I just saw all my channels
go away
and come over here okay so now it
doesn't fetch any channels or is it just
show general okay so now how are you
doing it by public I'm just going to
check our database so slack select all
from channel okay apparently random on
all these I created it were private so
okay good so we can't see those anymore
but I should be able to see my private
channel if I am this guy if I am Bob so
how I'm gonna do that is I'm going to do
in or here and if we come on over here
to direct messages we saw we did seek
wise or like this so we're gonna copy it
like so and what I want to or this with
is your public or your part of this list
over here and I think this will be the
easiest to write if we just do a regular
query and here's how I want to do this
so I'll show you guys the query I want
run so from users okay so my user ID for
Bob for example is one so I want to
select let me move this up connect slack
I want to select all from channels where
the we're gonna search by team ID of
course too but also public is equal to
true or and we're gonna join this with
our PC members members and we'll use
aliases so as see
as PC and will say PC dot user ID is
equal to my user ID so about one is
equal to one so or that and our channel
is equal to channel ID is equal to PC
dot channel ID so let's run this query
and this should be channels ok so what
do we get now we get general a bunch of
times which we don't want so user ID
each time so we definitely want to do
unique on ID
and I mean deduce distinct so now we're
getting general on this random channel I
made in my private channel which is what
we want so we're basically checking
whether it's public so that's how we got
general and we got these two channels by
checking whether we're a member of it by
checking the private our members table
and making sure both of these conditions
are true so let's copy this query that
we wrote and that's what we want to run
right here instead of the channels so
we're going to say models let's equalize
dot query and we'll just make a raw
query for this and I'm gonna drop it
down to multiple lines so this is easier
to read and here's our from clause
here's our where clause so now here we
also want to do team ID is equal to
whatever whatever the ID of the parent
is
so now we need to pass in variables and
I'm gonna like that so I think we've
done queries like this before here we go
and the replacements we're gonna do it
just like this here we're using named
replacements where we used colon and
then the name so we're gonna do it just
like that so this is going to be team ID
this is gonna be user ID and that's we
only need two of them I think and so
here we will do our options and we're
gonna say replacements so our team ID is
equal to ID this is the parent ID which
is the team we're currently and then
user ID is equal to user to ID and we're
getting the user from our context so
comma user and the model for this is
gonna be models dot channel and we want
to make this raw and we'll do a comma
here so I'll give that a save and let's
see if that works better for our query
so come over here refresh and we crashed
it so let's see what we're doing wrong
nothing seems wrong over here I'm just
gonna refresh maybe a server was still
restarting nope all right so let's see
what's going on it has to be something
on the server side because that's all we
changed so I'm gonna do network tab
refresh and now we'll see what we get
returned from the server so filter by
graph QL syntax error near public
locations
and I just forgot to do an and so we
want to find that the channels only
consider channels where the team ID is
equal to the team ID and this team ID is
channel that team ID and channel dot
public and I'm gonna wrap this whole
thing so where the IDs match up are the
only ones we consider and then we filter
down those channels by picking the ones
that are public or the ones that we are
a member of by checking this PC members
that we have so let's see that again
oops I accidentally clicked on their
message and cool now we see our private
channels now hopefully when I come over
here we refresh I don't see my private
channel perfect now I'm gonna try
logging in as Bob - oops Bob - at Bob
calm and I should see my private channel
and sure enough hey Bob - shows up
perfect so now we are filtering so only
the people we want to be able to see our
private channel can see it now there's
one thing I want to change on the server
side - and that's with our messages over
here so we're letting anyone see our
messages that are authenticated which
really shouldn't be the case you should
only be able to see the messages if you
are a part of the private channel so
we are going to move this query in here
and do a little bit of checking so the
first thing you want to do is check if
the channel is public so we're gonna say
Const Channel is equal to a weight
models dot channel dot find one and this
is we're gonna say bra is true
and we're also gonna say we're in here
we're gonna say ID is equal to channel
ID so we're first going to and I have
one too many parentheses there we go
okay lets you know get make sure these
line up you need to put that here I
think there we go
okay so all the parentheses line up now
so we're first grabbing a channel and
I'm gonna say if channel is public we
don't have to do anything so we only
need to check if it's not public
and here we're gonna say if it's not
public we then need to check our PC
members to see if you are a member so
comma user and we're gonna say Const
membership we're gonna try to find one
and remember we'll say oh wait models
dot PC member dot find one row is true
and then we're and then here we're just
going to say channel ID is equal to our
channel ID and then we can also check
the user ID which is going to be user
diet E and then we're gonna say if not
user or not member meaning we couldn't
find a member we're just gonna throw new
member or sorry throw new air and we'll
just say not authorized so I'm fine just
throwing an error like this this is
cryptic but we don't expect any users to
try to access a channel the messages for
the channel that are private right
because they can't even see it like Bob
through you can't even see my private
channel anymore so he would have to do
something fishy trying to access the
messages for a private channel so I'm
fine just throwing new air and not
authorized to him if he tries to access
this when he's not a member so now good
so now we have guarded our messages to
make sure that you can't grab messages
of private channels unless you are a
member of it now let's make sure we
didn't actually break this if i refresh
I should be able to see my private
channel still hopefully and looks like
we've broke it
let's see what's going on with that so
graph QL cannot return null
and that's because we just forgot to put
our return statement here alright and we
just did not refresh or let the server
refresh and quote so I could still see
it let's make sure Bob - over here can
still see it perfect but now if Bob 3
for example made a post request to our
server trying to access these messages
he would not be able to because we tell
him he is not a member so cool I think
this is good for our private channels
what we're going to be doing next is
trying to refactor how we do direct
messages because we can pretty much
treat me messaging Bob as a private
channel or were the only two members are
part of it and then this also leaves it
to very easily doing group direct
messaging because group direct messaging
is literally just a private channel
again so that's it for this video guys
thanks for watching and as always I'll
push this code up to github
