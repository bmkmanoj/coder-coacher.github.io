of doing authentication with the JWT
tokens and cookies now my two goals here
with this is to make a super simple
system and the reason for that is when
you add more complexity it just adds
more corner cases and bugs that can pop
up and especially with security
that's not a great thing so I wanted to
create it as simple as possible not a
lot of extra things going on and two
second goal with this is whenever I'm
doing a request I'd like not to have to
fetch that user to see if they have the
right permissions what I'd like to do is
store the permissions and the JWT token
so it saves me one database call now
this might be a goal that can't get met
but I'd like to try so keep that in mind
when I go through this those are the two
goals that I'm kind of trying to achieve
with this setup so here we have the
client here we have the server now the
first time you'll get a JWT token is
when the client passes in an email and
password so this will authenticate on
the server if they put in the right
email and password what we will do is
two things
first create a JWT token and then we
will also store that JWT token in a
database table so we're gonna be
creating a table it's just like a big
list of all the valid JWT tokens so
whenever they log in we're creating the
token putting that in the table and then
giving them the token back and then that
token will be stored in the cookies also
good to note this cookies gonna be HTTP
only and all that stuff so it's secure
the other thing is we're gonna want to
store something like any type of
permission that we want so maybe if
they're an admin or if they need
specific rights that sort of thing we're
gonna put in the token so then whenever
the client makes a request this is
what's going to happen so they make a
request to the server we're gonna come
down here these are the steps that are
going to happen
so the first is we're gonna check if the
JWT token is valid now by that I mean
we're gonna check we're gonna decode the
token and validate it using a JSON web
token library and just make sure the
right secret was made and the token is
not expired so the encryption is good
and it hasn't expired yet if that's the
case we know we have just been given a
valid GWT token I'm gonna make sure this
JWT token is in our database table that
we created up here remember how we said
we added a token when they logged in we
want to make sure the token is there and
it has been revoked or deleted for some
reason and I'll go over in a second
while we might delete a token from that
table but we make sure so we'll make one
database call here where we'll just
check and make sure the token exists
it's there in the table if these two are
permissions you know check out then
we're cool we have we can trust the
token basically and then right here what
we're gonna do is we're gonna look at
the contents the body of the token and
check if they're an admin and if there
are an admin we can then fetch the data
correctly now it might not be any kind
of like permission I wanna check inside
the token would be the last check we
would do and then if any of these fail
before you just say hey this failed or
whatever so go through these checks
every time it makes a request so with
this you will be doing one extra check
here against the table but the reason
why this is important is sometimes a JWT
token will go stale and so the cases for
that is for example let's say I didn't
start as an admin but let's say I became
an admin then you need to make sure to
update the JWT token so whenever we like
update the value of the user we don't
want the token to go bad so what we do
is we issue a new token and then we
invalidate the old one and we invalidate
the old one by deleting it from the
table and then for example if someone
resets their password you might want to
delete any tokens associated with their
account that sort of thing
so it's good to have a table where you
can kind of revoke access to any token
that you want so that's why I have that
check going there and yeah that's pretty
much it so as I said this is a pretty
basic set up but that's how would work
each request we do these three checks
and then if they all check out we give
the data back to them and now we're not
always gonna be checking for permissions
right if some endpoints don't need to be
admins or whatever this is only happens
if we want that import in point or this
is on I'm gonna be using for graph QL
but if you're doing rest to endpoint or
you know the query or mutation that
you're gonna run if that permission
needs to be checked they will check it
here but yeah let me know what you guys
think of this set up if you think it's
good what you would recommend changing
if anything I'm gonna go over in
tomorrow's video I'm gonna go over like
a few different ways how you can tweak
this to get different things maybe you
want to do seek a new secret per user
maybe you want to store the JWT
tokens in the table slightly differently
there's a few different you want to use
a refresh token like there's lots of
different variations that you can do
based on this so I'm gonna go over a few
that I thought I was thinking about
trying out tomorrow what I think about
those yeah let me know what you think of
this the current set up and I'm gonna
implement one of these guys very soon so
yeah thanks for watching guys and I'll
see in the next video
