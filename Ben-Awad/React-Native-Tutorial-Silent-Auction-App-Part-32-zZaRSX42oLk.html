we're going to be fixing a big bug eyes
didn't persisting that I wasn't sure why
was happening bitten basically all our
forms and what the bug looks like so
notice when I click here once the button
responds right away but here I am type
in a field and I try to click the button
I just tried to click there and it
didn't work after click on it twice and
again I do here click double twice and
so I found out what was causing this and
it's really simple and we could just
remove it we don't even need it so the
problem here is we have this content
thing here what content is it's
basically just a scroll view and a
scroll view basically lets you scroll
past your content if it overflows the
page and we don't actually need that and
getting rid of just that from the signup
page for example will remove that
problem so now click Auto works
click here works click here works click
here works of course we have to pay user
here but as you can see the button
itself is working and that's what counts
so this thing is I just click on it
didn't work you need to fix for the
login as well and it's literally just
this content thing that's causing it and
then we add another form or Auctions
form page you can remove content from
that as well and let's just tab it over
so it's all aligned so it's nicely
oh the login page I think yeah ok close
the problem and now it's all good to go
refresh can login now click in the
button works automatically and I think
those all the places that we had forms
is causing it yeah
ok so we're good now
the problem is solved and now you don't
double click so it was just a little
thing causing it and that's all for this
video I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
