going over how this silent auction app
works so it's made with react native and
I'm using a lot of different libraries
so I kind of wanna just take this time
to show you how it's architected walk
you through how all these different
libraries are talking with each other so
it makes a little bit more sense how
they're working so this thing works and
this is actually a video suggested by
someone in the comments and if you're
also interested and seeing me make a
video I recommend in the description
below I'll put a link to my Trello or
basically I have all the videos and
suggestions for projects I'm going to be
doing and you can add them vote on them
and see what I'm going to be doing next
so if there's something you'd like to
see you can put it there so I have the
code up right here and before we
actually jump into the code I talked
about how this works and side note too I
increase my font size so let me know if
this is too big feels a slightly big for
me but it might be just right for you
guys so let me know if this is a better
font size or if I can go even bigger or
if this is too big before I jump into
the code and talk start talking about
this I want to just make sure you guys
understand just the basics so right now
we have a server set up the server and
I'm mostly going to be talking about the
signup page because that works for most
of the pages so what we'd like to do in
the sign up page is to create a user and
to create a user what we need to do is
we need to do make a post request to
this URL passing in data now the data
here is going to be a variable data
depending on what the user passes in
with that form so for example I can make
a post request to create users but
basically what I want is my app is to
make make a post request to this URL
passing in the data that that user puts
in from the form and then it grabs this
data back and it says oh this is
successful request we're good to go
for example when I do an empty request
I'll just with an old house hoping it
would air out so I could test say
assuming this did air out which it
doesn't maybe if I do a non-unique
password the no air out there so now we
get an air and for example when I gets
an air we come back and we show an air
so we need some way inter-app to make a
post request be able to handle whatever
is given back to us and then update the
view and the app so I just that's that's
what we the goal that's what we want to
do as why we use some of the libraries
that I'm about to talk about so this is
the structure of the app so this is the
whole app it's wrapped in the provider
and a provider tag which basically
allows you to look at the Redux store
which basically is just a bunch of data
of how your UI that you use for your UI
and lets you update the store in your
different components so I just want to
talk about real quick also how our store
is set up so if I come over here to the
store I'm passing it as I'm passing it
into the provider so that the store that
we're creating can be used by all our
routes so if I come in the store you'll
notice that we're adding saga middleware
what is talking about aware saga
middleware is used for reading saga and
what this is doing is how do i trigger
on a post request so one way to mate do
post requests and if we come over here
the way you do post requests is of
course just like this I'm doing we're
using feathers client which makes a post
request in the background and basically
we are you doing redux saga to be able
to make a post request like we are right
here so this is async code for making
the post request so we
for example we don't have to use redux
Agha we can just put in our view but
that's kind of bad form and what this
allows us to do is separate everything
and now we have redux saga which runs in
the background it creates a background
head that runs this and we can get the
return value so we're calling sign up we
get the return value and then we can
call stop submit is actually an action
for Redux so we can then update the
state from here very easily so that's
the reason why we're using Redux saga
but the reason why react saga is
actually triggered when actions are
fired so if you're familiar with Redux
you fire actions stuff UI but you can
also and you know launch actions to
trigger Redux saga and that's how it's
working here so whenever we do requests
sign up action we dispatch that it comes
to this saga and it runs this code and
it makes the post request and then takes
the response and updates our Redux store
which then updates the UI so to be able
to listen for actions what we need to do
is we need to add in our store here as
middleware and we just add do apply
middleware on this saga middleware and
that allows us we're now listening for
every time an action is made we're
listening and checking if that action
matches request sign up to make the sign
up or it would go to something else um
so that's what this fork this fancy
looking thing right here all this is
doing is its forking off to start
listening for these okay so we're
creating a store right here that's going
to be used to store data and we're also
listening for events for saga middleware
with saga middleware which allows this
to make post requests so back to this
guy so we set up our store we connected
with Redux saga and what is this routes
this routes is a component which we
created that's in the routes folder so
if I come to the routes folder I can go
to the index and that is what's being
imported
and we're actually using the AG native
router flux this is my library using for
routing and basically what routing is an
app is basically allows you to switch
screens so for example I want to have a
sign up and login screen how do I switch
between the two that's what this is
handling so basically I make a scene for
each one of the pages that I want and
then I say what component I would like
to render when I have this page and then
I can use this library to switch pages
this library is pretty simple and I'm
not going to get too much into it
because that's basically all there is to
it
you create a scene for each one and then
whenever you want to switch you just say
which scene you want to go to and it
transitions it's pretty it's pretty
basic so past that we'll just get into
what's happening with each component so
you'll notice with the component I have
all this junk what does this connect to
doing because we're doing stuff here
that looks like a regular component we
have this here that's a little bit fancy
not fancy but weird I suppose because
it's not just looking it's not a regular
component so we actually import this
component when we're using in other
functions and it's this connect thing
and what connect is doing is I would
like to call the action request sign up
from my view so when the user coming
back to the app clicks this what I would
like to do you saw that we created a
saga which then makes a post request
right so we only want to you know call
that saga when the user clicks this
button
so basically when the user clicks button
we'd like to dispatch the action which
launches out and triggers the Sagra so
that the action that does that is called
a quest sign up now coming over here
modules user actions Redux actions is
basically something it just makes making
actions easier so when I do requests
sign up
this is equivalent basically this is
just making a function here that's a
list so when I call create a request
sign up so I'm going to call like this
request sign up and then I can pass data
to it usually I'll pass as an object so
I can say username I and then dealer
stuff right and this what this is going
to do is it's actually just going to
return an object with the type request
sign up and then payload whatever this
pram is that's what this is returning
and pram is what this thing is
that's all create action does just
boilerplate reduces boilerplate it's
equivalent to basically making a
function that looks like this this is
basically the equivalent of these two so
it takes whatever you pass into the
request sign up function tax on a type
of request sign up and it passes that in
the action basically all it's returning
is an object right so coming back over
here we would like to call that action
oops I want to come back letting this
they sign up index page okay so I would
like to call this function but when I
call this function all it's returning is
an object right what I really want to
happen is I want to call get the object
and then dispatch it so Redux can then
handle this action so that's what bind
action Creators does here notice I'm
calling this map dispatch the props
that's basically allowing us to access
this function inside our view so our
view is access to this function because
we're using the connect and they've
connect implements this our adds this
function we're using this function here
and we're using bind action creators
which says whenever I call this function
inside a view it will automatically
dispatch it for me which is really nice
and that's why I like using this so I
just call it my view and it
automatically
because it goes and does its thing so
looking at the view here it's connected
so when I submit and I call request sign
up takes this parameter here and adds it
the calls that function I was talking
about returns an object and then
dispatches it to Redux Redux then looks
at it and then it's past Redux saga and
Redux saga then makes the post request
and does stuff and updates the UI so
that's how that's working and really the
last piece that I want to talk about is
redux form now this guy can be a little
confusing for if it's your first time
working with it so what this does is it
makes basically forms a lot easier to
create and more robust as well so what
it does is when you type in a value it
actually stores what the user is typing
in the Redux store so when I'm typing
here you know and I type my email my
password and stuff all these values are
actually in the Redux store and we can
access those and we can do different
stuff with that
and it's just a nice way to handle it
now to set up Redux form what we needed
to do is how does it know you know when
I type these things we're not actually
dispatching actions ourselves how is
this getting put into the Redux store
because if we look at our code here
you'll notice what I'm making is if we
can find it a filled up wrong page I'm
just gonna move close that page we're
calling this filled thing which is
imported from redux form we call this
field or use this field component we're
passing in the component you'd like to
basically render for this field and we
pass it a name name is required a name
actually doesn't you know change
anything that's going on here name is
actually basically what is called in the
Redux store so field actually knows to
talk to the Redux store
but we have to tell which store to talk
to and the way we do that is in our when
we're doing creating the reducers right
here yep and we do combine reducers we
have to add a reducer for the form so
the field is going to automatically
dispatches actions and this form reducer
which we get from Redux form actually
listens for the actions and then updates
the state or the yeah the Redux state so
it's listening right here this guy is
listening for the actions that are
getting dispatched from this field now
we have multiple fields and so this name
is that that's how you differentiate
them so the email username these are two
different things inside the redux state
inside of the form and now the form is
getting differentiated here that's why
you do this thing here so you know this
is all under the sign up form that way
you can have it our login form we can
also have in our Redux store for example
a name because it's the login name or
sorry the login email because you don't
use the name login email or password
okay so right here that's what that's
doing telling it what form and we can
also pass other options that we can use
for our form and it's wrapping our
component if you don't wrap it you can't
actually use these fields this is what
you know binds it to this function or
this component okay so the fields and we
actually have to implement stuff that's
why you notice how this code or this
component is like super long because
that field component actually gives us a
lot of things to work with
when it's watching actions the redux
state changes and the redux state is
being passed here some of the things for
example on change is I'm pretty sure
that's like an action or something every
time I type it dispatch
in action to the rehook store updates
the value and then changes what value is
set here so that's how that form is
working and now whenever I click Submit
how am I getting all these values right
well Redux form passes a handle submit
so notice how I'm wrapping my sign-up
function so reacts form actually passes
a parameter to the sign-up component and
it's called handle submit now handle
submit is passed as a prop to our signup
component and handle submit is what we
call when we're submitting so on submit
I call sorry on when this button is
pressed I call handle submit and I pass
a function in and the function I'm
passing is right here
it's a lambda and basically I'm just
passed I to get the fields this should
be fields because there's multiple we're
getting the email password passes an
object or passing it to this on submit
function which actually does the bulk of
the things so on submit actually does
different things this submitted data and
as you see at the bottom that's how
we're actually making a request to
redock saga so that's basically it of
how Redux agha all these libraries are
working and how they are communicating
so one last time i just want to walk you
through what's all happening when i'm
typing here so it starts with the
username field I'm typing my username
Bob 3 so when I just did Bob 3 it
updated the Redux store I was typing
stuff in the username field the username
field was dispatching actions Redux
in that Redux form was storing in react
store and then showing it here because
it's taking the value in the Redux store
and showing it here that's what we're
doing over here
that's why we this rest of input thing
it's actually one of the things is like
value which is grabbing from the Redux
store same thing for this field
and same thing for this field so
although three of those fields were
making actions when I was typing now so
we have all these values stored in redux
and so when I hit sign up what's going
to happen is Redux form is going to pass
it to my function and then we're going
to call handle cement or on submit and
we're going to request the sign up with
the data that was passed to us from
redox reaction and then we're going to
make a post request with Redux saga
running in the background create the
actual object on the server get the
response once we get the response we're
going to actually update stuff in our
saga so let's go ahead and click sign up
so you notice we transition the page so
we come into our saga here we make the
request here what we're doing so I
should explain this real quick yield put
what's that doing this is dispatch
action I should have explained that
that's what yield put is doing this
looks super weird all it's doing so you
could think of this kind of equivalent
to yeah it's dispatching an action so it
starts submit this is returning an
object that object is being dispatched
this creates an action so we're
submitting basically the signup form
that's why we're dispatching this we're
making the API call we're getting the
response back we're printing it out
we're saying the signup is done and then
we're able to do stuff we can transition
to a different scene using our router so
that is it guys that is the whole
process of what's going on and this
basically the same thing happens for
view action over here it's just using
different data different API calls
different actions are going on here so I
hope that kind of eliminates some of the
confusion of what's going on there's a
lot of libraries going on if you have
more questions specifically about what
different ones are doing please let me
know I can go more in depth about any
particular one so thank you guys for
