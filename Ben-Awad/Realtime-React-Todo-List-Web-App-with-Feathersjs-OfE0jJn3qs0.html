to be teaching you how to make a
real-time application using sockets so
right here you'll see I have two
browsers open this is the final product
both is opened up to localhost 3000 it's
the same webpage and what we're going to
be making is a to-do list now this is a
very basic to-do list but what makes it
special is that you sockets so without
reloading the page
we're gonna watch as both of these are
updated what I can do is I can click on
things and they'll cross them out you
notice as I come down and click on these
items they're crossed out over here and
I can come over here and if I want cross
out some things
uncross some things and those change I
can add items and you notice that
updates over here I can delete items
over here and they just you know you can
just see as the two screens are mirrored
the same thing is happening in both of
them so it's really cool using sockets
allows you to just show every you know
client real time data so the front-end
is using react this what you see right
here and in the backend is using
feathers it's persisting the data and
allowing us to make calls you notice as
i refresh the page the data is still
there so in the next video I'll be
showing you how to set up the feather
server to get these things working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
