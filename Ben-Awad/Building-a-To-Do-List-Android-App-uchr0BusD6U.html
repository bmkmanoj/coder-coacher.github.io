yoke
yeah I disconnect again
back to us Texas
okay I'm just gonna well it's kind of
bad
okay so you can get rid of that I'm not
gonna worry about the look of it right
now I can always make that look better
later so let's go over here this will be
our new note and we will set the text to
you know I also want to make this a
material design or me well I'm going to
try that out so the measure is defined
as so right now I'm looking at this
material theme is defined as dark
version light version first material is
lines that customize the club palette so
how am i adding that do you provide
system would just delay sit five look
good cheers to find us
alright so let's add I think light goes
better with this
that seemed
all right so not obviously it was not
did anything material light all right so
this is gonna be our new note button um
I also want to and so and then we're
gonna have another activity oh yeah
before I get to stir in this on add
version control
so just import
I think I just it's really I know sorry
I thought I disconnected for a second so
I want to add a version control so I'm
gonna be using git oops
enable urgent control integrin ization
you just get and I'm gonna use a bit
bucket for my remote remote what is that
called remote repository here bit bucket
I'm gonna make it private and flush and
then let's go ahead and commit changes
all right I need to add first get we
want to do this from right here it and
now you can just push it this is just
the initial commit and we're gonna go
ahead and push it
can't push because no remotes are
defined okay well we just added import
into version control share project is
there exists but are the same name
already exists but for some reason it
did not there how can you link it from
here
branches history will push camp why did
it not connect them it's probably cuz I
didn't add them I added a shirt not know
I'll just go do it manually cut CD into
see see the should be it to-do list why
is it to do this here
don't you say this
well for some reason I've know why
that's not working
yeah I don't know well you can add
remotes right here if you click if you
click go to import version control you
can create one right here I don't know I
don't know why the heck it doesn't show
my project I should maybe it's because I
have it open right now let's try closing
in real Oh for some reasons on my
desktop what the heck no wonder heck is
it on my desktop okay so see the end to
do this gets you know I actually do list
let's see I have an existing project all
right so get remote and origin
I lost there
then we're just going to get bullish
all right so there we go all right so
we're good on version control right now
so let's add a another Java class this
will be our second
this will be our note activity so I will
call it note
yeah activity do you want to add the
following oh no I shouldn't believe this
it's gonna add a new activity activity
name right no way out aim yep yep yep
um drawing a parent yeah I think that's
fine thank having making it a parent
that's fine for now we can always change
that later
good that's false to get yes all right
so
with our we're gonna create non click
and on click we're just going to go to
note activity we just hit alt enter to
bring up the slow dialog we can create
this enter our thing and then we just
want to create an intent so when they
click on the button we'll go over to
this new activity so this intent need to
pass in a context maybe not now you need
to pass in context and I'm pretty sure
you want to pass in the class one go to
you got class pretty sure it's like that
and we want to start activity passing in
intent
I'm almost positive that's how it is how
it works let's make sure that that's
working or I'll run Jimmy motion and
we'll just launch the editor and see if
that works
so I'm thinking about so I was reading
about the hollow our material design and
they had these new they had two new
layouts that they were talking about one
was our cycler view and the other one
was a card view and I think a card view
would work pretty good for my activity
right here right here next to the D I
just need to look up how to do that all
right so personal machine starting you
can go ahead and up actually restart we
can go ahead and build the Gradle all
that's loading I'll move it over in a
second so real sign if you can't tell
him trying to practice that seems
everyone's switching to it I heard about
it and it seems pretty useful cheerio
sign card guess
all right so see if this thing is yep
yep
all right so Android we are starting up
oh my goodness what just happened
and let's see alright so we click new
note Briggs this other activity suite
that worked and when we push the back it
brings us back here alright cool
and close that and so this is what I'm
talking about
right here is the creating lists and
cards to create a complex list and cards
material science on the apps you can use
the just like their view and car view
widgets
sir card view widget just on the side
here yet let's see
close this give us some more space card
view card view part a web view eyewear
search view rearview
okay I don't see it over here yet I
don't think they've added it to Android
studio yet at least I know they haven't
had recyclerview so we'll just write up
in the XML recycler view widget is a
more flex advanced and flexible version
of listen this widget is a container for
displaying large data sets that can be
small very efficiently by maintaining a
limited number of views use the recycler
view widget when you have data
collections whose illness change at
runtime based on the user's actions or
network events okay the recyclerview
classifies the displaying handling of
large data sets by burning the out
andrew short position items spa to your
psyche your view widget you have to
specify an adapter so this looks the UM
Cyclovia looks good for our I don't I
don't know if it's better to use a
recycler view or just regular ListView
for this activity for our note I'll just
do it we'll just do a what's that called
a list view for now but I might do
recycler view let's get to what okay
here we go cardia partly extends the
frame layout class and lets you show
information inside the cards that have a
consistent look across the platform card
be widgets can have shadows around a
coroner's created card view shadow use
the card view part elevate attribute
uses realization dynamic shadows
for more information you're saying no
cuz it crashed
if for some reason the my OBS keeps
reconnecting I don't know why it crashes
and then it comes back in ten seconds or
like five seconds I should I need to
look in that I'll fix that after this
okay so use these properties to
customize the appearance of cartridge to
set the corners
okay so following code examples show how
to include a card view widget
okay so curve your image text view and
dependencies for more information there
cycling or part of the be seventies
widgets
okay so let's add these to our
build.gradle file before we forget
actually I'm no good sink I don't know
why it's crashing
I think it's because I have a because I
have fine see video I'm gonna turn down
resolution downscale now base resolution
encoding I think I need to lower my guy
Neil over mine encoding max bitrate I'm
gonna go with bitrate I don't think it's
that I let's lower this like 25 okay
yeah
hopefully all crashing more it's my life
right now let's make sure
because Android studio okay all right
hopefully it should be good now all
right so I added the card view library
right here and I'm going to go back to
the layout and we're just gonna add this
car view okay copy this in all right so
call this card v1 Center so this is
interesting and sitting a layout width
and height and it's having rounded
corners all right let's just see what
this which I won't show you right now
okay oh no it just wants you to build it
or anything and try building the project
this is actually my first time using
them I just saw I just was reading I
just stumbled upon this page and I saw
these little cards I thought that'd be a
good way to display notes Oh what
offline cache Dean
for some reason it only the line goes
offline for a few seconds I'm just going
to lower this to five seconds Cody
general hot piece advanced all right
this is I'm gonna have to play this
later this is the best I can do it might
hit it might go offline again all right
so let's put so we want this to be it
for now we'll put that at the top so
it's a line parent top center horizontal
let's put the card view below that let's
say below bright it does so because this
below layout so because it's not an
Android studio yet it won't autocomplete
which is kind of annoying but that's
fine and you know Sona should sit under
here come on I don't know if it's blow
out yeah
lay out your score below now I should go
blow at but out you do
alright let's just pretend we're doing
it up here
yeah thanks I'm not used to doing it
without autocomplete so is this okay
that's high text for you
oh so this is the textview not inside
the card view no it is for some reason
jumped out in mine okay so now let's
just type in let's call this note name
text me miserable
texts let's say my note type I'm just
gonna use this so I know how to type it
out okay so and of course wants me so
it's going up there so how do I want to
add I probably want to add a little
screenshot of what they have in their
note all right so I should I want to
make these dynamically these notes based
on how many notes they have so every
time they make a new note I want them to
I want to save the note and I'm gonna
put it on the home screen so I think the
first thing I want to do is I don't
worry about this card of you for now
we'll come back to that and I actually
want to make the Donna I want to make
the note activity and get that to work
first so let's take a look at let's just
now I'm gonna see this for now all right
so let's come over here I'm gonna
eventually need to set up a database so
we can save the notes we could do shared
preferences but I think it could get too
complicated so I think we're gonna set
up a database we'll set that up in a
little bit so for the note let's get rid
of this hello world does it say that
theme note doesn't let's do a new
material light like you're gonna stay
throughout our project I'm gonna stay
the same through damage doing material
light over here when I do material life
oh shoot I'm down
okay back we want to keep the same theme
on so the first thing I want to do is on
add a list view let's just call this
note face layout and then we just want a
list view how this match parent for now
we'll have the height let's just have it
wrap
cuz we may at the top we probably
actually want a button at the top
stretch it or add this
this will be and should add event add
order to those calls we call it
something what we call it in our of
Islamic add item okay that's a little
work for now and item will make the ID
yeah sucks I add item
then we'll have our list you
I'll put it blue yeah I don't know
either I think it has to do with my i've
streamed before and it hasn't I don't
know how it's crashed again we actually
go back to my settings it wasn't
crashing so much until let me close my
it wasn't crashing as much until I
opened genymotion
I'm gonna turn that close that maybe
that'll help a little bit okay so we're
gonna have the ListView blow the button
so say item and every time we add the
item we want to add an alert dialogue so
okay it's an hour on click this will be
add item
no we're gonna call it yes and item is
fine sound generic item could be
anything
yeah there it is crashing again
obviously that didn't help
okay so where dialogue builder builders
equals third
yes good builder posit it pauses button
this would be okay listener why what's
in there in a second
negative button which cancel and we
don't want to do anything when it
cancels okay I think when I ever since I
lowered my max bitrate that hurt it so
I'm gonna just go back to 3500 and just
applied it make sure let's just let's go
4000 I don't know if that's bad okay
okay builder dot set negative button um
no we gots a builder dot set title not
set title I don't set it to do eylem
and then we want to add a actually don't
know how to added okay so we need to
make a custom we need to make a custom
layout let's go into our layouts new
layout
let's do new item dialog yes I want to
add this to get
hello alright so we add that too so I
want a edit text right now this is what
my this is what I have for my encoding
settings the max bitrate I just changed
the 4000 it was that 20 it was that
strength 3 500 then I lowered to 2,500
now that's actually hasn't crashed in a
little bit once I moved it to 4000 that
seemed to help it so yeah alright so I'm
gonna add at a text I was seeing a lot
of buffering with since I've stopped
there's a cute yeah okay so going to add
an edit text I'm not gonna bother with
the design view text wrap wrap ID let's
call it
new item name and yes I'm fine
let's say that and alright don't matter
every house you
now I need to to add custom layout to
alert I ride the in mind
okay
go back to activity activity I'm getting
it from this some layout yeah call this
new note base layout on this new log
period
doner dot set us up layouts and then we
want to show builder Dasha
well let's go ahead and run genymotion
and run up the leader and see if that is
working and if that is what we're gonna
do next is go into this on click method
and we're going to one so on it clicks
okay we're going to take whatever text
is in that editable field
blower the
so this right here
what do you recommend I Laura to 3,500 I
thought it was set at first
I can try lowering it to 3,500 and see
if that helps
what do you usually
okay at 1500 okay I can try lowering it
to 1500 and see what happens
coding 1500 my guess is it's gonna crash
we'll see what happens
okay
so we're gonna click new note and we're
gonna add an item didn't like when I
typed wool sweet all right so but I
don't worked okay so now when we hit
okay we want to add to list view oh I
have no idea
I mean it's not crashing right now so
and I lowered to 1500 yeah as soon as as
soon as I raised it
it stopped crashing yeah I don't know
why that that was but now it's I lowered
it to 1500 and it's not crashed yet so
that's pretty good too okay so lets me
create an array call this array list
string call this I say in my new array
list
okay so when we need to also
hmm we need to get okay now layout yeah
there you go
so I need to access the
so I need to get to the Edit tax so I
can achieve what they put in it okay so
how am I gonna do that new note base
layout so here's the only way to get
there it's like okay new oh I can get
the child that's what I'll do
so a cop here and text actually I don't
think it's not always gonna be the same
text you
this isn't edittext
you know item looking so lose some
xbox360 that's poor what language do you
used to make that and just what even
used to make 360 feel like there's a
long time ago right new item
up we just disconnected again the Hearst
time with lower bitrate okay so yeah see
I don't know
weird isn't it so we're gonna get the
new note to base they all get child yeah
it's weird and we need to cast this into
a beat
you uh I think it just crashed did just
grassy did just crash again for you guys
I honestly I checked what it does it or
why it does
yeah I'll look into it later I'll be
able to figure it out oh I can also try
tweaking some of the things there's
probably something I'm doing wrong
okay but let's yeah so now when they
click the on click I want to add mm just
we're going to add and you know I don't
get text too
you should be
yeah
okay so then I want to okay so 90 to
make a array let's make a new Java class
new yes you don't want to make new
package this will be adapters new Java
class let's call this items grade
yes array adapter looks okay how do we
want to do the
well I'm gonna want a resource
everything else we're just gonna do
public items right after and then we
want to get a context context and then
we want just an array or a list
okay
arraylist there a list adapter because
when I was using this music doctors when
I look at stop the new project
injustice I was just using an ArrayList
Meili project
case oh this is the wrong one
all right this is my desktop or there's
no projects whatsoever
wanted to go to interest area new window
please
and we just connect I'll be able to pull
it out for you okay
adapters let's rename this we don't need
this to be a capital
yeah it's just a raid after I don't know
why I was in realist
rate after of string and then we're
going to great lists spring and then
call this context context ray list
string
there's no default material and what
doesn't like Oh super context
oh yeah and also once oh yeah we need to
make in our layout that's right I'll
call this
all right so we need to just close this
I'll be right back
Oh
all right I am back I should pull yes
okay so let's make sure all right we're
still connected I think it disconnected
a few times when I pulled up
enjoy studio okay so let's make a new
resource for our ArrayList adapter we'll
call this our item this list number and
ask me again and in this we will just
have a text view and Wahb as the ID so
beat item text we chopped in okay this
thing is disconnected every two seconds
what the heck
I mean flipping a minute I can move out
it all right let's just add the layout I
don't list
they don't wanna set context to context
and we'll set Meireles to ArrayList okay
I'm just looking at how I set up my
other one right here so I might use a
view holder I'm gonna set this up right
down here
I'll have a we're just having one
texture here and this is a dumb name and
what we're gonna do is say if
convertview is equal to null we're going
to say convert music layout later we're
gonna call context dot flee our dock
layout I know Chris a comma parent I'm
up pops
all right was the only about during a
method call expect you Oh doc from and
then we're gonna say folders equals new
race a folder don't I don't name is
equal to u dot what we call it yes
I don't name he said new item name I
mean I convert that to a text view text
and I'm back when you don't like me
having a stream playing old enough Oh
Windows virtual machine yeah I would
guess not actually that's probably why
the stream every time I open genymotion
I'm gonna close that I need to close
that every time I open that up it slows
down so keep that off for a little bit
that's probably part of the reason it
keeps crashing I'll just yeah
okay so and then we want to return okay
also you want to put convert EU dot set
tag or I'm gonna say else folder is
equal to you you don't get tak Wow it's
pretty bad okay and then we're just
going to set the order dot item name not
set text to ArrayList dot get at
position and all right so we're all set
up for this so we're gonna go back to
our note activity then right here we're
just gonna say raid after so items right
after say afters you
I don't straight pass of this items
I think it's crashing like crazy right
now you say keep hearing it go I don't
know I mean I'm gonna try turning it up
just a little bit I'm gonna try you
doing
encoding mm that way maybe that'll help
advice but still not choppy nope
okay items array after and I'm gonna set
the top set all right now this is the
adapter oh yeah we need get the list of
you to so few items list you actually
said how I want a spotless feel they
spell is shaking you know that's how
this well let's be there mice yeah I
should just felt like they do okay in my
name's list view I know this list view
dot sequel to find you by B r dot V dot
what did we call it it's close to these
tabs these items list we're done with
new item dialog we're done with activity
we've done with to devein done with four
now this let's see what do we want to
get him up again
the listview so that's in the activity
note this for you wait and you're gonna
this is the new items it's not new just
items list view
and you wanna cast it dispute sit items
listen you got set after and every time
we add we wanted to just update it
I don't got notified date have changed
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and run this
and see if it's working as we thought
and if it works I'm gonna go ahead and
call it a night
it keeps crashing stream anyway I record
it and we'll be putting this up on
YouTube and hopefully looks good on
there um I'll tweak the settings and
hopefully tomorrow it will not have so
many connection problems and yeah I'm
gonna be continued working on app and
let's go ahead and build this matrice
works yeah pretty sure it should be
working
I think the biggest thing I need to work
on is the look I want to make sure this
the app looks nice with the layout I'm
trying to do material design I'm going
to try to rigging up on some more of
that and implementing it
I mean I added the theme already this
thing booting up yeah I think it started
there you go
yeah
I literally just learned about it so
trying to get better at it
add it to my stuff
alright so let's say first light on this
map okay and it didn't work so see why
didn't work why didn't work it's close
this
hmm cool so got our adapter to make sure
that's working right so text looks right
it looks right um node activity okay so
we have an adapter right here making the
adapter we're saying it to the list view
and we're notifying it down here on the
on click
we're notifying changes and we're adding
the M items let's see I just probably
forgot something simple recurring the
ListView riding the adapter on create
it's probably something with my array
adapter maybe this looks right set tag
folder that either may not set tax
return convert view let's take a look at
maybe that list doesn't look right
I did make it a little small
oh you know what let's make sure the
activity no no I made that right
I think it might have to do with this
item text I am saying in the adapter
right okay that's why I was not singing
right yeah go figure
items text I don't text there you go
I was everything worked right I was
setting to the wrong view that was
stupid
all right let's launch this up again
that should fix the problem you're
having
let's go ahead and build Gradle while
we're starting the virtual device
continue and when yes Ranjan
all right cool
we're done with this
all right let's check it out
just go to our note it's an item called
math at it still not showing up I should
make sure my layout is right let's try
her word
no I guarantee it's a problem with my
name okay
items list that's right my getting item
text that's right oh you know what it
might not have built let's make sure it
built as I started Gradle but I'm not
sure if it actually built on cuz I'm
almost positive it should be working now
I mean I was doing that work last time
it didn't all right cool tube yes there
we go sweet success all right so it's
working so yeah I'm gonna call that call
it a night for now I'm gonna work on it
some more tomorrow we'll implement some
stylistic things we'll add maybe the
database so we can store the files make
everything look nice well thank you for
