little button right here or we can click
on and we can invite other users to our
team so the different teams we made we
can write other members we can then chat
with now before we get started actually
doing this I wanted to address two
things I talked about in the last video
so the first thing is I was adding this
double bang sign and to basically cast
this guy because he'd be undefined or an
empty string or something it's not a
boolean so when to cast it to a boolean
but I didn't realize this is yes lint
doesn't like it it's a no extra boolean
cast thing I'm the lender if I save this
it should automatically get rid of it
and so I want to talk about that real
quick so here's the rule basically what
I didn't realize is they already force
the variable to be a boolean so you
don't even have to worry about it you
don't have to cast it yourself I was
thinking you would add the bang sign for
performance enhancement because you just
automatically casting it but it looks
like they already do that for you so
there's really no need to do that so I'm
gonna stop doing that I'm gonna continue
how it was doing it before we're just
keeping it like this and not using the
double bang sign to cast it and the
second thing is some people were talking
about in their applications
remember how we brought this graph field
query from our sidebar into the view
team and then we can now pass this data
to our sidebar or messages in our header
what some people are doing is in their
sidebar now of course they'd have other
different applications been their
sidebar they're fetching the data and in
their header they're fetching the day of
the messages and the send message so you
know all these different components
they're all have a graph QL query in it
and they're all fetching all teams for
example and that's actually an OK thing
to do and the reason for that is graph
QL or Apollo will cache the request so
it actually will only make one request
to the server and then the rest of these
components when they actually fetch the
data but only fetch it once because it's
in the cache now the reason why I didn't
just do a graph QL query here here and
here you know all
that need the channel is because I want
to actually do a little bit of
computation
I call this computation right here we're
basically I'm taking my query my all
teams query and I'm from that giving the
team in the channel that it are
basically the current team the current
channel so I don't want to have to do
that in my header and my messages in my
send messages because then and what I
have to pass here is that I have to do
like a current channel ID you know which
we're getting from up here so this
channel ID I have to pass that down so
it's not worth to do this computation
every single component but that made
some be something you want to do where
you do the graph query in each one of
these if that's easier for your
application alright so now let's get
started with building out that little
invite button so this is gonna be
something that's on the sidebar so this
is gonna be in the channel sidebar so
it'll be over here and this is just
gonna be a button at the very bottom
here and all it's gonna say is invite
people so we're gonna say Plus invite
people and we can incap we can
capitalize this and we're gonna wrap
this with a link tag and the href we're
gonna just do a pound sign and we're
going to say invite people and then
we're gonna give this a non click so we
know when people click the button so I
wrap that and then here since this is
just a view component we need to get
past a prop in here so on invite people
click
and we'll call that down here so on
invite people click so let's see that
pop up over here so nothing happens when
I click on this now but what we will do
is hopefully in our sidebar we'll have a
little modal that'll pop down now so
here we have on add channel click we're
basically gonna copy how we did that
modal and we're going to create a new
modal for this guy so we called this on
invite people click so I'm just going to
copy that and we'll use that over here
and we'll create a function called
handle invite people click so on handle
people click we're gonna do the same
thing that we did here so handle invite
people click we're gonna say invite
people modal and we'll say open and
we're going to set that to true and now
this this little state we need to add to
our state up here and we're gonna
initially set the false as well and then
we're you need to have a handle close as
well so I'll handle close and bite
people and I guess we can call some
Bodil and we'll say open and by people
modal false so that's how we can control
whether the Moodle pops up or not and so
let's create a
invite people move in my people
and in that modal we're gonna just pass
down here so we're gonna create another
thing we're returning for this this is
going to be an invite people modal so we
need to know the team ID
that way when we actually invite a
person we know what team they want to be
added to so on clothes this is gonna be
handle and my people handle clothes and
my people and then whether this is open
or not is gonna be with that state and
I'm just gonna just D structure the
state now since we have multiple so this
state and it's gonna be open and open
add channel modal so now I don't need to
have the state here and I will just say
open and by people modal so that's our
conditional to say whether they're in
light or to open this modal and here
this is gonna be a invite people
okay so now let's actually create this
component so I'm gonna copy this
component because it's gonna be really
similar we're just going to paste it in
and we're gonna rename this to invite
people so we have an all teams query we
really don't need to update a query
after we add a person to the team so we
can get rid of that so we can get rid of
our update function here and we're not
really gonna have to find index we're
gonna be doing a graph QL query for this
at the end and we are going to be using
formic for this so we can keep that and
everything else we can keep for now so
great we need to create a new mutation
to handle this so let's actually go to
the backend and create this mutation and
then come back and finish this form so
in our back-end right here we have
basically this member table so this is a
join table between team and user if we
come down yep so what we want to do is
really just add a new member and the
easiest way to do this is to just call
so when we created new objects so like
for example creating a new channel we
were just said models that Channel dot
create right so it'd be really easy for
us to do something like models dot
member Dockery and then create a new
member of our team but right now we
don't have a member model so we're just
gonna create that so we're gonna say
member Jas and member dot J's can just
copy one of these things and it's
actually going to be totally empty so
it's gonna say member here and
it's gonna have nothing going on there
and it's gonna return so this is
basically just a stub and we can even
get rid of that now if there's any extra
data I wanted to store it in the join
table I could hear the only thing we're
gonna change now is now instead of doing
a string here for the through we're
gonna say models dot member so it's
gonna grab that table we just created
here so models dot member so then our
index over here we just need to do the
same thing that we did with all our
other models is just import it so now in
my index my index dot J I'm just gonna
create a new here we are I'm just gonna
say force to create our new basically
model that we just made so database
should reset and we should get all right
so just rebuilt no errors that's good so
now I'm gonna create a add team member
to our team schema so here I'm going to
say add team member and so remember a a
user is going to be filling this out so
they don't know the users ID they're
really just going to pass the email the
user they want to add and then we're
gonna pass in the team idea as well so
what we're going to do is we're going to
look up the email get the ID and then
pair these together now I'm gonna create
something called a void response so this
is gonna be a type up here boy response
I don't think I've created this type
before
and this is just gonna have an OK which
is a boolean and then airs which is an
array of error and the reason why is I
don't really need to return anything
when I'm creating a new member object so
I'm just gonna really return if there's
any errors and this does not have to be
you can get null for errors okay so
let's create this add team over now so
this is gonna be a mutation
I can copy this because gonna be kind of
the same thing add team member it's a
tip a team member so here we want to
requires off but what we also want to do
is require the user to be the owner of
the team right so like if I am a member
of the team but I don't own the team I
should not be able to add other members
unless that's something we want a
feature we want but for now we're gonna
say only team members can add people so
the way we're gonna do this is we're not
going to create a permission here
because we want to do a little
performance increase and I'll show you
what I mean
so remember how one of our arguments is
email and team ID so those are our two
arguments now T email I can't really do
anything with what I need to do is
really get the user that that email is
associated with so I'm gonna say user
dot await models dot find one and I'm
gonna say where and I'm gonna say email
and we're gonna make this a raw query so
so now that I have the user but I also
want to check the user that's creating
this so user to add and this is Const
owner right so we're gonna say a weight
models dot find one and actually I don't
think I capitalized this find one where
ID is equal to user ID and again I'm
going to make this a raw query
okay so here we're grabbing the owner of
the team right
so the owner of the team should be this
user that we have here and we also need
to fetch the user that we want to add so
really I just want to be like a little
if statement here if owner is equal to
and then the owner of the team right so
really what we do if we have to fetch
the owner of the team as well so we're
gonna have to do any another query so
Kant's team is gonna be a weight and
we're gonna say models find one where
team ID and we're gonna say raw is true
alright so now we have a team owner and
a user ID so now what we can do is we
can say if owner dot ID or actually we
don't even need to sorry we don't need
to fetch an owner because we already
have the user ID we only really need to
fetch the team so team the ID is equal
to user dot ID so right so the user ID
is the person who's making this request
and actually sorry this should be owner
so we're we have storing the owner of
the team here and if this is not equal
we know this is not the owner of the
team trying to make this request so we
can like throw an error for example but
it'd be a shame is now I can get rid of
this because we don't need any of this
right now let's move this into there
now it'd be a shame right we're gonna do
one query here we're gonna check if this
maybe we're gonna return okay is false
and then we throw some error right and
then down here we're gonna do comp we're
gonna await models dot member create and
then for a create function we're gonna
pass in our user ID which is gonna be
user to add that ID so that's gonna be
user ID and then the team ID which we
already have right passed up there so
we're gonna do one two three requests to
our database now before we continue I
just want to make sure I did call this
user ID for a member so if I come over
here to my model the foreign key I used
was indeed user IDs a perfect okay
so it'd be really nice if I could cut
down and at least cut down on the
requests because this is three requests
and so what I can do is I can call this
is I can run these two requests in
parallel and the way I do that is a
weight makes it synchronous so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to call this team
promise and so this is gonna return a
promise and I'm gonna say user to add
promise so both of these are promises
and now they're both running at the same
time and now all I have to do is wait
for them to finish so team user to add
is equal to promise dot all and then
we're gonna do a team promise and user
to add promise so what this does is it
waits for and we're gonna say I'll wait
up here oops
so we're gonna wait for both of these
promises to finish which you're both
running at the same time and we're the
team promise back and the user right
here so grab both of them so now it's a
bummer if the you know the user that
made this request is not the owner
because we already made this query but
if they are hey we already fetched this
so we make a little bit faster so that
there's a little bit of a trade-off
there right because we make this query
after this if statement so there's a
chance we don't but for most more like
more often than not you're not gonna be
get people that are like doing fishy
stuff and trying to add a member to the
team when they're not an owner because
we're gonna basically not allow them to
do that on the front end too so I'm
gonna return an error for this - so airs
gonna say path is gonna be email well
actually we're gonna our path is gonna
be email because that's the only field
we're gonna have in our form and then
the message is gonna be you are not e
you cannot add members to the team okay
so if owner if tema owner is not equal
to user ID otherwise we know they are
the owner of the team so they can just
add members okay so we'll create a
member and then we're gonna return and
we're gonna say okay it's true and not
return any errors and then here if we
get any errors will format them and
return them so this looks pretty good I
might be missing something because we
wrote a lot of code here but the best
way to find out if it works is to give
this thing a test
oh there's actually one other thing
media test I forgot user ID user to add
could be null right if they give us a
bad email so I'm going to say user to
add
if it doesn't exist if we get a null
back we're in a return false and email
will say I could not find user with this
email
okay let's okay we looks like we don't
have any heirs and just our log here so
I'm gonna hop back over here below close
to 80 80 or 80 81 for me and build this
query that we or the mutation we just
made
alright so add team member we have an
email and we're gonna have a teammate
and this is gonna have okay back we want
to get any heirs we get path and message
and then I made variables so I'm gonna
have to initialize them up here that's
gonna be a string and team ID is gonna
be an int and both of them are required
so copy that so now I'm gonna make a
copy of my mutation here get rid of this
old mutation so this is gonna be add
team member mutation so we're gonna have
that to graphical right here so now when
we mutate what we want to pass in as
values dot email
and we're gonna call this email we're
not gonna have an optimistic response
for this one because we don't need it
we'll call on clothes and then set
submitting ducks good team ID we're
passing to the prop still here we're
gonna call this email it's possible for
us to get errors here so I can say Const
response and for now we're just going to
console dot log the response and then we
can see what kind of errors we can
display them in the form if we get any
okay so now let's fix our form up here
so this is not an ad to channel modal
this is a invite people modal oops area
so change that at the bottom with our
export key fault and so these are all
going to be the same right because we
have an open on clothes these are all
generic things no matter what our form
is so here we're going to say add people
to your team and our input here so the
name of this is gonna be an email and
this is gonna be users email
I have to have a cancel and a
adduser I'll just take a look at what
this looks like no errors in our log
that's good and can't read okay so I
just dropped my database so we're gonna
have to create a new a new user and then
a new team so we're gonna register real
quick so Bob at look like let's do Bob
at Bob 16 comm I'm just gonna use that
for all my values isn't it can only
contain oh yeah I forgot about that so
let's get that submit now let's login
now we can view our team and oh we
haven't we haven't created team yet and
we might want to create like some kind
of guard for users that just go to view
team when they haven't created a team
yet so my first team cement create our
team got our first channel now I'd like
to invite someone to my team let's first
get our first air right so there's no
other users on the website so if I view
Bob at Bob 15.com I should get an error
saying that user does not exist so add
user cannot read property sequel eyes of
undefined so I'm gonna come over here to
my server something went wrong with the
server we can see what our logs is
models dot find one is not a function so
here this should be team and that should
be user so I just forgot to specify
which model we were looking at so let
that rerun will refresh here
um okay just refresh so I think I the
reason I'm being this area is because
the server's not up no servers up
okay cannot read channel properties of
undefined so we don't have a channel
here because we don't specify it I
wonder if I get rid of the one if that
works no okay so let's look at our
front-end we obviously have a bug in our
front-end right now so it's saying our
channel ID
let's do console dot log team and then
console dot log channel ID X so we can
see what the ID or what location we're
supposed to be grabbing from our team ok
so really the problem is our team is
undefined right now so let's console.log
all teams and team ID X and see why they
are undefined oh I know why I forgot rid
of forgot to get rid of the force true
so when I just made a change on my
back-end it just dropped the entire
database again okay get rid of these we
don't need them anymore
I know what the problem was so we really
need to make a just a little thing that
says hey you haven't created any teams
yet but we'll do that in a different
video
so you're Bob 16 we're gonna log in
and now we're gonna create a team my
first team again so create that in my
people so now we're going to buy Bob at
Bob 15.com so we expect an error to
happen we expect to get Bob 15 does not
exist okay is false and our errors are
could not find user with this email
perfect
so let's handle that air right now so in
our modal we're gonna have response
we're gonna say respond okay and air is
just equal to response and add team
member team every okay so if okay these
are the things you want to do otherwise
we're gonna come over here and we're
gonna show that airs to the user so
there is a I believe it's called set
airs there we go and so we can set
submitting is false and then we set our
errors and we're gonna pass an error
object so now the air object needs to be
a object that looks like this and we get
an email and it's gonna be like an array
of airs so air one air two but if we
look at what the format of her airs are
right now let's just show you what our
errors look like
so grab that oh okay cannot read
property okay undefined
response that add to remember okay so
it's console.log response again I must
be doing something just silly here
response to add team member maybe I
spelled that wrong so data Oh dot data
so data dot there we go
oh I'm not printing out errors let's
print that is out so we need to create a
basically a universal function that
formats errors because we really want to
format the errors in this way no matter
what form are using so right now we have
an array where we have message and path
so we want to basically reduce this
array into one object so I'm gonna
create just a util function I'm going to
create a new file up here that's called
format or we're gonna call it normalize
Aires
okay s now if I have more of these
utility is I'll create a we're gonna do
a reduce on this I'll create utils
folder but right now we only have one so
we'll keep it just down the outer layer
of our package so I want to import this
import normalize whole lower case it
airs and this is goes up one this is for
normalize Aires
okay and what I really want to do with
it is I want to call set errors I'm
gonna pass normalize errors passing in
this Aires object so what I want to do
in here is we're gonna take a array of
errors and it's going to be path is
equal to something
and message is going to equal to
something and I want to take that and
create an object and here's what I want
my object to look like so my object I
want to have like email and then air one
air two and so on so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna say air is dot reduce and
we'll put that there so our reduced it's
gonna take a function that takes an
accumulator and then the current value
and what it's gonna return what the next
value is going to be and our initial
value is gonna be a object so if you
don't know how reduced works what it
does is it takes this value here this is
gonna be the initial value puts it into
accumulator and then the current value
is going to be our current value in the
list so first we're gonna do one thing
so this is an object here we basically
want to take it cumulate err and we want
to say current value dot path right cuz
that's gonna be like email and this is
gonna be does not exist and we want to
create a list of this right and we want
to say CV dot message now if we only
expect one error message per we could
actually just do this right and be but
we want to make this unique and work for
all of them so we're gonna pass back in
array because we could get more than one
err possibly what do we oh there we go
so after how this works is you at the
bottom we're gonna return accumulator
and accumulator is then gonna like
accumulate all the values so as we keep
going we just add a value here and we
return accumulator accumulator on the
next call is gonna be here and current
value is gonna be the next one in the
list now because we're doing this we
want we don't want to overwrite so
really when you want to check
so if C V dot path is in accumulator
else we do something else so if it's
already in it we don't want to set it
like this right really what we want to
do is push you want to add a value to it
so now we're gonna loop through this
convert it to an object like you like it
here we're gonna take the path check if
it's in the accumulator if it's not in
it we're gonna create a new array with
the message one of the error messages
otherwise we're gonna push on a new
message so let's see if that works so
we're not doing anything with the errors
actually so let's up here in my form
field I'm just gonna have a little guy
this will be like my little airs my
little airs will print out here so we're
gonna say and we don't have areas up
here so touched now air is gonna show so
touched and then the field name which is
email and airs email so both of those
exist then what we're gonna do
otherwise we'll show null so here you
want to just show this this string and
we're gonna show just the first air for
now let's have this thing and Colt we
see a little error could not find users
with this air or with this email so now
let's create a new user that actually
has this email and see if we can create
or add that member to the team okay so
I'm gonna register so now I'm going to
create a Bob 16
so I'm sorry Bob 15 about 15 about 15 we
can copy you pasted you there so now my
beauty my mad Bob 15 to my team and
alright looks like it worked okay I'm
not sure over console logging to get a
null here
Oh airs so yeah airs was no you get rid
of that console long so now we invited
him to our team and what we can do is
I'm gonna give this clear we can go into
P sequel we can connect to our slack and
we can select all from members and there
we go
and we can see we have one member his
user ID is 2 and he's attached to the
team 1 so because we created Bob we can
actually just select the user and see we
can see Bob 16 is user ID 1 and Bob 15
is user ID 2 so we did just invite Bob
15 to our team so awesome so now we are
now able to add users to our team which
is really cool so that is it for this
video guys we made good progress now
that we can add people to our team we
can finally start chatting so very soon
we can set up subscriptions and start
chatting to other users in the channels
so that's gonna be really cool so thank
you guys for watching and as always the
code will be up on github if you want
check it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
