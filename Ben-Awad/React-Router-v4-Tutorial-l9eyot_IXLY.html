setting up react router for on a fresh
install of create react at literally
just going to walk through this
QuickStart highly recommend checking out
the documentation they have great guides
this is the rear react router
documentation right here they explain
stuff super well what I'm going to do is
just kind of walk through some of the
differences let's see in version 4 and
how I like to do things now with version
4 set up a little bit lap over here I
just did did create react deck and
started a new application brand new kits
you have this little page I have the
server started and how I just start
adding react router to this get pages
set of stuff is a little bit different
now
so then what I've been used to version 4
but I do like it
once I gotten used to it so without
further ado look good start with this
thing and rough but it says the big
thing that changes you now install react
router Dom instead of just react rather
soaps is my project here are our four
and I'm going to go ahead and do yard
react and add this package now you used
to just do yarn add react router now if
they specify Dom and the reason for that
is they want to be you can do react
router Dom and you can get react router
react native I don't know if that's the
name of the package but they have a
react native version now I don't know if
they had it before but now they want to
you know have them separate the two
different packages so okay I got this
here I'm going to go ahead and delete
something they don't want so I don't
need AB dot CSS on the app contest
I'll need index of CSS and yeah so I'm
going to go ahead and remove those don't
need this logo to SVG either that's fine
and cool so next page is good back to
the app what I like to do when doing
react router is I like creating a
Ralph's folder and then
I'll have in index is an index J s I'll
actually have all my routes in this page
so go ahead and port react from react
and import we need a couple things
basically these three things right here
we don't need link but these two so from
react router Dom you'll notice they
renamed router to browser router they
were using alias there that's why
they're renaming it because they used to
be called router we're going to export
default and we can put a route here so
what I like to do is just create a
browser router here and and then we can
put routes in the middle so for example
one route we'll have is the home page
and then same as before you can pass a
component in so I'm going to import home
from home and I'll render or a passive
alum component so then now when I go to
this path I will render the home
component but of course we need to make
this home component and actually import
this soup on a file name extension as is
my Uslan okay so we need to actually
import this route into our app so it
gets rendered so I'm going to import
first let me get rid of this because
we're going to make this appear function
and also I want to import those space
here import routes from routes doc flash
and then I'll need to do this here I'll
just go ahead and export default a
function and then our routes and maybe
actually let's just get rid of it we're
only ever routes here yeah this is a
good practice though if you want to wrap
later going to wrap stuff with redux
provider and other things you would put
that here so we'll keep this for now but
all right come over here
homepage right we didn't create that
component yet so usually what I'll do is
I'll put my routes here so home j/s so
this is just the most basic example
right we have a single route and
explored defaults we're rendering it
just on the home page div oh all right
BAM so refresh from I have to restart
server and we don't go so cool so we're
here that's the most basic example we
can change the path here you guys should
know this and then that path is
represented here so if I now we don't
see it anymore it is there a way to
let's move my bar a little bit
okay so slash home we now render that
home component there so that that's just
a super basics one thing you might
notice now is you might be used to going
to add another route just doing it like
this right this looks like it would work
of course we should do render home over
here alright looks like it's going to
work but hey we get this error a router
male we have one child element so this
is something you might get an error for
and the reason for that is browser
router like it says can only have one
child we're giving it two children two
routes now the way to handle this one
way is to do a just a div right and do
that and then that will take care of
that air for you but I'll show you is
there's another way to do it and you'll
notice hey that does not do what we
really wanted right what page are we on
slash home
there we go that's what I want now
Fisher sorry guys
now we're in a good position to show I
just want to show you the URL here so
all right we're here one home is
rendered but now if I go to home you
know it's two is rendered why is that
happening this might be another thing
that can happen to you
and the reason for that is they now have
a new word you can use called exact so
if you use exact exactly I mean exactly
what it sounds like it matches this
exact path what's happening is this
matches here so we can show you this a
third time it's home - right so if I go
to slash home slash - there's going to
be actually three components right
because it matches on this it matches on
this and it matches on this so we should
see three homes and but we can fix this
by using the exact keywords so passing
exact we should now get only one / and
there you go you're good now this div is
not the best way to actually do this
right then just putting a div here they
actually have a special component you
can use called a switch so let's see
where it is here it is so switch and
check it out it just wraps your routes
and the reason for switch is it matches
exactly one of your route - so that's
helpful
so we're going to go ahead and pass a
switch here and we'll put our switch
here instead of using and you can see
this is how this different assuming
about the routes unique that renders our
route exclusively in contrast every rep
a matches location renders exclusively
consider this code no URL is in slash
then and it will endure all because they
all match the path so this is this is
what I was just showing you right we
were able to get rid of that with exact
another ways with switch and switch
matches the first thing so the first
thing you want to match
so you don't have to use switch if you
don't want to if there's some scenarios
where you want multiple to match you can
do that for the most part you switch
usually along one component now there's
now a new way to do this I mean at least
I think it's new I didn't see in version
3 should be in the QuickStart is using
render ok they're not using range of
your cell to show you guys what it looks
like so instead of doing component what
you can do is render and so that can be
a function and it just renders like this
so same thing is going to happen with as
the component in this case notice how
home shows up just fine so you might ask
why would I ever want to use render well
render you can actually pack into some
props here and then you can do a spread
here and now your home component
actually has some extra props and one of
the extra props which is very useful and
will actually there's multiple very
useful ones they will have I'll just go
to the bottom here match they'll have
location and histories what they pass in
so history will have basically how
you've navigated the page and allow you
to push so you can programmatically
switch different pages so I'm going to
come over here to my home and let's go
ahead and make this a regular class I do
not make it a class we'll do props and
we'll just go ahead and print what the
props are so you can see what's going on
so return and we can console dot log
props
come over here to our console against
your objects so history location match
like I told you guys history the main
thing I use with this is push pushes you
to different location match has some
parameters on how you match this URL and
params if I believe that's for queries
like if I do
hello is equal to 2 I believe that's in
the match nope on that it's in location
then yeah here's location see how to add
search and as these things
okay so mostly I'm using history so I'll
just show you guys possibly use cases
history so we can say we can make this a
class for example so actually let's give
this class Oh extends react component
and then on component will mount maybe
I'll do an if can be some condition
where you want to do something and I'll
do this by history dot push and then I'm
going to specify slash home slash I just
got pushed the equal true and then we're
going to just do our render function
here return let's just return a div with
high so you may be a used to in the past
expected string you might be what we
need to export this you might be in the
past used to getting the history like
importing it up here now you get history
from the props and you have to access it
there so now what I'm about to
demonstrate to you guys is when I reload
this page so I just say this when this
page reloads we're going to go to this
home page Coppola mount and then we're
actually going to push to this other
page here
while you're going to push of
console.log I for whatever reason we
didn't push maybe history is broken area
so we went to /home I don't know why
constantly like hide it show up in the
comp let's run this one more time area
high shows up and then we're redirected
so push make helps you change pages link
is the same way you guys should know how
link works easy prey a Crowder before
lets you switch pages the only other
thing I found really interesting is that
I use is the redirect tag which I
believe they used to have I don't know
for sure but with authentication they
have an authentication one area
redirects off so I really like their
authentication example right here I use
this in my applications so basically
what it does is you do some kind of test
to see if they're authenticated if they
are just go ahead and pass the opponent
if not you pass a redirect component and
the redirect component just takes you to
another page pretty plain simple cut dry
so that's about it for reactor router
guys there's one last thing I want to
make another video about and that is
using this with redux Agha because a big
use case in my opinion is doing a
pushing with history after like for
example someone logs in so being able to
switch a page when someone logs in and
then another one is with when you have
routes like this we can passion like
parameters so make two more videos one
about this asking these guys and another
about using this with redux saga because
i think that's a big one so thank you
guys for watching and stay tuned more
reactor out or for stuff is coming out
soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
