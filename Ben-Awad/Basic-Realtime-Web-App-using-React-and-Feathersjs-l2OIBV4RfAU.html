you how to make a real-time basic
application using feathers J s and react
so right now I'm gonna show you the
finished product
that we're gonna be making this is just
a little simple website right here using
react it's using sockets and then right
here I have postman opened up and I
noticed I have my localhost there's a
feathers server that I running and I
just have a service up tacos and we're
gonna make a post request to it
I'm gonna watch as our application
updates live without us refreshing the
page or anything so I'm just gonna send
it it looks like our server responded
okay and you notice that it's updated
over here automatically now let's say I
only want one and you can see it pops up
over here as well so I can just change
the values however I want and I can just
keep updating this you'll notice it'll
update putting in my new items like that
throwing it so that's super cool
let's get into how this is done so open
up a terminal window and then first just
make a folder called but I'm gonna call
mine back in you can call whatever you
like go into that and then we're gonna
be using the feathers command line tools
so if you do feathers generate that will
in the backend folder this will go ahead
and burn us a prompt we can set up our
project or just hit enter to everything
all the default settings are good it
automatically comes with sockets which
we want that's very cool
if you're not familiar with this what
this feathers command-line application
is I'll post something in description
below it just lets you set up a feathers
app really super easy okay so this is
almost done making and when this is done
what we're gonna do is we're going to
set up a service creating tacos and
that's it that's all you need to do for
the backend and it already comes
built-in to you sockets
and you're all set up just like that
it's really nice using sockets with
feathers as you're about to see okay so
it looks like we're just about finished
downloading looks like this is the last
one and we can exit out of this little
window and we're just do feathers
generate service all right I'm gonna
call this taco Lani's database we'll
just use the needy be no authentication
needed and our service is good okay
so this is pretty much done right now
the back end is all good it's finished
now let's just work on the front end
react code that we're gonna be using so
I'm gonna move back up and then I want
you guys to clone a dis repository this
is just the basic react template that I
set up it just has
saga react redux reactor outer all that
stuff setup and already done so it'll be
very easy we just add the sockets to it
so go ahead and clone this irie have
this clone so I will not run that but
I'll put a link to it below of what to
clone and once you have that cloned just
CD into it then do MPM install I already
have this done install already but if
your first time make sure to do that and
then do NPM install save socket dot io /
client this is a client socket I have a
library that we'll be using
so make sure to run that as well and if
you just look inside of this is a basic
react application you can see I already
set up some actions some stores and is
just dummy code that's ready to be
filled out by us right now so the first
thing I want to do is initialize the
feathers application what you like to do
in the store so the first thing and we
won't be using sagar for this but i'm
just and leave it in for now
the first thing we're going to just
import is feathers so import feathers
from feather client and then we're also
gonna import io from socket IO client
and then down here you can put this just
about anywhere I'm gonna put it below my
store I'm just gonna initialize some
stuff so first I'm gonna put the host
what you're gonna be localhost and this
is the port and the URL that your server
is gonna be set up at so by default
feathers goes to this one so I'm gonna
set to this one but if yours others were
going somewhere else make sure to put
that there and then when I create a
socket I'll just do I owe
I believe it's dot nope just host just
like that and then we're gonna export
Kant's app I care feathers so dot
configure feathers thoughts socket IO
passing in socket and then dot configure
feathers dot hooks okay so that
initializes the feathers application get
to setup with sockets and points that
have two server that we're gonna be
meeting okay very good so next we're
gonna go into our components and
actually start listening for socket
change for changes in the server so this
is going to be in our components main
folder I'm just going to come down here
and create a new function so we're in
Kate a function called component did
mount so this is a function that react
calls for you and this is it did the
component mount that that's exactly look
like if it if it is glowing
on to the page then it will call this
function and it only calls it once which
is important because we only want to do
this once so we're just gonna get that
app that we initialized in our store and
we're just going to create our service
so oops not app
tacos tacos service app dot service
tacos and then from our taco service
we're just going to create we're going
to do on what this says is this lets you
do sockets so you can say when created
when deleted we're gonna do one created
so every time a new taco is created this
function is going to be called it's
gonna pass a taco and so every time
something is created in the server it's
gonna call our function right here so
what we'd like to do is we'd like to
update the UI and show that we have a
new taco being displayed so we're just
saying create a function that's gonna
we're gonna do an action and then a
reducer for it so this sock props dot
new taco passing in taco so we have to
actually go create this function new
taco now in our actions so save that
we're all done with that and then we're
gonna go into actions action creators
and we're gonna export function and this
is the new taco passing in taco as a
parameter and all we're gonna do is
we're going to turn a object and it'll
be new new taco and then right here
we'll pass in the taco so this is going
to be an action that we're going to
dispatch to one of our Redux reducers
and it'll add this to the state of our
application so every time a new taco is
created on the feather server it'll call
our function right here passing the taco
in what we'd like to do is update our
state so we're going to go into
reducers and we're hearing create a talk
overdue sir okay so we're just gonna say
function Taco call it tacos and it's
gonna take a state at first we have no
tacos just empty array and action before
I forget let's just export default tacos
and then we're going to do a switch
statement we're gonna do action type and
then case number one it is new taco if
it is what we'd like to return is our a
new array with all the elements in the
old state adding on our new taco that we
just got so just like that
so we're getting a new array we're
adding all elements from our old state
and then we're adding the taco and then
when you need to set a default state
which we just returned state okay so now
we just need to add this to our route
reducer so it's index so we're gonna
reduce your slash index and we're just
gonna import
taco tacos from tacos now I just want to
double check and make sure I need it
taku juicers and I call it taco not
tacos okay and we're just gonna right
here do tacos add that to our reducer
oops and this should not be in a string
and all right awesome so what's gonna
happen is it's gonna call that reducer
and it's gonna add tacos to our state
now we just need to then go to our
components app we're gonna add that
state to the props so we're gonna say
tacos
to state talkers just like that so
awesome now if we were to make a post it
will add our tacos to the state now we
just want to show it on the screen so
we're just gonna go to components and
then home and then right here we'll
create a div and we'll say this got
props dot tacos
dot map and the first printer is the
taco
second is the position and we'll just
create a paragraph tag key makes unique
so this is for reacts purpose so it
loads faster and knows which ones to
reload and in the middle here we're just
gonna do json stringify
because the taco is a json object and
we're just going to close that p tag
awesome and just like that we are done
so I'm just going to save that and give
this thing a run I'm just gonna close my
other two tabs real quick that we're
running the server before to launch this
one okay so I'm just gonna do it NPM
start and my front end I'm gonna create
a new tab and I'm gonna go come back
over here go back to our back-end you
NPM start so I have the feather server
running and I have the react server
running as you can see oh and looks like
do we have a syntax error we can fix
real quick
let's see feathers ran okay and up I
just did a send Mike wanted n't so if
you go into source components app get
rid of the semicolon this is a JSON
object those should not be there so
start that up again and
does it look like we're running good
we're loading once this thing is loading
we'll try making a post adding this to
our feather server and see if it updates
live here let's see it's just starting
up still failed to compile module not
found feathers client okay so I just
forgot to install one package so install
save feathers client is needed as well
and we'll let this finish installing and
then I will start the server again and
notice reacts message error messages are
very nice and clear they tell you
exactly what is wrong so you can go and
fix them it's really nice I knew exactly
which module I need to now load and add
to that okay so we're just gonna try to
start up the server again see if I was
missing anything else this one looks
like it's loading a little bit faster
maybe we are all clear of syntax errors
and there we go okay it popped up
alright so at first we don't see
anything that's what we would expect we
have not posted anything yet so well
it's just that let's start posting
something so I I use postman we can use
curl or some other things we're just
gonna post to our server
mine's at localhost 3030 so I'm gonna
send and we sent it responded okay and
very nice we see it pop up over here no
refresh of the page we just see it pop
up if I send it again it send against
and again just keep sending and then we
notice it's updating real-time and looks
really nice
so you notice IDs are different on each
one of these guys
you can change this again to a different
word if you want to and you can see
they're posting now this is just a dummy
application to get show you the concept
and the power of sockets and how cool
they can be as you can see the pages
changes without reloading which is
really awesome um this is a little
teaser I'm gonna be making a larger
application using sockets in the future
and future videos coming up real soon so
if you want to see how to build a big
application using sockets do subscribe
and watch for that video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
