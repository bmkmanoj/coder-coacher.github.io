picker nicely here and now I'd like to
be able to submit this form and actually
send it to the server
so let's go ahead and do that we're done
with date picker for now but what we'd
like to do is add this request create
auction so you can click on index file
and this is an action we're going to get
quest create option and this is going to
come from up up going into modules
auction and then action actions and then
we're just going to add that to our
props that way you can actually call
that so now instead of console logging
it actually I call this function which
we're actually passing it now let's
actually create this action so the
pressed auctions request create auction
and when you come down here I'm going to
say request create auction all right so
we have the action hooked up now we can
add a saga so we can copy that paste it
and here this is going to be a create
auction saga and we need to import
request create auction
that's where I listen for here quest
great option and when we get that we're
going to call create auction
and then we're going to call create
auction now create auction we're getting
from oops oh yeah we're getting from API
which we're going to create a new API so
here we are we're calling create option
getting the response for logger response
and then actually what we really just
want to do is redirect them to the
auction page we don't really need to do
anything else if there's not near that
is so if there's an error we'll have to
deal with that I'm not sure what type of
error we would get from the server we'd
pretty much be able to accept anything
so here it's not air then we would like
to redirect to a new page so for now we
redirect to the main page so import
actions from react native router flux
and actions oops and I forget the name
that we used for view actually I think
it was few options it's just like that
okay that looks good and now we just
want to create this create auction so if
I go to the API here we can actually
copy because it's going to look just
about the same create auction they're
going to create and the rest actually
say the exact same all right unless I
made an error typing I think we are
finished there so and actually while
we're at it now that we got that page
where
you want to come back and make this the
initial page alright so we have our list
of auctions create a new one this is
going to be a toothbrush
I did this for twenty dollars and
actually not create 20 this is cheap but
if it stood for three dollars and thirty
cents make sure decibels working now
select the date this will be due
tomorrow confirm
now let's submit all right we're getting
a bad request current price cannot be
null and the reason for that is we are
just passing in we just need to change
what the name of everything is so we're
just passing the wrong names in so
that's going to be and not here remove
that down here done here I think here
so in our auction form we just need to
change what we're naming these so name
is fine but this needs to be current
price and expiration date is date all
right and it doesn't like the comma oh
there's a trailing space center now
let's try this again green auctioned
toothbrush $3.30 click the date select
tomorrow submit and all right hopefully
get submitted okay took us to this page
now if I scroll to the bottom I see the
toothbrush and check it out 24 hours
from now it's ticking down so it all
looks good
awesome so now we can add in auctions
using our form that's all
for this video in the next video I think
we will I think work on sorting because
I just added an auction I'd like to see
it at the top maybe or a sort in some
way so we'll do that in the next video
and I'll see them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
