been streaming or have made a video in a
couple days I've been made mostly just
doing a little bit of a coding here and
there and I've made a bunch of changes
and updates to the apps I want to update
you guys and show you where we're at so
I'm gonna I'm just running the app right
now to show you what this looks like
right now and what changes I've made so
it looks very similar um we just add
another item they'll notice you know
it's this buttons a little different I
just changed the color of this it didn't
change anything else okay if you add a
new item and we type in whatever text we
want if you click this edit button I now
change it to the cursor stays on the
right normally when you press up on the
cursors on the Left I change that okay
and then everything's working I don't
know if you guys remember but I used to
have a problem with the drag and
dropping so if I just add a couple items
here notice if I try dragging and
dropping this I was gonna say normally I
don't have a problem but we're just
having one there here let me boot up a
earlier we reopened genymotion I solved
this problem with having moving these
around for a earlier I can't get it to
work for API 21 and up but I've got like
if I load the app on galaxy s5 and try
doing this it works just fine and the
reason for that is here let me move this
over
if you come into here I changed my which
I'll call it my adapter come into this
so what I changed about it is right down
here I did I looked up some kind of
Stack Overflow and they suggested
changing has stable IDs from beasts
being true all the time to on this land
right here so this will this it makes it
work I don't know if I need to return
false all the time I'm afraid that will
break everything I mean I could try it
right now and see I mean I don't have
anything to lose let's try it
I should probably copy that just in case
I'll come back to actually so if it's
less than 20 okay
so never mind doing that the false won't
do anything so if the dragon drop works
on everything
besides API 21 and up and this is API 21
so it works pretty well except for that
one time when I add an item I'm not sure
exactly what I want to do how to chant
go about changing that
besides that worked out works pretty
well and everything's working here if I
click this it brings it to the bottom
uncheck checks everything also in our
iteration I made is when someone leaves
the note empty right now this is a hint
so you can start typing but if they
don't add anything and I push back I
automatically call it untitled for them
now the next thing I did was I don't
know if you guys remember last time but
these were two recycler views now this
is one recycler view and you can scroll
up and down and that looks really nice
so like if for example if these notes go
below the bottom so let me just add a
couple more notes to show you I'm
talking about
if these notes get longer than here it
will allow me to scroll and it will
scroll the whole list so this is just
adding some items and add a couple so
I've been working on trying to do some
material design things and I've been
trying to work on the animation I found
a pretty cool library that does
animation you know just when I click on
this button right here the animation
that goes off like that um I tried
adding that animation to other buttons
and it's working pretty well now I
haven't got it perfect but I I feel like
if I tweak it a little bit I can get it
to a point that looks really nice and
I'll show you the button that I add the
anime should do this animation right
there's a default material design
animation that Android is doing for me
so I don't even have to do that all
right so if we just add one last note
all right now if I scroll down notice
how it Scrolls everything together
whereas before we were doing just one
column at a time so that's looking
really nice and what I did for that is I
just made this into a worn recycler view
and then I passed in two of these card
views at the same time so the next
update that I have added was just how
will you delete these items so if I
force touch or not force touch if I
click and hold one of these notes it
will get a little border around it
you know make sure not to press too long
good oops I'm really but it's really
hard to do this on the emulator let's go
back up okay so when I hold down to
click on one of these notes it'll get a
little border kind of like a highlight
if you will and you'll see it changes
the action bar if we push this little
back button it just unhighlight s-- I'll
fee highlight that again come back to it
and if you saw a little animation that's
the animation that I was talking about
this button I had to add myself and if I
click right here we can actually share
this note like this it brings up on
different share options now on this
device only has bluetooth and messaging
so I'm not gonna click that because
there's no other apps but what happens
is it will check on your phone if you
were to download this app it checks all
the different apps on your phone and
sees which apps you can actually share
text with and it'll share the text of
your note
it'll take this note it'll take untitled
KK and it will save that and share to
Nara app for example Gmail text message
and you can share notes like that so
that's a pretty cool feature that I
added I can show you guys how I add at
that as well as I put this alike on if
you just want a trash bin so if we just
click on that and it just deletes it and
I can do this for anyone so this one
this one you know whatever I like once
ok so this is how I the intent I made
this is how I did the intense this is my
share intent so whenever someone clicks
that button I call the share intent
thing and I just pass in the text that I
want to share and this is the text in
the note and all I'm doing is I'm doing
a plane all I'm sending is text to share
and all I'm all I have to do is put
intent extra text and this will pass in
the text I want to share and then I just
do this creat cheeser here and that
brings up that little pop-up you guys
saw ok so
that's how this app is looking right now
and this is basically I just made this
app to learn and practice so I don't
feel like I've added anything special
that no other to-do list is doing so I'm
not really gonna bother posting this or
putting this on the App Store but I'm
gonna go ahead and I'm gonna make it
open source and I already made my water
repository I'm also gonna put on github
and I think I'm just going to stop the
development right here I could make it
nicer like the styles and the animations
and add to it but I don't want to bother
going to all that word 2 for this app
because I don't want to put on the store
I don't feel like it's adding anything
special and I want to work on another
app before that I just wanted to
practice making this I think it wouldn't
worked out really well and I like where
it's out and I'll post a the repository
to github in the description so if you
guys want to if you guys want to add on
to this project you can if you want to
so this is what we're looking at right
now I think it looks pretty nice it's
real basic to-do list and I like it I
could add some more features but I think
I'm just gonna leave it like this for
now and the next thing I want to start
working on is Kotlin and I don't know if
you guys have heard about that it's a
new programming language or I don't know
if it's a programming language but it's
a way to write Android apps besides
using Java and so I thought I would I
want to check that out and so right now
I'm gonna go ahead and go through the
tutorial for that so I'm gonna clear my
emulator down and we can just close this
project so we're done with this project
for now actually before I'm done with
this
project let me go ahead and let me go
ahead and save this to Maya I push this
repository so I'm just going to copy
this into or not copy just go into my
project Oh what oh that's right alright
so just gonna I'm just gonna add all the
files and then I'm just gonna commit and
I'm just gonna say final not final basic
let's say undesigned basic to-do list
that's basically where where it's at
right now and then I'm just gonna push
that repository push get push and I'm
just gonna say let's see its origin
master and that will push to my
bitbucket repository I also just want to
make a github repository real quick as
well for the project so if I just come
here create new repository Android to-do
list no description for now public
initialize this repository we don't have
to worry about doing that all right
we're just gonna push her go ahead and
push this
all right your head origin so we need to
call it something else let's call it
origin - and then we're just gonna push
it we don't want to put put the U flag
either
so just origin - and then master ok put
my username my password looks like it's
successfully went in I'll check it out
and cool so it's right here for you guys
to check out
github comm slash bin a wad slash
Android to do list and I will post that
in the description of this video ok so
let's go ahead and check out the
tutorial for Collin alright so we want
to go ahead and give this thing a try if
we just look at this so why we were
using Kotlin avoid entire classes of
areas such as null pointer exceptions oh
wow how is that get rid of those pesky
null pointer exceptions you know the
billion dollar mistake I'll put you
first column front of the queue from
mistakenly operating on all types
including those from Java that's kinda
neat concise versatile interoperable
build server-side applications Android
apps in front code running in the
browser
that's Regal alright so we're gonna use
all can I not use this guy not use
Android studio and I like Android studio
who's using it Prezi is
all right let's go sing a try
so starting to interview project Oakland
hello world next next next next want
that build it did it go
okay yeah all right this is Tori walks
us through cleaning a simple little
application using IntelliJ alright store
we're gonna use this alright so we just
need to go to plugins and download the
cotton plug-in we'll do that once
cradles done building
they're stinging quite long time to
build look at their website a little bit
more while we wait for that to finish
it's just kind of interesting args so
this looks a little different than
adjustor ago Java function so your
package level function main which
returns unit and takes an array of
strings as a printer
oh so you can just semicolons are
optional oh that's neat
so it's so I guess they do spacing
now they do brackets for space I guess
so
I can't do like something like that I'll
be done building all right cool let's go
ahead and pull screen again let's
download all right we're actually might
take a second to download so Kotlin just
come up here
all right let me just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
