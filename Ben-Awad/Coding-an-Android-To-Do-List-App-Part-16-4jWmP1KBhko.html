been streaming or have made a video in a
couple days I've been made mostly just
doing a little bit of a coding here and
there and I've made a bunch of changes
and updates to the apps i want to update
you guys and show you where we're at so
I'm just running the app right now show
you what this looks like right now and
what changes I've made so it looks very
similar um we just add another item
they'll notice you know it's this
buttons a little different I just change
the color of this it didn't change
anything else ok uh if you add a new
item and we type in whatever text you
want if you click this edit button I now
change it to the cursor stays on the
right normally when you press up on the
cursor on the Left I change that okay
and everything's working I don't know if
you guys remember but I used to have a
problem with the dragon dropping so if I
just add a couple items here notice if I
try dragging and dropping this I was
going to say normally I don't have a
problem but we're just having one there
here let me boot up a earlier wait
reopen genymotion um I solve this
problem with having moving these around
for a year I can't get it to work for
API 21 and up but I've got like if I
load the app on galaxy s5 and try giving
this it works just fine and the reason
for that is here let me move this over
if you come into here I changed my which
I will call it my adapter so we come
into this so what I changed about it is
right down here I did I looked up some
kind of stack overflow and they
suggested changing has stable IDs from
beasts being true all the time to on
this land right here so this will this
it makes it work I don't know if I need
to return false all the time I'm afraid
that will break everything I I could try
it right now see I mean I don't have
anything to lose let's try it I should
probably copy that just in case I'll
come back to actually so if it's less
than 20 okay so there are my foot doing
that the false won't do anything so if
the drag-and-drop works on everything
besides API 21 and up and this is API 21
so it works pretty well except for that
one time when i add an item i'm not sure
exactly what i want to do how to chant
go about changing that besides that
worked out works pretty well and
everything is working here if I click
this it brings it to the bottom and
check or checks everything also in our
iteration I made is when someone leaves
the note empty right now this is a hint
so you can start typing but if they
don't add anything and i push back i
automatically call it untitled for them
now the next thing i did was i don't
know if you guys remember last time but
these were two recycler views now this
is one recyclerview and you can scroll
up and down and that looks really nice
so like if for example if these um notes
go
below the bottom so let me just add a
couple more notes to show you I'm
talking about if these notes get longer
than here it will allow me to scroll and
it will scroll the whole list so this is
just adding some items and add a couple
so I've been working on trying to do
some material design things and I've
been trying to work on the animation I
found a pretty cool library that does
animation no just when I click on this
button right here the animation that
goes off like that um I tried adding
that animation to other buttons and it's
working pretty well now I haven't got it
perfect but I I feel like if I tweaked
it a little bit i can get it to a point
that looks really nice and i'll show you
the button that I add the animation to
this animation right there is a default
material design animation that Android
is doing for me so I don't even have to
do that all right so if we just add one
last note all right now if I scroll down
notice how it Scrolls everything
together whereas before we were doing
just one column at a time so that's
looking really nice and what I did for
that is I just made this into warren
recycler view and then I passed into of
these card views at the same time so the
next update that I have added was just
how will you delete these items so if I
am force touch you're not forced touch
if I click and hold one of these notes
it will get a little border around it
you know make sure not to press too long
good oops I'm really but it's really
hard to do this on the emulator scroll
back up okay so when I hold down to
click on one of these notes it'll get a
little border kind of like a highlight
if you will and you'll see it changes
the action bar if we push this little
back button it just on highlights Alfie
highlight that again come back to it and
if you saw a little animation that's the
animation that I was talking about this
button I had to add myself and if I
click right here we can actually share
this note like this it brings up on
different share options now on this
device and way has bluetooth and
messaging so I'm not going to click that
because there's no other apps but what
happens is it will check on your phone
if you were to download this app it
checks all the different apps on your
phone and sees which apps you can
actually share text with and it will
share the text of your note this will
take this note it'll take untitled kay
Kay and it will save that and cher tune
our app for example gmail a text message
and you can share notes like that so
that's a pretty cool feature that I
added I can show you guys how I added
that as well as I put this like on if
you just want a trash bin so if we just
click on that and it just deletes it and
I can do this for anyone so this one on
this one you know whatever I like once
okay so this is how I then the intent i
made this is how i did that intense this
is my share intent so whenever someone
clicks that button i call the sharing
tint thing and I just pass in the text
that I want to share and this is the
text in the note and all i'm doing is
i'm doing a plane all i'm sending his
text to share and all I'm all I have to
do is put a intent extra text and this
will pass in the text i want to share
and i just do this creature here and
that brings up that will pop up you guys
saw
so that's how this app is looking right
now and this is basically I just made
this app to learn and practice so I
don't feel like I've added anything
special that no other to-do list is
doing so I'm not really gonna bother
posting this or putting this on the App
Store bum and go ahead and I'm gonna
make it open source and I already made
my one repository i'm also going to put
on github and i think i'm just going to
stop the development right here i could
make it nicer like the styles and the
animations and add to it but I don't
know bother going to all that word to UM
for this app because I don't want to put
on the store I don't feel like it's
adding anything special and I want to
work on another app before that I just
wanted to practice making this I think
it went worked out really well and I
like where it's out and i'll post a the
repository to github in the description
so if you guys want to if you guys want
to add on to this project you can if you
want to so this is what we're looking at
right now I think it looks pretty nice
um it's real basic to-do list and i like
it i could add some more features but i
think i'm just going to leave it like
this for now and the next thing i want
to start working on is um Kotlin and i
don't know if you guys have heard about
that it's a new programming language or
i don't know if it's a programming
language but it's a way to write android
apps besides using java and so i thought
i would I want to check that out and so
right now i'm gonna go ahead and go
through the tutorial for that so i'm
going to clean my emulator down and we
just close this projects so we're done
with this project for now
actually before i'm done with this
project let me go ahead and let me go
ahead and save this to my touch this
repository so i'm just going to copy
this into or not copy just go into my
project oh what oh that's right see talk
alright so just gonna I'm just going to
add all the files and then I'm just
going to commit and I'm just going to
say um final not final basic let's say
undesigned basic to-do list that's
basically where it's at right now and
then I'm just gonna push that repository
so push up git push and I'm just going
to say let's see its origin master and
that will push my bitbucket um
repository I also just want to make a
github repository real quick as well for
the project so if I just come here
create new repository Android to-do list
no description for now public initialize
this repository we don't have to worry
about doing that all right we're just
going to push her and push this
all right we read origin so we need to
call it something else let's call it
origin two and then we're just going to
push it we don't want to put put the U
flag either so just for gen 2 and then
master okay put my username or password
alright looks like it's successfully
went in I'll check it out and cool so
it's right here for you guys to check
out um github com slash bin a wad /
android to-do list and i will post that
in the description of this video okay so
let's go ahead and check out the
tutorial for Colin alright so we want to
go ahead and give this thing a try if we
just look at this so while you were
using Kotlin avoid entire classes of
areas such as null pointer exceptions oh
wow how is that get rid of those pesky
null pointer exceptions you know the
billion-dollar mistake I'll put you
first column front of the queue from
mistakenly operating on all types
including those from Java this kinda
neat concise versatile interoperable
build service I applications to android
apps and front code running in the
browser and that's regal alright so
we're going to use all can I not use
this guy not use Android studio I like
androids to view who's
using it Prezi is all right good thing a
try
so start a new Android studio project
plan hello world next next next next
let that build it did it go okay yeah
all right this is Tori walks us through
cleaning a simple application using
IntelliJ all right let's tour we're
going to use this all right so we just
need to go to plugins and download the
cotton plugin will do that once cradles
done builder
stinging quite long time to build let's
look at their website a little bit more
while we wait for that to finish
this is kind of interesting args so this
looks a little different than just
regular Java function clear your package
level function main which returns unit
and takes an array of strings as a
printer oh so you can just semicolons
are optional oh that's neat so it's so I
guess they do spacing now they do
brackets for space I guess so I can't do
like them like that are we done building
alright cool let's go ahead and full
screen and let's download all right
we're actually might take a second to
download so Colin come up here
on let me just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
