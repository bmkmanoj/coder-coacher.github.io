with showing you how to print out a
basically the text on a file some sort
so the first thing is I'm just going to
open up a text editor right now I'm in
Visual Studio code but you can open
sublime or Adam and we're just going to
create a little readme file to test out
and play with so I'm just created with
some simple text in it and I'm just
going to save it in my downloads folder
and I'm just going to call this read me
mb okay I saved in my downloads now I'm
going to come over to terminal and I'm
currently just hitting my home directory
or home folder and I want to move to my
download so i can go look at that file
i'm going to do CD downloads if we do an
LS will notice we see the readme and i
want to see what's inside of it I want
to see these words right there so to do
that if you do cat and then the name of
the file so read me um it'll actually
notice it will print out hashtag hello
world and then what's up notice because
we didn't put a new line at the end it's
kind of messed up with our prompt right
there if we go back real quick and add a
new line saved and then cat the readme
again shows up now did you notice how
fast I was able to type cat read me
right there it would call fast I track
that I type it again just kidding i'm
not actually typing what's happening is
you notice the last command we type this
cat read me if you hit up arrow it'll
actually show you the last command you
just typed and you can do it again so
all I was doing is hang up arrow and
typing again so that's really handy if
for example now I want to cat may be
reviewed txt I can just do hit up arrow
modify the command a little bit and then
run it again so it was clear so let's
super duper handy the next thing i want
to show you is copy
so let's say I want to copy read me I
would do the CP the name of the file
that want to copy and then the new name
we can call it Bob if we wanted to now
if week at Bob we should see hello world
and we do awesome let's say I want to
rename Bob so maybe I want to get call
him dawn or Don's a bad name no offense
Don's let's call it let's call it
Sebastian that's a good name so if I
just do MV and then Bob the name of file
and its new name that will change it for
so if we do an LS we'll see we have read
me and we have Sebastian and bob is gone
Bob this no longer there if I cat
sebastian has all the stuff in it
awesome that we would expect Bob to have
it so this is Bob I'll notice the move
command a Sebastian and then something
else ABC notice how this actually
renames it you can also use it to move
something so if the second command is
not a folder or second parameter is not
a folder it actually renames it but if
it is folder it moves it in there so for
example if I'm a directory called f1 and
I tried moving Sebastian and then f 1 is
my second parameter it would not rename
Sebastian is f1 it would move Sebastian
into f1 like that that we do an LS we
just see f1 and then Sebastian also good
to note you cannot just copy directories
like this you have to do the dash our
flag because you have to recursively
copy all the files inside of a directory
so for example I can copy f1 and f2
you're not in to make a copy of so if I
do an LS now we have F 2 so if i do
analysis of f1 we had Sebastian in their
video else of f2 you have Sebastian in
there too and we can even cat Sebastian
f2 and we notice that this hollow world
what's up ok very cool we're able to
copy
move things notice i can move i can also
rename folders the same thing so f 3 f
22 f 3 we don't have a folder called f3
so it renames f2 to f3 now we have a
folder named f1 so if i did move f3 to
f1 it would now move f3 inside of f1 so
if i didn't LS we now just have f1 and
read me here and fitted LS of f1 we
notice we have f1 and Sebastian in there
and if I did an LS of f1 and I did f3 so
this is an LS on f3 we see Sebastian in
there as well cool and you guys remember
how to delete those so I want to remove
f1 so I do remove our F and F 1 is gone
by so those are really helpful commands
right there I just showed you most
important when I want you to remember is
up arrow that guy you'll use a ton I
wonder you run the last command I just
hit the up arrow and you can keep going
so notice how the last command i did was
LS hit the up arrow once its LS hit up
arrow again still Alaska Zoo else here
up arrow LS here again if I hit up arrow
again we're not on remove our F and you
can just keep hanging up air out and
getting earlier commands that you have
already typed super helpful to rename
files you do move in the name of the
first file and then the name of the
second file so move read me too maybe a
that renames it to copy a file you put
the name of the first one the second one
now creates two to do copies of folders
you have to do the dash our flag and
then cat was the last thing that we
taught you and cat was we do cat a that
prints the contents of a that was a lot
of material right there I'll put in the
description all the commands that we
just did watch this video again this is
a very important one knowing all these
commands is super helpful if you have
any questions on how any of these work
leave a comment below and I'd be happy
to help you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
