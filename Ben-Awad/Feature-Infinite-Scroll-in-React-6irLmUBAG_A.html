our messages right now where we have a
small number of them and then if you
wanted to see more we scroll up to the
top and click load more now that's not
actually how slack or most websites work
these days
for example Twitter has infinite
scrolling sort of slack where you don't
even notice it hides it behind the
scenes so as you scroll up and you reach
the end of the list it'll automatically
make a request to the server to fetch
more and then it'll append more items at
the end of the list and you just keep
scrolling so that's what we're gonna
make today now to do this what we need
to do is basically know when we reach
the top of this container and when we
reach the top of this container we want
to basically have a call back and fetch
our items and then load it on the list
so to do this we actually need to have
access to the div where that scrollbar
is so we're gonna have to make a div on
the outside here because we can't get
reference to this file upload component
because we don't want to access the drop
zone component we need an actual div
that has that overflow on it so we're
gonna wrap our whole thing with a div
here and we're gonna basically copy all
the styles over style
and we're gonna copy hoops all of it
here and we're gonna keep these two on
the file upload component that way it's
in the right direction and then here
this is why I wanted to switch this to a
div is because I need to have the
reference to it so I'm gonna say I'm
gonna call it scroller is equal to this
dot scroller is equal to scroller okay
so now we have access to this scroller
object and whenever we scroll on this
div I want to know about it so there's a
callback called on scroll and then we're
gonna create a function called handle
scroll this guy handles rule so right
now and my handle scroll function I just
want to show you guys how this works so
I'm going to console dot log this dot
scroller and I want to make sure this
das scroller exists first so this Dutch
scored a scroll top so scroll top keeps
basically your position of where you are
in this so let's refresh so notice how
the numbers are getting smaller here as
I scroll further and further up this
list and then I reach the very top I hit
zero and if I scroll back down the
numbers get smaller so basically all I'm
gonna listen for is when we approach
zero so maybe when this number is less
than 0 or less than 100 I mean or less
than 200 that's a number you can play
with but a threshold we can say we've
reached the top so for example so and
this dot scroller scroll top
less than a hundred we can say reached
top so now as I scroll up I reach the
top it says reached top so instead of
just console logging reached top now I
can actually fetch my elements in that
function and populate it so instead of
having this button here we can actually
delete the button but we can copy these
conditions because they still are valid
so and so here we want to make sure we
have more items to fetch and then the
message length is greater than 35 and
I'm just gonna copy the props into here
because we need them as well we don't
care about loading though that's the
only one okay and then I'm gonna copy
fetch more and put that in here as well
and now we can delete her button down
here okay
looks good so now what we're doing is
when we reach to the top we're gonna
fetch more and then add our elements to
the list so now watch the scrollbar as
I'm scrolling you can notice it got a
little bit smaller there and a little
bit smaller so you can tell we're
actually fetching more items and it
takes longer to get to the top of the
list
now it's annoying that it takes us to
the bottom the list every time so we're
gonna fix that but first we have to
understand why it's doing that the
reason it is is because initially we
have some number of items for us it's
going to be usually around 35 and then
we get a new set of items 70 items and
so react pushes us to the very bottom
when it receives a new number of items
so 70 35 more so instead of pushing it
to the bottom we want to basically
listen for when we get more items and
then move the scrollbar back up to where
we were so the way we're going to do
that is receive component will receive
props this component this lifestyle
lifecycle method will be called every
time we get new props so if we get new
messages that's a prop we can listen for
it here so I'm going to say data
messages and a lot of common there now
we won't always have messages so we need
to make sure
messages exists and we need the same
thing with our current props so
component will receive props these are
the future props and we want to compare
them against our current props so we're
gonna say data and here we're gonna say
and I'm was gonna expand it but we don't
want the names to conflicts so I will
just say this props
dot data dot messages
so we want to make sure I have some
messages and I'm receiving new messages
and we want to make sure they're there
links don't match that means we got new
messages so dot link is not equal to
messages dot length so that means the
the message is propped changed in some
way because we got new messages and the
links don't match up we also want to
make sure we have access to this dot
scroller and what we're gonna do here is
we have not actually received the new
messages they have not actually rendered
so currently in this if statement there
are 35 items for example or it could be
70 but the new items have not rendered
so to get what I can do is I can get the
current height of that entire container
so Const current height is equal to this
dot scroller dot scroll height so the
scroll height is going to be the total
height of it and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna set a timeout and what's
that timeout does is it calls your
function after a certain amount of time
we're gonna say a hundred milliseconds
but this is a number you might need to
play with we basically want to wait
until wait for 70 items to render so
we're grabbing what our height of the
container is with 35 items and when the
35 so more items get rendered in we're
going to set this dot scroller
dot scroll top and this will if we set
this number this will actually change
the scrollbar so we're gonna set it
equal to this dot scroll or dot scroll
height so use the scroll height should
be larger here right because we have
more messages and we're just gonna
subtract it from current height so
current Heights not a great name for
this let's call it height before render
so that's gonna be the height before the
new messages are rendered then this is
the height when those new messages are
rendered and then we subtract the two to
get our position and we scroll to that
position and then here we're just
waiting 100 milliseconds to wait for it
to render all right so let's see this
now so scroll Scroll scroll and we went
to the bottom so something went wrong up
it worked there
it worked there so just our first one
broke and that's what I was talking
about you might need to change up how
many milliseconds you wait for so let's
try a hundred twenty all right
scroll through scroll and there we go
scroll scroll cool let's just make sure
that wasn't me just scrolling a lot yep
looks like our scrollbar works nicely so
we can scroll and it looks like it's a
continuous scroll for us we can refresh
and look at that again so as a free user
they just keep scrolling and seeing new
items but we're really loading more in
the background cool but there's one
problem with what we have right now so
let's say we start typing a message so
what's up
notice my scroll bar is now it's at the
very top of the list instead of where
what's up is and the reason for that is
we're listening
oops we're listening for new messages
here so when we send one single message
that increases the length by one so we
really just want to listen to when we're
fetching
more messages so we need to change our
if statement here and we know we're
fetching more if we're at the top of our
list here so what I'm gonna say is this
dot scroller dot scroll top is less than
100 so basically our condition threw in
to fetch more items has been met because
we're at the top so this won't affect
our actual scroll see the scroll still
works but now when I say hey guys what's
up instead of popping me to the top of
the list it will actually bring me to
the bottom and I see hey guys what's up
so cool so this is how you do infinite
scrolling this is at least one way to do
it so we're keeping track of the scroll
bar where it reaches the top we fetch
more items and then we adjust the scroll
bar to the position that you were at so
that's it for this video guys thank you
for watching
