Prisma server for our e-commerce app now
if you haven't already make sure you
install Prisma on your computer you can
do so with NPM with this command right
here now I already have it installed on
my computer so I'm not gonna run that
and the first thing I'm going to do is
create an empty folder you start the
project so I'm going to call it
ecommerce and I'm just gonna CD into
there so you want to make sure the
folder is empty cuz we're in around
Prisma and then inside of it and Prisma
an it will initialize the project and
notice how I put a little down the end
that says I want to initialize in the
current directory okay so it gives us a
choice we're gonna choose the full stack
boilerplate the other one is if you
don't want to set up a JavaScript server
yourself here we have a couple different
choices of the boilerplate to choose
from I'm gonna choose typescript but
feel free to choose node if you're more
comfortable with that we could have also
chose react but super you in react
natives so this won't really help us as
much now we have a choice between basic
and advanced we want to do
authentication and our apps so I'm going
to choose this one because it has some
of the authentication things already set
up for us now we could have chose the
other one and add authentication ourself
but this boilerplate does authentication
in a way that I like and have done very
similar before so we're just gonna use
this now let's gonna install all of the
JavaScript dependencies that we need and
then as you can see it runs Prisma
deploy so it's creating its gonna create
a Prisma server and also the my sequel
database and you have to choose where
you want this to run if you have a
docker install on your computer you can
run it locally which is what I'm gonna
do but feel free if you don't have
docker or you don't want to install dr.
docker you can use there's two public
development clusters that Prisma has
that you can use but I'm gonna click
local and right there so this is where
it's gonna set up the my sequel database
and the Prisma server that it uses so
it's going to be running locally on my
computer using docker ok so this is all
done good and it doesn't tell me where
my url
so if you don't see that what you can do
is you can run Prisma info and it tells
you hey we're running the cluster so
here's during the close to the local
cluster and here's where it's running so
we could click on this URL and go to it
right now if we wanted to and we'd be
able to play around and the graph QL
playground but we you might get a little
authentication error which we'll be
discussing and a little bit in the
future because we have you have to set a
header but I open up this code in Visual
Studio code and take a look at it now I
mentioned we had clicked the
authentication boilerplate so I want to
talk to you guys house is set up and
what came with it how the authentication
is working because we don't actually
need to do much after this so right here
they have set up a graph QL yoga server
that's what this thing is and then
you'll notice it is grabbing its
resolvers from this folder called
resolvers which is over here and this
resolver folder is where all the
basically work is done for the schema
graph QL so the implementation of all
these things and now you'll notice
there's already a sign up and a login
for us so that's really nice and we have
a off payload where we can grab the user
and the token and if you watch some my
stuff in the past you know I use a
refresh token and a regular token but
I'm going to just use a token to follow
along with these guys and it's very
similar way of doing it was just a
singular token and let's see how they
actually do this so how do they log a
user in right so let's look at the
mutations and then off so for login what
they do I guess we should start with
signup because that's kind of the first
thing you do so if the account doesn't
exist
they are hashing the password using
bcrypt if you don't know what that means
you don't want to store the password -
just if my password is Bob you don't
want to just store the password in the
database as Bob because if the database
gets hacked then everyone knows your
password so instead you hash it and -
basically a random
so we store a random string in the
database and then we're creating the
user right here and then what they're
returning is a JWT token so they're
using data JSON web token library right
here to do this and they are passing in
the user ID this is important so this is
how we're going to do authentication the
user our what they're going to do is in
react native app they're gonna store
this JWT token so when they come back to
our app we know who they are because we
are storing the user ID and this JWT
token that they have and they are still
signing this token with the app secret
and this app secret is in the dot M file
so we can see this is my app secret
right here you don't want to share this
with people but this is just your
development and you can see these are
crappy secrets you'd want to share them
or you want to change them when going
into production anyway okay so that's
how you create a user write or sign up
so you give them a token back and you
create a user in the database and then
log in you're just verifying that their
password matches so we use bcrypt to
check against the hashed password right
here and of course we are checking who
the user is based on the email that they
give us and they're throwing an error if
the email doesn't exist we're gonna do
this slightly differently because I like
to do errors with login slightly
differently but this works fine too and
then they're doing a wait bcrypt
and they're using async and wait which
is nice and then right here they're just
checking in the password to make sure
it's correct and they're giving a token
back like before so that's how they're
doing off and now on the side over here
they have off payload isn't really
important but in their utils they have
this get user ID so what they're doing
is they're grabbing the authorization
header so on the react native app what
we're going to do is whenever we make a
request we're gonna pass that JWT token
that they gave us as a request header so
here they're grabbing that token that we
pass them
and they're checking to make sure token
exists and their use the word bear in
front of it so they're replacing that
out and then here you can see they're
just verifying that the JWT token is
correct by checking the app secret and
if it is correct we know that the user
ID is stored inside of there so now this
is how they're getting the user ID and
we're gonna be using this function and
they use this function I believe like
when they're creating a post right here
so you know or creating a draft you know
who the user is who's actually making
these requests based on the token that
they're using so that's off that they
have setup and it's pretty nice we're
gonna be using that and the dupes the
database over here we can see they
already have a post and user set up
we're gonna be using the user and I want
to show you guys something real quick so
notice how there's a type user in the
database this is what the database model
is but we wouldn't want to like return a
password back to a user right you only
really want to store this in the
database so this is like a database only
field
so in our schema doc graphical you'll
notice that they actually create another
user type over here but without the
password because you'd never want to
return the password back to a user so
this is a practice that seems like
happens when using Prisma when you don't
want the user type over here like some
of these fields you don't want to show
back to the user but you know it's like
type post I believe they do this see how
they have the type post and they're
grabbing that you can see it's commented
out but they are grabbing the post type
that they use in their model over here
so we're gonna create a new model
ourselves I'm gonna go ahead and keep
the code that they have for post in case
we need something to go off of if we're
having trouble or do we don't know how
to do something we can see how they're
doing with post instead of just deleting
it all right now but when we get further
down the line we'll go ahead and delete
post so I'm gonna create a type called
product and this is gonna be basically
our main thing so I'm gonna keep this
super bare-bones
I have a name which is gonna be a string
and it cannot be null so that's why I'm
using a bang sign at the end I'm going
to have a picture URL which is also
going to be a string will make the
picture mandatory as well and then
lastly I'm gonna have a price so we're
gonna make price a float Anthony a
notorious so this is gonna be what a
product looks like feel free to add more
fields to this if you'd like like
description or whatnot now we might want
to know like who the owner of this
product is right so we can make a field
called seller so the person who's
selling this product and have it point
back to a user up here and we're gonna
create this or make this a mandatory
field as well so you have to have to
create a product you have to be a user
and we have to know who your user is so
we have this the person who's selling
the product and then maybe from the
users point of view we'd like to see all
the products that they sell so for
example products and then that's gonna
return an array of product and I don't
know if I have to like move this up now
I don't have to I was for a second I
didn't really think I wasn't sure if I
need to move type above here because
we're referencing product but then I saw
the referencing user and type is above
but yeah don't worry about that so
anyway now we have our product set up so
whenever you make a change to this data
model dot graph QL file you need to
actually change what your database looks
like because now we want our database to
sync up with what this file looks like
so you can open up a terminal and I'm in
the same folder ecommerce and I just run
Prisma deploy so what that will do is
we'll take your code here check it
against what is deployed and if
anything's different it'll create fields
in the database so take a look here it
shows us all the changes that were made
so it created a new product and I
actually should have added these as
fields because we're gonna want them
we're gonna want an ID created at
updated at so we're gonna copy that
paste it down here as well I forgot to
add those those are good fields so they
add it automatically for us so this is
all good and then notice how it sets up
a relationship with the user right cuz
this is database stuff but you need to
set up a user in the database for these
two to be related to each other okay I'm
gonna say that I'm actually not sure
since I added fields that are ready in
there
if I run Prisma deploy if that's
necessary but I'm gonna run it again
just in case looks like it's updating
them but it should update to be the same
thing anyway okay so good so now we're
synced up and we have this product on
our prism of server and we have
authentication already done for us
thanks to prism O's boilerplate what
we're gonna do next is set up the
reactant native app and then we're gonna
start making requests create a sign up
in a login page since the mutations
already done that's it for this video
guys thanks for watching
