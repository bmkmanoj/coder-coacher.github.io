thing and that is eeeh Slynt this is
something I can't start a project
without adding it is wonderful if you've
never heard of it what it is is a tool
that you can add to your editor or run
it on your code and what it does is it
tells you places where your style or
your making errors for example this will
looks like in Visual Studio code with
the eslint plugin so you see a little
red line on our code and then it says
hey you should use single quotes here
because that's what your style guide
recommends so it makes you follow a
certain style with your code and tells
you where you can improve your code in
places and it's really nice so let's add
that to this project
now I've already added here I'll show
you how I did it so the first thing is
to install es link globally to do this
go ahead and type NPM I - gee yes Lent
so what that does is installs the CS
lint package globally and if you don't
know what this I is that's short case
for install so run that and you should
get a es lint utility on the command
line so now you can run yes lint - V get
the version I'm using 4.14 but I would
just use the latest version that is
currently out when you're watching this
video and then we're just gonna run
yeeess lint on it and go ahead and run
this in the directory of your project so
stat calculator is my project and when I
run
yes lint an it it's gonna ask me a few
questions now these are all preference
so my preference is to use a popular
style guide notably Airbnb and now we're
using react so we'll say yes and then
you go ahead and select the format you
want your configuration file and I
prefer JavaScript but again this is up
to you guys preference and once you hit
enter it'll go ahead and install
yeeess lint and all the things it needs
for air and B&amp;amp;Bs lint
now funny enough it does not do actually
install
yeeess lint itself so we're have to
install that as well
with a dev dependency and we're also
gonna be installing babble iya Slynt
which I'll explain in just a second so
again and I'm doing - - save dev here to
save these as developer dependencies so
I ran all that install that all that
jazz so now what I have is a dia Slynt
RC file here and it should look like
this for you now if you picked a
different either JSON or yamo output
file it might look a little different
but you should have extends Airbnb
somewhere and then in your package saw
JSON you should see a number of packages
added to dev dependencies so Ballia
Slynt yes when we added and then these
right here yes Lent added for us and
that's needed for Airbnb okay so we're
gonna add one last thing to our
configuration file one setting that I
was talking to you guys about and that
is a parser Babel is lint if you don't
know a Babel is that is something that
lets you use experimental or new
JavaScript syntax that's really nice an
example that is a sink and a weight and
spread operator if you've ever seen
people do like a or dot B that's called
the spread operator the triple dots the
way they're able to do that is if
they're using Babel so yes lint doesn't
always understand all these new syntax
so we need to use the babel excellent
parser here that way es lint doesn't
throw weird errors everywhere okay so
let me save that and run that if you
have yes lint to plugin for your editor
you should see rut lines starting to pop
up here because we're currently not
following the air and beat B style guy
here now quick note I'm using the es
lint one for visual studio code and I'm
also using another plugin here called
prettier this is something I would
recommend getting as well it's not just
for visual studio code lots of editors
what prettier does and you'll notice
this in a second here I'm gonna save
this file so I could go in here manually
and save or change strings must use
single quotes but that's kind of tedious
what prettier does is it actually styles
the code and goes ahead and fixes my es
lint warnings at least the ones that it
can fix for example here a commas
dangling which means there needs to be a
comma here I notice how the air goes
away but as soon as I hit sale in this
file all these airs are gonna disappear
so here that's me just hitting save it
takes a second to run and configure
sometimes I've noticed it actually
doesn't run at all if that's and it
looks like that's the case here you can
actually have it manually happened by
bringing up the command palette and
running format document and you'll
notice how some of the errors went away
the comma appeared and I have quotation
marks appeared now this Eric couldn't
fix which is fine but I would recommend
getting prettier if you don't have it
you'll notice my code kind of shifting
around all of a sudden when I save
that's because of prettier and yeah
styles it for me
now I also have a setting on that right
here so format on save with my editor
that's how prettier gets run when I save
it and then this es link integration
after prettier runs it also pump it
through es lint that way it follows all
the es lint rules so I'd recommend that
if you're using Visual Studio code or if
there's a similar setting for your
plugin for your IDE or editor okay so we
got rid of that warning here and now
we'll see all kinds of different
warnings as we're coding now which is
nice and this particular one it says
component should really written as a
pure function so you might be asking
yourself what is a pure function so
right now we have a component this is a
class and it's a component because we're
exiting react component now there's
other ways to write components
components can just be functions so what
we can do is we can take the return this
render function and just make it a
function so for example I can delete
class up here and instead of render I
can call this thing I can just say
kant's and I can say app is equal to a
function so now we're exporting defaults
this app that you notice we're gonna
have a little error here we can see it I
expected token the reason for that is
because you can't export default a Const
app you can only export it or what you
can do is say export default and I'm
just gonna bring that to the bottom here
export default app in a different line
now notice it's getting mad at me
JSX not allowed in file name so we
called this app J s so one way to get
rid of this is I could say app dot JSX
give that a save and that get rid of
that one Stiles was not defined above so
we can move Styles up here give that
save and what else are we doing wrong I
think spective blocks surrounding arrow
so we're returning here I don't think
there's any other syntactical errors
we're making missing semicolon newline
so I'm just gonna go ahead and format
the document give that a save and cool
so now it's all formatted we're
following all the es Linc guidelines and
the app will work exactly the same as it
was with the class before but now it's a
function so you may be wondering why you
would want to use a function like this
instead of a class my recommendation to
you if you don't know the difference is
right now is always use a function until
you need a class there's this thing
called state which we'll probably talk
about later which you can't use in
functions and also there's some special
methods that you can use in classes
which you cannot use in function
but that's it for this video guys we set
up es lint which is really nice so now
we're gonna get warnings and we can fix
their code and make it look nice as
we're coding stuff so when we run it it
will work hopefully now also I'm gonna
put this code on github because I'm
starting to make changes to it so you
guys can follow along and make sure you
guys have your config file the same as
mine
and your package JSON in case you run
into some errors so that's it for this
video guys I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
