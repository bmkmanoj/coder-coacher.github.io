and projects that you guys would like to
see and normally I would add this to
to-do list and basically just go look at
whenever I wanted to make a new video
I'd look at the to-do list and I would
pick something and I'd make a video
about it and I thought why not make this
list public so you guys can see what I'm
working on what projects are down the
pipeline
anyway I can make suggestions directly
and see if other people are interested
in seeing the same video you are so what
I did is I made a public Trello so
anyone can come look at this
and I'm also going to put in the
description below a link that you can
actually join the board that way you can
add cards as well so you can come here
and you can add cards and add
suggestions for videos I tried to add
suggestions I've seen in the comments
but I might have missed yours I did come
along joy come on join the Trello and
add your card so how it's going to work
is I kind of split things up I'm card
you can vote on and I'm kind of to see
the popularity of what videos people
want to see and kind of just pick the
top ones and make those so here's how I
split it up so there's a few languages
slash framework I'm interested in trying
and here they are right here you can add
a little bit other ones here if you're
interested in seeing other ones they're
just off the top of my head that I
thought would be interesting to explore
here are some projects which are multi
serie ones kind of like if you've seen
my some of my feathers yes or my react
videos where I do a big project I will
go under here and then the concepts
these are kind of like volta video ones
that are slightly bigger but are not
exactly a project for example
ooofff there's lots of different things
you can get into OAuth or deploying a
project AWS because there's lots of
different AWS things so I split it up
into here and then this list is for
single videos this is an idea where it's
just one video and encompasses the whole
idea
so as you can see these are all can be
done in one video and I also made a list
for what I'm currently working on
currently not working on any videos that
will be soon and then scheduled is the
basically I've completed these videos
and they are scheduled to be published
soon and I put due dates you can see
when this is finished and when new
videos will be coming out and I just
need a finished list so I'll move these
over once they are finished okay so that
is it I kind of want to just get
feedback from you guys see what videos
you want to see so please come join the
Trello and add suggestions I want
feedback from you guys come vote and add
things that you want to see and I will
start working on it so thank you guys
for watching and don't forget to join
