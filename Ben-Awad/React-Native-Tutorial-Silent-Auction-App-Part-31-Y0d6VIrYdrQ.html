to do some cool stuff with this icon
right here I'm thinking is doing an
animation so I found this prequel
library right here I'm thinking about
doing one of these animations maybe like
bounce or maybe a pulse would be pretty
cool the library we're going to be using
is react native and animatable which we
need to install so just copy that bring
this over here do yarn add and we'll add
that to our thing and then this is kind
of an example we're going to go off of
right here so I'm just going to copy
this and create a new component that
we're going to do this for so this is
going to be an animated icon jas and
explore defaults and get rid of so I'm
going to close some tabs here we can
import our animated icon here and should
be at the top actually up can't find it
might have been because we just added it
and then we'll render our animated icon
here and then we need to set an on press
request bid here from redux I don't
really want to tell animate icon about
Redux it doesn't need to know about it
so we can actually just remove the on
press here and copy that I'll copy it
first and then we can be our stuff over
here all right
and we can also clean this up what are
we getting air is about statement end
did return so the thing in the middle
should be an icon and on press we should
just be calling our Vista props on press
that we're getting from what we pass in
will call this animate icon extends
import react from react so every act
opponent and we don't need a touchable
okay so there's two things than this
icon is press we're going to do going to
reference this view and bounce it so
let's make this into a function I can do
more than one thing let's drop on press
down to the next line it's getting quite
long anyway
not sure what is the convention for
styling multi-line with a function like
this I'm guessing it something like this
and then change this for two spaces here
and then we're going to do this ref got
few valves and we'll set 800 we don't
need to do anything when it's finished
so don't worry about that can remove
that have that over then we can import
icon from native base so it using string
literals for a attribute is depreciated
no string wrap all right
I'm sure that's about looks like an EF
lens thing word about that later
using this rx is depreciated okay nice
so it looks like a way this library kind
of does things is kind of depreciated
but this is their example wonder if they
have another example have more examples
are using the rough here it looks like
it's always using wrap so not sure what
that's about and also notice how the ref
I'm doing it from inside the animated
view not sure if that will cause
problems let's find out so refresh this
BAM
oh yes that bounce worked cool so now
that we know that bounce works we play
with a couple other these animations we
can just swap them in clicking polls
might look kind of cool
is priestly understand our es Lent here
with those airs because it seems to be
working
ending interest library maybe it tada
that looks kind of interesting see you
hello Oh doesn't look that great like my
favorite is actually the pulse kind of
subtle and just pops it little bit off
Pam wonderful we can I'm assuming if I
make that like double it gets double as
big and then it actually seems slower
more subtle look if I go to 400 now
I don't know what exactly this number is
doing I think 800 looks the best though
so they'll just leave it as that pump it
or don't look at balance one more time
see which one actually maybe I like
bounce better it's kind of nice because
like you're shaking the money out of it
okay I think I'll leave it with Bounce
you guys can play the animation some
more yourself change it up see which one
you like the best
and yep I'll leave this for now for our
animated icon it's looking pretty sweet
and we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
