working nicely so we have a history of
the people that we have chatted with and
there's one little thing that we're
gonna fix and that's when we chat with a
new user we're just invited to a team we
don't see their user name pop up here
right away
and that's because we are caching this
query and then when we do a new one
we're reading from the cache and we just
need to update the cache it's kind of a
choice if you want to update the cache
you can also just have the user have to
refresh the page to see it here but I'll
show you in case you ever want to add an
apps where you update your cache which
we have done before and we're also gonna
be working on up here at the top so if I
click on Tom - I don't see Tom twos
username here I see we want to see Tom -
there so we're gonna fetch Tom twos
username here so we can see them and see
that's who were chatting with here ok so
let's get started now if you don't know
what the problem I was talking about
direct message I'll show you right now
so I just created a new user called Jim
and Jim - so I'm gonna invite Jim to the
team and then I'm gonna refresh and I'm
a direct message Jim so you notice how I
just have that refresh there same exact
thing we update we need to update the
cache if you wanted Jim to show up there
when we invite people so right here I
have Jim's chat window and I can say hey
Jim and I don't see the message here
that's because we have a dozen
subscriptions yet we're gonna be doing
that but I don't see Jim pop up here
either but if i refresh we see Jim sure
enough right there so let's add Jim now
so the way we're going to do this is by
adding an update function to our
mutation here so I'm in the direct
messages page and this is where we're
creating a direct message so we're just
gonna update the direct message members
afterwards this is very similar of how
we updated the channels list with our
add channel modal and I'm just going to
copy this update and
this optimistic response because we're
gonna do basically the same thing
now our optimistic response we basically
return what we expect the server to
return for this mutation we're returning
true or false true if it succeeds false
if it doesn't so I'm just gonna return
true here because I expect the server
for it to go through and then we'd
actually don't even need to look at the
data returned to do this I'm gonna get
rid of that okay this is save so here
we're getting an error with T my DX I'm
gonna call this T my DX to just because
if we look up here we have T my DX as
well okay so the first thing we're doing
is we're reading the me query which is
good that's what we want to update and
then we are finding the team which we
want to update which is basically the
current team we're using team ID here
instead of using team ID I instead when
I grab the team and call that ID on it
and we're doing that here is well I
think we want to do team that ID just
because if we get a bad team ID here we
are defaulting our team all right so
here we go team that ID so we're finding
the index of that team and then here we
are finding that team which we just you
know grabbing the index of it and then
here we were pushing a channel now for
us we want to push a direct message
remember and if we look at our query
that's these guys here direct message
members and we're going to push an ID
and a username so I'm gonna just have
one object here we also need to pass in
the type name which is a user
and I capitalized it cuz that's the name
of the type and then I'm gonna have an
ID so the idea of this is the receiver
ID because that's who we're sending the
message to and that's user ID and then
the user name we actually don't have the
user name of the user we're sending to
right now that's why we need to make oh
we just got in there but at the top
there we're not fetching the user yet so
I'm just gonna say someone here for now
and then we're gonna fill that in in a
little bit now this query looks like it
work looks like it works this update and
I it will for inviting new members but
it'll break if we're h-had with this
member before because the member already
be in direct message members and we're
gonna re push him on so we don't want to
do that we want to check whether the
user is already in direct message
members so we're gonna say kant's not
already there so we're gonna write some
kind of boolean and we're gonna say if
not already there then we're going to
push on and then write to the update
update the cache because we don't need
to update the cache we already have the
member on the side and the way we're
gonna check is we're gonna copy this bit
here and we're just gonna basically
iterate through the members using the
every function and if you haven't seen
this before how what it does is we're
gonna go through every single member and
we're gonna say remember remember not
equal to user ID and this user ID we
grab up here so this is the person we
sent it to so and I'm gonna say member
ID here so we're checking against each
member if that's not the member I sent
the message to then it'll return true so
if every member in here is not the
member I send a message to this will be
true if one member is if this is equal
to true somewhere or not true equal to
false which means the member is in here
then this returns false so just a quick
recap of every if all of them are true
and I'll return true if one of them is
false
it'll return false so that's how we're
checking this
now this user ID is actually a string if
we look up here so we're just gonna do a
parse int on it because our member ID is
a integer and it's mad because I just
want us to know which base it is it's
base 10 and now let's run this and see
what happens
all right so let's invite people I'm
gonna invite Jim to give them an ad
refresh I'm gonna start direct messaging
within Jim too
and here I'm gonna say hey Jim to hit
enter and ooh we get an error didn't
read property every of undefined and
looks like I forgot the S direct message
members and forgot the S here so we see
our Jim too because we just messaged him
so let's create another user real quick
so we can test it again I'm gonna call
this guy Jim 3 and let's invite him to
the team
all right and now same thing as how
we're doing an update function if you
wanted to write an update function for
invite people we wouldn't have to
refresh when we do this but we'll leave
that for you guys to try out so we have
this I'm gonna say hey Jim three and
cool we see someone pop up here now
ideally we see the actual user name so
when we fetch this we're gonna basically
store it so we can use it here as well
so we're gonna basically pause our
progress with this and come back and
change this to the right username in a
second now I noticed how we get this
missing field to create direct message
and true I think what it's talking about
is my optimistic response see how we
said type name mutation here I think it
just wants us to do that same thing
maybe maybe not the type name but at
least the name of the mutation here so
I'm gonna say the name of our mutation
is create direct message so create
direct message returns true I think
that's what it means by missing the
field create direct message we'll see
when we run this again in fact goes away
so now how are we gonna fetch the
username right here well what we're
gonna do is we're gonna add something to
our me query so instead of just running
this me query we're gonna say Const
direct message me query is equal to gql
and we're gonna write our own custom me
query cuz what we want to run is this
guy right here copy that
but we also want to fetch the username
of the person we're about to message so
I'm gonna say direct message me query so
this is me the other thing I want to do
is fetch a particular user so I'm gonna
say query here we're gonna pass in a
variable of the user we would like to
get so user ID we'll say and that's just
gonna be an integer and then I don't
know if we actually have fetching a user
in our back-end let's check nope so
let's say get user returns a user and
we're not gonna say not null because if
they give us a bad idea here so user IDs
in it then we return null so in our
resolver we're gonna say copy this get
user we're gonna say user dot find one
and we're gonna say where and we're to
say ID is equal to the user ID given
here
okay so now we can grab that user so get
user passing in that user ID so user ID
is equal to dollar sign user ID then
here we're just gonna fetch the user
name is all we really care about so this
thing we can grab up here so we're gonna
have me and get user so now get user I
can say from that I don't know why this
is read oh it's a gang long Oh
let's move this guy up here it doesn't
want to be once it because this is an
absolutely important needs to be above
these relative ones so now get user here
I'm instead of passing someone's
username into this I'm gonna say get
user dot username and same thing for our
username down here so it get user dot
username now down here when we're
querying we need to pass in a variable
so variables and this is gonna equal two
props and we're going to return back so
user ID is gonna be equal to props
params user ID so this props top params
that use their ID this is coming from
the the header of the URL same thing as
we're fetching up here so match params
user ID so I need to add match in front
of that props match
dot params so that is whatever we put up
here now we are definitely susceptible
to errors if we have a bad user error or
user ID up here and stuff but let's see
what's going on on this expecting
variable user ID but it was not found we
had this problem before it didn't like
how I was passing into variables and I
changed it so let me just see
let's search my project real quick for
variable ID see where I'm doing this so
we can copy how I did that
props so this is the user ID that did
work I think it's just reading my props
I don't think it's actually using the
the user name here all right where was I
direct messages okay so I don't think
it's reading this props for some reason
for the variables here I don't know if I
it's cuz I need to put in options let's
double check how they do it on a Paulo
graph QL because this should be a very
simple thing where we just pass in
through our props so we're gonna go to
client react and our queries
so this is us passing through the props
and that's what I was doing wrong we
need to put variables inside the options
so it looks like by default it tries to
read the variables from the props that's
kind of interesting alright so now we
get a new thing so all right so our
whirring in air here is my server looks
like my server variable user ID int was
not provided props that match okay so
let's look at our network tab and we're
gonna refresh and I'm gonna filter for
graph QL let's look at this request that
we just made and see if we're passing in
alright so notice how our variables here
are empty so like I did before we're
gonna just hard code this so I have a
nine so I'm gonna copy this
and say nein
and see if that works then we know
whether it's something of how we're
doing it
so we still get the variables I believe
we're copying this oh you know what I
think variables can't take any can't
take a function like this I think
options takes it like this there we go I
think that's what's my problem
okay so variables probably doesn't take
props but I know options can I think
that's Rogers messing up and and that's
where it was okay so we see hashtag Jim
3 here so perfect so we see our user
name here of who were messaging so if I
go to tom
I should see Tom there and I do Bob cool
so now let's register a new user and try
this all together so I'm gonna say Sally
Sally at Sally calm and let's try
inviting her to the team oops
okay invite add user refresh and search
for Sally add Sally me hey Sally and
awesome we see Sally pop up here if i
refresh I see the message there and I
see Sally stay there
cool so the next steps is to get this
messaging to be fluent in real time so
similar to how we got it working with
channels over here and I can just be
like hey Bob and Bob shows up here we
use graphic fuel subscriptions for that
we're gonna do that same thing here so
that's what we're working on in the next
video that's it for now thanks for
watching guys
