we were having a little bit of troubles
we were struggling let's be honest we
were trying to figure out how to do this
belongs to mini name any relationship
and I had no idea how to do it and after
some long research and getting some help
with other j/s people they are great by
the way I figured out I can actually
literally just do what this line is
right here iíve added the necessary
stuff so I can just take an instance of
the to-do list and I can pass in a user
to share it so let's dig into details of
how that actually works so the first
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a new thing in our schema so
we're creating a mutation here route 2
mutations let's go up here and it's
gonna put it down here we're gonna say
sure to do list
now let's share that to do this what we
want to do is we're going to pass in the
list ID which is a string and then a
user ID and though that's basically the
list you want to share and who you want
to share it to and then of course the
token to authenticate and then out spits
out we want to spit out a to-do list
spits out with the Association that it
the newly formed Association I guess so
now we can come over to our resolvers
come down here now we go to our mutation
this is the interesting part so now just
down here
sure to-do list so we pass and list ID
and use your ID and then the token now
what goes here that is the interesting
part so we're gonna do to do list dot
get and now we're going to get the list
ID so this will actually get us the
to-do list that that we want to share
and then dot then once we have this
to-do list we now need to get the user
so we're gonna say get Capitol users so
users your users let's see what I put in
here users okay so it's right users dot
get and we're doing the exact same thing
use your ID grab the user that we want
okay set look not we're not tabbed over
right a real that looks slightly better
it's out of space okay and then dot then
we can drop that to an extra line dot
then user and then there we can do stuff
so I'm not sure how we're gonna do the
pub sub thing if we want to do a
subscription or not let's say you know
subscription for now keep it simple and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna use
our list ID here and our user ID here or
not sorry not these IDs but the to do
list itself and the user ID and we're
gonna say the to do list that we just
fetched dot add user and then that's an
user so what that'll do is it'll just go
ahead and add the to do list to that and
and guess we can return this I don't
know if this returns an object or not or
we're gonna find out what this returns
so first I just want to go to the
graphical UI and see if this works at
all I know this ad user of a lot a user
and we'll just see if it actually
happens so okay I'm just going to come
over here before we start I'm just gonna
go to PC equal connect to our database
and so check out what it looks like
so if we come back over here we're
connected we select all from share I
believe it a share to do list share and
we can see we have a few this is when I
was testing stuff so we can just drop
that delete from share to your list okay
so now we have no basically shared to do
list now I can get out of here
whoops and let's start the server up
make sure we don't have any kind of
problem with configuration syntax errors
okay it looks like we have a console log
let's go to that we don't need that
anymore like I had in the index here
oh yeah I come back to resolvers cuz
that's what we're gonna have to look at
so I'm gonna pop out to the graph iql
and let's do some fiddling around now
first let's login and password and
actually I just thought of this when we
share to do list we want to pass in the
username not the password itself so
let's do that
is this actually let's fix this I made a
mistake I didn't think this through note
when you're sharing a to-do list you
wanna as a user you just want to pass in
the user that or their email not their
username because we're not using user
names so if I go to schema so this you
just do email so have user ID now I can
come back to our resolver now instead of
just doing it I have to do find and boom
and we're gonna have to remember fine
syntax let's go look that up feather Jas
find because this has an interesting way
of how it works I remember right so you
have to make a query object in here
query name is equal to Alice so kind of
what we want to do there but instead
what we want to do is we're gonna say
email is equal to email email and I
think they need to do like this could be
wrong but just to be safe I'll wrap it
in quotations so we find the user that
we want we grab the user and then we add
the user to the to do list and this is a
little bit of wrapped callbacks thank
javascript for that and let's restart
the server syntax good yep alright come
back over here so let's login so Bob Bob
I have a syntax error I have another
oops
okay so Bob exists and just I think I
need a Bob one that'll be the user we
share it with Bob one okay - I've
evolved to possibly there we go we have
Bob - so we'll share Bob - and let's get
his ID data ID so his ID is two
so now when we look at the database
later and we share with Bob - we should
see an idea of - in the database so
remember that but let's just login with
Bob one right now
grab his token and the first thing we're
going to do is we're gonna just create a
new to-do list it's gonna call it share
me and let's do snake case cuz why not
and that's all I want
token pass that in and all I want in
return is to see the ID okay that did
not work do we get a problem on the
server not authenticated possibly I just
need to refresh unknown operation named
undefined I think it created this but it
didn't create it create to-do list
create to-do list and I found the
problem we're not actually returning it
to do list here we're just pub subbing
it so to do the list there we go to
restart that so we'll call it share me
five there we go and it's ID is 11 so we
should see a mapping between 11 and 2
after we do this
so do I solve the token if I do so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
share to do list passing in the list ID
which we're going to share that to-do
list and we want to share it with Bob -
and pass in another token
and what we'd like to see and we won't
we won't get anything that's fine just
create it okay we forgot to do it again
over here no we didn't forget the add
user add user it looks like it just
doesn't return anything which I guess is
fine well we'll have to return like true
or false of whether it worked I guess so
now let's go into our database and see
whether it worked
Oh neat connect first connect now I'll
select very cool guys so notice how we
have the user ID - is connected with the
list ID 11 exactly what we expected to
see okay so now whoops did not mean to
go over one too many now what I kind of
want to do is I'd like to I kind of
would like to return whether it worked
or not so we can do errors
I guess this doesn't return anything
let's just create an object I guess and
let's see if the this says does it say
whether it will be add project
doesn't really have I was looking for
like what the return type of ad project
was and let's just for now console dot
log it what the return is because it
looked like it was passing no back so I
don't know if it's just not passing
anything it's a void function which is
entirely possible or whether just graph
I QL was being weird um let's see if I
have a bob three okay and ever turns a
promise to add user I guess I could do
dot then yeah so we can stack this even
further one more level I don't have it
like that top then new to-do list new
to-do lists return that now let's see if
that will return it to do list for us
maybe there's Bob for able to fetch
it's gonna return this guy's gonna
return this thought this Oh can't have a
semicolon there okay go
really it's not gonna turn anything okay
so let's see what this new to-do list is
or maybe it's because it's not bubbling
up because they did dot then yeah it's
just probably not bubbling up oops
so just stop that here that and then
this one okay fresh that I don't think I
have a Bob five get a return empty list
maybe it's go soups me cuz it over Bob
five let's see when I don't even know I
don't exist okay okay so did that let's
do Bob one share them with this so oops
I just bought it's a list so now it's a
list of lists what the heck so what I
want to do is zero zero that seems so
weird
let's let's try it one more time
copy this because we're gonna need a new
sign up email Bob fire
password the Bob five yeah now I can
share with Bob by not really sure why
that didn't work serial zero
let's do see if we can go down to a
previous list item we can so Oh huh
didn't restart the server that's why
it's like why didn't that not work all
right
still still not going to do it huh type
that so we can see there's data in there
at all eight no still at this point I'm
kind of like just return true or false
right what was I looking for all yet log
it gets data values is that what I want
to return yeah
instance data values dot data values
which is not a to-do list so now I can
see why it's not working
divide data values so let's add to our
scheme a new new thing user ID list ID
so this is going to be type
to-do list shared and what it's going to
return is a user ID which is an integer
and a list ID which is also an integer
and instead of share yeah sure oops
to-do list
shared okay now let's start that up
Oh integer so graph QL integer looks
like look like what the problem is is
you can't have a type of integer Q all
integer
um and deter you all and could you show
me what that looks like do I use graph
QL int I can just do string this
documentation is confusing and does it
have an example no well no it doesn't
I actually can't figure out how what the
syntax is for an engineering graphic ul
do I really just do graph QL end up
there we go and - sure and cool we're
compiling why is it Auto adding ID Oh an
easy to refresh sometimes you have to
refresh graph iql so it refreshes the
documentation can I run that and wallah
returns the shared to-do list very nice
okay that's what we wanted now when I
try is let's say we try sharing it with
someone who doesn't exist
can't every property 0 of undefined
okay so VN air that's good so we can
basically read that in our client then
when we're sharing so let's go ahead and
implement this lets you keep that server
running real quick oh we don't want to
check right now close thank you just
commit this because we got that working
so many to many relationship between
to-do list and user
all right well let's start the client
oops who did not mean to open it up
modules that's a lot of folders that it
just opened up okay so home if you
create a new component it's basically to
do form but we're gonna have a different
thing so let's copy go on this is it
going to be share form interview copy
that
share form and then I'm just gonna put
at the very bottom
oops not that far down this few to do
for them so below our scroll view let's
put it here
let's just start from the top and go
down that's fine
Const submit text is fine we're not
going to pass and create to do it's
going to be share to do list and list ID
would be helpful to have or we need to
know it that way we can share it so
let's pass that as a prop just like we
do for to do form so we just want to do
that passing all the props in just like
this there we go
empty I guess would be shared user text
that trim but required that's fine else
share to-do list
giving a list ID and the text which was
going to be the person's email and let's
just replace text with email so we don't
get confused
okay so we're checking it looks good
this will be a share form to do forum to
share form okay this will be an email
field this will be share component you
still want a text field is it capital
yeah this text field text input you know
I call it literally an email field text
and put it here
button this will be shared to-do list so
be share handle submit passing in values
create to do this will be shared to do
list instead and we're still passing in
the list ID coming down here create our
mutation this will be share to do
mutation to do list and for this come
over here grab that and then the
mutation basically the same get rid of
those basically the same variables we
just won't have a complete variable
analyst ID past analyst ID email pass an
email and of course our token
and then we'd like to see the user ID
the list ID pack just to make sure it
worked and she's sure to do graph QL
graph QL and let's just change this to
share to do list mutation this will be
share to do list passing in the list ID
and the email getting them took them
from the props email list ID we have and
this will be share form this will be to
do graph QL be sure to do graph QL share
form okay I think that's good to refresh
over here see if we can see our form at
the bottom we can if we add some to dues
okay it pushes it down nice let's make
sure it doesn't go below it does that's
really annoying worry about that in a
second I guess first there's one check
to see if this share does anything at
all so let's share this new list hello
to I guess with oh it's capitalizing get
rid of that
I think it's Auto capitalized I figure
out let's just look it up react native
capitalized gonna pull it
I was there otto capita life I was out
of auto cap July's go to none capitalize
refresh tight Bob auto cap hit spell it
wrong cap hit a lot cat okay Wirt yeah
Ariel cap hit to lies I'm I actually
just bad I am its capital we're done
spelling that just copy and paste their
real so let's share this with Bob 5 get
a find variable share to-do list share
to-do list
even though we're passing it in the
props right here and we're doing this
right here I cannot find it oh I know
what the problem is guys right here
create to-do list we don't like that
that should be shared to list there
we're parsing it from the pearls they're
not parsing it but taking it so share
we're not getting any kind of feedback
that's fine mutations can I do a dot
then dot then data just so we can see it
works or something happened if I could
also look at this back-end banner they
want to do that can't even tell if the
button went off zoom fired how do I look
at whether the mutation worked or not
how'd he get the return of a mutation
feel like I've done this before but I
can't remember how I did it let's look I
have to have done this before just
getting the return value of mutation
probably did in that one gravity well
when I did yeah I thought it was dot
then but I guess not
these are all queries
no being mean should be something in
Maine there you go mutation mutate dot
then we were in console logging it sorry
guys I was expecting something in the
output and I wasn't seeing anything so I
thought something wasn't working I was
like so I forgot that console log it ok
that worked op 3 and looks like that
worked correctly
ok so we're setting up this association
in the database right that's exactly
what we want to see but here's the thing
let's say I share it with Bob 3
Bob 3 is not gonna see it in his to-do
list over here because we're not
actually setting up the share code like
we're making the share but we're not I'm
just gonna leave some of these we're
creating the share but we're not
actually showing it on this sidebar so
let's do that because all right now
we're just pulling in to do this that
you create not to do lists that you're
related to so this will be actually kind
of interesting to figure out how do you
find to-do lists that you're related to
okay all right no come on over here
let's actually create one list I think I
believe all of them that's not good
so really what I want to do is how am I
getting it to do list right now let's
just see loading here Cleary
okay so I'm doing this let's copy this
let's first login again so we can get a
token and actually I should just set a
one down here I'm sorry I should I
should've been using this guys I just
kind of forgot about it I'll show you
this is a pretty cool thing so I can do
is I can take this token here and I can
just say token oh wow
tope okay every time I type a letter it
does that so like I'm guessing it oh
okay
it's Auto completing for me okay I guess
I was just doing it wrong let's see if
this does anything and it does very cool
now what else so we would really like to
do is have something that's like we're
getting this news right we also want to
get like a shared to dues attribute onto
the to-do list
oh no no I don't we want that as part as
the viewer up here so part of viewer is
you can get or as part of a user I guess
you can get shared to do this so just
real quick I want to see what the best
because we're just querying
okay this is kind of what we want to do
find all projects with at least one task
where tax state is equal to project task
so task dot state equal to project
sequel eyes column okay so let's do
something like this this kind of looks
so we want to do is like to do lists
find all and they were passing a user
model where user dot state our user ID
is equal to project or to do list ID
something like that I think I think this
is what we want
it's hard to in my head just transfer
what it is so let's start writing it
down we have the server running we can
close that
okay let's fullscreen so when you create
a hook for our user so actually do you
need this back feathers yes generate
okay and this is a very similar hook to
what I did before with the two dues that
let us I'll show you guys add
relationship when I include this here
we're basically doing the exact same
thing
simple for hook this is for user and
this is only on it's gonna be a find or
a get now this is gonna be a find shoot
I accidentally pushed enter so would you
just let me do this fat finger and
accidentally create this and I did the
wrong thing so I'm just gonna kill it
real quick
actually I'm I'm curious to go over
right over the files so let's try not
deleting them and just create them again
for hook user this is gonna be a find
not I create not a patch looks like it
just over it or it overrode them is what
I wanted to happen so copy that
refresh nerd tree
oh no I mess something up when I did
this or was like you're doing feathers
Jerry yeah I messed something up guys so
the thing about feathers j/s barosaurus
and test is you need to be in the root
folder or it doesn't work so notice how
was in the source folder instead of this
root outer root folder so that was
causing a problem all right now do we
see your hook just refresh inner tree
there we go
that's what I want to see
and actually so okay so we don't want to
include this include where so actually I
need to look at the feathers Jas
documentation I'll find let's see how
that works okay hey there's pretty basic
there's the feathers just equalized
Doc's might have it documents are trans
will see rise auction here we go
thickness where we want getting started
options
see if there's a query migrations apply
a migration we don't need to worry about
that right now
okay it doesn't look like it has what we
want so I'll just give this a try
so the model that I want to add now is
to do list
and now I want to find it kind of wanted
to find all but I don't think I can
so in this schema let's add it before we
continue you user shared to do this this
will be a return of share a list of to
do us now if we go to resolvers
now we can craft our fine method so
possibly actually I guess we don't
really need to do have this hook now
that I think of it because it's actually
more of a to-do list
yeah I changed my mind I think I know I
D defined and we don't need this so
delete yes and also when you delete a
hook it'll also add an import statement
sometimes and it did edit it right there
so we just have to kill that and dang a
lot of hooks going on here hash password
okay
so Tallulah stop find and we're gonna do
a query so let's go back to the query
syntax cuz we're gonna do something like
that
okay it's like you want to eat you won't
want to use eelinator documents in your
database okay or so our shared or to our
to-do lists have a before before we do
that to is we can't remember how we had
this add relationship hook this is only
added when we create or sorry patch we
also need that when we find now because
I'm gonna be looking for it
and what we're gonna query is what would
it return it's gonna have a list of I
guess we're gonna look for is user ID
something like this I guess
except we're gonna be looking at the
property so we're looking at we're not
looking at the name with the query we're
looking at put that in here we're
looking at is gonna be actually I don't
know what it's going to be so let's do a
just a general fine to see what it
returns like if I just find it to do
list what is that gonna return we're
gonna have to do some experimenting guys
cuz I'm not exactly sure how to go about
doing this so let's just do that for now
rerun forgot to put comma probably yeah
that always gets me okay now if we do
this and we don't care about any of this
stuff all we want to see is shared and
again refresh the page to get the docs
working okay and the name please hello
and what else is there
query Oh
so I don't think we're gonna be able to
see in graph QL so I'm just gonna do it
here data console dot log data and I'm
just gonna pipe that to a log file
because I have a feeling it's gonna be
quite a bit I'm not quite a bit but just
so you know they're doing me something
okay some kind of area let's expect it
actually ok users so we want to search
in this users so let's just look up
there's GS query as many relationship
let's just see if there's anything out
there that's exactly I'm looking for
I don't like this approach at all or you
can just do the same Calton and service
talk get and then actually I wonder if
there is when we get the user I wonder
if there is it gives us the to do see
how the users it passes it like this
I wonder around the users slide if it
tells us the to-do lists so we don't
even have to do a find so what I want to
do just for the sake of testing users
and the hook that I just got rid of
wanna add back because I just had a new
idea of how to get that working cook it
for heck it's gonna be for user and just
for find and there we go
oh did I do it again I did it again
I'm so bad I forgot I'm I threw I'm in
the source folder so I have to go back
off or I can do
feathers generate hook okay now if I go
to user what I want to do is I wanna
just do this exactly what I did here I
want to see this side of the
relationship what kind of data we're
getting so to do this that's it that's
good just go back to her resolvers to
show you guys so now what i'm tested to
test this users should also be gonna
find your real is I'm just searching
what happened what data did they give me
what I do it users find hopefully some
good data
and that's exactly what I was looking
for to-do lists
and actually let me look at it real
quick data values okay actually I should
just Duke it right let's get what I want
passing and I'm passing in contact
contact actually better yet maybe this
user object right here already has it
console.log user okay that's fine that
weird thing will print fine for now we
might have to do get as well a get hook
just in case
all right
yes
okay so shared to do list is literally
return user we don't even have to do a
fetch data values dot and is this yeah
data values dot to-do lists perfect run
that server we see no one to share
anything with Bob but let's login with
Bob to so all you out login just create
one hey buddy
create that task one if I can I click
the button my mouse is being funky there
we go
I'm literally just double clicking
that's so bad
okay so let's share share go through
there we go yes now when I share it I
get the all beautiful I get this shared
to-do list so a server is all good now
you don't need you anymore
figured it out so let's get at all get
commit
get shared to-do list say user cool now
on the client side
we just need to update our query now
we're gonna do the same thing so now I'm
sure to do list shared to do list and
that's all these guys
now I just want to merge them together
so subscribe to new to do this it's not
what we want
oh we had it up here naira set to do
list grab the viewer from next props dot
viewer and so we don't have to change
all the reducers will do this will say
viewer shared could you this I believe
that's what it's called
just merge them together yeah so now
when I login to Bob I should see hey
buddy
so logout
okay you're not to do this so let's just
console that log viewer could be a
syntax thing or maybe something's messed
up here
looks like it's undefined possibly
because I misspelled something here yep
this needs to be shared hey thanks
Victor I'm glad you're enjoying it
undefined is not an object so we're
studying undefined is it because my
query is wrong
let's copy and paste this into graph iql
this will just correct all our mistakes
it's not shared to-do lists
there we go and that fetches nicely so
we can come back fix it here so we need
to make sure we do the same here and we
do have lists refresh that and we see
hey buddy
so this is another list now one thing I
just thought of is I'm not sure if we
actually have permission to add things /
delete things yeah it didn't work or
maim I'm a student nope my mouse worked
okay so I can delete things hello
three date okay so we're now able to
share and update things and so now if I
go back to Bob - I should see an item
crossed out and what do we have here
shared to do this to do this sorry about
that so we have undefined on object her
to do list dot name so it we are getting
objects back when we merge them should
have stuff for just refresh ok it has it
it's lashed out so why do we get that
error when we log out just go back to
bulb ok create an item log out okay
can't replicate it don't know what
happened with that error right there
so this to-do list is really ugly right
now to the UI is not what I wanted to be
but I want to demo real quick
the app side by side with a Android
phone so you can kind of see the
subscriptions side by side hopefully and
see a the both run at the same time I
think they'll be pretty cool so I'm just
going to boot up my Android virtual
machine
give her this console.log stuff for now
so Android AV
do create sorry not create I really want
to use this one start and I'll just let
that boot up for a second virtual
machine is pretty slow especially
Android one so let that boot up close
that Victor said I'll definitely watch
this whole react native series I
research about a little part and that's
more difficult to understand
it's the redux / door thing yeah reacts
can be very weird at first but once I
started using it more I really liked it
and I really liked the way the effect it
had on apps and how it worked with
integrated and I'm a big fan of
functional programming and the reducers
are pure functions it reminds me a lot
of doing functional programming but
we're just spinning here I guess I'll
just leave that out to the side for now
so I'm gonna create a new user for this
log out I'm gonna call this iOS login
huh you sign up first iOS iOS and
actually look at before I login what I
want to do is see localhost Android
emulator because I just need to change
something in my code I remember looking
at this once I've changed it to this
number and setup localhost for
Android so to run Android emulator and
let's see localhost that I have the
feather server I have running on my
computer I just need to change the index
here get rid of this localhost stuff
there we go
oops 10.0 duck - duck - okay now we can
do okay so that's blocking that's fine
react native run Android okay so this
will boot up on our Android phone and
let's login here ok so right now we have
no to-do list so this will be create my
first list and you can see it's lagging
a little bit it's trying to urge
machines right now so to create that and
it's just being slow I think yep my
first list and let's see what's
happening with the Android stuff can't
just compiling still I guess that'll
take some time so let's create a couple
items so here are some things that the
app could use error detecting sir not
air detecting error handling oh my gosh
look at that lag and look at that spam
of the mouse I guess I don't know get
rid of these and it just delete all of
them I don't know if it's my mouse
that's being really wonky or just
emulator lagging to make air handling
create
could be I'm just like putting my
computer under too much stress trying to
run all these things
um this is fine for the example I want
to show you guys it's fine we have a
bunch of duplicates so looks like the
Android ones almost done here looks like
it's building and if we come down here
you can see what percent 64 I'll just
let it do its thing
see if I can just like click this bottom
one you delete one of these to-do list
items still eating all of them because
they are all the same name I wonder now
shouldn't they create recreate different
these air-handling click I always be
clicking once and excreting four of them
do not know why it's doing that
and I think we're going this error
because we have no to-do list we're
guessing sign up okay
Android Android sign up
unhandled so let's see to make a
connection to the server hard to say
sheesh refresh all we can do is actually
we can just do PC equal connect no you
know I've been a WOD learn to do select
all from the users okay so to did create
an Android one
it's a reload we now need to login okay
let's see if it'll has login before we
just crash it actually it should be
detecting the users logged in or not and
then it takes them to the correct page
let's debug this real quick and close
that window now so we're getting a
little bit of a difference in Android it
also notice how it looks very similar in
Android and iOS that's the power of
react native is being able to build it
both of them so loading you check if
signed-in happens so that'll be in our
epic get token
so let's doc do action I'm curious if
it's just getting an old token I think
it might be I'm gonna do this real quick
I think what it's happening is it's I I
logged in with Android once before and I
think yeah I just had an old token in
there that was messing it up okay so now
I'm going to login with Android okay so
now what I want to do is I want to share
this with Android so share see if we can
see it here and we do we see that looks
like the share went off so now if i
refresh my Android view oops
you select out of this text view or this
text input I mean there we go
very fresh we now see my first list and
we see error handling that's quite
interesting we're seeing it four times
here for only one time here so that's
something ready we can debug in a minute
after we check out this so I guess that
makes sense why delete one they're both
deleting but let's add a to-do item I am
from Android and look at that I died
type dip I just super slow now we create
and you see how it populated over here
added twice over here added bunch of
times over here but that is
subscriptions happening there so we get
that real-time sockets to both of these
this is super slow I'm just gonna close
this kill a VD I just wanted to show you
guys the Android one working and how I
have two phones up and they're both
running at the same time and passing the
data in okay but I want to see what's
going on over here and I need to come
back change it back to localhost now I
think I have to exceed arts actually no
I don't not I don't think I have to
yeah actually maybe I do have to escape
adults I think I do so dot 0 dot 2.2
James that was a little closed alright
I'll just give this a refresh now we
only see one item here now if I create
an item hello
only adds it once so forever reason when
I booted up Android this thing started
freaking out I don't know if that just
cuz I have two emulators open is the
problem what I can actually do real
quick is actually no I was gonna suggest
I could run the it all my phone cuz I
have an Android phone but then I
wouldn't be have access to localhost but
this is I think I what I'm gonna do is
stop here for now for developing the to
do list I feel like I got to a pretty
good point and
the UI is very ugly I apologize for that
guys I'm not a UI developer or UX guy at
all I'm terrible with design but this
has a lot of good functionality and I
hope going through and getting this far
you saw that the subscriptions how he
did those was very cool with the
real-time updating and everything that
came in the backend work with feathers
je s to get the models the work and that
many to many relationships this was a
long journey to come here and I know
this is just like a huge stream it's
very long so I don't know even how many
people are gonna make it to this point
but if you are interested in seeing more
with this to-do list you want to see
more features there's probably hundreds
of bugs in this all over the place if
there's something you would specifically
want to see let me know leave a comment
on youtube tell me what feature you want
to see and I'll just make shorter videos
adding features to the to-do list from
now on because I feel like the streaming
is a I like how raw and uncut it is and
I like just you guys can see the whole
process but I've taken it to a pretty
good point I've spent a lot of time on
getting it here and I just wanna
basically now it's your guys's turn take
a look see you play with the code a
little bit let me know what you think
let me know what you'd like to see
changed and go from there because right
now this is just if you will waterfall
development I just went through the
whole thing adding all this stuff in I
want to do more agile development with
you guys so let me know if there's stuff
you only add for now I'm gonna leave
this as is just gonna commit the code
real quick so get status
oh we just added sharing to-do lists
push that up origin/master
and we will close the client for now and
I were just lagging when we're pushing
this up there we go in same is the okay
we're up to date with the server I'm
just gonna kill team ox right now kill
sessions we were done working on the app
for now shut it down also close it over
here and that's it for now guys I just
want to say thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you in the next video are
using JWT on this for author Victor ass
I am using JWT so feathers I'm doing it
all through feathers it does that takes
care of the authentication for me and it
gives you the token and use that for off
we can kill this now turn off a
simulator
