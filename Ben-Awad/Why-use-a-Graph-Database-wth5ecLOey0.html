types of databases called graph
databases and I was wondering why would
someone want to use a graph database
versus sequel or no sequel and when
would you choose it when would it be
faster because that's really what it
comes down to is when is a graph
database faster than let's say MongoDB
or Postgres and there's two really graph
databases I am considering and trying
out and that's Arango DB and neo4j and
now there's this nice performance
benchmark and that Arango DB did and so
I thought I would show you guys this
because I thought it was quite
interesting to see when is Arango faster
when is Postgres faster when is neo4j
faster like each database when is it
faster than the other one this kind of
gives you idea of when you want to
choose one of them over the other
now of course I'm sure this is a little
biased because Arango is doing this and
they're you know doing the benchmark so
they know how to make their database
faster they might not know how to
performance tune the other databases
these core databases might not get as
much of a chance as a rango DB but
anyway let's take a look at this so I
thought this was quite interesting they
are choosing this machine 16 core
machine with 60 gigabytes of RAM and one
of the reasons for that is that Arango
DB does not work as well if all the data
doesn't fit in memory so you check this
out right here it says rango DB
currently works best when the data fits
completely into memory and the
performance suffers when they actually
have it's bigger than memory so I wonder
if how the other databases would do when
you have basically bigger data than how
much you can store memory what I mean I
thought that was interesting so they
definitely picked the machine to help
their database already but let's just
dive into the results so here of a
couple different ones that they ran so
single reads writes aggregating data
together neighbors and some other
different ones these seem neighbors name
data and shortest path you can tell
these are oriented towards queries that
you would do in a graph database but
let's take a look at the results
I hope these were quite interesting and
almost all of these neo4j performed
worse than Arango DB which they're both
graph databases so look you just for
single read look how bad neo4j is
compared to Rango and you can just see
neo4j is consistently more expensive
here here here the only thing it's
beating Arango DB on is memory usage and
look at the memory usage of all these I
thought this was quite interesting as
well MongoDB has the least and then so
does new 4j it doesn't have as much so
that's interesting but just looking at
this diagram here why would I ever
choose neo4j over a ranked ODB Arango DB
looks like it destroys neo4j for graph
databases based on this so that's
interesting
occasionally Postgres gets better
and notice MongoDB does pretty well
terrible on the single write sinks but
you don't have to do that right you can
just do it non asynchronously like I was
surprised how well MongoDB stacked up
they seem like a good median for
aggregation I don't know why they didn't
do shortest paths for Mongo I guess you
could I guess they're trying to store
our graph and Postgres and store a graph
and the other ones using tab I don't
know what this tab is versus JSON I know
you can sort JSON data in Postgres but I
would take it look at these results all
how the link in description below so you
can check these out this is a quite an
interesting diagram and they go more in
depth with what they did to do the study
and they actually have their how they
test the databases put their code on
github I believe right here but
that's good I'm interesting and
personally I've been reading so their
articles and watching some different
videos and it seems like graph databases
the one like why you want to use them or
why we're there faster is when you have
queries that are require a lot of
relations just like deep inferred
knowledge and that would require lots of
joins so for example Nero neo4j here has
this sandbox that I was trying out and
you can just click on it and you can
authenticate and you can get like this
little web portal here and then give you
some data which is pretty cool and you
can take a look at it so this is what in
fullscreen this this is neo4j they have
a little web thing where you can make
queries run them and that sort of thing
so here is a little query that I ran
this they have like a little tutorial
thingy this is for a movie graph and I
just ran this one right here so we're
looking for all the movies or not all
the movies it's really you're trying to
find who the directors are of the movies
that Tom Hanks acted in so you can see
Tom Hanks here acted in these movies and
then you can see who directed each one
of those movies so that's kind of
interesting but like that sort of query
would take several joints to do in
Postgres or several aggregations in
MongoDB I did learn you can do joins in
MongoDB so several drawings in that as
well
whereas with this look at the syntax -
that's quite interesting for a graph
their syntax with Fournier DeForge a
looks very interesting
I've never seen anything like this
before so that will be interesting to
get used to but that sort of queries
where it takes a lot and is super
expensive and sequel and MongoDB seem
like we're graph graphs really shine
because this is pretty this is a cool
interface to I really like to neo4j to
being able to visualize this you can
wiggle around if we want to and you can
kind of see hey look here's an edge
where Tom Hanks acted in this movie and
he directed it so you can see that's
pretty interesting here they have
multiple nodes pointing to this and you
can see what the table view of this
would be kind of cool and then I think
they have I don't know what this I guess
this is a text table and here's the code
this is the actual JSON response from
the server here I was gonna say why
didn't they prettify it here it is this
is what you get back if you actually did
it and that's how they created this
graph here and MongoDB seems very
similar to a ranked ODB they have on
their website a little side by side of
the differences so and the syntax seems
very similar so it might be pretty easy
to learn Arango VB when you know MongoDB
but I'm gonna be checking out in the
future
Arango DB and neo4j trying those guys
out and seeing how I like these graph
databases I'm also very curious if graph
databases are mostly you know you're
gonna be running queries like this that
are more complicated and have edges all
over the place and this is a relatively
simple query but you can do more
advanced ones are you also doing regular
queries in this is this your main
database or a company is using this plus
another database like Postgres or Mongo
as their main and then they're using
this to do more complicated queries and
I'm curious how they keep those in sync
if they have multiple of them or maybe
they're just storing different data in
each
so I'll be learning more about these in
the future and I'll be doing more videos
on them as I learned them and as I check
them out so stay tuned for that and let
me know what you think of graph
databases if you've tried them if you
like them or if they just look super
weird and obscure there's like some
witchcraft queries you can come up with
that look really cool though I was
watching some videos on you 4j and I
like this little little graphing you can
make but I mean from the performance
thing a Rango DB looks strictly better
so we'll have to try it out when we
actually in practice and see what we
what we get but that is it for this
video guys thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
