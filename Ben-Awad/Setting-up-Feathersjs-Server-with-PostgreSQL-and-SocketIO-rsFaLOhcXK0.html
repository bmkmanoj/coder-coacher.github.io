be setting up a server to be making a
real-time application so the first thing
we're gonna do is create a folder so I'm
going to call mine to do back-end and
I'm just gonna move inside of it
and the first thing I'm gonna do is
generate so this is using the feathers
command line and this allows you to set
feathers project up really easily so I'm
just gonna call it to do backend no
description all the defaults are fine
and I'm actually going to set up with a
Postgres sequel database I like it
because it's really fast if you don't
want to use post seek role you don't
have to you can use me DB but if you
have Postgres installed i recommend
selecting that and if you don't it's not
too bad to set up do brew do homebrew if
you're on a Mac I think you can stall
with chocolaty on Windows and I'm sure
apt-get on Linux of any sort using your
package manager get that installed and
then after this is done installing here
we just need to start up the Postgres
sequel server I have mine already
started up and then next we're just kind
of create a database in it which is
about to tell us we need to create a
database because you need to store all
our data for our application so it's
actually in a store to do lists in the
Postgres sequel server so while this is
doing its thing i'm just going to open
up a new tab in my command line and then
create the database so make sure you
have Postgres sequel installed and then
once you have installed make sure you
have it started on mac you could start
like this I'm not sure let's start on
other platforms go ahead and google that
if you don't know how to start it I
already have mine started so I'm not
gonna run that I'll put this in the
description below if you want to copy
and paste this and run that and once you
have it started we just need to create a
day
bass and then you want to name it the
name of your project so if I go back and
see alright it's done
it tells me create a database called to
do back-end so I can use this command
called create DB and when you install
Postgres it installs this application
for you command line and then comes to
new to back-end hit enter and it creates
the database for me now if I come back
here I have told you I had my Postgres
sequel running and then I just created
the database for it so this is should be
all good to go when I do MPM start it
should start no problem and let's see it
does perfect ok so we have just the
basics set up the next thing I want to
do is make a service service this is
going to store our to-do items I'm just
gonna call it item it's gonna be using
the database you know what I'm putting
the Postgres sequel database and no
authentication and by default it works
with sockets you noticed the only thing
I did was check off sockets when I did
feathers generate other than that I've
done nothing
and we're actually built in sockets
works just fine we don't actually have
to do anything so the only thing I'm
gonna do now is change to small things
in her back-end and that's it so the
first thing I want to do is we're just
gonna go into our services and we're
just gonna go into the item service and
I'm gonna go into item model so this is
inside the backend source services item
open up item model and you see how it
has text here that's good we're gonna
have an item that's gonna have a text
and it's gonna also have a field called
complete and this is gonna have the type
boolean and this just says whether they
have the item crossed off or not okay so
that's it
just wanted to add that to the item
model and then in the index right here
I'm just going to bump this up to 15
this is just a small little thing
that'll come in handy later as we we're
gonna be using the find in the client
and it lets us get items from the
database and it lets us get more than
just five this allows to get 15 out of
the database by default just makes it a
little bit easier okay and that's it our
database is all good to go our server is
all good to go
you notice how easy that was for us to
set up a feather server and get it
running
working with sockets and everything the
rest of the tutorial we're actually just
working on the front end with react so
I'm just gonna do MPM start leave this
running through the rest of this
tutorial
because it's good to go in the next
video we'll start working on the front
