use a reverse polish notation calculator
on the right I have stack calculator
which is one and then on the Left I have
full frame alpha and I just have a
sample equation that we're gonna solve
and it results in 11 so if we do it
right we should get that and now the
difference with how this works from a
normal calculator there's two big things
the first is and this is saying five
plus seven or whatever numbers you want
to add you enter your numbers first and
then you say what operation you want to
occur on them so we would say six and
then we say enter and then we say eight
and we add them together the second
thing is there's no parentheses and you
don't need parentheses at all in a
reverse polish notation calculator
because it uses a stack where it stores
previous results as you'll see so let's
try to solve this and I'll show you how
you would do it with a reverse polish
notation calculator okay so first I
start from the left or the innermost so
I'm gonna calculate this and then this
and then this so six enter eight right
and then we say well operation we want
to occur on those numbers we're gonna
add them together so 14 and then I want
to square root it or not square root it
power of two so I'm in or two and then
power we get 196 and now we want to
divide it by 102
it's normally right you would say
division in parentheses 102 at minus 53
but with this it's really nice because
it we're pretty much just gonna float
this answer so I'm gonna hit enter
notice how it pops up there and now I
can say 53 and I can subtract it from
102 and so now we want to really do
division on these two numbers right so
now I just say division and we get four
and this side is done so now I want to
calculate this and add it with that so
again I'm just gonna float it so I'm
gonna say four to eight it's kind of
just sitting up there and I say enter
379 subtract and then now I want to buy
you by seven so I say seven and now we
add them together finally
and we get 11 so cool so that's how you
do it with reverse polish notation
calculator the difference is is you do
this technique which I like to call
floating or basically you save your
answer up the stack or up in the air
while you compute another part and put
it together I really like these type of
calculators and using them a lot in math
over regular ones just from a nice being
able to push it up and not having to
worry about parentheses and then gonna
get in trouble you can swap stuff if you
get it outward or whatnot so I really
like it so that's how you use it I hope
that was helpful
