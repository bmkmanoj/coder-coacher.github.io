maybe a month ago for one of my
tutorials when I was using Prisma and I
just fell in love with it and now I
really want to use typescript for pretty
much all my new projects that I'm going
to be using so I wanted to show you why
I really like typescript
before I the one reason I wasn't using
typescript or flow is I felt like it
slowed me down when I was using
JavaScript compared to using javascript
because I felt like I had waste had to
waste time to add types but now I'm kind
of feeling the opposite I feel like I'm
coding faster in typescript than I was
with JavaScript and that's really just
the main reason for me is I've been
coding faster and then also my code is
safer because that's now checking the
types so let me show you what I mean by
faster though so this first thing is
something that I didn't get when I was
trying flow and that was super good
integration with Visual Studio code so
let me show you what I mean by that so I
currently have a deeply nested component
over here it's in routes login
components and I don't know anything
about this header like what it does and
I just want to add it to my component
right here so I just start making my
header and you'll notice I have it
imported it yet but I get this nice
little autocomplete I can go down to the
header and now it'll auto import it for
me at the top like this and now I have
header and look how many it deeply
nested it did the whole import for me
and that's super nice so I love being
able to do that so Visual Studio code
has started to do some of that with
JavaScript but it's not nearly as nice
as with typescript so now I pretty much
never manually import any of my
components I just auto import them with
using visual studio codes the next thing
as soon as I imported this component it
Rea tells me there's something wrong
with it so I can check right here and
it's like all right the property text is
missing in the type okay so that means
and by the way these messages are pretty
cryptic at first but as you get used to
typescript you kind of realize what
they're talking about in this case I
didn't add a text property
so if I just add it in here it should be
good right Oh No look I misspelled it
so like things like this where I would
basically go and run my code and go
check it in the browser and something
would be wrong and I'd have to go debug
it I know right away with typescript
that I just misspelled it or I just left
off a letter and now we're good so it
just saves me time having to go check my
code imp like normally with JavaScript I
would go and maybe add some console logs
to see if it gets passed in okay and
then realize up the chain I just
misspelled something or whatnot and
really for those two reasons being able
to know what I need to pass to my
components or my functions and then also
being able to import them easily with
Visual Studio code and the auto
completion it gives you has really
converted me to typescript and I love it
and I'd highly recommend that if you
haven't already checking it out I
haven't checked flow lately or tried
flow that's Facebook's version
typescript is Microsoft's version and so
I don't know if the integration with
Visual Studio code is better but right
now I love the integration with
typescript so that's what I'm going to
be using and pretty much using for all
my future projects so that's it that's
why I like typescript and highly
recommend checking it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
