to talk about redox observable this is a
library that uses rxjs and redux and
kind of mashes the two together it's
pretty cool it allows you to do
basically async programming in a
different style and I really like it for
calling making API calls and making
Network calls with react now the reason
I want to talk about today is I was just
going through and figuring out how it
works and I need to scroll down my cell
to have this react example and if you
open up we can see and they just have a
big chunk of code here it spits out this
and I want to show you guys how you can
actually take this code that behavior
right here and then actually put it on
your computer and run it and make it
work
you found think it's that clear how do
you take what they have here and
actually add it to your project so I
just want to walk you the process of how
I added this to my own project to run it
from my own computer so the first thing
I did was just open up terminal and I
have NPM and react and all that jazz
already set up the first thing I did was
run create react app and then I called
my app ping-pong IRA ran that but if
you're following along run that now and
then you should get a little screen that
looks like this and if you don't have
create rack react app you can install
like this using NPM you can do a global
install of it but I already have it so
I'm not going to run that so I'm just
going to CD into ping-pong and if we
just do a quick look inside we have all
our folders now we're going to need a
few other packages so we're going to
have to install the other packages to
get this working because we're going to
be using Redux observable and all the
stuff that goes along with that so I
like to install packages with yarn um
this is a really cool package basically
manager that Facebook put out and if you
don't have it you can install like this
it's a lot faster than
p.m. I like it we cannot install this
with NPM if you prefer so the first
thing I'm gonna do is just omit this
directory I'm just going to keep all the
defaults and I'm gonna say yarn add and
the the dependencies that we're going to
need are Redux observable so this guy
right here we're going to need redux
redux a react and redux and then of
course rxjs
which you know you don't really it's
hard to tell you need it from here but
this relies on rxjs
and the background so we're in salt rxjs
Redux observable redux and react redux
now also add this line to the
description below if you want to copy
and paste it and then I will just
download all these packages with yarn
it's usually pretty quick if you aren't
a fast it's a fast cheetah so we need to
talk about that done and cool now we can
do CD in the source and we can start
working so first I'm going to do is when
you first make the app with create react
app there's some stuff you don't need so
I'm going to get rid of it I'll need app
CSS I don't need app tests
I don't need index dot CSS and I don't
need logo so you should be left with two
folders and source app and index if we
can start with index first I actually
know we'll start with index laughs the
first thing is we're going to come back
over here and we're showing look at the
component so the first thing is right
here is these are just hard-coded
strings I'm just going to replace each
of the pings and pawns with strings so
it's a little easier we're ending this
take this first thing right here and
this is just an action so I'm going to
create a action folder and in the extra
folder may create index such AF and
going to paste in the faction and I'm
going to export it and I'm just going to
wrap this type what it need to be a
string and that's going to be our action
and then right here we have an epoch so
I'm going to create and copy the sky
create an epic so I'm going to make
directory called epics and epics when I
create an index of GS just paste this
guy in here and export now I'm not
exporting default because I could see
myself adding more attics or more
actions in the future so when I keep it
flexible and again wrap wrap with a
quotations because there's strings now
we're not using the variables next thing
is a reducer to copy this so we can make
a directory called reducers and then
reducers we'll call create a GS holder
called ping pong gf and we'll paste this
into this is a reducer and export notice
I will export default because this is
the only reducer I'm going to have in
here so export default and then I'm just
going to jam the function in right here
and then again just wrap these guys with
quotation marks okay so this is our
reducer for this so so far we should
have at create three folders actions
epics and reducers and add of those in
the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to create a store so we're
going to copy this guy right here and we
actually only need this right here so
them door yes and this is in the on the
same level as index watch es lo que
stored up GF so change this to import I
haven't seen this syntax before where
see how he does in the ports right here
I haven't seen the syntax before this
could work I'm going to do it to more
familiar that I'm used to so get that
from redux one well you know we can't
just import that from Redux observable
and we change it that's how it would
look like in a string and notice how
we're using the ping epoch and the ping
reducer and let's drop the CMU line and
we can also export this create store so
export default create store so we need
to import reducer in the ping epoch so
import ping epoch from epics now if
you've never seen this before this is a
cool way of how importing works I'll
notice how in our epoch so if I just see
these epics and I'm not willing the CD
I'll just LS epics notice in epics we
have index bub KS but and here I just
did import dot epics and do splash index
you don't need to do that it will
automatically grab that index ljs holder
for us and so this is a kind of a
cleaner shorter to write and I like it
it looks cleaner and we're going to do
the same thing for our one offer reducer
so for our actions later so paying
reducer and this was a default so here
that that's for my reducers I campaigned
off
ping pong okay so we just imported our
epic my reducer our epic we use right
here create middleware and then I reduce
it right here and we're actually going
to be using the
creates store on in our index that's why
we're exporting here okay
so I'm going to make a component folder
component and we're going to just move
we have a PS in the outer scope we're
going to move into component and then
we're going to change up stuff with a
plot GIS so now this is our app right
here copy this so we don't need this
whole class extends component part and
we don't need a SVG or the CSS or to
import connect from react Redux and then
the rest of this is good we just have it
right in here and then the last part is
just our index page which you can just
copy this little guy right here paste
them in scared of this don't need our
CSS anymore our app is in our component
folder from your prefixes and then we
just need to grab our store which we
know is store from and then the store
file that we just made all right this
should be good let's give this a run and
so another terminal or you can do in the
same terminal if I'm gonna open a new
terminal and then I'm in that folder I'm
just going to say NPM start start the
server and we'll see if we get any
errors and we did OOP we press import
provider we just notice we're using the
provider tag right there or a component
so we just need to import that provider
from believe it's from redux
let's see it likes it component so app
component oh it looks like it likes this
if we go back though I forgot to import
some things and to go to components app
jf notice that down here we're using
ping so we actually need to import that
from our action so import ping from I
mean you go up a directory and then
actions
um and then is there another one that we
need import no so let's just see we have
an air delay is not a function actually
let's type out and there's one last
thing if you go back to the index folder
sorry index file we just need to import
rxjs that way it we go into our epics
here notice how we're using some rxjs
functions delay map to in our index
folder we need to import it so it can
use it okay so and I think provider is
from react Redux and if this should not
work yep so now if we click start
painting goes from true or false exactly
how we would think it would work okay so
we now have this running on our own
computer and we can now modify and add
stuff to it and continue creating an
application that we want so you can go
on and add things to this and use this
as a template if you like if you're
interested in learning more about kind
of how this works because this if you're
not from two familiars our chefs I'm
just going to explain real quick how
what's happening in this code so the
first thing is that might be a little
weird is CC import ArcGIS this is just
grabbing all of our xjf functions and
basically letting your whole application
use them so you'll see this later as I
showed in your epic set they can use
them and so we're grabbing it this
should look familiar if you're familiar
actin Redux we're just creating a
provider and we're soaking up the redux
store that we created in our store file
so I'll show that and then we're just
rendering the app ok so then our store
function we configure the Redux store
now the thing that might look a little
different is we're just adding some
middleware this allows the ping epoch to
basically listen for actions so it's
going to happen here is every time I
click and we'll just go into components
every time I click this button here it's
going to call the ping action which we
created now notice and let's just get
the ping ok so when I click on this
button it's going to call this ping
action the ping action is this thing
right here that we created and when it
when this is clicked it will dispatch an
action to the Redux reducers now we know
this because that's what when you is
connect right here the second one here
this is adding it to the prop so if we
just right click and inspect and react
let's go can click down we can see in
our app you notice that there's a
function called ping in the prop and
that's because we connected right here
the ping function that we got from
actions down here we're connecting that
to the props right here so that way when
we click on the button we can call pain
and that's how it's getting it here and
notice it's getting it's grabbing ping
from the props right here that's what
this decomposition is ok so dispatch is
in action then what after this action is
dispatched it will go into the reducers
pon reducer and then it will dispatch a
ping and now is ping is true and we'll
see that as we click when we click this
action is dispatched and now this is
true now after an action goes through
here what it will do is it will actually
go through our epoch so after it goes
through your reducer and this is very
important this is after it goes through
the reducer it then comes through this
epoch it comes to action is a type ping
so this is true so then it waits
basically at one second and then it send
dot map to type palm this might look
kind of foreign but basically what it's
doing is it's issuing a new action
called palm so a new action called pong
will go through again and now if we go
to our reducer when palm comes is paying
as now false and that's why you click
this it dispatches action it becomes
true it waits one second dispatches
another action it goes to the reducer
and changes this to false so that's how
that is working how old these are
connected and so how it wires up this
reducer in this epoch how these are all
talking to each other is when you create
the store right here you notice how we
have the ping a pick we create some
middleware and then we create our store
we add both the ping reducer and the
middleware itself so that all this stuff
is happening so I hope that makes more
sense a little bit more sense at least
and rxjs is this I didn't go too much
over how this worked right here but I
hope this makes more sense how redux
observable kind of handles these things
and I hope this example the ping pong
game you kind of understand how it was
put all together and you can try
changing things and breaking it and
trying to understand how this example is
working so I hope it helped and let me
know if you have any questions in the
comments below I'd be happy to help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
