so now when I create a team it'll
automatically send my JWT token to the
server and then they know what user I am
and then they can assign my user to the
team that I just created but we're not
handling Aires
very well right now with this so if I
come over here to my application I can
see I have no tokens so I should not be
able to create a team and I hit submit
sure enough it says cannot read
properties equalizer undefined so we do
get an error of some kind but we don't
get hey you're not authenticated and
that's really what we want to do is
protect these basically routes and make
sure no one's able to access these and
they're not authenticated so here's how
we're gonna do it the first thing is
we're gonna protect the actual graph QL
endpoint and we're gonna do this using a
method I like to use that can be
basically broadly used with any type of
permission so I'm gonna copy this and
we're gonna go over how this works and
what this will allow us to do is do
fine-grained permissions on the resolver
level so what I'm gonna be doing is
ideally I'd like to say create team is
authenticated route and only users that
are logged in can create team so if
you're not logged in you can't access
this mutation and so we want to be able
to do this in a generic way where we can
say any mutation so we can select a
handful of them that I need to be
authenticated and some aren't I'm gonna
be able an easy way to reuse code across
these so I like to do it in this way so
this is something I took from a
repository I saw called graph QL I think
it's a palo errors actually and i really
liked it so how it works is you create
this thing called create resolver and
what it is is a function that takes a
resolver and creates another
offer so here's an example I can create
a requires off resolver so when I call
create resolver here what I do is I pass
it a resolver so you'll notice here this
looks like my team resolver here it has
a parent args and then contacts you so
parent args contacts and then here is
checking the context the user so here
what I could do is I could say user and
could just expand this if I wanted to
and if we're there's not a user or
there's not a user ID we know this is a
bad user and we throw an error let me
say not authenticated so that's exactly
what we want right we want to wrap our
components over here and what this allow
us to do is in our team over here I can
then say import requires I think it's
requires it requires off from slash
actually wrapper repository permissions
and then here I can say requires off dot
create resolver
and I wrap my whole resolver here in
that and oops I just went down one too
many area and the great thing about this
is this can be have many children so
requires off here is now going to be
checked so what's gonna happen is this
is gonna run and it doesn't like it
because we only have one but we'll add
more later we only have one resolver
here right before so this is gonna be
this one resolver here is gonna be run
before our create team so it's gonna
check and if it doesn't have you use it
then it's not often to get but what's
nice is we don't have to limit this to
one I can say requires off dot create
resolver and that's what you see in the
example here is I actually have an admin
so why don't I just copy this to show
you guys so here what I'm doing is I'm
saying requires off dot create resolver
and here I'm checking whether the user
is an admin now you notice instead of
calling create resolver here using the
space I'm using requires dot off so
what's gonna happen is it's gonna go
through two things it's first going to
check whether the user is logged in if
not throws and authenticated err then it
comes here to requires admin and checks
whether the user is admin and we don't
have an admin so we don't have to use
this but this should kind of shows you
the power of this you can stack these so
now over here instead it requires off I
could say requires admin and really that
does two checks so this is just a really
nice way to do permissions that I found
and I really like it so we don't need
this and kind of how this is how it's
working right here we are creating a
we're taking our resolver which we're
grabbing here and we're saying I want to
be able to create basically add a
function to a called create resolver
that takes a child resolver and then
returns a new resolver now our new
resolver is another resolver that first
waits for the child resolver it first
resolves itself the base resolver and
then the child resolver which sounds
really confusing but basically what this
is doing is this child here is gonna
resolve before whatever it got created
so this guy is gonna resolve before this
guy because this is this is its child if
you will I probably didn't explain this
well the gist of it is this runs before
this so we're checking whether they have
an off but stuff like this is very
confusing when you have function inside
of functions and this is barking at me
because I didn't export defaults so
let's export default and I'm just gonna
do a little requires off a little
comment here so you know what that does
so now if I tried to do this force a
graphical so I want to show you guys
before and after this should to have
8080 so now if I try to do mutation and
I try to do it from here so I'm
obviously not logged in and let's just
grab okay
it says not authenticated so that's
awesome that's what we expect and same
thing goes over here when I hit submit
we should get a not authentic it and we
do perfect I'm not sure what this is I'm
gonna refresh and see if we get that
error again we get the same one here
looks like it happens when you do two
errors in a row but now on our front end
if we get this not authenticated error
we want to not even show that screen
anymore right we want to move them to a
different screen so on submit here what
I'm going to do is do a try-catch for
this mutation so I'm gonna say Const
response is equal to null and I'm gonna
make it a let variable I'm gonna say try
try doing this catch any errors that we
get and now we only have really one err
that we're gonna get if you had other
errors what you could do is oops lagged
for a second if you have others you can
read the air object but here we're just
gonna say this stop drops the history
dot push to the login page so if anyone
tries to do this and they're not logged
in we're just going to tell them to go
to the login page so here I'm not logged
in we can see and tells me just go to
the login and on submit and notice how I
had the function run still we need to
return and that way we don't get this
error so create team so now I'm covered
if some kind of user tries to do this
they're gonna get blocked so I'm gonna
register a new user because I forgot my
username from last time comm and now
we're just gonna log in and make sure
the functionality still works
so sure enough for able to create a team
okay still so we're not logged in we get
kicked out and sent to the login page
otherwise we're good but ideally we
don't even want to show the user this
page if they're not authenticated so one
way we can do is check we know if
they're not authenticated with these
tokens now someone could do a fake token
and trick us but most users aren't gonna
put fake tokens so what we can do is
just check for whether they have a
refresh token and a regular token so jw2
decode is what we're gonna use this is a
library that lets you take a token and
just decode it so we're gonna get the
contents of this token and we are gonna
use that to redirect users so here is
our react router right here and how this
works is they have a little off example
and we're gonna copy this but we're
gonna do it slightly differently just
because we have a JWT JWT token we're
gonna look at so we're gonna create this
thing called a private route and you use
it the same as the regular route but you
notice you do this is authenticated
check so we're gonna copy this and come
over here so I real quick before we get
started I'm gonna go ahead and install
the library so I'm on client download
yarn add j2 decode and then I'm gonna
come over here to my routes
and I'm just gonna paste this guy in so
private route and so we're using a route
that we have up here and we're taking
the props and we're saying if the user
is authenticated will show the component
otherwise we redirect them to the login
page
which is perfect and we don't work care
about any sending of any type of state
this redirect component is coming from
react router Daum and it just says
notice how we're rendering a redirect
here that is whether that does is just
redirects to the login page as you would
expect
so private route how this works is this
create team instead of a route it's
going to be a private route and same
thing pass the component create team
notice this component here we're gonna
render it if the user is authentic it
now instead of doing fake off what we're
gonna do is say check off or we can say
is authenticated so conce is
authenticated
and here we're gonna import our de WT
I'm gonna call it decode from JWT decode
and here I'm going to say Kant's token
is equal to local storage getitem token
and same for the Refresh token and now
I'm just going to do a try/catch we're
just going to try to decode the token
and we're going to catch if we get any
errors we're gonna return false and if
we're gonna de Cobo the token and the
Refresh token so what this is doing is
it's just trying to decode the token if
it can't decode the token the d the
tokens either null or it's invalid or
something and so that user is not
authenticated we say so we're gonna say
return true otherwise so let's take a
look at this
I'm authenticated you can see my tokens
here so I'm gonna try to malformed one
of these so delete a character and then
refresh and it still works so I
obviously did not malformed this
correctly so if you go to JWT i/o you
can see what your token decodes to okay
so notice it still decodes this stuff if
I take stuff off the end here
nothing changes I think that has to do
with the secret I think I have to take
off some here there we go so notice how
the payload it goes from having purple
stuff and I get rid of it and it changes
it dies so it makes it invalid
so I'm gonna come in here in the middle
and leave on the letters see if that
invalidates it alright sure enough we
have invalid token now and we get
redirected now I'll also show you with a
cleared out token Creek team BAM took me
right back to the login page but if I
were to log back in and I already forgot
my login but I would be able to access
the page I really need to just write one
of these logins down I think I mean we
can copy this I think I use the same
username and password yeah that worked
all right create team we're noticed
we're still able to access the page so
now we have this guarded on the front
end so we're saving a request we have to
make to the server but we're also
guarding on the back end in case someone
is not accessing it through our website
or if they get past the front end
somehow so we have this not that decayed
also so our bases are covered now when
creating teams and we're also this is
very easy to use every time we create
new things as we go we create channels
we create other things we can create new
private routes and we don't have to code
this up again and then also our
permissions here as we get more
permissions we can use this resolver
here and create new ones making sure
they're still authenticated and the
errors will bubble up which is really
cool so that is it for this video guys
thanks for watching and the code for
this will be up on github
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
