video we're going to be sitting up the
API calls but real quick there's one
thing I forgot to add to our saga it's
in our root function at the very bottom
we just need to pass in service as a
parameter so that it can see service
right there oh sorry not service we just
need to rename feathers after service my
bag okay and then we're good to go sagas
are good okay now head over here to not
head over when you create our services
services and an API dot jas these are
our functions that actually call our
feathers GS server so first I'm going to
create is create item we're going to
pass in service is the first parameter
item is the second and it's SuperDuper
easy we're in return we don't even need
to return because we're not even looking
for a turnstile we will return anyway I
guess just for the sake of it also I
believe we actually might need to return
because it's waiting for yield but
anyway so we're going to call service
create pass an item and then do dot then
data and then return data and that's it
look how easy that was to create a item
there's four more functions we're going
to be creating each one similar remove
item and remember we just had passed in
the ID and likewise pretty easy here as
well we're going to change instead of
create we remove we just passed an ID
add item we want to remove next we'll do
update item
passing in the ID and data the new data
we want to replace so and we're just
going to pass those right in do update
ID new data and return data last one
find all items we get service here and
we have no other parameter and we do
find and then we're going to create an
object in the middle this is just to
sort it which will be using later for
our to do list that way it looks nice
and pretty when it prints out in the
right order created at you do negative
one you might be wondering what this
gibberish is right here what this is is
that this jas allows you to basically
filter your queries when you're finding
items and the database so we're looking
through the Postgres database and how we
want to do it is we'd like to sort the
results given back to us and the way
we'd like to sort it is by looking at
this key called created at and you'll
notice we didn't actually create this
this was something that postgres
automatically makes for you and the
minus 1 means it's in descending order
biggest first or earliest or latest so
like this is time base to the most
recent to-do list you add will be at the
top so if I just add a and then I add be
it will be be a not a be okay that was a
bad example but anyway you understand
what I'm saying it's in descending order
and I'm just going to pop over here and
look at the debug and make sure
everything is compiling okay into the
link with your module not found I
thought service API and react source
saugus so it's not finding our services
folder I just want to pop in there and
make sure we did everything
we just need to rename this disservice
is not service and I just want to make
sure it's compiling okay and that
compiles all good okay this was a
shorter video but we have our API called
if we actually call this function those
actions they will then come over here
call the sagas which create an async
call to our API which we just created
and actually update on our server now
this is a lot of basically structure and
infrastructure we're setting up for
application in the next coming videos
we're going to be creating some reducers
and then actually adding some stuff to
this UI making it look nice and pretty
showing up on the screen and we'll see
the power of sockets coming up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
