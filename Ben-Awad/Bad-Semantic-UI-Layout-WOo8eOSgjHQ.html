intro to this video and say none of the
code you're about to see it works and
I'm going to scrap all of it so I tried
making a layout with semantic UI using
their grid system to try to copy the
slack design like this where you have a
sidebar on the left and then all this
stuff here and it didn't quite work out
very well I had trouble getting the grid
to work and I didn't like how Samantha
Hugh I had it set up so I kind of just
rage quit and I have this is what it my
end product look like right before I
quit and you're gonna see me basically
make this monster but I'm gonna
basically start all over from scratch on
making the layout so this is just a PSA
of what not to you what not to do when
styling and creating things with
semantic UI but I'll be redoing this
with grid CSS grid or maybe flexbox and
it's gonna work a lot better if you want
to see me suffer through creating this
layout keep watching if not come back
tomorrow where we'll actually code this
up much nicer hey guys we're gonna be
building out our layout for a slack
clone and this is the page we're going
to try replicating so we're gonna be
using semantic UI components for this
and I was trying to break out this
layout and to basically a grid that we
could make and what it looks like is we
have a sidebar which cut off cuts off
here and then a bottom a little input
bar and then a header here so basically
four different components a messages
block a header block a input that we put
down here and then this little sidebar
so we're gonna try making this and
semantic UI has a lot of little
components we can use to replicate this
so they have a sidebar we're gonna be
using they have an input field and then
also a header we're gonna use and then
I'm not quite sure how we're going to do
the messages but semantic UI has some
really good ones for messages
so we can try some different ones out
and see how it looks alright so let's
get started so I'm gonna put this in a
new route so I'm gonna call it view team
Jas and I'm just going to set up this
route this is gonna be a private route
later
but right now I'm gonna make it just
regular routes so it's easy to view and
create the layout so view team and now
in here I'm trying to say import react
from react I'm just gonna export default
and we're gonna put our stuff here so
I'm thinking I'm gonna make a components
folder and in my component folder I'm
going to create a team sidebar team
header and team input bar well that
doesn't really make sense team I guess
message input message and and so for our
sidebar I'm just gonna copy the
components over from semantic UI and
then we can go back and change them to
our liking so I'm going to copy the
sidebar example they have into the
sidebar and then the header I'm gonna
copy their header I'll just grab a
regular header here
or you know what this is a bunch of them
they're just one where there's a one
this is fine I suppose
and we only really need one and then
message input
I'm gonna worry about creating the
message cards at a later date and let's
grab and we want a fluid input bar
so do they not hear you so copied all
those in place and now my view team what
I'm going to do is I'm going to import
the team sidebar from components slash
team sidebar
and we're going to do this for each one
now we can't just
oops we can't just mash these all in
here like if I just put a div in here
it's not gonna look good team sidebar
team header and message input I don't
even know what this is gonna look like
just adding them like this
I assume really ugly view team Team B
does not exist she's supposed to be team
of you know this is supposed to be view
team Oh down here put team you view team
okay they're not team you alright so
this does not look anything like how how
slack is looking our little sidebars
right here and we got our header and our
little bars here nowhere near what we
want it to look like and the way we're
gonna get this to layout in a nice
fashion is using a grid component from
semantic UI here and so the first thing
we're gonna do is say we want the
sidebar over here and all the other
content on the right so if we come back
over here to grid let's create a basic
grid
and you don't really need an image and
we don't need lodash for this so I'm
gonna create a grid here instead of
using a outermost div and you'll notice
what I want to do with each one of these
components is make them presentational
only this is the separate my view logic
from my actual graph QL logic and
requesting stuff so we're going to be
creating some container classes in
future videos so here's our grid and
then what I'm gonna do is we're gonna
have a sidebar here so grid dot row so
this is all gonna be one row you know
what we don't even need to say real I'm
just gonna say column and let's say this
has a width of 1 because we don't really
want the sidebar to be that vague right
and then the rest of this is in the
other column all right we don't need
that and now with this I'm gonna say
maybe is ten and let's just see what
that looks like okay so our sidebar is
over here on the side I think it's a
little bit too small I'm gonna give it
more of like a three see how that looks
yeah that's looking a little bit better
now I also don't want this sidebar to
like toggle on and off
I just want to always be there so we
click on the sidebar and you know what
this is now that I think of it because
this is a we don't even care about
having this be toggle on and off you
notice on the slack this is a static I
think making this into a grid makes more
sense than actually using the sidebar
component now that I'm looking at this
so I almost think let's do a grid for
this don't even bother with a sidebar so
I'm gonna delete this and copy a great
example in here because I like the idea
of doing a grid better since it's gonna
be static okay
so we're gonna say team sidebar we're an
export default team sidebar okay so this
is gonna be a grid and let's see what
we're gonna take as props so as props we
need the name of the I guess the name of
the team the name of the user and in the
name of the channels and then all the
people they can direct message so team
name username channels which should be
an array channel names and then direct
messages direct
messages so now we're going to construct
a grid this is gonna be one column and
then multiple rows so we're gonna have
one row here
another row here three rows and inside
of those we have more rows right so
we're gonna say grid dot Row three times
and here for now I'm just going to put a
team name and user name and we can see
how this looks and then we can come back
and change change it so channel names
I'm gonna map this so for each channel
name I'm just gonna return that channel
name I don't even know if it lets us do
something like this
wrap it like this
I think let's to make just this make
this a paragraph tag I suppose and
because this is the thing we need to
wrap it in that because it's to draw the
script string I think that looks good
so this is our closing brass brace I'm
just gonna space this so I can make sure
this is all good so channel name stop
maps we're going through this array of
strings and we're gonna say for each
channel name we're gonna display a
paragraph tag okay
oh there's be one more there we go
that's all good and of course at the
very top though it's also gonna just say
the word channels and then our last one
here it's gonna be a direct message so
channels direct messages then we're
gonna do the same thing with mapping so
direct messages we're going to loop
through the DMS this actually is not
really a direct message
these aren't messages there's probably a
better name for this we'll say people to
DM
I don't know if this is a better name
but I like it better I think people to
DM so person and will display that
person's name actually let's say instead
people users users to DM that's the best
okay
so here's our little sidebar so over
here in team in our team sidebar for now
we're gonna pass in dummy data so team
name is gonna be Bob Bob is cool and our
username is gonna be Bob the first and
our channels are gonna be general and
random
okay and then people we can direct
message users to DM we have slack bot
myself so a slack bot will use a
different user Bob Bob the first
actually I don't know if you can have
spaces and yeah I think you have spaces
in your name Bob the first and I'll type
Bob the second
okay so let's take a look at our sidebar
and it looks like we're like a little
bit off the page here so I'm gonna just
inspect this guy and see what's going on
and we can see here's our grid and the
width is 82% I think we just have does
this I think this could add up to 12 I
don't know if it says here usually a
grids are 12 in length or a number of
columns you can have because I have
three and a 10 I'm gonna try making this
a nine and see if it fits on the page
better nope it doesn't I don't know why
that's going off the page and I also
don't know why why this is not expanding
so here's a grid right we have this and
this this guy's not taking up the full
width like this column this kid div here
I want to be all the way over here so
this is 18%
so what eighteen point seven five plus
56 does that even add up 200 I don't
think it does I want to just have I
thought I pasted it so eighteen point
seven five plus 56 point 25
I don't know why this won't add okay
there we go Plus 56 point 25 so we need
25 more space so I'm gonna call this
five give our sidebar some more room and
it's still off to the side a wonder if
that's just because uh I'm using random
paragraph tags I think it is I think
instead what I need to do is use
something else okay
also let's add a container around this
whole thing so if I can we're here to
container okay it's just container that
might help as well a container slash
container and let's make this 15
what we could do is we should be able to
make this like one of them expand to
fill okay now we have this so yeah we
are we are like growing past I don't
know what the heck our grid is doing now
our container is giving us hecka padding
on this so on my team I'm now gonna just
put each one's which is pretty much what
the header is and soon h1 here and these
might be better as like h4 s I'm gonna
make them all h 4s so h1 to h4
I didn't do it globally h-12 here we'll
just do finding in replace h1 to h4 area
let's take a look at that that looks a
little bit better
and I want a copy also this will help us
with debugging so we can see where the
width of the container is so we need to
make all that text white and I just want
to get the color of this guy
oops so I'm gonna come over here chrome
dev tools allows you to inspect this so
I got the color of this guy so I should
be able to my grid does it say is there
a color attribute if not there should be
just like a style I can override class
name I can add a class to it nope
doesn't say so I'm gonna just try doing
a style here and I'm gonna say
background color it's equal to that
and that did not work at all man I am
NOT I'm not liking the way this is
looking at all I'm not liking the
constraints of semantic UI what I think
I'm gonna do is actually just redo this
whole thing using CSS grid or flexbox
and use some styled components because I
think that'll go a lot smoother I still
only use this guy but setting up the
sidebar and styling these is difficult I
could just be bad at using semantic UI
though it could be that too so I think
I'm just gonna rage quit and switch over
to CSS grid because I really want to
like change the color and stuff and make
this look more like slack so I'm gonna
stop this guy right here and restart him
using CSS grid so thank you guys for
watching let's give this thing a little
change up
