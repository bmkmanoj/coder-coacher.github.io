make a web application using kind of the
microservices architecture now you can
see this is what I'm going to be showing
you how to make it's kind of just a
basic recipe box website you have your
recipes here you can click on them look
at the recipes you have a picture title
the ingredients on the description of
how to make it um as you can see I have
a login system and sign out I'm so whole
authentication if I click on this I can
see the recipes that I've added has been
a lot of these are the recipes
um you can also add another recipe if I
want I can log out sign up go to I can
make a new user so let's just make test
I sign up
I can then log in with my user I just
created now if I click here I can see
that I don't have any recipes but I can
go ahead and add one so let's just say
test recipe click an image just do this
and say test ingredient then words I'm
going to submit that and as we can see
you can see our little recipe has been
added we go to the front page we see a
recipe and that's kind of how it works
so to make this what we're going to use
is two things for the server at the back
end we're going to be using feathers j/s
which is basically it makes it it's on
top of node and makes it really easy to
set up a server and basically this will
act as our API to call and then on the
front end we're going to be making a
client application using react and as
you can see it kind of has like these
cool little card things that is using
semantic UI now in the video today I'm
just going to help you guys get set up
for the future videos when we actually
start creating this so to use feathers
we just need to install the command line
feathers application so if you do npm
install - g feathers CLI that'll install
for you and then once you do that
ivory have my installed so i won't
install it again these two feathers it
should pop up a little prompt making
sure it is downloaded okay and you need
npm to install that so make sure you
have that if not make sure that install
a node and you'll get npm with it
so for react to bake the react part
we're going to be using react or create
react app this is something Facebook put
out that makes it super easy to set up a
project with react if you just do npm
install - g create react app they'll
install for you and then just do that to
make sure you have go ahead and run and
make sure you have installed so using
those will set up kind of our project in
the next video i will show you how to
get started we'll start with the
feathers server we'll set up and then
after that after you set up kind of an
api and a server that we'll use that
will call will then create a client
react application that will call our
feathers server and they will
communicate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
