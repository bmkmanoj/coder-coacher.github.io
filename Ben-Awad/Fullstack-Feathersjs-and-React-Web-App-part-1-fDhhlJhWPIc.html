going to be showing you how to set up
the feathers backend server now the
first thing you want to do is just go
ahead and open up a terminal window and
go to the folder you'd like to make the
project in so I'm in a folder called
backend right now and make sure you have
the feathers command-line application
I'm installed using NPM so once you have
that you just can do feathers generate
and then it will just go ahead and make
a little prompt where you will kind of
fill out the information for your
project so I'm going to call this menu
monkey and leave the description empty
we're only going to use rest services no
sockets I mean just enable for all and
we're going to keep it simple and use a
any DB and then we're use local and then
what's doing right now is it's going
just installing all the dependencies
that we needed for this project and
going through and setting everything up
and then once that's done we actually
have ourselves a a basic web server
working if we just do NPM start that
I'll go ahead and start up our server so
first if we just exit out of this this
is kind of feathers command line prompt
you want to get out of that and go back
to your normal one you do NPM start that
will start up the server and now if we
go to localhost 3030 we should see the
feathers
a little webpage show up cool awesome we
have the server up and running that's
great but we would like to you know make
API requests to this get data and post
data and all that for our recipes so how
are we going to do that so let's stop
the server and the next thing we're
going to do is we're going to create a
service and what services do is they
allow you to make API endpoints so for
example I can then go to slash recipes
maybe and it'll show me all the recipes
that I want so that's we're going to set
up by creating a service so we can do
that by doing the same way which we did
before we're going to do feathers
generate but this time we're going to
say service and the prompt will come
back up and I'll help us make our
service so I'm going to call this recipe
this is going to be using the database
and the data to persist we're going to
just use that database and for now we're
not going to use the 50k ssin so that's
going to create the service for
ourselves now now that that's there
that's great
now if we go to slash recipes it should
give us a
got start server sort of server backup
now if we go to recipes it should return
us JSON awesome so what this did is we
set up an endpoint when we go to a slash
recipes what it does is it goes and
looks for the recipes endpoint and
returns five recipes now how do we
actually add recipes to show you how to
do this I'm going to use postman to do a
post request you can use this or you can
use a curl or anything to make a post
request so hop into my postman I'm going
to go ahead and set the URL to locos
3030 and do slash recipes and I'm going
to do a post request and I'm going to
submit this JSON so I'm posting a recipe
right here to make pizza and the
ingredients are bread tomato sauce and
cheese so this is just JSON I'm going to
post so go ahead and send and as we see
this is the response from the server we
can see give us an ID for the object
that was made awesome now if we go back
and we refresh the page we can see our
pizza ingredients are there so that's
wonderful so now we can start posting to
that endpoint for a website to create
recipes and then we can go to this
important right here to get them and
just a quick note you can also do a get
request to here
same endpoint and it will return you the
JSON so you can do and post me and also
in your web browser so that's great so
something to note though right now this
will take any JSON so I can just add
another one like directions cook for 10
minutes and this is going to be broccoli
a sauce so in our broccoli sauce we're
going to eat broccoli and all oil so now
we can post this and this JSON has an
extra has an extra element directions
but as you can see it it takes it just
fine and then if we get it we can see it
just returns us another object right
there with directions so later we'll
validate the JSON to make sure it
actually fits the right schema that we
want now that's cool thing the other
thing that we want to be able to do is
log users and sign them up and what's
awesome about feathers that they're
actually already done for us by default
if you go just you know explore the
package or the folders a little bit so
if you go into source and then you go
into services you can see there is a
here's the recipe service which we just
made and there's already a user service
that's done for us and then
authentication so that lets us log in
and authenticate users in the login so
that's pretty much it for the server for
now it's pretty much all set and ready
to go don't think when we're going to do
next is setup the react client and start
calling this guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
