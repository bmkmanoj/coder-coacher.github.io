app store of their own separate from
Android or iOS that either one can use
and here's what it looks like here are
some of the featured apps so for example
you could click on flappy bird here
looks like someone made a clone and now
with the expo app that you have on your
phone if you have it what you can do is
you can scan this little barcode and
then you can run flappy bird on your
phone or any of these apps over here so
we want to deploy our stack calculator
to expose so anyone can install it um
and here it's asking me to upgrade to
High Sierra not gonna do that too many
security flaws with it but anyway where
was I oh yeah we were gonna deploy this
to Expo so yeah let's get started with
doing this it's actually quite easy
first thing you want to do is create an
account I already have an account made
with Expo you'll probably have to
confirm your email and once you're done
with that you're gonna want to set up
from the command line we need to run a
command called exp publish and to do
that we're gonna have to install that
package so option number one you can
install it globally with this command
NPM I - t exp or if you'd rather save it
locally you can run an NPM I save dev
exp and then run it with MPX alright so
once you have that package installed you
just want to run exp publish you know go
ahead and publish your app you don't
need to do anything at all so when you
do that it'll give you a link so here's
the one I rated so I publish stat
calculator now if you have not changed
any settings this is what it look like
and you notice it's kind of ugly it
doesn't have a logo and this is not you
know I don't want this - in the middle
of the name there's no description so
how do we add all these things to our
application so if you remember this app
dot JSON file we can actually fill out
so right here I filled out just a couple
things so I want my name to be stack cow
you later an icon you'll notice I
pointed it to an icon dot PNG so I made
a little icon here and I'll talk about
that in a second but I'm pointing to
that dot slash logo dot PNG which is
right here so that way it grabs that
logo and then description I set the
description and some you run exp publish
again and it'll update your description
on App Store and put these in you know
look much nicer and then how how did I
make this little logo thing so I'm not
experienced with design at all so what I
did is used pixel art which is really
easy if you haven't used it before it's
a free online tool and what you do is
just come on over here and you just draw
your little thing in pixels so here's my
little calculator I made a 500 pixel by
500 pixel board here of pixels and then
when we click download I just downloaded
it at 1500 by 1500 and saved it over
here and that's how I made that so if
you want to make your own follow along
make a little icon you can go over there
and do that and now when you type exp
publish and you go to the link stock
calculator will look a little bit nicer
we have a description the name and our
logo and nice little color in the
background so if you go to this URL
right here you can actually download and
run well you don't even have to download
it right you just can to open it with
your Expo app and you can actually use
stat calculator on your phone so you can
heart it leave a comment if you want a
little filler options so that's how you
do it and now your app is on the expo
Play Store well I guess not a Play Store
but your the Expos store in the next
video what we'll do is we'll talk about
how you can deploy this to the Google
Play and the iOS store that's it for
this video guys thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
