about a new app I'm gonna show you how
to make so just me an app called Munchie
where you can basically find where
you're gonna eat faster so this is how
the app works so first ill just bring
you kind of the home screen and I'll
bring up this random restaurant around
you alright now I have the GPS location
on San Francisco so this is some
restaurant in San Francisco so it just
shows you a picture of the food a random
picture from Yelp and then it shows the
name of the restaurant and then the
rating and then the category of food now
I can swipe up and it'll give me a new
picture of that restaurant now you can
just swipe through them look at the
pictures for that restaurant until we
find a picture we like when we find a
picture you like we can just click on it
and then this will take us to that
restaurant on Yelp and once we're on
Yelp we can then actually go to that
restaurant you know get the directions
whatnot so let's go back to app and this
is what just allows you to get to
restaurants faster so you can swipe
right it'll take you to a new restaurant
swipe right you can go back to that one
and get another one until you just find
basically a picture of food you want to
eat you just swipe up furthermore
pictures of mosaic I don't like that
restaurants go to a different one you
know I'm just gonna swipe through the
different restaurants till I find a
restaurant I like okay maybe I'm
interested in this Harbor cafe I'll just
look through a couple items that they
have and like okay this could be an
interesting place I want to eat click on
it and bam so just help you figure out
where you want to eat faster so I'm
gonna show you guys how I created this
app and this series so before I get into
kind of how you know the actual
technical part and actually making it I
just want to go over kind of the
architecture of how this app works so
I'm just gonna restart the app to show
you what happens when you first build
the app so when the app first opened up
what happens is it goes and makes an API
call to Yelp and gets all the
restaurants in your locations so it has
it takes a minute to load will making it
API call right now and it goes and picks
a restaurant from Yelp and it gets about
40 restaurants with one API call you get
40 restaurants around you and it's
getting the coordinates the latitude
longitude based on your phone and
putting that and the Yelp API call so
now it's using the location based on
your phone it gets you all these
restaurants and I'm getting the pictures
and just showing you them here so I have
all these pre-loaded I'm just going
through here and I'm using a library
called Picasso to actually load the
pictures and from the internet means
under that's all it's working so just
like doesn't initial API call it stores
them all and then as you're swiping
through in the background if let's say I
do 40 swipes to the right and I'm out of
you know the initial API call it'll make
other API calls in the background while
you're swiping through so once you have
it loaded you should not be loading
anymore you should just be swiping
through pictures the picture takes a
second to load that's just because it's
loading it off the internet but you
should not see a progress bar loading
anymore because in the background while
we're swiping right now
it's loading more restaurants from Yelp
and you can see I can pretty much just
infinitely swipe because especially if
you're in a area with a lot of
restaurants you can just go on forever
so that's kind of how the app works and
it's using async tasks and some other
things which I'll show you how that's
working in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
