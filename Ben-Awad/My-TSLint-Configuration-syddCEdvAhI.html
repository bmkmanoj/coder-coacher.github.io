configuration if you haven't heard of
this this is very similar to yes lint
and JavaScript
so this basically looks at your code and
finds like extra things code style that
sort of thing that you can stay
consistent throughout your whole project
and if you don't know what it is or
having use it before highly recommend
checking out because it just makes your
code a lot cleaner and a lot more
systematic and basically your co-workers
and yourself will be able to make your
code more readable for everyone okay so
one thing that makes it a little bit
harder when using TS lint is I like to
use something called prettier and so
what prettier does is this works with
typescript as well and it formats my
code automatically so it doesn't need me
to do anything but what happens is
prettier will format my code and it'll
make it a different style than what TS
lint likes and so TS lint will be like
hey that's a bad code after prettier
formats it so this causes a little bit
of a problem but there's this really
nice library called TS lint config
prettier and what this does is this gets
prettier anteus lint to work together
and play nice so I'm going to show you
an example of what my TS Linux like so
this is with a react application and
you'll notice all I'm really doing is
I'm extending the latest react and
prettier just like that and I'll pretty
much give me everything I need for
prettier anteus lint to work together
now react is optional so for example you
can also use this in non react app Lakai
shion's
like nodejs applications if I'm building
like an express server or with Prisma
and that's actually where I started
using typescript with Prisma and with
that I use the same configuration but I
just get rid of the react and I will put
a link in description below for both of
these if you want to see these both keas
Lintz and you can use them so this one I
like to use for react and this one I
like to use for nodejs there's a
exact same and you'll notice I have a
few more rules right here that I like to
turn off so I like to keep console logs
and and I just like keep it note to
myself to remove them later or like when
I'm building I'll turn it on or whatever
like that and then here's just some ones
that are just like rules
I found annoying to follow and so I turn
them off and so yeah if you're ever just
using it feel like using TS lint and
it's like man why is it asked me to do
this first I'd recommend actually
googling a lot of the rules they'll
actually have explanations of why it's a
good idea to follow that rule and then
if you're like yeah you can either just
disable it for that line or remove it
all together but this is pretty easy to
configure if we take a look at what to
do you just add this thing as a
dependency so and actually it's shipping
as a dependency now so this is using
create react app so I did create this is
what I ran to create this project create
react app demo and then I used the react
script type script so this created a
typescript application for react and it
automatically sets up a Tia Slynt for me
that looks pretty good they're using TS
'ln recommended instead of TS lint
latest which is a little bit different
but I don't really know the differences
I haven't had any problems with latest
and I believe latest it's what they
recommend here
so yeah they recommend latest on the TS
lint config prettier so that's what I
was using that for and then I don't
think I have any user settings turned on
but here my user settings for visual
studio code I don't think I have
anything special to have prettier and TS
won't work together I did have to do a
slant integration true but this
shouldn't be really affecting that and I
do have editor format on save so every
time I save prettier will run and format
the code for me and if we wanted to see
that in action we can come over here so
if I were to get you know
tab this awkwardly right
or maybe I forget a semicolon there and
I don't know maybe these double quotes
or something like that and we could save
and see you notice how it just like
styled everything it changed all these
double quotes so it's consistent across
the board and so that's what that stuff
does and it doesn't have any red lines
afterwards which is nice and then if you
don't have Tia Slynt prettier or like if
you don't hang if you're not building
this with a kind of like a starter kit
so like this is create react app I
reinstall all these things for you to
install this on your own and oh that's
kind of cool it ships with images DTS I
didn't know that anyway you install
three packages so if you look at dev
dependencies it doesn't actually show it
cuz it's a crate reactor but what you'd
want to do is do yarn add and okay you
your AC this is I've done this plenty of
times before
so you installed Tia slit and then Tia
Slynt config prettier to set up new
projects with Tia cellent and then you
just created Tia Slynt JSON and add the
you easy to use these rules which look
pretty good or this is what I like to
usually use but yeah that's it for this
video guys that's my configuration with
Tia Slynt let me know if you guys use
any tips or tricks with this that you'd
recommend me trying out I am pretty new
to using Tia slant and typescript in
general but I've been pretty happy with
my setup so far but give this video guys
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
