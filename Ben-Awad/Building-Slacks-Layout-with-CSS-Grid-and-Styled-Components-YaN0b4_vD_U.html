of the layout that looks like slack but
this time we're gonna use CSS grid and
instead of me trying to build the layout
we're gonna use one that someone else
has made because CSS is not my strong
suit so this is what it looks like this
is exactly what we want
teams channels header in the web version
they don't have teams but why not let's
add teams cuz teams are nice so here's
kind of how the grid is gonna look like
when we set this up we're gonna have one
two three columns and one two three rows
and here is the HTML and CSS we're gonna
use but instead of just using CSS I
thought it would be cooler if we use
styled components so this is a library
so basically you don't have to use CSS
classes and you just use components that
are styled if you've never seen it
before it's super cool I really like it
and it's getting quite popular so I'll
show you how to use this so we're gonna
take this layout and use tab components
on it so let's get started so first
thing I'm gonna do is go over here this
is my client and I'm just gonna say yarn
add styled components and then I'm gonna
add a new route here called u team and
view team is where we are the page we're
gonna set up here I'm not gonna make it
private route because I want to be able
to access it while I'm styling it but we
will change this later so call it view
team is so import react from react and
we're export defaults
and here's we're gonna put all our stuff
so we're gonna copy this and paste it in
here so here's what our layouts gonna
look like we're getting some errors
expected closing oh is it off by one no
it looks fine to me I don't know why I'm
getting errors for this all right let's
try formatting this um not sure why this
is getting errors I'm just gonna come
over here and see if this renders okay
nope we're missing a in the input oh
they just forgot to close it put tag
that's all alright there we go so we're
gonna break this off into components I'm
going to create a components oops not
file a folder yeah we're gonna put our
components in so the first thing we can
create is a sidebar or we'll call it
channels that makes more sense so this
is gonna be a channels
j/s and we're gonna import styled from
the styled components and we're going to
export default a styled div and for
channels if we come back over here
we can see this is the markup we want on
channels putting in the second column
and the I guess that's the one fourth
row I'm not quite sure and so what this
does is we now have a div that we can
use with this styling so back over here
in our view team I'm going to say import
channels from components slash channels
so now I'm so using this div here I'm
going to say channels and then I'm also
going to just give that a background
color so a background color and we're
just going to inspect this to get the
color that we want so they have a little
color picker and this will copy that and
paste that here cool
so that's our channel div and we're
gonna create a team's div as well we can
copy this paste it here and let's see
what our team's are using so our team is
has this styling and we want to add a
different background color for it they
have it here it's a darker purple all
right oops I did not mean to click on
this let's go back
and grab our picker and we have our
darker purple now all right
we don't want notifications okay so now
we have a color for our team's as well
and then we're also going to have a
header a messages and input so header
messages and input so copy the team put
in header and now I don't want to add
any background color or anything to this
so I'm gonna paste this guy in here and
move on to messages
and grab that so now you can kind of see
how we're not we're able to put our CSS
in between here and it's applying it to
this div right here and because we're
doing this we just use this component
and now it has that CSS and we don't
have to do anything now messages is a
div but input is an input tag so we just
change that there and so we get an input
tag now everything else is a div so
coming back over here we'll call this
app layout because we need an outermost
one too
so paste it's copy the channel and here
is our overall layout
pop that in there and then our review
team here so now we're gonna import each
one in so team's header messages input
an app layout and put messages header
teams so not here we'll do a play out we
will do teams channels header messages
and then here is our input oh I guess
our input wrapped in a div so we'll put
input here and we'll come back over here
and change this I thought it was input
itself we can play with that too and
also see which one looks better unable
missing file extension is it are we
gaining air okay cool hey this is laying
out quite nicely so I did not did I add
a input here you know we do have input
so everything looks good
I see the channels and the team's not
sure what's happening down here is that
our input so our inputs not getting
stretched what I think I want to do is
try if I just do an input tag here and
see what that looks like
okay nothing happened so I'm gonna
inspect this we can come in and see what
happened to this guy and the div kind of
just got collapsed all right so we'll
put this back to a div and we'll put
this back because that seemed to work so
that is a decent layout and we can see
the boundaries of this too if we go into
inspector here's our header up here and
then this is where we're gonna put
messages so this looks pretty good for
our layout I'm pretty happy with this so
this is a good stopping point what I
think I want to do next is elaborate on
this layout and make our components so
right now we just kind of have these
styled components that we created I want
to be able to pass props to them and
instead of having channels just be
static here I want to be able to pass
the channels in and do a little side
layout as well so we'll be doing more
layout stuff in the next video but this
is a good start with static components
so thanks for watching guys and the code
will be up on github
