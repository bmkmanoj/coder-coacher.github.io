video we're gonna be setting up the
routes of our app so we're just gonna go
into the index folder and the route of
source and start adding some stuff so
react router we're going to create keep
most of the same imports and then we
also I want to create a login page and a
sign-up page which we will just like a
page signup page and then right here I
created both of these regular imports I
could have kept it as default by change
sticks why not and then we're also going
to need some stuff from Apollo so you
notice how I was using the react Redux
provider here we're gonna be switching
it over let's say Paulo provider from
the reactive power and then we also need
our client import client from reducers
slash index so this is basically where
everything is being wired up right now
Apollo provider then we can pass our
store and we also pass in the client and
then we're gonna create two paths there
are two routes so the next route will
keep the same and then we'll create a
regular route path is equal to slash
login and the component is going to be
login page and we can create another one
first sign up
sign up sign up page okay and then we're
gonna keep the rest of the same and then
let's just go into the components folder
and then we're gonna create two files so
I'm gonna copy home we're gonna create a
login page I'm going to create a signup
page so go into the login page um for
now we'll just say login and we'll call
this login page and we'll do the same
thing for our signup page
and let's come back over here and make
sure everything it's working and I just
forgot to put Apollo slash Apollo
provider or my index file alright so now
we get no more errors here that's good
and if I go to sign up should say sign
up and if I go to login it says login
perfect in the next video we will start
setting up our next component we're
gonna be touching main and fixing that
up and like putting some mutations and
some queries in there that we can start
accessing things so for example when the
page loads we show the number of tacos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
