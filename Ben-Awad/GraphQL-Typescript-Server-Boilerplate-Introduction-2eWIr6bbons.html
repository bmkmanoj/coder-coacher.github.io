project series with my latest stack that
I really enjoy and I want to include
authentication and users and all that
fun stuff in this project and what I
realized is I'd be doing the same thing
for any kind of clone or project that I
was doing whether I was making like a
Twitter clone or a Spotify clone or
pretty much you know any type of project
I would need user authentication so what
I want to do before doing some more
project series is to build basically a
core or boilerplate that is a graphical
server that handles basically all that
stuff and it's just the overlap between
all projects that will include
authentications hanging up users and all
that fun stuff and right now I'm really
enjoying typescript so I'm gonna be
building this with typescript so I'm
gonna be starting a new series where
we're basically gonna build out the core
that I'll be used for every single
series in the future and so this is a
boilerplate and it's gonna be using
craft QL and typescript and here are the
things I want to add to it right now and
please if I'm missing anything that you
think they'd be very good or that are
used across multiple different projects
I'll leave a comment below and I'll
definitely consider it so the first
thing is I want to cover signing up
users or registering users and the way I
like to do this is with sending a
confirmation email and then they won't
be able to log in until they confirm
their email and it's really good to just
make sure they're not they actually own
this email so that's the first thing
we're going to be doing and then setting
up allowing users to log in and through
a username and password and then a
forgot password so if they forget their
password they can click that link and
what will happen is it'll send them an
email and they
and then change their password and then
logging out and this will be logging out
for this is with for example if we have
both a react native in a react client or
a phone in a web client you can lock
them out
across all the different clients and
then also like I said I want this to be
able to work with both a mobile client
and a web client so there are no cookies
available on a episo-- will be handling
authentication or sending of tokens
through HTTP header with the mobile
client and then for web sites we're
gonna be using cookies and then I'm
gonna be setting up some authentication
middleware with graph QL this will be
able to basically we can reuse and
handle oh I only want people with this
certain attribute to be able to access
this or whatnot that sort of thing the
next thing is rate limiting so setting
up you don't want user to just be able
to create a bunch of requests and then
also there's specific routes you don't
want people to spam for for example
logging in you want people trying to log
in a bunch or to forget password a bunch
and in that case what goes hand in hand
is blocking accounts so maybe we have a
user called Bob at Bob calm and someone
is trying to log in with that account a
hundred times we'll just lock the
account for like 30 minutes or whatnot
and people can't access it and lastly
this is just back-end code so usually I
build a front-end as well but in this
case this boilerplate is only gonna be a
back-end so what I want to do is set up
tests to be able to make sure all this
stuff works and so that's how we're
gonna validate that the code that we're
writing actually works is through tests
and I'm probably gonna be using just for
this and that's the plan so far so I'm
gonna start this tomorrow and then just
code along with you guys and build this
out do just a video every day and then
just incrementally add on and create
this so again let me know in the
comments below if you feel like I'm
missing any
that would be nice for a core thing that
will be used for every single clone or
project I'll be doing in the future so
that's it for this video guys here's the
github page that I'll be coding it on
I'll link in the description below but
you can follow or star this if you want
to follow along that's it for this video
guys I'll see you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
