cursor pagination now I have my graph QL
server up right here you have the schema
and here is my query using offset and
limit pagination now we're going to be
doing cursor pagination in this video
and this is what I recommend doing if
you want to put do pagination and it
scales much better we have a lot of data
so instead of doing an offset we're
basically going to keep track of our
position of one column and that's what
the cursor is going to be so I'm going
to create a some suggestions to it's
going to take a limit just like above
but our second one is going to be a
cursor now this cursor you want to make
it the type of the data column that you
want to basically keep as your position
so a cursor is basically your position
in a list so I'm going to keep the
position by ID so I'm going to use an
end here but you may want to do
something else and I'll show you another
example at the end of this video of how
cursor could be a string or something
else alright so we have some solutions
to we have our limit in our cursor and
now let's create the resolver for this
so save that pop and resolvers so where
is subduction zones - there we go
now some suggestions here some
suggestions - so here also good to note
in our schema cursor can be null and
that's okay so we're going to have a
little bit more logic in our resolver so
I'm going to just make this a curly
brace function and what we're going to
do is this this this is basically the
simple hydrogen but we need to take care
of the null case so we're going to do
models dot suggestion dot final um we're
going to do limit by
and let's grab the limit and the off not
offset cursor from our arguments and
limit here is going to be the limit um
and we're going to have a where clause
and our where clause here is we're going
to say the ID of suggestions is greater
than any extra our cursor alright put
some commas here because semicolon I'll
see why we're getting errors there yeah
okay so our some suggestion is to here
this is basically how it's going to work
we're am do a limit same as we did above
so we're only giving part of what we're
you want it's slowly and commenting that
and then our where this is the important
one right what we're saying is we're
basically and we also want to order the
list by ID now we were getting an
ordered list of all the suggestions and
we're saying we want to get the ID where
the ID is greater than cursor so we're
going to do is after we get our first
results we're going to look at the end
of the results and pass that ID this
function um now our cursor I guess so to
handle an old case we basically want to
set this to 0 so we could say is cursor
or 0 actually we should say negative 1
because I think an ID not sure if an ID
can be 0 or not but it's safer to put
negative 1 here actually we would also
occur I was going to do curly brace
function we don't even need that this is
simple enough but this will make more
sense when we run this over here so
we're going to make a query here I'm
going to say some suggestions too
well it doesn't have it we need to
restart looks like we might have an air
and our server nope I just forgot to
start it up okay we're going to refresh
and go to graphical to try this guy out
and we're going to go to some
suggestions to now limit I'm going to
say first before we even do this let's
show you guys all the suggestions so
notice what the IDS are 1 to 62 so our
basic logic is let's say we only want to
get we're limiting to 10 our first time
we're going to grab these suggestions
then in our second query we're going to
pass a cursor of 10 and it's going to
say grab all the ones with IDs greater
than 10 then we're going to grab these
10 then we're say hey we got the last
one is 20 we want to grab the next 10 so
we pass it as our cursor 20 so that's
the basic logic we're going to use so
let's show that in action real quick so
some suggestion to our limit is going to
be 10 and our curt we're not going to
have a cursor for the first order must
be type of a rare instance of the valid
Google eyes method oh it look like it's
like the way we did order you might have
to do it like this
ascending
let's see if it likes that better does
not exist suggestion dot sanding okay
let's go to sequel eyes query and see
the correct way to order things I
thought it was just setting the order
like that but I guess it's different
see those ledges did I guess you have to
pass him in array that's fine all right
all right and we're just ordering by ID
see if it likes that better and it does
cool so we have the first ten here now
we get text and now in our cursor so
let's we'll show you guys with the text
too so you get a b c d e f g h holoholo
and now if i set the cursor now in our
code what we're going to do for a list
is we're going to fire what the last
element is and then pass that are there
cursors now i want ten so this should
give me the next 10 hello and i can do
20 maybe the next 20 and then so on i
can make this 30 and just go through the
list like that and that's how you pad
you know go through it so now i want to
show you guys how you would add this in
react native so our server is good to go
here here's the code for react native
our previous one we were using limit and
offset so now instead of offset we're
going to have a cursor cursor is going
to start at zero and in our index here
we're going to set a limit of 15 that
seems like a good size but we're not
going to pass in a cursor and then the
only thing that's going to change here
is so we're not having an offset we're
going to have a cursor and what the
cursor is going to equal is when we
handle end we want to look at what's the
very last element and d-list is so this
drops dot data dot some suggestions too
you and then grab the last item and then
dot ID now to get the last item in the
list Python you can put negative one I
wish you could and JavaScript I don't
you can so what I'm going to do is say
Const some suggestions to is equal to
this table data and then we'll do some
suggestions to link finances link minus
one that'll give us the last element in
the list and now we also need to change
our get suggestions query here so now
it's going to get suggestions too and
here we're only going to Hat we're going
to have a cursor in a limit and recall
some suggestions too and this is going
to be used it's going to be cursor so
just change their query to now be some
solutions to and now we're using cursor
instead of an offset path the tour app I
already converted this guy right here to
using some suggestions too so we're
changing the cursor it's the last ID in
the list and then this will be some
suggestions to here for getting the data
nothing should change here and one thing
I have forgotten the previous videos we
actually need to await this fetch more
that's important well I mean it's not
that important but our load will look a
little funky the functionality work from
before though and then we'll set the
cursor to this state cursor and then our
update query is going to be the exact
same and yeah we're done actually so the
things may need to be changed we're
we're now using cursor instead of offset
the way we update our cursor is by
getting the last ohm in the list and
giving its ID so we know what the next
one look at is and now we're just doing
the same thing so let's see if we may
years can come over here refresh rate up
from requires an array like object not
know Lauren defined a rate up from I
have no idea what that is I'm going to
go ahead and close not close I'm going
to minimize will put this guy over here
this is the code for the server we're
done with that printer now and let's do
some debugging of what's going wrong so
let's talk such I think the fetch more
is not even getting called yet this is
on initial fetch I think get suggestions
to might not be working this query might
be broken because notice how it doesn't
even load Oh straight up undefined okay
that's weird
let's refresh again okay sometimes it
crashes sometimes it doesn't I think I
think what's happening is handle end is
being called did we're getting to the
end of the list before this is done
loading so what I'm going to do is say
handle list we're going to say some
suggestions and loading and then we're
only going to set the state if we're not
loading
that way we don't just like crap out at
the beginning like this we notice if it
loaded fast enough it works okay we're
still getting this weird error but if i
refresh sometimes it works now let's
just scroll through this same thing I
wonder what it is cause I think maybe
this is giving us there some suggest
maybe our update query is I don't think
anything else would well okay
even tells us right here that our update
query is what's causing it line 25 so oh
there should be some suggestions - my
bad so those that should be changed now
let's see if we have that problem and
this needs to be some suggestions - we
just need to match up the name with the
field all right so now we can scroll a
lot enlist and coward - children it's
the same key drilling Keys must be okay
so we somehow so okay we're getting this
warning encountered to children with the
same key 16 we're using the ID for the
key that means we're something broken
because we should never load the same
item but we are so - what we're going to
do to watch and make sure I think this
not loading thing this is good what I
think I'll do is we basically want to
see every time we're fetching more I
guess I'm going to do a console dot log
I do this dot state dot cursor console
dot log fetching
and I'm just going to open up a console
right here so it's easy to see and go
into our react native application now
I'm going to do react native blog iowa's
so now we can see how many calls we're
making to graph QL server sorry you
haven't touched more yet we're hitting
the bottom of the list we're fetching
more let's scroll up scroll scroll up
before all of these airs pop up okay
let's see what's going on okay before
before okay
log message quota exceeded some messages
have been discarded looks like there is
so many fetching okay so look we're
fetching 15 fetching 15 I think what's
happening is we're getting to the end of
the list too fast for life this function
is being called twice I think handle in
this game call twice so what's happening
is we are fetching data on the same
cursor so we're doing 15 then we're
doing 15 but this not loading thing
should help unless bloating is always
false it might be is bloating I'm going
to console dot log this stock drops to
and to help with the the log instead of
doing the ID I'm going to do the index
that way we shouldn't get an error we
can just see what the fetches for your
column are all right let's cool down to
the bottom here we can make this smaller
since we should be so much data okay so
what here is our first one so
loading is true and we tried to fetch
more so not loading is good this is
correct so now I'm going to scroll down
to the bottom and we didn't even cost
log anything there we go okay I don't
want to fit I don't wanna okay so I'm
going to get rid of the console logs
we've got rid of the console log there
now I'm only going to see when we fetch
data okay so now I'm scrolling down 15
fetching 15 okay this is their problem
13 15 15 15
we just fetched basically twice I don't
know why we're doing that we hit the
bottom of the list and then we're
calling the handle and twice what we can
do is in our state say fetching data for
and specify the ID actually no we
already know what it is the cursor so
we're going to we're going to check
right here we're going to say if this
dot state cursor is equal to some
suggestions some suggestions link - 1 -
ID and we want to check is not loading
and is not equal okay so those are the
two conditions I want for what I'm
fetching now the second condition I'm
checking if the cursor is not equal to
the end of the list so you know it's
what I didn't want with the fetch 15
like
15 so 15 is what the cursor locations at
so when I fetched 15 I set the cursor to
15 and then when I'm fetching here we
would have seen hey we're still at 15
don't do it again so we're saying it's
not equal to so now let's refresh and
see if we get the same problem so they
come back to bottom we get fetching 30
now see if we get such an 45 we don't
get touching 45 we're getting fetching
60 I think it just did not printed but I
think this is working now yeah looks
like we got we don't see any fetching
duplicates and to make sure for sure
what we can do is use the ID here and
now we're going to refresh let me go
ahead and restart the log so we don't
have any errors or any messages missing
all right so scrolling to the bottom we
get such a 30 touching 45 and should be
fetching 60
all right so that is be fetching that's
our cursor so that is how you do
precursors right there we had a little
problem as you guys saw with duplicate
fetching but that's kind of something
wrong with our client side code but how
we implement cursors in the back end was
good to go I highly recommend doing it
like this where you're using the ID or
some other column and using the last
thing you fetched now I want to do one
last example and that is with basically
a search so sometimes your cursors not
going to be an int so search suggestions
so here I'm going to set to a limit I'm
also going to have a query right for
searching so I'm gonna have a strength
and that's mandatory and now our cursor
is going to be a string - and what the
cursor is going to be is I'm actually
going to order it by the text I actually
could order it by ID still and that
would work now I think of it but if you
wanted to order it by something else
besides the ID you could but it's good
to note that you want to order it by the
something you have an index for in your
database which the ID does any what so
I'm going to show you how you can do
search suggestions with the cursor being
the index still alright so this is going
to be a query we have the cursor here
we've got a resolver so some suggestions
now we're going to do search so search
suggestions I think was a gift finesse
at the end so here we're going to have a
query to limit and a cursor so we're
going to actually keep the exact same
thing here we're actually just going to
add where text I think it's what
contains well let's go where you have
this equalizer query documentation up
right here the basics here are all the
operations we can do we want to do I
like which is case insensitive come back
over here
I like query and what we'll do is well
actually put percent signs around this
that way we can find stuff all right
and that's it it's already pagination
and everything it's setup good yeah I'll
show I can show you guys the how I do it
I would add this in react native to we
can do that real quick what I think I'm
going to do is create a branch so where
I have ou have this up we don't need
this anymore come back over here alright
so I'm going to create a branch git
branch for this video so 5 cursor
pagination and I'm going to check out
this branch to create it and I'll do git
status I'm going to go ahead and commit
everything git commit and we'll say add
cursor based pagination okay now I'm
going to get check out we'll do another
branch real quick we'll do five
underscore part two we'll call us five
point one why not five point one instead
and here we're going to do search
pagination all right so now in this
branch we can go ahead and change our
react native code because I want to keep
this is a good code for dollar one so
now let's do this with search so this is
going to be search suggestion
and this will be suggestions let's leave
that grab that this is the name of our
query limit cursor is going to say the
same cursor like that we're not one more
variable which is going to be the query
and to be a string so query is just
going to be query and this will be a
dollar sign here and get the ID and this
will be some suggestions we want search
the best all right sister suggestions we
got our this is going to be a graph QL
query for it our index here we'll go
ahead and pass a limit and a query the
query I'm going to get all the
suggestions that have an e in them and
then come back up here so every place
you see the word some suggestions to we
can pretty much replace it with search
suggestions actually I think we're just
done because actually we didn't really
change the query up too much right it's
actually the exact same code the only
thing we're changing is we're passing an
initial query which is in our index
which we pass in but if you wanted to
with fetch more you could change what
the query variable is but I think we're
actually good let's just refresh and see
what happens a quick search in replace
might be all we need
nope I do have this server up and
running right yes I do those search
suggestions that's good let's see what
the areas again unhandled and react
Apollo I was feeling our actual graph QL
might be wrong
I'll check that out I'm gonna go ahead
and close this window
we're done making server changes so dog
so many windows open so I'm going to go
ahead and put this in to graphical and
see if we get any errors oops I did not
copy this to my clipboard and prettify
looks good
um it looks like some suggestions was
not changed everywhere so and the reason
for that is I forgot to put the G so I'm
using a VIN plugin that lets me change
in these that lets me do VIN commands
and I was doing of them search in place
when I search her in a place they did
not do it well but if you want to filter
in place here you can as well but I just
searched and replace search suggestions
I put that in for some suggestions too
now we can refresh still no same Eric
yeah same here
alright I mean let's make sure I don't
have any sons suggestions
nope got search suggestions this looks
like something I might have messed up
here oh yeah first off we should not be
doing it like that she just passed it
like that but I don't think that was
what the problem was it's almost like if
we're almost having a problem with this
server it could be an unhandled bundle
thing I don't know what that is
Green undefined on the server I think
maybe if we come over here
and do a react native log iOS than
possibly it'll tell us what's in more
detail what the heck is going on because
like this air is not very helpful
running I don't see anything here that
would be informative nothing is good
look how a log visitor change we get
initializing that's it
Ukrop's log quote exceeded some messages
may have been discarded all right reopen
this hopefully now this one won't get
discarded loading item bundle actually
have no idea what happened basically
just changed it to using some sort of
search suggestions query and now
everything's broken I have a feeling
it's like some small syntax error we're
using cursor still query we're not using
our cursor should be updating in the
same way quick yeah
nothing I'm just doing a quick scan of
the code and there's nothing here that
way I think I would break something or
there's one so the only thing I know I
usually do when this happens I'll go
ahead and trim some stuff out so this is
not very helpful
we'll just minimize you all right cover
the flat list the flat list is not
causing it meaning it has to be this
query for whatever reason this query is
not is what is causing a problem you
guys might see it before I do what I'm
doing wrong it might be able to easily
fix this but I actually have no idea
what's going on here's just like a quick
line by line what's different
yeah like I just have the graph QL
messed up all right I can't show you
guys this then I think I'm just going to
call quits here I'm not sure what the
exact problem is I think I have this
query mess up search suggestions is
messed up in some fashion I don't think
it's because I'm doing the same name
here in here I'm going to query like -
good when I pack pasted it here right
like if I actually know what I never
tried doing it here let's just run it
real quick here and make sure it does
work do a query e fold I'm at 10 we
don't need a cursor for the first one
well there you go that's a problem field
search suggestions argument cursor of
type in is required but not provided all
right let's go to our schema real quick
I actually closed that so code that we
were done with the server so that was
just me being dumb forgot to get rid of
that
even though I didn't put it here I added
it there start server backup
and now everything will work funny how
we didn't get a good air from react
needed though it just gave us that super
cryptic thing the thing I tried this all
right now that's working and I guarantee
you react native words now damn
notice how we filtered everything and
now just has ease in it ok some
suggestions clear to that but notice how
we are filtering it just by the e ones
now so some suggestions ok I still have
it in two places somehow search
suggestions search suggestions reload
and now we see e hello and we should see
by at the end cool alright that's how
you would do it with a search and that's
it guys thanks for watching I hope that
helped and how to do cursors I apologize
for how much error debugging there was
ends up being in this just me being
silly sorry but yeah thanks for watching
I'll see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
