showing you how to use a RPN calculator
as a reverse polish notation calculator
that's an RP n stands for right here is
the RPM calculator this nice big one
right here is just regular calculator
and we're gonna go through some of
differences why it's even worth using
one of these I'll start off the reason
why it's worth using one of these are
calculators is because they're very
handy for longer equations and harder
equations with lots of parentheses they
work through problems very easily and
it's very natural once you get used to
it and with a normal calculator you may
not even be able to do the type problems
you can with these and we'll get to that
more later so let's first start with the
sample problem how do you do 5 plus 6
the seems pretty trivial but if you look
over here there's no equal sign yeah how
do you do that so huh normal calculator
you do 5 plus 6 equal 11 so how we did
that if you did entered our first number
then we entered in operation plus sign
in this case in the second number and
then we said do that operation now on
our pink calculator it were similarly
except you know the two numbers first in
the internal onto what's called a stack
and then you do though you do an
operation on two stacks so I'm gonna be
how to work you push 5 that enters it to
this first stack now I want to move this
to the second stack and put six of the
first stack so I can add them together
so I click this Enter key
now five is now in the second stack you
can think of it almost like a Rochelle's
this goes up a row and I click six six
is below five and if I add them together
that's like saying five plus six and we
get 11 that's how that works
now let's get to more some more complex
problems so
let's say we want to do five plus 15
plus 10 we'd first put five first number
on the shelf and push enter and then
push 15 and then we can add these
together by pushing + and now we get 20
and now we want to add 10 now 20 to move
up the shelf you may think we push enter
again so we can put 10 but because we
just did an operation this is already
entered for us so we're just going like
10 and 20 moves off the shelf and we're
just gonna push + and adds that together
now there's an that's one way to do that
with an are pink out there in other ways
you can push 5 enter move this up a
shelf let me push 15 enter this move
this up another shelf then we push 10
right now there's think of it as 3
shelves 5 15 10 and for the first one 15
and 10 we're gonna add them together we
get 25 then we're gonna add 25 and 5
together push your 5 again and we get 30
so if that's starting to make more sense
there like a stack and you do operations
on them so next problem we're gonna do
is 8 times 5 divided by 6 so we're gonna
hit int we're gonna type in 18 I'm gonna
enter that then when I push 5 and we
want to multiply these together this
time for go ahead multiply now we want
to divide by 6 so we don't need to hit
enter because it's already added to the
shelf where you push 6 and then we
divide and we get 15 as their answer so
that works really nicely so let's do
another one
say 12 enter we're gonna add 19 to this
so we say 19 and then we're gonna add
now this is where it gets really
interesting we're gonna do 44 minus 7
and I'm going to divide that by 31 31
divided by what 44 minus 7 equals so
what we do first is we first do 44 minus
7 then we're hit divided key what we're
gonna do is kind of float this on top
and so you'll see what I mean by that
we'll hit 44
we're going to enter this key so right
now the thirty number is on the very top
now 44 and now seven and I'm gonna
subtract seven from 44 by hitting - and
now I joined - by those numbers and we
get this nice decimal now let's get to
that's pretty much how an RPN calculus
so let's get to a harder problem so get
to an exponent so how do I do this is
you will add the numbers together so
this is the first number enter I'm gonna
add up to 157 and then we'll just hit
this pretty easy and that squares it so
this problem is purposely hard and
difficult and I challenge you to use a
regular calculator to try to do this
problem and see if you can come up with
the answer and this is a particular
equation where an RPN calculator shines
because as you can see there's all these
parentheses it's really gross well with
an RPN calculator there are no
parentheses and it's really easy to do
this type of problem well not really
easy but easier so let's go ahead and do
this problem so let's say start over
here we're gonna say 19 enter we're
gonna put to the fourth power so 4 and
then we get this number
I'm gonna add 6 so 6 add it to that and
then we want to subtract this number by
with this equals right here so we're
gonna start with 12 wants to pact that
by 3 to the sixth power so I'm gonna
take 3 enter 6 to that power so we just
took 3 to 6 power then we subtract from
12 get that they're gonna multiply this
times 9 9 times they're gonna subtract
from the number that we got right here
say subtract and we get this number
right here now we want to square it and
we get this huge number right here now
we want to divide by this number so
we're just gonna float this number do
this operation and then
so we're going to say to enter nine add
those together then we want to put this
to the fifth power negative five power
so we type in five and to make a number
negative on this calculator you just
click on the number and then you put to
the power and now we're just gonna
divide and we get this huge number and
that's the answer so that's how rpm
calculators work they take a little bit
to get used to the stack can be kind of
confusing but just go ahead try some
practice problems on your own and you'll
get used to it now the calculator I use
T is called stack calculator I made it
and it's on the Amazon App Store in the
Android App Store or the Google Play
Store this is only for Android phones
alright guys I don't know how to put on
my phone store yet so if you guys want
to see this I'll link this and the show
notes below so you can download it and I
just want to say thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
