the cash images and react native this is
something you might want to consider
doing for a couple of reasons the first
is if your users offline it would be
nice if they were able to still see the
images in your app and they can if you
cache them and secondly it loads faster
you don't have to make a request and
download the image every time the user
opens the app they can just store it
locally and it'll be quicker for them
for the image to pop up so to do this
I'm going to show you how we can create
a component that automatically caches
images for us now I'm using create react
native app and right here I have just
the basic boilerplate nothing changed
except I have an image here so this is
what it looks like if you want to
display images and react native so I
just gave it a style 200 height 200
width so it shows up over here and then
I just set my source and I set the URI
to just this cat image so let's create a
new component here that will
automatically cache this URL so we're
gonna create a new file called cache
image j/s and this is going to be a
react component and this is going to be
a react class so cache image extends
react component
all right so we're gonna have a render
function in a render function we are
just going to use the image from react
native and Britt in a store in our state
what the URL is or the source so by
default the source is going to be null
and so we can return here an image and
really all I need to pass to this image
is the your URI and maybe some style or
there's some other attributes but we're
worried about those later
so maybe style is coming from the prop
so this da props that's style and then
here we have the source which I'm gonna
get from the state ok so I have a really
basic cash component here where we are
getting a a source from the state and
then we're gonna update the state once
we've cached the image so the idea with
caching images is we download the image
and store it on the device so we're
gonna create in our component did mount
you're going to create a function here
where we check if we've already cached
the image before and if we have we just
go ahead and read it from the device
otherwise we download the image to the
device right because we need to cache it
if it's the first time so really the
only way to know whether we've cache the
device or not is to are you the rel is
to keep track of the URL that the user
passes in so we're gonna pass in a URI
to this so I'll miss a Const URI and
this is coming from the stuff props now
there might be all kinds of things in
this URI that are not safe to save your
file in so what I want to do is actually
hash this into just a safe string
so I'm gonna say Const name and I went
ahead and already installed a library
and packaged that JSON I have one called
a short hash so I'm gonna import it from
short hash so what this does is I do
short hashed unique this will create a
unique string given a URI so given the
same string it'll generate the same
unique string and the nice thing about
this is now we don't have to worry about
whatever garbage is in the URL we now
have a safe string name so the name will
now only contain like characters like
this I don't know if it also has numbers
but for example we won't have like a CP
and have slashes at the front of our
file name right because we want to check
whether this file we've already saved
this file before so that's how I'm gonna
do it so now I have a nice safe name now
I want to check if this file is already
on the device so we are using Expo
that's what create react native app uses
so they have this file system and this
library or this this component our
object I suppose we can use there's this
thing called get info async and one of
the options is to see whether a your eye
exists or the name of the file exists so
let's go ahead and import that oops so
import file system from Expo now the
other nice thing about Expo so we're
gonna just create a path right here to
our file so we don't want to just
specify and I'm the string template here
so we don't want to just specify our
name we also want to store this in the
correct directory so if we do file
system one of the things we can get is
the cache directory
and the cache directory already has a
slash at the end so that's why I don't
have cache directory slash the name of
the file but this is a directory that
x-bow array has set up that is for
caching files exactly what we're doing
here so we want to store it here and so
this is the path to the file if the file
were takes us right to the cache
directory and then the name of the file
so now we're gonna just check if it
exists so this is gonna be your image on
it's asynchronous so we're gonna wait it
filesystem dot get info async and then
here we just pass in what the path is so
now we're going to check if the image
exists so if it exists one of the
attributes given back to us is just the
exact your I and this is pointing on the
device itself so we can just now this
dot set state have source is gonna be
image dot your I otherwise and we can
return so right so here's the case where
we've already cached the image so we get
the info we check if it exists we know
it exists then we just set the state
given the the URL let's re on the disk
alright so now here's the case
underneath here is gonna happen is if
we've never cashed the file before this
is the first time we're seeing it in
that case we need to download it and
file system has a very nice function
also to help us with this it's called I
believe here it is download async so
file system download async we specify
the thing we want to download and then
the name that we want to download it -
so I'm gonna say Const new image is
equal to a weight file system dot a sink
and a load
and then I'm gonna specify the your I
given and then the path is where we want
it to save to and then after that we now
have the file on our computer or on our
computer but on our device so then we
can just say this dot sets state and
we're just gonna set the source so new
image dot your I and we set that equal
and we're good to go so now I can just
do a console log here and I can say
console dot log read image from cache or
we can put a console log here
downloading image to cache so now we can
see when these things are happening so
let's go ahead and use our cache image
now because it's good to do we're gonna
pass in a your eye to it and let's just
real quick recap what's happening so
we're gonna pass in as a prop the
location of the file on the internet
we're going to hash it so it has a nice
and here I'll just console.log what the
name is so you guys can see that too
this is just a nice little easy short
string I like short hash makes it short
which I like as well so here we're just
specifying the path to the file if it
exists and we're checking whether it
exists by calling this get info async
and now we have check if it exists if it
does we read it from cache otherwise we
have to go download it and we're gonna
download it and this is where we're
gonna download it to and this is where
to download it from and then here we
just update our state because it's now
in it we know alright so here actually
we need to first use it over here so
instead of source we just pass in
your eye and just like that and so this
is gonna be cash image so import to cash
image from the cash image all right and
I don't know I don't see any console
logs I think I just need to refresh it
over here feel to build let's reload
okay so we're just completely failing
and I don't know if it's cuz I just have
like a syntax error somewhere and it's
not telling me I'm just gonna try
restarting my expo be right back
okay so it wasn't a problem with Expo
I just forgot to make this function
asynchronous and I was using a wait so I
added eslint also so I could see the
little red stuff when I was making
errors yeah so let's go ahead and see
this so you guys just saw the cat up
here so here is that that is the name of
the hash that we created so that's what
this thing is right here so you notice
it's a nice little short string that
we're using for the file name so here it
says downloading image to cache so now
if i refresh this we should read the
image from the cache itself now you'll
notice we get the same name here that's
because it's hashing it so given the
same URI we're getting it the same hash
which is exactly what we want so cool so
this is how I would do caching with
images let's go ahead and just reformat
this I think I was just missing some
commas and stuff oh it doesn't like
katas ID on with the JSX
extension I didn't change that in my es
lint but anyway the other way I've seen
image caching done is with
there is a prefetch option for images
but that doesn't always work and it
seems to be really finicky and I slipped
up some things on Stack Overflow and
they said it doesn't even work at all on
iOS and this seems to be a much more
solid method is to just go ahead and
install the images yourself and not
worry about prefetching the image with
the image component so this is what I
like a lot let me know what you guys
think of this I think what I'm going to
do is actually I could see myself using
this in a couple different projects
because it's very easy to just pop in
right because I now just use this
instead of regular image and I pass in
the Euro I like that so I think I'm
gonna make this in just to a separate
NPM package now before I do that I need
to clean it up a little bit because I
think since I did this in component did
mount if I were to change with this your
eye is I don't think it would update
right because we only the component only
mounts once so I want to clean that up
and also try coding this up in
typescript and then put this on the npm
make this into an MP in package which
i'm gonna have to figure out cuz i've
never published an NPM package so that
is what the future is gonna hold for us
that's what I'm gonna do the next few
days is get this working so that's it
for this video guys hope that was
helpful thanks for watching
