pretty much done with our app here the
only thing that we haven't implemented
yet was being able to like go to a
single bid but we're kind of displaying
all the information here so I don't
really see a reason to give it to a
different bid
I guess right now we're only supporting
one type of bidding you only bid by five
dollars but I think that's fine
I don't think I doing more comprehend
that might be a good thing if you're
interested in practicing to do that but
I think what I want to do is right now
we can only get to this page is some
navigation so I can switch between this
the login and the sign up so the way I'm
going to do that is I'm going to add a
tab bar at the bottom here a layout so
you can click on little buttons and I'll
take you there so that's what we're
going to work on this video so right now
we have this root component and that's
where the root scene and we're actually
understanding create a component here
and this is going to be tab bar tab bar
layout we'll call it this is going to be
a component we can create and I'm going
to put it in components because it
doesn't need to touch the store or redux
so those are going to be a component
we're going to create it's going to be
part of the root scene which means it's
going to render on all these scenes and
that's exactly what I wanted to do so at
the bottom you can basically from any
page go to any other page and that's
kind of what we want all right so let's
create this so components new file and
we'll call it tab bar layout so import
right from react and export default
now because we have like stuff inside
notice how there's all these scenes
inside they actually pass it to my tab
bar component we have to handle it
so it passes those as children we have
to actually do stuff with it so we're
going to handle those so just to show
you how that works we're going to do a
simple layout or we just basically share
the same text on every page so natives
base so I'm going to make content just a
wrapper for everything and for whatever
reason notice how the tab right here is
four spaces whereas it all now look
there's two here I love this one they're
all two for a reason this is four spaces
one what to that using change view okay
that was easier than I thought it was to
change alright so now we're good alright
tab that over okay so now to display
these children what we have to do is do
children dot map and then here what we
have to do is it's passing us and let me
do everything on that line passing us a
scene and from that scene what we need
to do is create a element passing in the
scene dot component and then below here
we can just do text hello and show that
that work now suit the promise here
trailing space okay
now we can refresh this and we should
see how elect bottom here okay notice
how we have this little warning a
warning says each child in the array or
iterator should have a unique key so
we're mapping through these but we
didn't give these guys a key so it's not
happy so we're going to add that and I
also don't even say hello
oh text hello I wonder if it's just
because it didn't like how we did the
mapping it could be so or maybe it just
needs to be called container instead of
continent very fresh there we go
now with container we get the hello here
so used to get the hull here but we're
getting this warning so let's we're
going to fix next to get rid of that
warning they actually need to add a prop
to this and the way down a prompt to a
component that's already like created
here to do react clone element and we
pass in as the first argument on the
element and the second is the prop that
we want to add we want to add a key and
then the key we want to add is scene dot
name because that'll be unique and the
trailing space oh we're going to expect
the element unexpected token unexpected
oh there should just be another pair now
the line is too long so we'll drop that
to the next line type it over have it
one more time awesome now refresh all
right so now we see it and we see
there's a little tab at the bottom here
or a little text so now we want to
replace that with a tap bar so we're
going to be using the tabs from native
base and it's going to look like this
at the toss here we're just going to do
them at the bottom because we really
have a bunch of stuff at the top so
we're going to import tab and tabs and
we can copy and paste this to the bottom
here of our container so icon tabs and
tab the components we're going to be
using and let's just make sure
everything is spaced over good bring it
over bring this end one more and then
the header up look like need a tab
heading and tab one tab to tab three are
those just where do they go and like
went to a different page just refresh up
now found native base component all
right area and just scroll down the tab
little click there side bars broken just
get it there this way this will be
faster oh footer tabs that's what we
wanted to do oh just kidding huh let's
just use footer tabs instead of tab I
was thinking this is only the library
good thing we found that so footer
footer tab only thing we need
so flutter flutter tab and we can copy
that
okay yeah this is exactly where I want
weird though it's rendering the icons
but doesn't look like it should yeah
okay this is what we want
icon footer will treat let's just
refresh and see how it looks
oh and I didn't save it save can't find
button here we are and we can get rid of
text we don't need that anymore
alright that looks nice actually notice
how when you click on the icon it gives
it a little bit of a save because it
wrapped in two button I kind of do that
for this too so look nice alright so
let's fix of spacing tag these over some
more and that looks good tab this over
some more tab this over some more and
then tap those okay so we have three
pages we have a have a home and a login
and a sign up I couldn't find really any
good icons from the ionic for them but
the ones I'm going to use here and free
feel free to switch your icons so once
you like better because I really can't
find any good ones is the list here
which I'll be using basically to
represent the list of auctions
I did find a login so log in is good
that's this one right here that one
looks pretty nice but there's no sign
out as you can see so hook which can use
a clipboard clipboard alright refresh we
can see our icons so this is VR page 4
this and open plate Li small kind of I
increase the size of them a little bit
and go to icon I think there is a size
oh you know we do style font size I
remember this one in particular looks
small so style font size 28 see if it's
shrink air it goes a little bit aw that
looks much better that looks like the
size of these now it looked like it was
really small before
okay let's copy that we can use it for
all of these and do Const font size is
equal to 30 and then we can just use
that for all of them use same size and I
think I want a little bigger than 3
let's try 40 oops
alright those are way too jumbo let's
try 32 alright action icon when I said
look look slightly big what you can see
them really well easy to click on ok so
the active one should be the active page
that you're on which we should be able
to get actually from react native clocks
or whatever it's called should tell us
what page active pages on and then the
only other thing is to set up actual
links for this so for the links part
that's easy so import actions from react
native router flux and then we can just
link up each one so on press
you will go to actions dot and then this
will be view options okay can do the
same thing I just copy too much yeah
we'll just type that one more time on
press actions dot login I think I called
it these might be wrong because I have
not done this in a while and then this
button on press actions dot sign up
alright so we linked our pages so when
you click on them should take you to the
different pages so click on this up we
see sign up but it also look how it
popped up over here I can go like that
and hit renders well that's kind of
funny how that worked to children was
the same key must be unique okay that's
really weird look how they mashes all
this together I wonder if they're
expecting us to like filter these
ourselves now oh this is a real mess so
react router look I have a mini tutorial
here where's Ariel we just want to get
what the current page is
I'm hoping there's like a global global
variable or something it tells you what
page you're on go back to the talks and
see
new features all right none of these are
what we want I guess technically we can
keep track of the pager so that's not a
great way to do it all right
so I think I want to I'm going to do
some investigation and figure out how to
get the global state of the ear lepage
wrong so we have this nice-looking guy
down here our tab bar will actually link
it up properly so this doesn't happen in
the next video so see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
