that we run when we first load this page
so we fetch all of our teams and then
all the channels along with those teams
and also the users and these channels
down here so we're doing quite a bit of
fetching and I want to go and take a
look at what the sequel statements that
we're actually running so we can take a
look at how we can improve this using
caching and batching so first let's take
a look at what's going on so we're
running this query teams to get all the
teams and so this is one query right
here and then our team to fetch each
Channel we're running this query here
and then the fetch direct message
members we're gonna fetch these now I'm
gonna be going over this channel fetch
right here but you can use this on all
of the children and fetches so direct
message members as well so let's see how
many sequel statements are actually
executed when we refresh that so here I
have the log right now for our server
and I have sequel I've logging turned on
it's turned on by default so if i
refresh this I can see what queries that
run over here so these are all the
statements that were run and if I search
for this one from channels I can see
where this was run and we notice it was
run four times and that's because we
have four teams so it's for each team
what it's doing is it's fetched it's
calling that query for the channels to
grab the channels you'll notice right
here the team I d1 team ID two three and
four so as we get more and more teams
the number of these queries is just
going to grow grow grow grow so if we
have 10 teams we're doing 10 queries on
channels which is not great so what we
can do to improve this is to use one of
two libraries
one is called joy monster this is
something that only works with sequel
databases and what it does is you send
in the graph QL and it'll actually
generate the sequel that needs to be run
and what it'll do is instead of
splitting up these guys into separate
queries it'll do one big query and join
them all together now we're doing some
more sophisticated sorting and we're
doing the left outer join here so I'm
not going to be using joint monster for
this for this project because we don't
really want to join it on to one big
query we want to separate it out into
smaller queries but I don't want ten
queries I want to turn this into one
query so one query to get the channel
and so what we're gonna use for that is
data loader so data loader is a lovely
library by Facebook and it's you can use
this it's don't need sequel it's very
generic you can use this for pretty much
any database you want and back-end set
up so this is what we're gonna be using
and I'll show you how we're gonna turn
these four queries into only one query
no matter how many teams we have alright
so let's get into that so first things
first I'm going to install data loader
so yarn add data loader and then I'm
gonna restart the server when that's
done and how data loader works is I'm
just gonna come over here to index and
import it there's two parts to it so
data loader data loader the first part
is loading in all the IDS basically what
we're going to do is we're gonna create
a data loader here so we're gonna call
this channel loader
and we're gonna load each one of these
channels so we have we want to get
channels 14 one two three and four so
here we're gonna load the team IDs and
then we're gonna run one query that
fetches the channels fourteen one two
three and four all together so we're
gonna create a new data loader here and
it's important that you create a new
data loader per request so that's why
we're putting in the context right here
because what it does is it caches so
here we're gonna pass in our what's
called the batch function so this
handles at when we collect all the
different IDs so here we're going to
create a new file called batch functions
and I'm just going to import it import
and I'm gonna create a function called
channel batch will call it channel
batcher from and this is batch functions
to be functions let's rename that
they're real because you can have
multiple of them okay so then down here
all right here here it is so here we're
gonna pass in our batch load function so
our channel batcher and it takes keys so
we pass in two data loader a function
that takes keys and returns basically
the data so the keys are just IDs so in
passing IDs the channel batcher and I
also have pass in models so we can do a
database query and we need to get the
user so I'm going to pass in the request
user now we don't have to worry about
this being null or anything because we
already know if we've made it to this
far and our function that this is
getting called
that there is a user so that's good so
I'm gonna get rid of what we have here
now and I'm gonna put that into our
batch function over here so now here all
I have to do is use my loader and I
don't need my user or my models just my
channel loader and I do Channel loader
Channel let's make sure I spell that
right channel loader yup and I'm gonna
say load I
so what's happening is I'm requesting
the team ID here and so I'm gonna call
channel odor on team one two three and
four and so what's gonna happen is it's
gonna call our channel batch function
once it gets all of the IDs
so we're gonna say export comps channel
batcher so it's gonna have IDs models
and user and I'm just gonna export a
dummy thing down here export default or
export dummy so we don't get a warning
about exporting only one thing so IDs
this is gonna have one two three four so
we're gonna do is we're gonna fetch all
the channels for all of them and then
we're gonna return an array so ID this
is gonna look like one two three four
and then what we're gonna return at the
end is an array where we get all the
channels for Team one so team one
channels team two channels and so on for
each one and the channels here is gonna
be an array so we're gonna return array
of channels all right so let's do that
so first we're gonna say concert results
is gonna be we're gonna await the
results of this so now instead of just
one ID we have multiple IDs so I'm gonna
say IDs and so we just need to change
this to where instead of equal is in
which you can wrap that and I'm gonna
save team IDs so now we're passing in an
array of IDs we're looking for of team
IDs so we're getting them all at once
and user IDs gonna be the same
throughout the whole thing so we don't
need to do anything about that so and I
make this an async function so async
so once we get the results of this what
we're gonna do is we need to create I'm
gonna we need to sort it basically so
we're gonna create this is gonna give us
the results of like say 50 channels or
how many channels we have across all the
teams and we need to group them by team
and then we need to return them in this
order so first we're gonna group
oops group by team so that we're gonna
say kant's is gonna be data and now you
see me easily - to do group by before
but you can also just do a for loop so
results stop map or sorry for each and
we're gonna say result and we're gonna
say if data are dot team ID because we
want to group by team ID so we're gonna
store the team ID in here we're gonna
see if the team ID is in our data else
so if it is we're gonna say data our
team ID dot push our otherwise we are
gonna create a new array okay so we've
created basically grouped our team IDs
as the keys and then we have a list of
channels for each one so all we have to
do now is return IDs and we're gonna map
over the IDs we're gonna say ID where
data ID and I think it would probably be
helpful if I console.log to the data
here to show you guys what that looks
like but basically our data is gonna be
keys so it would be one two three four
and then each one will have it array of
channels and so when we map over this
we now have an array of arrays so that I
look like
that that that and so this this guy
right here will have team one channels
so I might have the name like general
and then for each one you'll have more
channels in each one so if I didn't do
anything wrong this should work let's
see if we have any errors over here nope
and let's see if we refresh we should
see the exact same setup here and sure
enough we do nothing changed
so we fetched all our channels that's
good I can see all my direct message is
still perfect that's not good that has
to do with our scroll height whoa look
at that in a second okay so I think
we're good let me show you guys what
this looks like on the end you'll notice
look at us selecting all these users
this is another one that would be good
to date at load I'm just gonna de load
this channel but you can see how you
would change this okay so for example
team four we have an array of channels
and we can see we have the general
channel we have Bob - we have some other
channels so that's how we're then
returning it in our IDs we have an array
of race so that is how you use data
loader to cache the results so now we're
only running one query so we can see our
query getting run should be right above
this actually so here we go this is from
channels and you can see we're looking
for the team ID where they're in this so
now instead of four or maybe ten times
the queries now we've reduced it to one
no matter how many channels we have so
this is a good idea to add a loader to
each one of your your guys over here so
this would be another good one to add it
a loader - okay so let's look at that
will air that we found over here - so
something went undefined I can give us
the scroll height I'm guessing just
scroller was undefined I was clicking
here we go so scroll height looks like
roller is just under
so we just need to check and make sure
it's defined before we do that I think I
was just like clicking too fast so
here's our client source routes this is
gonna be not in this what page is that
going to be on message container so in
our time out we just need to make sure
this dot scroller area you got a save
which schooler should be defined but
sometimes it isn't okay that looks like
it's not crashing anymore that's good
and general I was trying to find the
channel that had all my messages here's
the channel flawed messages scroll up
cool scrolling is still working
correctly so we didn't break that or
anything alright so that's it for this
video guys I recommend using data loader
wherever you can
to cache and batch you were query so
you're not running a ton because you can
easily in graph QL run way more database
queries than you think you are so thank
you guys for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
