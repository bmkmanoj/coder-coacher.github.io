here and I noticed two problems and then
one of you guys noticed a third that
we're gonna be fixing in this video the
first one is there's a little black bar
at the top here that's a little bit
different color than right here we're
using four numbers so you can just
barely slightly see it and I want to get
rid of that and I'm thinking my first
thought was this view container
you know that's wrapping the whole
application it must be this must be
black it must be you know showing up
here for some reason so there must be
like a tiny bit of space so I'm just
gonna set the color of the container so
copy the background color we're using
four here put it on the container now
pay it so like that pay attention to
this guy right here notice how it's
white right now when we save this and it
refreshes we now have a little black bar
appearing here so the background is like
seeping through right here for some
reason but not here here or here but
notice how that fixed it here so to get
rid of both of those problems this guy
and that guy I try putting it at our top
and that seemed to work and get rid of
it and not affect it down here so top if
you remember is just our top portion
right there that holds all our texts so
this block I don't know why it was
seeping through right here but that
fixed it the next thing I want to look
at is a division where like long numbers
appear so 94 divided by 3
notice how we draw up to the next line
and this kind of gets squished so what I
want to do is make it so this can only
be one line if it gets too big shown
ellipse or something and this is
actually really easy with react native
they have something called number
number of lines on text field and when I
set that if I do 94 enter 3 you notice
it doesn't ellipse but look at it mash
up against the side
oddly enough I don't know you would have
thought this would never happen because
the whole point of doing the ellipse and
the number of lines so it displays
nicely in one line but what we need to
do also is add this to here in here so
let's do that real quick
and then I'll show you I found a little
hack to fix it so I was annoyed that it
was mashing into the side and I didn't
want that so what you can do is add a
little bit of space and I found out that
two spaces is the IBL amount so we're
just gonna put it here and here so now
when I do 94 divided by 3
it doesn't smash up against the side
ENTER looks good and all three and then
we just shown ellipse at the end because
really don't need to see the full
decimal usually especially if it's
really long and we're showing a lot of
places here so yeah you this is a little
hacky having a little space here but it
goes ahead and fixes the spacing issue
and looks nice now all right so that's
two of our problems fixed the third one
is this guy so the orientation if we
swap it to landscape you'll notice the
buttons get all small and it doesn't
look great at all so there's two options
that we can do here the first is
basically styling it differently when
the layout changes like this or saying
you can only use it in portrait mode
like this and what I think I'm going to
do is just make it portrait only because
I looked into how you you know detect
well you have to end up doing if you
want to style it for landscape is detect
when the orientation changes rerender
and change all the styles
and I think it'll be easier just to set
this thing to portrait as you guys will
see it's one little thing we change in
app dot JSON we just say orientation
orientation and we just say we only want
to porch it now I don't know if app dot
Jason Allen gets red when we're doing
emulators but when I push it to the side
like that it shouldn't swap like this so
I think when I build this and publish it
it should listen I don't think app dot
JSON is read for just this or maybe it
didn't refresh this time but setting it
here should tell your application
hey and maybe I just need to rebuild it
or something for to see the effect here
but we're telling it hey you can't go
into portrait mode anymore
whenever you swap to landscape nothing
happens you stay in portrait the whole
time so that's it for this video guys
just cleaning up some issues with the
app and if there's any more issues I
noticed or you guys noticed along the
way we will fix those as they come up
that's it for this video guys thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
