we're going to be going over moving from
the button create button to just typing
things and then pressing enter and
having that add it to the to do list so
to do this I want to take advantage of
one of the props of text input and one
of them is on submit editing is what I
think I want to use anyway but I'm not
quite sure so I'm just going to
basically put this on this text view and
then see if it works out see what it's
called if it gets called because what
I'd like to do just press ENTER and have
it add the two instead of having a
button let's refresh press ENTER press
enter oh yet we get done on submit
editing call back those call and text
and boots submit button is pressed okay
I think that's the right thing so then
what I want to do is I want to submit
and we're going to pass create to do end
values handle submit submit is here okay
so we need to pass these values to the
text input so I just want to try this
component components are like functions
right
least I believe they are think we can
just do that let's see that might not
work okay no notice how it just like
stopped typing for me didn't work so if
it needs to be just like that how can I
pass the value how can i pass handle
submit to text field I basically just
need to pass another prop to it oh that
she might be problematic so how do I
pass more props dot bind possibly handle
cement just curious what that will do
that messes up to so it needs to be just
like this okay so maybe JK about trying
to get that working because I'm not sure
how to pass the props you know what I'll
do is I'll investigate this later and
just do some research to see if we can
figure out how to do it and I'll just
move on to the next thing that I want to
get working which is I want to have like
molt's support multiple to-do lists so I
kind of want to have like a menu where
you can select that to do that you would
work on you have like different to-do
lists basically and right here side menu
so we want to implement like a little
side menu here
we'll have that and so this is going to
be on the homepage actually it's just
it's literally just side menu and then
its list okay very hapless imported I
think no we don't let's format these
nicely okay and now we want side menu
list and the item okay we'll import
these now what do we do next menu
component side menu toggle side menu
constructor Oh what am i doing we're
inside to do for so copy these save that
go to this paste it here and we're going
to do this kind of in the middle is
where render function is right now we
have that we have this go to login and
we can get rid of this button right now
because we can basically add that to our
side pane actually will leave for now
that way I remember action stop logged
is the function we want to call later so
we a constructor we basically looks like
create a state just to toggle the menu
so let's create that
um that's fine I was wondering whether
we needed to add set to do's called to
state out like we do I don't know why I
didn't pass the props in here and I also
don't know why there's not semicolons
we'll leave that there I hate I hate not
having this at the top let's put the top
forgot that constructor there toggle
sidebar whoa why do we jump up to the
top what the heck did I delete it import
it's real quick no I didn't it straight
um and notice how he binds this to it
what that does is this function right
here has access to this global this
object but another way to do it because
I don't really like binding because it's
more typing so I can just go set equal
to a lambda function like that ok so now
and I actually let's create this as of
another component should be doing this
in our component this will be side menu
or is that that the read the name of yet
is what I'm going to call this let's
call it menu or no you know what glee
kurt node yeah
i'm going to call this navigation and i
want to rename that rename so want to do
is ok now we can copy this stuff go to
turn navigation paste that in there and
let's actually create the class first
class navigation extends react component
now I can add those now have a render
and then let's grab some imports just
grab reports from here navigation and we
don't need graph ql could use some of
these later so we'll keep those and we
don't need axe actually do neat actions
ok come back over here and i can get rid
of the constructor and toggle sidebar ok
now it should be good as new now we can
just work out the navigation and before
i forget let's go to line 17 whoops 21
now and export default alright let's
continue working on this so if we come
back over here I'll just copy that
the spacing is off that it's going to be
really annoying wait what's going on
there what curly braces this matchup
with mesh up without okay why are is
everything on the same level then have
everything in that looks good I hate
that they don't put semicolons at the
end of their code examples just snapped
my keyboard the keyboard stand ok
they're back in so semicolon there ok so
this is the menu component so this is
what I oh I guess this is what it
actually looks like
I kind of want to put this up here I
don't know if that does anything for
performance or anything but I kind of
feel like if I put up here it's better
for performance the reason why I'm a
little skeptical is I don't want to like
remake the component every time and the
render function actually I guess you
know what let's leave it leave it in
there change my mind I was just being
silly okdokey you so how are we going to
do this so for now we don't have any
like the back end doesn't support like
multiple lists so we're going to have to
implement that first before we do stuff
here but what we can do list container
style tab it all the list where is this
coming from okay
we can just create a couple static list
items we don't need avatars on press so
the first odd press we can do is we can
create a title let's create a login
login ki is equal to save hey just give
it a random key negative one let's go to
negative 3 I don't know I don't know
what the difference is I don't think
being a subtitle and side bar is open
menu app got toggle so side menu is open
app toggle what are we supposed to
import something for app where is this
app coming from that's something for
react native it could be coming to react
I'm wondering where this app components
coming from getting react native so just
try it I guess see if it just recognizes
the port or if it crashes duplicate
decoration of list oh that's going to
hurt us in this list item two that's
going to hit us over here to there you
go because I copied over the import i
added a twice by flux okay actually
maybe it rendered okay maybe apics is
the thing that's fine i'll just see what
happens when we try adding it to post
navigation
I ish navigation and what we want to do
here I guess just add it to the top
render where's a renter function here we
go navigation how about that got
undefined check to render method of
navigation
and what does it want me to check got
undefined invalid expected a string or
class but got undefined for navigation
this state is open that looks good menu
component that looks good too toggle
sidebar this oh I don't like that I like
that all toggle sidebar like that this
dot look better nope what else could be
the problem I don't think it's up here
this is looks pretty straightforward
could it be the negative one possibly it
doesn't like or the native number hope
that's not it view looks fine oh this
should be a function I think ya know I
still think it should be a function this
stop state dot is open that looks fine
let's make sure react native app is a
thing wrecked native app component I I
think it is a component oh you know what
I think I'm being dumb I think we need
to wrap I think we need to go like high
up explain what that means in a second I
think I think I know what this app thing
is um view all the way up to the root
directory there's um in Dexta Android
wear nope just kidding guys and I'm
talking about I thought for a second
that was like a the top level is the app
that we need creep that was not right
guides their components here yo
components there is no app component
there is no app on the app component
does not exist let's try to leading that
just for kicks to see if it enters it
renders so the app is what's throwing it
off where are we getting exposed to be
getting that from toggle sidebar
where are we supposed to put this maybe
app is like a general is there multiple
course there's not multiple examples
possibly well we have up here badges
that's quite unfortunate picking pun
implement react nice Irish is part so it
implements this all right cool this is a
could have more examples here here we go
sidebar content view oh so this is
supposed to wrap everything oh I know I
know how we're supposed to do this I
think I think for this um side menu
thing I need to put it up a couple
levels actually no the sidebar thing
should only be now the sidebar think
should be on the loading page it should
be on the no-action tuition oh man
actually having a slide bar it
complicates the app quite a bit I think
we need to put the side bar like right
here so it wraps this stuff because this
is our appt class app index so basically
we put it here wrap the router
status bar maybe that does something
flex just to see if it renders correctly
let's copy this hmm just this part let's
first get rid of it here because that's
obviously not going to work how I
thought it would and whoops I went did
not mean to cancel out
ok
has its own render function already
there doesn't look like there's a poop
the props there's no previous
constructor so that's fine I can just
put that stuff above here
we can just put our sidebar oh shoot up
in the wrong one fudge
okay I wanted to go one index up this
index Aereo this is a lot more cluttered
this looks right
okay put this around sure on this why
not
two bullet decoration of button
okay I didn't even add it because we
just need to okay it's there we just
need to add a button to toggle it over
okay so how are we going to do this then
because this complicates things because
we're going to have a sidebar eats the B
is the sidebar when you think about how
the sidebar works when we're on the
login page we're on the signup page
maybe we just disabled and only have it
on the home page then how would you go
from login to sign up now we'd have to
have it at this level that's really
annoying I don't want this high up but
why do I let this high up guess it's
fine having at this high up there's
actually no problem having this high up
I don't think
and it's working well
and so I might just extract this menu
component I don't think we can move this
sidebar from this area but we can move
component out okay so this is how it's
going to work the other side menu here
this looks good status bar i'm not sure
what that does so let's hook that up
your cliq react native status bar
was very vague this is just a buttload
of code all right no thanks I'll just
leave it there for now um I guess I'll
have a components key components holder
comments nope not in reducers Aereo /
come clients
so we're going to import menu from
component / then you need to import side
menu and that should be everything it
looks nice will copy this over from our
navigation page I believe it I just want
to clean up this page real quick okay we
can leave this stuff here we call this
menu okay the wrist that looks nice so
in my components folder what if we can
copy and paste okay I can be super cool
though so we have just do it like that
why not so menu oops we want to remove
that because it needs to be a folder
and then in here and actually let's just
head on over there it'll be easier set
this stuff up see the menu ok now I'm
going to copy from the routes and just
like the login yeah copy that here for
now we're not going to have any actions
common it out for now can uncommon at
once we have it in our view and now we
can come back up okay so now we have our
components we're going to copy over our
navigation code our menu component and
that's going to be our view explore
default and we actually need to pass
this guy a lot of props and actually you
know what I need to make this guy a but
a regular class because we're going to
do some graph ql queries and stuff in
here to actually get the lists so export
default or not so component
and then we have a render function
return and let's put all this code in
our return function and we can also get
rid of this late node oh I don't know
what just happened that was really weird
see if I actually delete it no I didn't
delete note yes did you leave yes bed
alright so login is good menu extends
need import list and list item from
react native elements elements and let's
refresh up to very hairs we might
navigation doesn't exist and we're
importing it
yeah let's pass function
oh I know what to do anchor creators
will be an empty object let's pass
connect oh I don't know what's wrong I
know it's something wrong with this
function for now let's just make a dummy
action so we don't have to deal with
this export default no not expert
default just export const dummy now do
you like it no actions just see where's
this coming from it doesn't say huh
I mean I'm pretty sure it's just this
index and i'm pretty sure it's just not
liking this connect you must pass a
component to the function i'll be an
export alrighty so oh ok but we should
have thought we should have seen this
though why is this not rendering that
should be popping up there's no reason
we shouldn't be seeing the word login
unless everything is white which is
shouldn't be blue I don't know what that
color was blue will definitely show up
it is grabbing it right from you know
where i'm porting menu it's putting the
menu here this status bar the freaking
now i can't be status by messing
anything up your own legs as far as
doing much hmm i'm really i'm not sure
why it's not showing anything at all
just for just a test we can return just
return that i don't need these right now
okay so that's not rendering so
something is not working this slide is
working could be I need to be out one
more level there you go spacing was
weird
what does it say they are loading
I guess we would see the high up here
right all I don't know what else to say
honestly hey rest city what's up so I
kind of want to just remove this and
just put like a text do I have text
imported I do to see if it's possibly
because we have like a component inside
here is messing something up okay say
hello slide over nope we're not getting
anything here so we're just using it
wrong so let's come back over to the
documentation content view side menu
content view menu menu
overthinking this navigator yes i agree
i really enjoy react i like how you do
some functional programming and twined
with it so there's just looks like it's
working it could because we're doing the
only extra thing is this is open thing
get rid of that for a second nope oh my
previous native videos this is actually
the first time I've been doing native
live streaming this so there's just like
a whole bunch of stuff that I have in
the last videos to get up to the point
to get it to like looking like this um
but it's there's a lot of extra space
because I basically just went through
the whole thing not known how to do it
so there's a lot of trouble shooting
like what's happening right now for
whatever reason it I'm getting the slide
this slide is like really smooth and I
like it before ever reason there's
nothing popping here and we're importing
this menu which is supposed to be coming
from here and
see menu menu menu what if I just do a
this turn text I unexpected then I'll
close it text hi oh maybe I'm supposed
to wrap
Mabus wants the syntax text it is on
this page that is like to do source
index line 53 so you have this oh I got
rid of that nothing just actually not
working let's see if they have any
issues where it's just not component our
undoing that's what we need I'm trying
to create the sidebar I'm not sure is it
the same guy yeah no one answered
menu okay so where is this menu
component coming from this is something
he's creating menu menu menu and you
navigator this is a lot of code okay
here's his menu here that a bit tricky
no kidding
see if there's any other issues that are
similar possibly answered
I'm just going to use a different side
bar then
hmm brings me back so that I guess
that's the top yeah this guy's got 86
stars that looks like it was the best
library when we can't get to work
they're really not another good library
this looks so easy to get working to I
really liked it you mean you just wrap
everything in a view maybe navigator
content view welcome to react native
point 1.2 I guess usage example I can
look at possibly there's going to be
something I'm doing slightly different i
think maybe i need to do like this menu
thing um a new menu i'm guessing maybe I
need to wrap everything in a view
possibly that's what this is doing
though maybe maybe you need to do flex
like they were doing I am wrapping it um
this is how it looks like some in my
sidebar right here I'm wrapping there
because I can get it to slide I think
the wrap that part is ok because it
slides ok what's not happening is this
menu guy is not being rendered so let's
go to the usage example I would clearly
this is the such example huh so
everything is on this page
what if I just to test this out let's do
a simpler component um Const simple menu
actually that's a good idea let's see if
it's even mounting component will now
console dot log did mount no it's not
even mounting okay is it you've been
going to this render function console
dot log vendor
no it's not yeah that's kind of
interesting actually so we're exporting
it
does it virender happens after mount for
some reason i was thinking mount
happened first and actually I want to
see what the first react native life
cycle I want to see with the first thing
the life cycle is and print that out see
if it's even getting like like where
it's getting in a constructor let's put
something in the constructor because I'm
guessing that's the first thing to be
called constructed
and it goes to loading that was a rude
transition let's just reload it nope
saima being constructed so
so I mean something I guess that means
it doesn't like the position of this no
you're fine view just to see if we can
get this to work I'm going to try
putting it into the home component
so wrap that and actually instead of
deleting one I copy
what did you say Piper import proper
import so it's at this component will
receive it is it is importing it and
adding it so import menu from we're
going to go up two components / menu and
actually actually we do have to remove
sidebar from here so it doesn't render
twice now see what happens
okay it slides and I fell like did we
render did i leave the import statements
and I import the console statements and
here yeah I did so it's not even being
constructed still let's full screen oops
we're back to one too many um where was
I routes home
I would I would have expected the
animation not to work if anything I'm
very surprised nothing is happening here
and actually what I want to do on a set
is open to true immediately opens that's
what I expect still not rendering oh no
but give me any component I'll see you
for a second it needs to be like this
menu thingy navigator navigator is there
is there a react native prop that's
called men you see react native
nope there's not a menu what does modal
do is that just pop over probably yeah I
really have no idea why it's not doing
the menu I'm I'm curious what if I just
do I'm just going to say what if I just
did something like this where i made it
empty but that's not gonna do anything
maybe just a single view possibly it
needs to be the outermost because in
their example here it's the outermost so
okay let's just try that so just for the
sake of trying everything let's copy it
back over slide then you know
and then put above the apollo provider
side venue and now I can delete it from
the home component
all right let's go to a different
strategy then let's see what our other
other options are for just like a
navigation
ok this might have what we want let's
side menu bar Oh installation for iOS
and Android or difference night class I
want something is cross-platform and
just like works for both
yep let's find a different one this one
seems like too much worked install
is there a native feature that we can
use not really it does look like not a
pretty one at least say navigation bar
I'll back forward thing I really want
the sidebar to work because it works
nicely because I want to kind of get the
Wunderlist type of feel so Wunderlist
sidebar I want this kind of feel where
it has like the lists here I don't know
if you guys can see this might be too
small and as the two days over here and
you can select different list see if
there's any other react if sidebar is
there any other material design material
design save me you have something these
companies have only been test that IRS
however they're welcome to go if you're
in a sort of crossbreeding development
sure we'll tak let's try this on iOS I
guess so the component we want is drawer
and is it blank yep it's might be a new
library or something
this actually looks like a decent size
project me this could be good one react
native career will achieve material
design slack style parallax these all
look very nice of what we want ok this
looks promising let's try this out react
native drawer to the draw hurry up and
let's import control panel I assume I
know what's going on with a control
panel I'm assuming that's the actual
menu
okay let's give this a try give that
import and then close control panel open
control panel I hope by default the
sliding just works but we're about to
find out
um coat a venue I don't worry about the
ref for now and this will be here go
back out go back in your
boring field prop type invalid prop
contents if I jewelry expected a react
node okay
I doesn't look like there's a there we
go well we got the sliding to work but
also went to loading why is it going to
loading was I clicking that maybe no
why does it go to loading I click over
here and pull does it go back
I'm actually I'm curious is this
something the drawer is doing so getting
rid of the drawer
weird oh here we go here we go for
whatever reason I can come over to this
loading screen so I probably thought I
was swiping oh my gosh I'm being so dumb
I probably thought I was when I was
using the other drawer I probably
thought I was opening it but I was
really just swiping over and going into
this I think what's going on is my
router react native flux router for
whatever reason has a slider to go to
different panels Dorsai venue what it
has it what already using this let's see
if we can get this thing to work then
sure okay screw all this junk that i'm
using right now
let's just use what I have already
because this is actually a nice library
that's been working for me Gary the
store junk it's already has is some kind
of swype in there too that's really
weird Production apps don't worry about
production ABS drawer other info drawer
tab bars to our he real drawer from 00
freaking it actually just uses this
drawer a library the one I'm using huh
okay nevermind don't undo we're going to
be using you ref open on clothes on type
content side menu tap to close open
drawer offset between default navigation
state on navigate then wrap your tabs
what then you should hide toilet or
anything using refresh so what's
happening is we're creating a drawer
here navigation drawer default render
okay sure
let's create a new component add node
navigation drawer navigation drawer
dotty is just copy pasta import menu
from menu
for a min you there will keep all this
stuff just stock same thing and now it
says come back to my router so I'm going
to get rid of the app drawer here and
now I'm going to come back to my router
and looks like we call this the drawer
and the component drawer and then we use
that open as false I wanna set open its
true to see what it looks like at first
but we'll do falls for now import
navigation drawer from up one components
components / add vacations or all right
let's see this work side menu doesn't
exist I think that's it our navigation
drawer side menu okay
cannot find variable component
you trying to access react native da
component from the react native page
perhaps you meant excess reactant
component oh that was weird he had just
the wrong thing loading okay this is a
fine screen to be on okay check if
signed in ad token to props I guess
let's initially set this is the true
just to see whether it's ruki that's
awesome so let's refresh it's kind of an
ugly-looking sidebar but nonetheless is
the sidebar that's working I'm also
curious why we're getting a loading
screen either way let's we're getting
pressed okay menu store index what I
want to do I wanna yeah mess with the
navigation drawer no I don't want to
mess with the actual menu itself you and
I actually want to do this we're going
to be changing the page and they told me
how to change the page drawer open but
ok that's only for doing then you can
open / hi toggle anywhere using your
fresh modifier
okay we just want to do a new screen all
together so instead of pressed we'd like
to do is say actions dot log in
okay it didn't work
you can tell if my button press isn't
working or if the actual code isn't
working I think it might just be the
button press and as a bun press this
right here this is a menu item which is
its I'm wondering if it's like up too
high in the router hierarchy it should
be fine
okay so go is definitely being triggered
it's just actually not moving try this I
guess oh I see what this is doing so
that's setting the value so for whatever
reason that is not working I believe I
did this exact code here yeah actions
that log in and it's just straighten out
working right now pressed so inside this
component it does not let me transition
the page so let's go back over here for
a second tabs is equal to true
built in nav bar component natural
remedies down function toggle okay
that's fine let's see what the other
things our modles tab bar custom navbar
switch splaying scenes sub scenes I mean
the only thing I can think I was let's
try doing this refreshing and then
instead of drawer we go to login
nope didn't like that either also I'm
curious why we're stuck on this loading
screen let's let's look at why that's
happening first because that might be
contributing factor because um and the
props here are in the console we're
printing out add token to props after
check if signed in and if I go to the
epic should be passing a token oh you
know what I think I broke I don't think
actions thought home I think I just
broke the navigation that's why when I
added this drawer oops to not mean do
that I think I just duplicated in the
window that's kind of cool I don't know
what I push to do that but was going to
say is I think I just broke it the
navigation so that's my router routes
index when I added this now nothing is
working not nothing but navigating let's
see if there's another way to navigate
so coming back up here components
go through the main tutorial again okay
from page the page we're doing that
do I need to do like actions dot drawer
dot refresh now are not refresh login
maybe it's like two levels deep let's
console dot log actions see if that
gives us anything helpful
then here oh ok login
undefined this function is undefined
I mean let's check if this is a known
github issue I guess wow this has a lot
of issues
I
okay no is helping this guy not sure
what's going on honestly this is a very
weird I don't know why I would just
break it I just look at this one more
time for a component navigation I guess
we have a scene inside of a scene now
okay let's check this navigation drawer
action nope yeah actually yeah okay
that's fine my actions view let's see if
drawer is undefined
drawers on define to do anything that's
long defined
get drawer focus refresh pop iterate
create so just be explicit about this to
make sure I know what the air is and i
get rid of that my theory is if i get
rid of this line right here we will no
longer see loading okay so it can
transition scenes as soon as we add a
component at this top level and we had a
drawer we can no longer change
components now let's see if there's
something he adds in there so that would
be where were we react native drawer I
want to go back to react native flips
Rotter I close that tab
you
okay here's is true she says tabs true I
don't think that does anything but
that's just one item key is main open is
false I mean
heck let's see herbs if I get it open
sea is because I'm open true nope that
didn't do anything this still open good
maybe if i get rid of initial what will
happen then still goes there are we
right into these such silly problems
under pizzas default render thing that's
just messing things up it's got to be
that I don't see anything else that's
outlet ordinary happens if I get rid of
it okay that's not even showing up
navigation state children we're children
stepchildren it's only showing their
first child on navigate the stop props
navigate
what is going on I guess the only thing
anything else look for another example
maybe these guys that the drawer place
has some biblically they had some
examples nope is it just this page yep
oh the Cybermen you need to come up okay
if you got sidebar menu to work this
looks nice any progress of this I'm
trying to get my site America Line it
works up to the point where I'm trying
to call any actions from sidebar or she
nothing happens
that's quite a nice da here let's try
this the you got it working yet his side
bar working let's see if we get ours
working so he went into the router nope
one too deep so this is actually above
the router that's kind of interesting
all this route
Oh guys I think I know what I was doing
wrong before that's really dumb I was
just passing menu in i think i need to
pass in menu like that that's the
problem that's really annoying I didn't
even throw an error just sit didn't work
alright so what's going on cannot find
side menu and port side menu from react
native elements
whoa this looks just like the other menu
but then it's working I just probably go
wait wait wait what's going on why is it
rendering why is it rendering the
navigation drawer I put go and I for the
go here cool it's actually working now I
took way too long to get working holy
moly actions dot log in haha oh man that
took so long ok I'm happy so let's get
rid of this item did not mean to open on
finder I'm just fat fingering
I'm just not closing the files in the
buffer as about to say alright let's
just get diff and see what we've changed
so we had react native drawer I'll just
a yarn remove react native drawer we
don't need that mpm remove oh I almost
just removed react native that could
been really bad I mean not really bad
but annoying we remove the button that's
fine let's actually go to source index
and just clean up some of these you
don't need the menu anymore I don't need
sidebar okay that looks good get diff
you I just change the spacing add some
items console.log killed all right looks
good commit got sidebar to render all
right i think is a good stopping point
for tonight we got the sidebar rendered
that took way longer than we needed to
but now that we have that we can start
cranking out on the navigation and get
that fleshed out so that's what we
working on the next video see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
