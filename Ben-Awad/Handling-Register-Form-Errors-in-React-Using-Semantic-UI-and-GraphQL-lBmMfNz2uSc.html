register form that we started in the
last video there's currently two
problems with it
the first if we get an error with our
form we're not displaying it to the user
so for example if I have the username a
a a we successfully create it right but
if I submit it again we get registers
false because we've already registered
username and we can't have the username
there twice so that's not good and we're
also allowing pretty much any username
email and password we want to have some
validation so we want to add those
things to our register form and we also
when we submit the form it's successful
we're going to navigate to a different
page on our website so that's what we're
gonna be working on so to start off with
the validation and formatting errors
we're going to be looking at something
than sequel ice so sequel eyes lets us
basically check single fields to make
sure they are valid and here are the
different validation checks that they
can do and all we do is we pick the
attribute we want to check we do
validate and then we pick whichever ones
we want we can add them in so for
example if our username we only want
alphanumeric we can do that so I'm gonna
bring over my project here so this is
the back end or the server for the
register form right now and if I click
on user not a resolver our model
actually we can set requirements so I'm
gonna validate the username
so the first thing I'd like to do is set
only allow alphanumeric so we don't have
you're looking usernames and I also want
to set a length
oops so I'm gonna say a length of let's
say it can be as short as three
characters and as long as 25 this is
kind of just me arbitrarily picking
numbers the other thing I want to do is
instead of just adding the value here
what you can do is add a message to like
how they have here so they set the
arguments and the message and the reason
for that is you can actually throw an
error message if this is not this
condition to not met so here I'm going
to say args true and then here I'm gonna
say message and my message is gonna be
the username can only contain letters
and numbers and in same thing here you
can do args and we can do any number of
these right so message and it's going to
be the username needs to be between 3
and 25 characters long and unique will
automatically be checked for us and we'd
like to do pretty much the same thing
with
the email so validate we can copy now we
don't really need to do an alphanumeric
check or a length to check per se but I
believe look there is a is email check
so we could do that and we can say args
we would like that in a message invalid
email so if it doesn't doesn't match
this check it doesn't go through it
somehow invalid and then maybe for our
password we'd like to set a length too
so we'll set say type and then we're
gonna say validate and in here I'm just
gonna set a length firm the password so
we'll copy what we put here and maybe
for the password we're gonna have five -
let's call hundred characters so the
password needs to be between five and
hundred characters long now you can do
more checks on the password if you'd
like to for example you can check if
they uppercase some letter or if there's
any numbers in it all kinds of different
things and you can even do custom
validations but I think this is a pretty
good sample and so we what we want to do
is throw this error back to our form
over here like I would like to see here
what the air is that I get what this
happens so to do this we're gonna change
up our scheme a little bit so in our
loops in our user schema here instead of
just returning a boolean I'm gonna
return a better object so I'm going to
create a schema here called air
is and I'm going to explore default I'm
gonna create an error type so the type
error has two things a path which is a
string and a message just a string and I
suppose the message could be null so the
path is what's wrong
for example the username could be wrong
the email could be wrong the password
could be wrong and then the message is
what's wrong
so in our user schema we're gonna say
we're gonna create a type register
response in our response we're gonna
return okay which is a boolean value of
whether it was and the basically the
request went through and then if it went
through we can return the user and if it
didn't go through we can return and this
is going to be nullable we can do errors
so this is gonna be array of air so
we're either gonna have an air or either
gonna pass so it this is kind of how
this types gonna work we're gonna return
it here so register responds and if it's
okay we'll get a user that is not null
and our heirs will be null but if it's
not okay our user is gonna be null and
we're gonna have errors to look at so
that's why one of these will be null
always so we can't use the bang sign
here okay so now we need to change up
our resolver so it returns things in
this format and so let's come over here
so here's what we're doing right now
so instead of returning like that we
really want to return like this so we
say okay which is true and our user
which we can say const user is equal to
this right and now for our heirs we're
gonna return okay is false and notice
how i don't specify in heirs here I
could put errors null but I don't need
to do that
so here user is gonna be null and heirs
is gonna be an array of heirs but how do
I actually get this array of errors
I can't just pass an error object back
how do I know where am I getting these
errors from well all the errors are
gonna be in this error object somewhere
all we have to do is basically grab it
and extract it so I have a little
function that I've used in previous
projects called format errors so I'm
going to copy this and just put it over
here so how format errors works is I'm
gonna pass in the air and the models so
for example format errors I pass in the
air and models we need to pass in the
air so it knows how that what air is the
format and the model is just sequel eyes
model because we're checking basically
the type of the air so we need to have
this so what this is doing is it's
checking the air object and it's saying
if this error object is a validation
error then we're gonna do one thing if
it's not a validation error we don't
know what type of error it is because
we're only in our inner model over here
all of these are validation things so
we're checking if we're getting any type
of validation error because we know what
the message should be so that's what we
handle here otherwise we say we
something else went wrong we don't know
what went wrong
we weren't expecting an air except for
validation errors so we don't know what
went wrong we just say something went
wrong in the path here I'm putting name
you could put anything here okay but and
I just want to make sure that I did in
my air okay good I want to make sure I
said message and not that
okay and then here what I'm doing is a
ears has all the airs and then I'm just
mapping through them and I'm doing a low
- command called pick because we don't
want to return the whole object we just
care about the path and the message so
let's go ahead and import low - this is
something we're gonna have to install so
I'm in the server folder I can do yarn
add low - to the sauce library
okay so cool so now we should be
throwing back errors
we're formatting the errors nicely here
we're checking if it's a validation
error if it is we're gonna Mack through
all of them and format them the only
formatting we're really doing is just
picking these two attributes from that
object if you've never seen this before
I can real click explain what pick is
doing in more depth so let's say you
have the object a and B so there's two
properties if I were to pick
pick on this guy the output is gonna be
an object where it's just a so whatever
you pass here it just grabs those
properties from the object so it's gonna
get rid of any other objects so I'm
gonna get rid of that so that's what
that's doing we can put that here okay
so let's give this a run and see what
happens
I'm gonna open up console consoles good
so we're not getting any errors there so
now I'm gonna go ahead and click Submit
Oh still on our client side now we're
gonna have to account for a different
response object so over here I was not
doing any type of selection but now I
need to here is graph QL okay so I want
to get okay I would like to get the user
I actually don't care about the user so
I'm just gonna ignore that and I want
the path and message these are really
the only fields I care about since we're
not using the user for anything you
could get the user back if you wanted to
but we don't need it so why even grab it
okay
so let's run that so a-a-alright
so let's see what's going on here so we
can see our heirs so we have two heirs
here our username the username is not
the right length it's not between three
and twenty five characters and our email
is invalid
I should be our password is also too
short
so let's see if we miss something with
our validation here oh you know what
that's that's one problem so a
validation here this will not work so
let's get rid of that and the reason for
that is I forgot we're hashing the
password so for this if I wanted to do
any type of validation on the password
here I would have to do it here I would
have to do a check if password is
greater than bla bla bla throw error or
something because we're gonna be hashing
this guy so up here I would have to do
if password dot length is less than 10
or you know whatever I want five we're
gonna throw new air
X Y Z
right so I could just do a return object
okay false and then airs an object you
know we'll go ahead and keep this why
not it's good to have make sure you have
a minimum length on your password I
suppose so if the password length is
less than five we're gonna say a path
password is wrong in our message will be
we can copy this guy so we basically
want the same error message the password
is to be greater has to be you know why
not let's set a between and Python you
can do something like this which I
really like I don't think you can do it
in JavaScript oh whoa what the heck so
my for matter just formatted to this so
we're gonna say password length is less
than five or password length is greater
than 100 we're gonna say password oops
needs to be between 5 and 100 characters
long
so let's request this again now we
should only get one air right cuz it
should hit that password one first so we
get the password err now we can do this
longer and now we should get these two
errors again and we do so now all we do
need to do is instead of just showing
you in the console here I'd like to see
a little pop-up or maybe the fields go
red something right so let's do that so
here there's three possible errors
something's wrong with the username
something's wrong with the email or the
password so I'm gonna say username air
and password err let's put that down
here actually email err ok so now when
we do variables here and we mutate we
need to actually specify which ones we
want so conce username email password
and that's what we're going to pass here
use your name email password as
variables cool and then our response
object here I'm just gonna go look at
what the shape of it was so it'd be easy
so so we're gonna click on data register
and then that's where we're gonna look
at things so const
okay heirs is equal to response sought
data dot register
so if okay what we want to do is
redirect them to a different page so to
do that we just do this stop props that
history dot push and we specify what
page so we'll just for now go to the
home page which is there you know all
console.log this still why not so
history is given to us by the sprout
because we made register a route it
passes down to us this history object
and we push to add a new round otherwise
it's not okay there was some errors so
we're going to say this dot sets state
and we're gonna update our state and
we're gonna pass in what the errors are
so how do we know what the errors are
well we have an array here and if the
path and the message we just need to
loop through and set them so I'm gonna
say actually you know what I don't even
need to just set state right here what
I'm gonna say is Const
we're not gonna say airs I'll just call
this error this is going to be an object
and we're gonna say airs for each we're
gonna say air it's going to be equal to
let's actually just expand this and grab
the path and message so the path is
equal to the message and really it's
going to be the path which is and then
air so we're gonna be looping through
the every air and for example if we have
a password we're gonna really be setting
air dot password air is equal to
whatever message we have like too long
or whatever so then at the end of this
loop we're gonna have an object here
with all the airs and it's okay if
there's an overwrite because it's okay
if we we can like basically have them
clear the first username error like if
there's multiple problems with their
username that's okay they can resolve it
one at a time basically so now we're
gonna do this stuff set State air now
we're not actually doing anything with
the state but let's just make sure the
state actually appears so I'm gonna say
AAA we don't get any errors I'm gonna
come over here and look at the register
component
and I see it looks like our password err
did not show up so something did go
wrong so let's just look at how we're
doing this
errors were looping through path message
password error
I'm gonna just say console dot log air
and see what the value oh here's the
problem there we go
I was like I was had the quote curly
braces around it when we really just
want to pass it like that
so we'll console.log this to make sure
as well so good this is what we expect
so now in our state we should see
password error cool has this message so
now we just need to display this to the
UI so I'm gonna get rid of this console
log we don't need it anymore
so the first UI I'm gonna do on this is
have the input turn red so to do this we
just display a err prop on the input so
air is going to be shown when we have a
user named air so here we're gonna get
the user name air email air and password
air and user name air
and here we will show a email air and a
password
okay so air is expecting a boolean and a
empty string results in false so when I
hit enter over here or when we see this
just refresh
well type of strings applied to input
expected boolean okay see this is
exactly what I was just talking about I
was thinking it will auto cast it but it
doesn't so to cast this to a boolean you
can put a double bang sign and the
reason for that is if I have that this
string this guy and I put a this
evaluates to false so if I put a bang
sign on it it'll now evaluate to true
but really I want to turn this thing
into false or I want to turn it into a
boolean and cast it so if I double bang
sign it just turns it from true to false
I don't know if that makes sense but
basically it turns this string into a
boolean so now when I hit submit we see
password is red and if I add a password
that's 5 we can now see they're all red
and what we can do is in the submit at
the start of the submit we should really
be setting this thought well I might say
that this started on submit but really
it's when you start typing you want to
basically say all these errors gone away
so username err you know what actually
I'm gonna say it when we submit again
so this thought set state because I
don't know if you guys noticed but when
I submitted this username stayed read
even though we fix that error which we
shouldn't show that so username error is
equal to that and we're just going to go
down so just resetting the error in our
form so now we get this guy read I make
it an appropriate length these two will
now turn red and this one will stay
white because it's now good so the last
part is to actually display that message
and semantic UI has a nice little
message card and what we want to do is
something like this where we show a list
so I'm just going to copy this message
and we're going to show this message at
the bottom so this is an error message
so we're putting error here and we only
want to display this if we have an error
so what I'm gonna do is say basically
put a boolean
so we're gonna return null if this is
not true and we're gonna check for a
username air or a email air or a
password air so if any of these airs are
true then what we will do is show this
guy right here otherwise we don't show
anything and then in our list we're
gonna say sure there was some errors
with your submission
that's a fine that's a fine thing to say
and then our list here is of all the
messages really what we want to add to
this list is the errors that are not
empty so we want to check if this is
empty so I'm gonna say Const Error List
and we're gonna say if username err then
we're gonna add it to our list oh sorry
push user name here there we go and
we're gonna do this for each err so if
there is president we push it on the
list email err
oops
and finally password okay so that as all
our air is covered let's see if we have
this working so I submit of please
select your home country so now we
actually need to actually put our lists
that we just created hidden here so this
is called air list so I hit submit
it says the password needs between five
and hundred characters long and we see
this is red so I'm gonna go ahead and
put it make it five hundred they're not
five hundred at least five and it says
invalid email and the username needs to
be at least three characters long so I'm
gonna say Bob and now our username error
went away we just have an invalid email
and now I'm going to say Bob at Bob calm
and I'm gonna hit submit username needs
to be unique so we've already made a
user with the username Bob so let's
change that to maybe Bob jr. and give
that a try and bam after making all
those changes to our form we're able to
say hastily submit but that's pretty
cool right and you saw we change pages
and we're now able to see each and every
error that happens and we can tell the
user as they're doing it so this is one
way to show airs and I think it's a
pretty decent and I'm pretty happy with
how our register form is looking one
little small improvement we could make
but I'm gonna skip this for now is
actually do some client-side validation
because we don't need to send password
to the server if it's blank right I
should not send this to the server
because all these fields are blank but
I'm doing it anyway but that's a
separate issue we can deal with at a
different time it's not too big of a
deal but this is nice seeing this little
error message our register forms coming
quite well together so I think in the
next video we're going to start on a
login so now that we're able to create
users we want to be able to log in and
you
our account so let me know what you
think of this method of creating a login
page and a or a register page and
handling errors I think this is a decent
way but let me know if you think there's
a better way to handle errors I'd love
to hear it I am always looking at ways
to improve how I'm doing this cuz I
could it's a little clunky but it works
quite nice so that's it for this video
guys thanks for watching the code will
be up on github
