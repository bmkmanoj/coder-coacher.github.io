login page is just about done so the
next thing to do is the product page but
before we get into that I want to fix
our navigation because right now we have
kind of an interesting way of how we
want to do it because we don't want to
start the user on the same page every
time depending if their login or not we
want to show them different pages so for
example if someone has never use their
app we want to take them to the signup
page first right but if they have used
our app before we don't want them to
take in to the signup page we want to
take them to the products page they can
directly see the products and you know
buy or whatever so how do we tell
whether the user has used our app or not
well we're storing a JWT token and a
sink storage so we need to check that
but JWT tokens expire and they could be
invalid so what we need to do is we need
to check a JWT token and if it's valid
we're going to take the user to the page
to the products page and then we're
going to if not if it's bad or it's
expired or they just don't have one
we're gonna take them to the signup page
and then from the signup page if they
already logged in or if they're you have
an account I mean there you can log in
by clicking the login button okay so how
are we gonna do this well the first
thing is I want to do a little bit on
the back end because while we're
checking the token I thought it'd be a
pretty good idea to also refresh it so I
mentioned earlier that JWT tokens expire
and notice how this is how this is how
the user or the backend gets basically
knows if it user exists right so it
looks at the JWT token and calls us get
user ID function so what does this guy
do if you look at utils we can see this
function and this is where the backend
reads that JWT token it verifies that
that it's legit and then if
go ahead and return the user ID but
notice they'll throw an auth error or
this function will throw an error too if
it's expired or a bad token so really we
want to check this token to see or we
call this function to check whether the
token is valid and also to get the user
ID so this is called before for example
creating draft for us that's gonna be
like creating a product or getting the
products when you want to make sure
they're a good user and get the user ID
because we need to attach the user to
that so we'll be using the this function
so we want to make sure their token is
valid so we could just say the user has
to log in every seven days right you can
set a length of when the user logs in so
right now here's them signing the token
and they don't really specify a date so
I'm not sure what the default date is
but this is the library that they're
using JSON web token and we can specify
expires in so we can say how many days
it takes for the token to expire and
then we could just say every X days they
have to come and relog in but what I
like to do better is refresh it
occasionally because if the user is you
know using the app still there's no
reason to have them log in again so the
way we're gonna do it for this I've got
different ways before sometimes I just
Auto refresh but for this one what I'm
thinking is every time the user log not
logs in but opens the app we have to
check the token anyway so while we're
checking the token we might as well
refresh the token at the same time so
let's create this refresh token it's
going to be a mutation on the back end
here and wall we're refreshing we need
to have a valid token so it's gonna do
two things it's gonna check whether the
token is good and if it is and it's
gonna refresh it and what I want to do
is I want to abstract this sign function
right here just because I want to make
sure we're creating the same token in
every place and I want to make the token
expire in seven days I think a week is a
pretty good amount of time the user
hasn't used
so any utils over here I'm just going to
export so we're gonna export a function
and this is going to say sign will say
create token create token and really we
need a user from this so we're gonna
copy this and this is what we're gonna
use
and actually we don't really need a user
right we just need a user ID so we're
gonna say use your ID and that's what
we're gonna sign this with and I'm just
gonna say export Const create to open so
I'm just going to create my function
like that and I don't know if I need to
explicitly go ahead and say integer here
since we know it's gonna be an integer
and I'll actually no it's not having
integers gonna be string I forgot about
that they're real okay so we're signing
this and then I want to say expires in 7
days and you guys could change this if
you wanted to expire in a different
amount of time but that's what I want to
use so form yuto's I'm gonna get context
and also create token so now I'm just
going to call create token
passing in the user ID like that and
logon also returns a token so we're
gonna do that here all right so let's
head over to our schema first and add a
refresh token mutation so I'm gonna say
refresh token so I want to take a token
and if it's a valid one and we must get
a token so I'm going to make it that it
required we get a good token we're gonna
return an off payload from that
okay so I'll Ted back over here and
let's create this so I'm gonna say async
refresh token because I want this to be
an async function too and we can just
copy this info here okay so what are we
gonna do in this function so like I said
first thing we want to do is make sure
we have a valid token so our arguments
one of the arguments is token
so in our utils this function is called
get user ID from that so we can just
call this function really and if if it
works so
get user ID get user ID so if we call
that passing in our token so if this
doesn't throw any airs we know we're
good so we can sign our token so from
that I'm gonna return and we're gonna
return a token and actually you know
what I changed my mind instead of an off
payload let's just return a screen with
them new token because I'm not gonna
return the user with the Refresh token
I'm gonna return create token and we
need to pass them to user ID which we
get here so a user ID all right cool so
this is how our Refresh token is working
we're verifying the user is legitimate
or not the user but the token is by
checking in here with that space by
calling this function and if this
function works we're able to parse the
token correctly we got the good we got a
good ID from this and the tokens good
the secret works it hasn't expired no
errors will be thrown so on our client
side we're gonna check if this throws
any errors and if it there's any errors
we know something went wrong we got bad
otherwise we get a good token back so
this is how we're gonna refresh so I
think that's all the work we need to do
on the backend let's head over to the
front-end so I'm gonna create a new
route called will say this check
check token J's and this is gonna be the
route that we go to now so that's gonna
be our slash route and checked okay okay
so in this guy I'm going to whoops I
guess I can copy that we'll just write
it there's not that much and okay import
react from react and then for this we're
gonna have a class I can just export no
we're gonna call mutations so we're
gonna export default at the bottom up at
the top we're gonna have a class Shack
token extends react component render so
here we want to render like a loading so
I could just say like text loading dot
dot dot or you could just display a
blank screen or some kind of indicator
oops
and we're gonna display that while we
make our call to the backend so here
we're going to import graph QL from
react Apollo and we're also going to
import gql from graph QL tag
and then we're gonna have component
didnäôt oops not catch this is we're
gonna make our call to the mutation here
we're gonna say graph QL pass in our
check token and then here we're gonna
say Const refresh token and this will be
a mutation and then we're gonna go grab
the stuff that we need to put there in a
second
refresh token and make sure we import
text from react native all right so I'm
gonna head over to localhost 4000 that's
where our servers running and we can
type out our query so let's make sure we
see it's a refresh token perfect so
mutation I'm gonna pass in a token to
this which is gonna be a string and
we're going to call our refresh token
make it pretty
copy paste it alright so notice how this
function is working so it's gonna render
a loading screen at first and then this
is going to be an async function here a
sink
and this acing function is gonna call
the mutation so we're gonna say this
stock drops
mutate and we need to pass in our
variable so variables and in this case
our variable is token and where do we
get the token from a sink storage a sink
storage so here we could say a weight a
sink storage dot and get item and here
we can get our item and that's we're
gonna pass in as a variable and remember
how this is asynchronous so that's why
I'm awaiting and then when this mutation
ends we're gonna say coughs response and
we can just console dot log the response
for now and see if we get a string back
and here we need to specify that the
what's it called the key and if we head
over to login we can see what our key
was this guy and it's a good idea with
these sort of things because this is
constant to just make a constants dot J
s and here I'm just going to export
Const you can just call this token key
and I'm gonna copy him and then we're
just gonna use this variable and it
doesn't like it doesn't like it cuz we
only have one thing in here and we're
exporting Kant's but we're gonna just
leave it there for now because we might
add more constant things later so now
here what I want to do is I want to use
token key and Visual Studio code was
nice and auto import it for me now
remember we're also using this on the
NOC products with the sign up page so
you want to do the same thing here and
use token key and again it imported
automatically from constants for me and
we're gonna do the same thing here so
token key that's the item we want to
grab so this should be the token that's
stored in a sink storage now let's
double check oh I always do this
gql should come directly from graph QL
tag I think that we're good to go now we
see loading cannot reap rocker you get
of undefined let's just take a look at
what's happening here we're getting a
graph QL air let's see on our server if
we get any logs cannot we properly get
it undefined all right so this looks
like a problem with our server so let's
hop back over to our utils and it says
object get user ID utils line ten all
right so that's this so it was not able
to get the authorization ah I forgot
about this so we're actually not sending
the token honor request like as expected
so here get user ID is expecting the
token to be sent in the header which
we're not doing we're actually passing
the token and
a variable right here we'll go over how
to send it in the header in a different
video but since for this one we're
already sending this I'm just going to
say context and then we can set an
optional guy here which will just be
token so right here I'm going to say and
he adds bear in front so we'll say if
token then we're gonna skip this
otherwise so this is authorization I'm
thinking about the best way to do this
so we don't do this twice I think I'll
set authorization here let's say what
JWT will say what it's create let's move
the token up here so we're gonna say let
token and here I'll say JWT token and by
default the token is going to be just an
empty string so if we are given a JWT
token then we're gonna say token is
equal to JWT token otherwise we're
grabbing it from the header so to grab
it from the header this is what we're
gonna do and we're gonna say token is
equal to that so now we're going to
check if token
okay this looks good so sorry guys I was
just like thinking what the best way to
do this so we don't repeat code so
here's how I'm doing it so we're either
gonna get the token from the context or
from the second variable here so first
I'm checking if this variable is given
to me which is just the token and if it
is we're good because I have been given
the token otherwise we're gonna read the
header this is or gonna do for all other
requests that we send because you don't
want to be adding over here like for
example in publish I don't want to add
pass in my token right for every single
one because that gets cumbersome so back
over to utils so now we're checking
otherwise we'll go ahead and check the
headers and if we have a token from one
of these two will verify it now we just
need to make sure to call this correctly
too so get user ID we're gonna pass in
context and our token perfect and let's
okay that restarted it was no problem
let's go ahead and restart our app now
and recall that all right it doesn't
look like there's any problem and we get
a promise back it looks like I just
forgot to call I'll wait on it
and I did so let's call oh wait
and won't that refresh we'll make
another call so data refresh token we
have our string perfect so let's wrap
this in a try-catch try oops
catch so if we get an error we know
something went wrong that our tokens bad
or something so what we're going to do
and we can actually do it we should
really do a check up here say choken is
equal to this if not token then we're
just going to return from this function
and we're gonna say this stop drops got
history dot push and we're gonna go to
slash sign up right so if we didn't get
a token from a sink storage there's no
point even doing the mutation at all so
we'll go ahead and just push to sign up
otherwise we know a token exists so
we're gonna try to check the token and
see if it's good so go ahead and do this
try call and I'm gonna say response up
here
and in our catch again we know the token
has expired or something so let's go
ahead and push the sign up and I'm gonna
return at the bottom here because I'm
gonna put some code down here otherwise
if we made it this far in the function
we know we got a good response so we can
get refresh token which is gonna be
response dot data and we can say a wait
a sink storage because we want to set
the new token so set item token key and
set that string that we just got refresh
token all right and then we're gonna
push on to the products page so products
so now this should take us to the
products page we see the word hello
which I don't know if that's the
products page I don't know what we have
on there yep it says hello I'll just say
this is the products page and add a
style on this so it's easier to see
margin-top house just say 50 all right
so you saw it like kind of for a second
there say loading and then we moved to
this page so it does indeed validate our
token okay I want to do one last thing
to demonstrate that this does work so
the top here I'm actually just going to
clear my token so a weight set item
token key is equal to an empty string so
this is me basically resetting it so the
reason why I'm doing this is to make
sure we do indeed go to the create page
so perfect we can delete that and now it
cool each time so if I log in ball that
ball
I think it's Bob to at Bob calm
we're now gonna add the token back to a
sink storage and I think okay that just
took a little bit to load so here we go
this is the products page I'm gonna
refresh and it should read the token yep
read the token from a sink storage and
correctly went here so nice so now we
have this intermediate page called check
token that will redirect us to the
correct page whether we're logged in or
not and additionally it refreshes the
token that way the user can continue
using the app and not have to rely again
after a week but if the user doesn't use
their app for a whole week then they
will have to log back in because their
tokens gonna be expired and we catch
that with this little catch right here
all right that's it for this video guys
and the next one we'll start working on
that products page see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
