detour today and upgrading our Apollo
client it just went from version one to
version two and quite a bit changed so
they made this nice migration guide that
we're going to go through and just get
our application up to date we don't need
to change anything on the server but
just on the react to the client side
now before we start on this I want to
talk about the server real quick so we
recently added this all teams query
where we're doing is we're grabbing all
the teams that the user is a part of but
right now a user can't really be a part
of any other team except the ones they
create because we haven't implemented
that part yet so right now I have the
owner or I'm basically finding all the
teams that you're an owner of here
that's why I'm saying you know owner is
equal to user ID where user ID is
wherever you're logged in on and we just
need to add this where clause here
before was actually selecting all the
teams that exist with this where we will
grab only the teams but the user is part
of well not part of that they own I had
forgotten to add this where so before
what would do is it grab all the teams
but ideally we're gonna change this
query later when we actually have teams
that you can join and this will be like
what to do will be change this query up
so we might have to create multiple
tables to find all the teams that you
can see but until then this is what
we're gonna keep it as and now on the
client side when you do that you might
get an error that looks like this so
here I have view team and I get this
nice little air that says cannot find a
property read undefined so this is
because we have hard-coded the team ID
let me show you so I'm just gonna
console dot log all teams so it's saying
that we're not getting a team basically
so you would think maybe this user
doesn't have a team if we scroll to the
top we can see they have teams the only
things the ID is seven and the ID is
nine and we're passing in trying to find
index where the current ID is passed in
and we're hard coding this
from our view team here we're passing in
a 1 so we can't find any IDs of one
because we can see the ID here is 7 and
9 so if you're getting that air it's
because we just have it hard-coded we're
gonna be fixing that in a video to come
but if I change this to 7 this user has
a team of 7 it should render okay for us
and it didn't console that log all teams
and I'm just gonna print out all teams
team ID X team and then also the current
team ID and we can look at all these
values and see why it's not working and
ok as soon as I add that it does start
working so we can see this guy has two
teams here I don't get any errors with
channels some users we're getting errors
with that I'm not sure what that's about
but here we go
console dot log we can get rid of now
and this is all good okay so let's now
talk about upgrading our client so I'm
gonna come over here to index and here
right now we're basically have one
package called react Apollo and what
we're about to do is add a crapload of
packages from all over the place so we
had one package before now we're gonna
be using at least five I think we might
be using six at the end so I'm gonna
copy this basically what they're doing
is just saying this is what it looks
like before this is what it looks like
now so instead of doing react Apollo
we're gonna paste in all these things
and now we have to install five more
libraries so Apollo client so yarn at
Apollo client
and Paulo link EGP Apollo cache and
memory graphical tag and a react Apollo
so once we have those we don't need
graph QL right here and we don't need
gql right here but here's the thing we
need it other places so I'm gonna copy
that and I'm gonna do a find and replace
in my files so how you're doing it
before and this is super small font so I
apologize for that
but we want to basically replace this so
react Apollo and oh do I not have this I
should have this somewhere oh because
I'm also importing other things graph QL
so we need to like break up this
statement here import gql tomograph ql
into two like this because now gql it
doesn't come from this package it comes
from a different one so luckily I have a
small package so I could just do
manually which I think will be easier
than doing a finder replace so I'm gonna
actually just get rid of this I'm gonna
search for gql this is coming from graph
QL tag now so here we go copy and you
know what I'm gonna create a little
macro and then to do this for me I think
so let me finish this one graph QL tag
and then we'll have it populate through
okay we got that one good this one we
had at least three more so to create a
macro so I'm gonna pop over here delete
that delete that out of space come down
here import gql from graph QL tag come
to end here cool and now our next one is
over here and here's our last one
alright so we've replaced all our graph
QL tags cancel alright so now we
actually have to change how we're
creating this network interface and
creating our little client here they
also got rid of Redux oh I forgot to
mention we need to also do yarn add
graph QL so they also got rid of graph
QL or not graph fuel Redux for their
provider which is kind of interesting
because not everyone wants to add Redux
to their project so I'll talk back over
here and see how they I recommend doing
this now so before this is what we have
when we're now creating a link like this
paste this guy over here so we're gonna
create a client by I'm gonna create the
link up here cuz I know we're about to
do some stuff
because we have middleware and this
creation link is coming from this
package up here and I'm gonna close this
guy and we can get rid of what we need
to keep it where you need to change our
URI so it matches okay so that's how we
create our client we need to feed the
link in here but we're gonna do that in
a second and then our client instead of
creating it here we can get rid of that
we pass it into a palo provider just
like that so that stays the same
and then down here we can see how we do
middleware which is exactly what we're
gonna do
middleware and after we're so i'm gonna
copy this guy so our middleware here we
need to set context which again comes
from another package so they really
spread out all their things so if I come
over here I could say yarn add what was
it Apollo link context okay
Apollo link context and then for headers
here I'm gonna copy what I have here
and we just need to have a property and
these can be commas now area
okay so we're saying the X token and the
X refresh token property for the headers
here so instead now we're doing this
middleware link and we're setting a
context which is really just a function
and then we're returning an object with
headers and then we have to basically
can cat this guy with this link thing we
created up here and I'm gonna move my
clients down below so now you see why
I'd have the link like that you're
connect concatenating both these
together and then we're passing link
there okay so now we just have to do our
after where I'm gonna get rid of my
Mueller now and here's our after where
so here's one way to do after where this
is if you want to catch errors that
happen we're not really caring about
errors so we're gonna copy this example
here and again this is a new new one we
have an added I believe Apollo link yep
we have not had an Apollo link yet so
yarn add Apollo link and we're gonna
paste this guy in here
this is gonna be our after we're and
let's import them
I think it was yeah we'll copy that you
guys so here I'm gonna say after we're
link and here it takes an opera
operation and forward we are not going
to do it like this so I'm gonna get rid
of that
that's if we want to actually change how
the response but we don't care about
that
so we're gonna put our logic here that
we have here and then we're also just
gonna say after we're link dot can cat
so we connect all these guys together
and copy this paste and kill this stuff
so here where do we get this headers
object from you may be wondering well
there's this ops operation thing that
has a git context and then from that we
can get the headers is equal to
operation get context so this passes
back a object which has the headers in
it and then there we can do headers dot
get but now headers can actually be
undefined so we just say if headers and
then we'll look at it
and at the very end just so we go to the
next step we say return forward
operation give that a save and I believe
that's all the things that we needed to
change so let's just walk through this
real quick everything we did so we add a
ton of different libraries at the top
all different packages from Apollo and
the reason why they went with this
approach is because you can swap any of
these out for different styles or just
you know if you want to customize them
in any way so we're creating a link an
HTTP link this will change I believe if
we want to do WebSockets or stuff when
we do subscriptions later and we're
pointing it at our graph QL endpoint
here then we're creating two
things middleware and after where our
middleware will run before this every
graphic you'll request after we're
running after every request and then the
same thing we're passing tokens before
and then here we're grabbing tokens from
the header grabbing them and setting
them to refresh automatically and then
here we're concatenating together so
it's like a little pipeline that we're
building that's gonna get run and then
we're passing this to our client and now
you can have different types of caches
so we're using the end memory one which
is their default one I believe and
creating the client passing it to a Palo
provider now we just did a lot of
changes let's see if we're getting any
errors on our server and we're not
that's good I'm really surprised okay
yeah this is what I thought what pack
and port module default is not a
function I thought we got some type of
error so well that was the other thing
we changes changed all where we're
getting this gql from graphic ul tag now
so I think it was what query broke all
users query so our all users I believe
is on our home route and I don't know
why this is breaking I'm just gonna
restart it cuz I don't see any error
here oops so it's gonna restart and we
can see what's wrong right off the bat
I'm not seeing anything oh I see that
needs to be wrapped and like that oh I
think I did that wrong for a couple um
let's see where I am importing react
Paul oh yeah it's supposed to be still
like that
where you put curly braces around graph
QL my mistake
so let's add that back in and we should
be should be good after this I think
cool so everything seems to load okay
I'm just gonna try like a log in and
make sure our mutations and stuff work
in our middleware oh we don't have a
home component okay so our all users
query still works I'm gonna grab that
user and log in I'm actually logged in
as the Bob 16 that looked like it worked
okay view team we have a let's create a
new team BC so you it oops and we see a
new team there so perfect so everything
seems like it is working we made quite a
few changes let me know if you had any
trouble upgrading this I'd be happy to
help you out and this code I will push
up to github so you can check it out and
see all the changes we made and notice
we had no changes made to the back-end
at all at least with Apollo and graphic
ability if this work sells pretty nice
so those are for this video guys and we
will continue where we left off with our
project in the next video so thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
