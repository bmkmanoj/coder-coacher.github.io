video we're going to be adding some
buttons to help filter our auctions so
right now we just have like just a long
list of auctions I'd like to see like
only open auction or any only finished
auctions there's some times I'd like to
see both so we're going to create like a
little button at the top here to do that
and what I'm thinking for that is create
a little segment that looks like this so
after we ran do so I'm going to grab
this segment here and we're going to be
working on not the options form you can
close that down you can come on over
here too
alright so import segment I'm going to
add a segment at the top of our content
not at the top of our content actually
because we don't want it to move all
right
the button here do not button imported
hope we do not so button this list is
getting pretty long eventually rap
should put it to different line and ran
over alright so let's just see if that
does render and it looks nice alright
does render looks decent okay so now we
basically now just need to a third
button so this is not first or last it's
just a middle one see if that works
awesome middle looks nice
so this will be I guess open so be both
so be complete and the first one should
be active when we first come in here so
when i refresh this all right so we
should just see it open and now we want
to do this is actually add it to our
state and set some on click stuff so
let's move this down so it's a little
easier to work with
okay drop you down to okay so we have
our three buttons and each button and
have an on click and yes this will be
this dot and change so we need to think
about how I want to name a naming schema
for this I guess we'll say Change button
psych
now the bad name so right now it's open
both complete so what what is this
trying to say I'm trying to think of a
name so when I click on open it should
update the state and pass it open I
guess we'll just say state and not state
a change active segment okay and then
for this one it'll be open so this stop
props so this is a function we need to
create change active state so copy you
and each button should be this okay and
you too
so here should be both open should be
complete so now you can create the grant
creating module for this we can use copy
actions it's going to be semi similar
rename this now I'm going to call this a
guest segment
we're going to delete all of these guys
only need one right now change active
segment change back to segment okay so
that's our action we're not going to
have an API not going to have sagas for
this this is just a reducer it's going
to be a change back to segment can get
rid of all that junk do we do that and
yeah we can copy this because this is
more of what our reducers going to look
like we don't need to combine action we
just need to handle action
we don't need moment you know oh okay
and this we're going to call segment and
I'll just is actually right and the
default will be open all right so we're
listening for change active segment
whenever this action is called we want
to handle it and when to handle it what
we're going to do is we're just going to
check the value that's passed in here
and let's unload you and we're just
going to pass that and make up the state
so if they pass in close closely the
value the default will be open that's
too much all there is for a reducer so
stab down here so we need to add this to
a root reduce here segment
segment and then now we can pull this
and get its value state dot segment and
now define what the active one is we say
act is equal to this stop props up
segment segment is equal to open and
we're going to do that for each one it's
good to have just the boolean values
like that at the end this is listening
for both this is listening for complete
and the reason why we're putting this in
Redux store not just doing like a local
state is because we want to basically
just messed up the naming here that's
just to be Ariel so yeah I was saying is
the reason we're using we're actually
grabbing this from redux and the reason
why we're doing this instead of oh we're
getting in there that's great but the
reason why we're doing this and so doing
it locally is because we want this to be
persisted as we change pages so when it
comes back you have what you had before
and also actually that's about it
I just mainly want to persist what the
value of it is between page changes
otherwise we do locally and just do a
state for this
okay so let's find out what this problem
is so
how's our reducer looking this looks
good casing I don't know we'll go to it
folks we have something here casing of
does not match the underlying file
system I just changed it though I
changed it to so I'm going to go to
terminal real quick and see if it is
what it says so I'm just going to tree
source I can see modules segments like I
just need to refresh that you'll need
signals good there ok cool that looks
good now and as always the air here is
super unhelpful with the problem
looks like I'm guessing it has to do
with this like to stop props up segment
change active segments that's the name
maybe that's wrong what I call it up and
that's the problem we're not actually
getting change active segment it looks
like it's probably the problem import
change active segment I just forgot to
grab the action this is Rome segment
punished actions cool
so if that was the only air and it looks
like it's not we're loading
it looks like there's a problem with our
choir author required so request off the
Kutuzov's let's do a console let's see
what happens when we call off here
oh we're her - you're consoling the
response yeah what happened to meet you
there
begin the user I think it just doesn't
like our I don't think they actually the
problem is that because we're good there
I think the problems with our buttons
for example if I kill the buttons I
don't know put some text hi this is
problem with a button get problems with
their buttons so let's fix your buttons
so let's go down to one button and let's
just keep like I was talking to you guys
earlier I like to just keep simplifying
it until we get what the problem is all
right so if I remove the on click will
you work yeah you will okay so the
problem is with the on click up on press
making that part of that mistake too
many times now oops that's not the only
problem on press of type objects applied
to button oh man
theory oh I was just being silly
like that and let's make the spacing
uniform here
so the drop-down
okay see how that looks
all right and that's better so now we
actually want the functionality and to
sort this we're going to use glow - whoa
- is a JavaScript library that makes it
just really nice give you a lot of extra
features features functions that make
doing things easy so the one particular
we're going to be using is for pi and as
you can see what it does here is it
takes an array of objects because we
have an array of options and you can
sort by one attributes so for example
user or mage that's what this is doing
right here so you can see Barney Barney
Fred Fred and you can notice how it does
it um actually sorry we're not using
sort we need to filter uh-huh sorry Oh
same same thing you can filter by we're
going to see how they're doing filter by
active we're going to filter by what's
it called what's our property open and
complete yeah except it's not open and
complete we're just checking if the
expiration date is complete not the
expiration date what's it called time
left the time left is done that we're
not showing it all right with that said
let's go ahead do it so it'll make more
sense when you see it if I probably
explain that well so we need to add lo -
so you are an ADD lo - we'll do that for
us at the top here we can import from lo
- you could do the name lo - here but
most people do an underscore like that
and I like that as well so we're going
to come down here to our auctions and
just before we map it we're going to
filter this filter by nope it's
straight-up filter we're filtering
auctions
we're filtering time left and we're
looking for just to show you how this
works we'll hard-code the values so
complete so notice how they're all
complete and can we do not complete okay
we're going to do like that who can we
make a function okay so we're going to
have to do in its statement here so so
if this stop props dot segment is equal
to complete then that's what we'd like
to show and we're just going to do this
three times and then for complete what
else was there open both so if there's
both we actually don't need to do any
filtering we just map and then for this
one we're going to say auction auction
is not equal oxygen at time left it's
not equal to complete and I'll guess all
the open ones alright so these are our
three ones when the segment is complete
what we're going to show is all the
complete ones so we're doing filter or
grab looking at the attribute time left
and getting all the ones that are
complete
we're going to if it's open we're going
to filter in the function we do the
check is if it's not equal to complete
and then if it's both we don't even have
to do any type of filtering we just go
ahead and do it how are you doing before
alright so now it's open we don't we
only see three and we don't see any
closed like come on and a complete over
here I see all these complete ones and
if I do both I see everything okay so we
have this nice little segment now that's
it for this video and the next one what
we're going to do is we're going to do
some sorting so now I can maybe see the
like they're like the soonest like this
is going to expire before this one I
like to see this at the top so I'd like
to see the expiration dates they're
ticking down about to finish and vice
versa so that's what we doing next and
I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
