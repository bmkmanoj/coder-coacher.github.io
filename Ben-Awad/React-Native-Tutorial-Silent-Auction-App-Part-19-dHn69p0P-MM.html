click on this button here nothing
happens so let's fix that so we want to
create a new page at it goes to and
click on that so I'm going to go to the
index file of the rails folder and we're
going to create a new route here or a
new scene as it's called so I'm just
going to copy that this will be a call
to action form and this will be a new
complaint that we will create action
form option upon and actually as it
should be a case and this will be called
auction form and this does require off
so we can say off required all right and
I'm guessing this just because it
doesn't exist
yep so now we can it's going to be a lot
like a log in here so we can copy that
paste and we can rename that to auction
one and then here you don't need
anything there right now something
anything there keep this clean for now
and as far as this goes
we'll just render right now let's come
back here you can close that there might
be some errors in this rendering if it
is a time we can change that in a second
what I want to do is just actually get
this button working so to actually
change scenes we're going to create an
on click here and when it's clicked we
want transitions
scenes into transition-- scenes we use
the because actions and that is from
react native router folks and then we do
actions and then we do the actually like
to go to is it seem going to go to and
that's going to be auction form and we
just call that function and we get past
blinken alright let's see if it'll take
us to a new page okay so that and
nothing happened
see if our a log says anything nope oh I
think I use the right syntax we did
module sagas wrong one of your songs so
here we hit actions here and then we did
actions dot just like that
so auction form auction form should
match the name we used here which it
does let's go I'm guessing this is on
press so if I come back over here click
on saw button hope yep it's on press not
on click on press ok looks good close
that on click is for doing web stuff
alright cool so when I click that you
know it transitions to this and I think
a transition to the right because we use
this I do you left does that change it
nope always transitions to the right so
I don't know what that direction does
we'll leave that for now well let's
check real quick actually because I'm
kind of curious direction of the button
that pop-ups Oh
so we don't have to even worry about
that all right okay so now this is where
page looks like so now we want to change
this form for an auction so for an
auction we have three fields the name of
action the starting price and when we'd
like it to expire so if I come down at
the bottom here I can create one more
field this will be name this will be
price call it local price here but it'd
still be called starting price in our
price placeholder and then here the
field will be a name price and would be
a good last one here what's Oh for now
you know what for now I'm not going to
do this class there because expiration
date we really want to add a time picker
really a field like this so we'll do
that one later because it's a little bit
more complex so here this won't be
called login this will be called create
option let's login auction create
auction all this looks fine just going
off to import that can help back to the
bottom here so request login will
eventually do a request create auction
so basically this is the same code that
we're pretty much reusing a lot of the
code that we use for the login page copy
and pasted Oh what what text do want for
the button so that'd be decent and then
for validation we no longer have an
email so change email to name can change
password to price and that's pretty much
how we want to do it and we just want to
say yeah it looks actually really good
here it doesn't like this content up to
succeed xanax link that time everything
else looks good request login now it'll
be request create auction and we'll go
ahead and do that and we pass in the
price and name we would also really want
to pass in the time as well but that's
something we'll do later so
Oh Khan that okay so now we see the name
see the starting price so now what I
want to do is I really just want to
console.log Christ console.log name and
also the type third type know if there's
not an input type so what I'd like for
price is I'd like to restrict them to
see right now I can type anything I'd
really like to restrict it to just
numbers so react native input there
should be a way to restrict them to just
numbers keyboard type and what we really
would like is decimal pad because we can
do numeric types so zero type and
keyboard type equals people type so then
down here through this field I can say
keyboard type equal to decimal pad and
now
what so now I'm typing here nothing
really changes I guess because Felicity
types this I guess on a phone where it
brings up the pad it would just let you
do numbers I guess I'll leave that for
now we want to validate it they only are
using numbers though for the starting
price so oops so I'm thinking it didn't
it's not doing anything now because I
think this is the keyboard type is when
they bring up their actual actually on
the phone a keyboard I just want to see
if there's anything else that has like
just numeric return key type placeholder
value okay
so there's only there's anything else so
then what we'll do right here is we'll
just say so if price is empty say is not
a number we'll say I expected number and
what what doesn't it like up there and
we had a space there now if i refresh
that come over here so a good one would
be a solid jar for 12 and it we were
able to submit that okay but for example
if I believe this per link gives me an
error if I type a letter gives me there
and notice how for whatever reason this
button I doesn't submit right away takes
two two clicks to submit I don't know
why that is
I think
because a keyboard pops up when I start
typing like this and then when I click
here it closes the keyboard then I click
again it actually submits it because the
keyboard is closed
that's something I need to look into to
figure out why it's doing that but okay
so now we have our two fields that are
these fields are good now that's it for
this video and then then the next one
will actually add a time picker here
that way you can select your time and
then we'll format all nicely so yup see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
