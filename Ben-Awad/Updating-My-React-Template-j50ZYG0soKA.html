be a chill video i have this react
template that i've been using for
basically starting react application to
have some of the boilerplate done
already and i'm just going to be
updating it and show you guys how i'm
updating it so we're going to first just
get clone this and i'm just going to
rename it react Redux saga template
because it's really a set up with Redux
Olga and I'm going to leave this one
here cuz has some older stuff but it
kind of has changed how I like to
architect my react applications now so I
want to update this and reflect how I'd
like to do it now but before I actually
don't need that react your ducks are a
template okay let's actually just open
that up so reducers sort of before I
actually start making the new one I
actually want to just update this actual
one this template for the new redox agra
features so take every is now from there
and you no longer have to yield star I
just open this up and do npm start now
should start without an heir
so this template was getting an error
before we act on oh and I just forgot to
download the stuff i love using yarn so
i'll download all the libraries real
quick and then after we get back going
to get status it at all just come in i'm
basically assuming it's going to work
update saga syntax git push origin
master and now we can do npm start and
hopefully this does work and if it
starts working i want to leave this
version up if it's now working and after
that start the new version up and it
does not work take every is not a
function so see what what doesn't it
like uncut something route take every is
not function call something which is a
function to cram this looks fine to me
Oh at something saw yes something wrong
it doesn't like this because I actually
want the star here and they get one at
the star anymore yeah okay the star is
not what's causing the air call
something is super weird take every is
not a function take every hunt see I'm
literally seeing it right here from
Redux saga they're going to make exact
same thing helps with Google there
you know when you go to a github su page
it's not going to be easy to debug / is
going to be more annoying than needs to
be
um I just need to be on remove get up
saga yarn add redux saga began just need
a install reinstall nope I just removed
an ad ads same version and you can see
that right here singing meows version
off actually no this might be the
version for yarn okay let's see why not
I could have six something for whatever
reason it's not recognizing take poops
take every action as a function the only
reason I can think of that is because I
have an old yarn version not yarn
version um look saga it now we're
getting a new air take every helper
uncut argument is not valid or a valued
pattern
huh there we go now we are working so
now i can get status get at all and I
could turn off I use turn port are you
turn I think it's called for some auto
completion and your JavaScript and
always creates a little dot turn port
file which literally just has the turn
port or the port to where it's running
so we're updating Buick saga version and
now our template should be good to go so
now I'm just going to kill it and get an
it a new project and then get at all git
status it commits exchange the readme I
react template when I point to you 3x
saga area git commit an issue initial
commit and we'll set up a new repo react
Redux saga template and i'll put the
link to this in the description if you
want to check it out push the initial
one up and don't need you anymore and
now we can start to change the
architecture of this so I'm just going
to NPM start while I'm working on this
oops okay so things I want to change
first index so I like to have now I
liked and put my routes in a different
place in my index so I want to set up is
a route folder and then my route folder
I have index ijs and what is that ok and
then I'm basically just going to have a
function here so import react from react
and we're going to explore default and
then we're just going to pass our router
in here
so past that guy here and now we don't
need these anymore you can put them here
and history you don't need to import
here anymore provider so this is
basically the dumbed down version so
we're importing stores support route um
lot / routes wow so that way i can have
different routes and that looks good and
this should really be called app so
that's kind of my index to be and now
over here in my router i want to
basically have a different set up so
just delete that so now that's how i
have this map to dispatch thing and
basically i'm wrapping everything in
this main I don't want to do that
anymore I want to create a folder / so
home I'm going to be moving this guy
instead of being in components we're
going to be in route home we call this
view and I'm going to have an index is
in there and I'm going to move app and
now i'm going to call it index looks
three do that
I'm just going to do it like this I want
to copy all my stuff from app into index
I want to simplify this a little bit
export default derivative this now I
don't need there's no need for this
components folder at all so get rid of
that so now what we have is we don't
need to do this we're going to get our
view from this is our home view which
we're going to access from index so
you're going to found them just
individually wrapping each component
like this so we can get the state and
also dispatch actions and now we're
going to have local actions so instead
of having a global one we're going to
have actions for every component and
right now the actions is empty so I like
to just comment it out and put an empty
object and I can always come back and
add that easily later so actions such as
I'll just a temp file export conch now
I'm you're going to put stuff in here
i'll leave it empty for now so this is
what one view would look like so I have
my view I have my action tab my index
and every route every page is going to
have those so now I don't need a nap we
don't need a base component right now
and that looks pretty good our saugus
should be set up nicely now as I turn
off the server I thought I had
oh you know what a home is now in the
same folder eyes index so we can delete
that so view views not define main is
not defined whereas main coming from
this isn't home index 0 2 decks my thing
doesn't look like that sources home /
index main is not that oh uh huh now
we're importing the view and that should
take care of both those warnings in one
you provide a history object oh and now
we're out here we need to let's do a
stack it like this import what I call it
history from you up a folder and it's in
our store so i'll refresh that cool and
having sagas I here is fine and the rest
of it I think it's fine and wen ting a
pine limp this as a second sagas routes
producers actions now we can create the
set or delete this actions because we're
not kind of global actions folder so now
anytime I want to make a route I just
could basically copy this home folder
and I put it um create this another
route and I have each local locally i
have an index or a mapping the dispatch
okay so this is basically the new
architecture that I like to use or have
each home as a page and this looks good
I think there's going to be stopped I
think I'm going to stop here for the my
first iteration of it we might come back
later and add some one on top so get at
all gets sent likes make sure git commit
I would like you to get status before
and make sure i'm adding the right files
I'm just called v1 and now let's mpm run
went six so just fix some stuff state is
defined but never used component should
be written as a pure function okay just
two problems that it's not bad get to
let's see what it changed throughout
home oh I don't even have to do that I
just do get that it'll show me oh I when
I commented it just added another space
that's not even worth committing okay so
nothing really changed with a lint so
I'm gonna just leave it as this this
looks good get push origin master so
this template this new template is now
set up and this is what I'm going to
start using for it some stirring up new
redox saga projects that I've been
really enjoying lately is um are XJS and
doing redux observable this 1 i've been
using i set this one up a while ago
instead of using redox agra uses epics
you can see pretty nice so that's
another template I've been using lately
that really enjoy i've been i've been
using redux saga as much i can using
this library and we start making some
more videos with this cuz i really like
this one and
has a super cool logo too but I think
that's it for now thank you guys for
watching yeah just chill video set up
the template it's all I really wanted to
do so i'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
