done with the project now we are just
lending this um so this is an
unnecessary video to watch but if you
want to I'm just going to come over here
to the console and you can see how I get
rid of all these red lines and all these
problems that ye Esalen thinks it has so
we're just going to do npm run lint fix
and i'm just going to close Visual
Studio code and then I'll reopen it
after this Linton this is going to
change a bunch of files okay just reopen
that move it over here alright so you'll
notice we have a hundred and eighty four
problems that is a ton so a lot of them
have to do the prop types so I'm just
going to like start I hope we couldn't
find please ensure that NPM is installed
good not installed typing for JavaScript
language feature okay this is something
I'll deal with later so yeah I'm just
going to go file through file and fix
the problems okay so first one is here
line exceeds and we are missing prop
types so here is what's going on with
those prop types that it keeps telling
me about so I actually need to install
something now we need to install this
prop types library and what that does is
we can then set the prop types of we're
basically saying our component uses
these props and we expect those props to
be there so that's what we're doing and
so we can install this guy and get to
that oops it and copy there we go so
yarn add oops OH
prov types so then here I can do import
prop types from prop types and then
actually can I do prop types for a pure
function let's see so I've only ever
seen prop types for actually a class
like this
CLU are they're actually not sure if you
can do prop types for pure function so
prop types pure function yeah let's see
what Stack Overflow says okay so I just
give it a name and then I do prop types
like usual cool so so comps navbar X for
default now bar and here I'll do nav bar
crop types and we are expecting a user
which is going to be prop x thoughts
string so basically we're just saying
the type of the prop that we're
expecting and then whether it's required
or not basically all these things we're
getting from history we expect to be
passed to nav bar yeah we do from the
props so that one is required but then
user and requests we're getting from
redux which we don't require so here
we'll do user request logout is a
function so prop types funk and then
history is a prop type
object aired out as an object with the
shape so history is an object and we
expect we're going to be using in this
object is the push function so we can
say we expect a push attribute and
prompt x stock func there alright and
that get through that complaining and
then oops let's just move this down to
another line I'm not in love with the
way that this is styled with does
another horrible I think actually I want
the question mark here : here makes more
sense to me okay alright so now we have
no es limb problems on this component so
now I can go to off alright app we don't
need now we can import prop types from
prop types and that will be for the
often decayed component so I guess I can
just put it here seems fine so
authenticate you can point out prompt
types and it's lower case a poops I
think it is yup like this prop types and
where the props are expecting
also oops I totally lied about navbar I
don't know why I did that this is not
users not a string it is a function as
an object and I think it's going to
complain because object of type
forbidden yeah once is they do give the
shape own also basically this component
will not work without history so what we
can do is we do is required whereas
these are not required because we're not
actually passing them when we create the
component it's coming from redux
anyway our user here I'm going to
actually don't know what the user has so
if this renders cool it does I can
actually see what all the things we
expect a user to have hope I'll not see
the user here even though he's right
here let's go to this page oh I'm
getting in the nav bar uh-huh should you
go to the nav bar then so a router
container UI this route now our user
oh.just ID and email ID which is a prop
type dot string and of the other one
email prompt type string okay now we can
actually copy that
we can use that for off
Popie is not required but has no default
prop declaration so we also need to do
default values if we're getting them
from redux
even though Redux provides default
values and forget what the name they use
for it
default props default props and then
here you just say user it's an empty
object and it stops complaining we're
getting requests off class off which is
a prob type dot func and then we're
expecting occasion and a path name so
location which is prop type shape so
we're expecting an object it has a path
name which is a prop type dot string and
this is required and location I guess
it's location required how are we
getting actually how are we getting the
location here we're rendering while
we're passing it as a prop we're passing
location of the prop so this is required
so we can only require it if we're
passing to the crop if Redux is giving
us the prop we have to set defaults
quest off on the default will be
something that returns an empty object
sure okay so and then just history again
and we can copy our same definition of
history here for all
cool so I got rid of most of the
problems in this file and we just have
bad intention here nice so we can pretty
much copy this because that's get user
is going to be very similar
so get user oh no actually this is
authenticated component so there
actually there's no user prompt that I
have to worry about and then no app here
import prop types from drop types
defined but is never used history a
browsing history there so they leave
this request and then here when wrapping
that leave up get rid of it so I using
it cool get user is good now recipe card
so import I mean most most of the
problem here is is prop types so I think
we're just gonna be adding a bunch of
prop types so a recipe card dot prompt
types and this one is easy because it
pretty much all strings prop types stop
string name prop types thought string
image URL prop type string and then
again same thing description table types
not string a no these are required to
everything is required except for prop
type because notice how we're we're
getting this from something else we're
not requiring the history prop type dot
shape push comp time funk
is required is required is required
default prop and we need a default prop
for it which is kind of silly default
props and history is equal to a function
l is an empty object that's fine okay
our SP list we're not using I so we
shouldn't pass it and then prop types
some poor Rob types from Bob types prop
types so be Const recipe list we need to
convert that to a function an export
default SP list
and my thing is recipes here which I
believe is an array okay so this is this
is kind of funny so we're going to do
recipes this is a prop type array so but
notice how and this is that is required
notice how it doesn't like it right and
well let's see what this is problem
absolute so notice how it doesn't like
it here and the reason was is just as
it's forbidden it doesn't like using it
like this what it want to see you
instead is array of and then we put the
type up what's the type of a recipe well
it's an object so we do prop type dot
shape and here we basically just do our
whole definition of Cardigan so we copy
those like that and now we're good
alright so those are all done now let's
go to actions actions good API wants us
to remove console logs since
everything's working we can remove them
producers good risk PID unexpected
underscore so for this one that's just
like what it's called so we just want to
disable the next line I believe it's
useless disabled no it's I think it's
disabled next line or something we look
up how you excellent disabled next line
because we basically just want to ignore
that eeeh Slynt because we don't need it
line fine
excellent disabled wine just limp
disabled next line insolent
disabled and
slide okay because we're happy with that
all right cool
yeah let's close these tabs your
reducers that's good
users good clothes you get rid of these
consoles save reducers okay um here
because I might want to expand this at
some time and add more than just a user
I'm just going to disable it is Flint
disabled next line saw goes looks like
that law console.log second I think it
was mostly console logs and prop types
for the heirs and then our index here
index is good
you can close modules good here file
reader which is not defined so what we
can do is when Gonia Slynt here and can
add it here file reader so now in our
address preview that doesn't cause a
problem and looks like we just need to
add props we have two props on the
history in this guy right there so is
the name of this class this is address P
so import prop types from prop types
so address P dot prop types and the
first one is history which we did before
so we need to do this again just copy it
so history's require all this history is
not required because it's like Pat no it
is it's required because it is being
passed in and then we're basically doing
a function like that okay we can just
copy that and here is going to be a
request grade and then since it's not
required we do a recipe default props
quash create recipe so this page is done
complaining home good in that page props
recipe so import prop for all types from
prompt type so as as you can see this is
why I said if you didn't want to watch
could get a little redundant because
basically we're just going in and prop
types for all of these things now so
request recent recipes it's basically
the same thing right
so we're just going in and prop type so
this one's a funk and then recipes this
one is an array huh actually this is
going to be the exact same definition as
we use for a riskless so we can copy you
except it's not required so where was i
home
so here and not required ohm dot default
props request recent recipes so I guess
we'll just do the same thing and then
recipe is just empty ray cool so that's
good
login page and we have actually a couple
of things here
so URL search parameters at the global
thing problem so copy so now that will
go away if I save it no pre reopen it's
not defined I just added you in yes lint
it's funny that works for that but not
was it params those pram right we don't
need you login page note those params I
just copied it badly okay so we need
just the prop types again for this page
it looks like it so import prop types so
the login page and we can put that up
here for default login page crop types
lower case and history we can copy from
home
oh because you're not using a history
here we're using history here yes we are
grab that oops
oh I was head caps left on okay push so
many requests login in this location so
voice login which is a function and
location which is an object and it has a
search and this is a string not sure
unexpected comma oh yeah so I causing it
okay what is going on I don't know why I
was a cuz I okay I was just causing
multiplayers login page drop types
sorry not prop types default props
choice login and turn into the object
location maybe an empty object okay
this page looks good we just have three
more pages we're good here and this page
has a couple
so request user ID okay so okay next for
default here and for prop types from op
types and then this one it's definition
is very similar to all the other ones so
my recipes is very similar to the home
pages recipes so we can copy that we
just call it my recipes um and the user
is like the navbar
so copy you
and then request my recipes that's just
a function we've done before that's easy
to type out request my recipes
it's just prop type stuff well cool up
and doesn't like that
we'll do that we'll deal with that in a
second
I guess we want to excellent disable for
the function so just doesn't have
defaults so we'll do my are ESPYs dot
default props so request my recipes it's
going to be a function that returns an
object and then user empty object IRS P
is empty array cool and then let's look
up any a slant how you do for a function
look doesn't have know how disabled for
function I wonder if I can disable until
a point here we go disable enable so we
can do is lint disabled and then we
enable it down here because we don't
want to worry about that dangling thing
all right we are so close to done let's
copy this skip down to single index or
single recipe and come back up to sign
up because while I have this selected
because it'll be very similar not super
similar of a little bit X for default
explore default lot of top and port top
types from prop types so instead of
request recipe
I've request recipe we don't need the
user here this needs to be single recipe
we need to do matching and we need
current recipe cur recipe it's not
actually an array just the shoes it's
just actually an object has own property
do not access object prototype method
has only from tart object okay well if
to Google what that one means so and
then we just need to do that one so
excuse me so match is an object so we're
going to use this shape and then it
actually itself has the params which of
the prop types shape and then inside of
that we have this recipe ID which is
required and that's going to be a string
but we don't also put required inside
cool single or SP Oh actually match
we're actually match is actually
required single recipe dot default props
or class recipe
so the best way honestly to be doing
this is to be linting kind of all you're
doing the project so going back and
lifting a whole project like this is not
the best way to do it I don't recommend
doing that so remember I was talking
about IDs here that's exactly the ESL
int is saying here I'm afraid if we use
duplicate ID and let's do it oh we can
prefix it then so this will be segment o
ingredients don't have IDs though we're
going to have to prefix it with an i I
was in say because we could do both
description and ingredient do not have
they're just going to have to keep
rear-ending so we're actually to say
we're just going to ESL into sable next
line excellent disabled next line and
then to not work because that seems
really bad
and doesn't like it when I oh well just
do disable it
and then we can rename it down here so
ideally you have like a unique ID but
for these we don't so that's okay so now
let's figure out what this is do not
access object prototype method no
prototype built-ins no prototype
built-ins yes lint so if you ever don't
know a rule is if you just google it
they have nice documentation on what
they're doing so we just need to object
okay so we just need to do this in a
different manner so call recipe dot name
now we no longer have the problem it
works in the same way all right now
let's go to this guy he's has history
and export defaults here import prop
types so I should have been adding the
prop types as I was going along that
have been a lot easier but is going back
over like this is not the best off I'll
do that next time so because you know
it's mostly eslint less stuff was just
prop types so a function and history
push so that's basically just this page
yeah
copy that paste it down here it's going
to be a sign up what is called the
epicenter page
now this will be request signup same
thing here and the location cool now
we're done with those this page looks
good this page looks good this page
refer default because we're not okay
this one I agree I'll change the export
default because we're not using for
anything else and then we just need to
change that in here this we explore like
that okay now we can run npm run went
fix on that stuff close all this and see
if there's any other things what the
heck there's a hundred and twenty
problems Oh are they all so I'm going to
just spit that to a log so it's easier
to look at looks like all the problem
our definition for rule was not found
I'm not really sure what that means
so let's google it definition for rule
and not found
yes link I'm assuming I just need to
install something there's a typo in the
rule naming your kid cannot find this
unknown rule Oh think this image alt
thing probably causing it
now I lent Darrell Lynch I needed doing
what fixes okay same thing this is weird
but there is no problem with the code
so he installed local version I think I
have good package I think I have via
Slynt local yep deaf dependency right
here so any other plugin the SX and port
react gsx and port try adding plugins
file names okay let's try that why not
file names now went actually why would
file names be hit so copy that install
that this is kind of weird I've never
had this problem with es lint
so it's missing a definition so I'm just
messing probably a package of some sort
and NPM is being slow as ever so while
that loads I think I'll do is I'll just
keep looking and see what people say
looks like a lot of people are having
this problem but they're having a lot of
scatter water rules in his no one seems
to have a good answer and NPM is almost
done can I get you slipped to work
import / no require was places import no
con just published a new ESN configure
and add it to okay I think maybe that
import I remove import IBM run link okay
that did nothing I think if I get rid of
the import or if I just run with those
two plugins no did absolutely no thing
alright I'm not sure if the problem is
exactly but at least in the editor can't
point anything hope except for that dumb
little thing um that's it for this video
I think I may be publish one more video
if I can figure out what's going on here
but it's on the low priority because for
the most cord the co is all cleaned up
and really linting is boring no one
really wants to watch outlet so that's
it for this guys thanks for watching and
that's it
everything is upgraded see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
