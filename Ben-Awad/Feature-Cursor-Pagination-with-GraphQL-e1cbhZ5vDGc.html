based pagination which scales a little
bit better when you have more rows in
your database than offset based
pagination which is what we currently
have now right now we're accidentally
seeing the very end of our list this is
actually the oldest messages at the
bottom here and let me show you guys
that so let me type latest message so it
looks like it works because it's right
here right but that's only because we're
doing subscriptions and putting it here
if I actually refresh well notice latest
message is actually nowhere to be found
and the reason for that is we are
sorting by ascending so we actually need
to be sorting by descending for messages
so descending is actually going to give
us the latest messages at the very top
so we just need to change that in our
message resolver so now when i refresh
and I scroll to the very top latest
messages there so we're now that we're
doing pagination like this we just need
to reverse our list so coming over to
our message container down here messages
we'd like to just reverse it right so
there's a reverse function in JavaScript
like so but this won't work and the
reason for that is messages is immutable
so if we run this it should throw a
little warning there we go saying can
decide read-only properties zero of the
object that's because the reverse tries
to mutate so all we need to do is do dot
dot dot to create a new array so this
will create a new array of messages
alternatively you could call messages
slice either one should work so to
whatever you prefer and now we see the
latest message at the bottom and we'll
say even later message and now we see
that pop two very top
and that's because we're now reversing
these guys and if we come up to where
we're doing here is our subscription and
we are adding the new message to the end
of the list when it should really be at
the beginning of the list because it's
the latest message so we just need to
change that as well and now everything
should be working properly so even later
message hi
you see hi here if I were to refresh
this we see hi stays here and now we can
load more load more and we notice how
it's getting later if we look at the
dates here December 4th at the very
bottom December 6 okay so now we're
we're going in the right direction now
but our offset pagination works and is
working five we just need to change the
order of that so now we're gonna do
cursor pagination and how that works is
if we come over here so right now what
we're saying is we're kind of keeping
the position that we are in and the list
of messages right by saying offset so if
we say offset is equal to 45 that means
we want to start in the list at position
45 and the reason why this is not as
performant when you get lots of rows is
it because you have to start at your
array at index 1 too and it'll go all
the way up until let's say 1 million so
it has to scan all the way through that
which is not very good so the idea with
cursor based pagination instead of
grabbing the index and off setting
instead what you do is you say I want
the value so you you hold the value and
you call that the cursor so maybe the
value is 4 8 3 and so you go to that
position and you find all the elements
after this value so that's what we're
going to be doing so how this is going
to work is we're gonna get rid of our
offset and our value is created at so
the value we're going to sort by so
we're basically we're ordering these by
their date and so we're going to say
we're gonna find all messages later than
this particular message at this date so
here I'm gonna say cursor so we're gonna
get a cursor now and so in my schema
over here instead of an offset on this a
cursor which is gonna be a string now
we're gonna let this string be knowable
that way cuz sometimes you don't want to
pass a cursor in the at the very first
element so here we're gonna say Const
options and we're gonna put this in here
so our cursor is now gonna be a date and
I'm just gonna pass in options here so I
want to conditionally add a where clause
I only want to add the where clause if
we have a cursor so that's why I'm
breaking up options bringing it out here
instead of putting it right there so now
I'm gonna say if cursor and if we have a
cursor I'm gonna say options dot where
and we're gonna look at the created at
is equal to and we want to find all the
messages after our cursor message
basically so we're going to say a models
dot and we want to do less than so we're
going to get the less than operator and
I don't know about you guys but I've
been getting kind of tired having to
write out this whole thing where I do
sequel eyes dot op and so on so I'm
gonna shorten this by coming in to my
index top models over here and just
gonna say models dopey is equal to
sequel eyes dot op just to make it a
little bit faster for us to grab that so
this is in my models index where we're
initializing this model so now I can
just say models thought oh P dot less
than and we're gonna say our cursor so
what's this going to do is when we have
when we're given a date or cursor we're
gonna find all the elements that are
after this cursor so let's get our front
end working with this so instead of
passing in
down here and offset we're gonna pass in
a cursor now at the beginning we don't
need to pass in a cursor because we want
to get the very latest messages no
matter what and then after that and we
need to change our query here so instead
of offset we're gonna say cursor cursor
and this is now a string and we'll come
over here and now in our fetch more now
I don't know why I was doing this stop
props cuz we already are grabbing those
items right here and we can even get
fetch more there so now I can just
shorten all this stuff so fetch more and
we have the channel ID up there and we
have messages okay but we're not doing
it like that anymore instead we're gonna
do cursor and here I'm gonna say I want
to get the last element in my list which
is so that's gonna be messages messages
dot length minus 1 so I'm getting its
value so I want to get dot created at so
here I'm getting the date of the last
message so come over here so the last
state is going to be Tuesday December
5th and then at this time and then I
want to find all the messages that are
after this time so we're gonna pass that
in it's going to come over here to our
resolver and it's gonna say we gave it a
cursor at that time find all the
messages we're created at is even less
than that time okay
so let's see this in action click load
more includes a little more more okay so
keep loading and we should see these are
even older we see this is December 4th
now so perfect so that is how you do
cursor based pagination now out of the
box I don't believe this is faster what
we have right now what makes this faster
is
you can index this column the one that
we are doing this we're calling on so we
need to add an index to created at and
that will actually give us that
performance that'll be faster than
offset based pagination so in our model
over here in our message we just want to
add a index so in sequel eyes it's super
easy to add an index so in the object
that you're defining you just add an
option there a at the end or an option
object I mean and then we're just gonna
copy this you create an indexes in there
so that's not us Association here's your
model that we're defining we're gonna
create a option at the end here paste in
our index and we're only gonna add one
index to this and we're going to say
create it at now our index is not unique
because you could have two messages that
could be at the very same time all right
and I think we see that when I was
typing really fast some of them were at
the same time now there might be a
different like milliseconds for example
but at the same second at least you can
see there's a couple at the same second
okay so normally you would drop the
database so this index gets applied I'm
not gonna worry about it cuz the same
thing it's gonna work exactly the same
way as it's working over here it's just
gonna perform faster and scale better
okay so that is how you do cursive race
pagination and this is what I would
recommend for the most cases but you saw
offset can be a little simpler and it's
also important to make sure we're
already ordering by this column but you
need to order by the column that you are
your cursor it's so our cursor is a date
which is created at so you also need to
order by that as well okay cool
and there's one more thing I wanted to
do real quick before we in the video and
that is over here in our
routes so it's authenticated right now
we have made this little method that
will check whether just client-side
whether we think or check if they're
authenticated and all we're doing right
now is checking whether they have a
token if they don't then they're not
authenticated but someone mentioned a
nice little addition we can make to this
to make this even better we could check
if the token has expired
now it's okay if our regular token
expires because we can refresh it with
our refresh token but if our refresh
token expires then we know they're not
authenticated so when we decode the
refresh token we actually get the values
in it and one of the values in it is
called exp and that gives us in seconds
the date this expires and what we can do
is we can just do a little if statement
and we're going to say date now this
gives us the date in milliseconds so we
have to divide by a thousand and we're
just gonna say if it's greater than
expired then return false so this means
so what we're checking here is we want
to make sure if the current date is
bigger than when this expires so that
means we have past when we have this is
expired then we return false they are
not authenticated so give that a save
and this should not we shouldn't see any
effect because I'm logged in I have a
good token because I'm able to say hey
and see my messages here so perfect and
Olli there's also one other thing I
wanted to do notice our load more button
pops up here even though there's no
messages so we're only we're only
checking whether our load more so it's
in our message container so our button
so we're only checking if has more items
and we default that to true but we
should also know we don't have any more
items if our initial messages is less
than 35 so and messages is greater than
35
and we should say messages link and 35
again that's matching up how much we're
limiting so here we know we didn't get
35 messages at least so we know we're
out
but in general we got 35 messages so we
know we could possibly load more perfect
so that's it for this video guys thanks
for watching
