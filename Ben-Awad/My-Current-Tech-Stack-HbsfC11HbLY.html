like Trello right now it has like these
boards and there's items I'm not exactly
Trello and I want to expand and make way
different features but it's kind of
similar nature now if and I can't honest
take a step back how architecting this
and why I'm architecting it the way I am
right now that there's two parts of it
there's what I call it which is the back
end and Rose which is the front and I'm
going to make like this little readme
I'm going to add those and just want to
talk about what's the art was a text
stack of this application why I chose a
depth in this video I'm just going to
hit up why I chose one of these why I
picked it
videos I want on a deep dive into maybe
some different ReactOS those and just
kind of like the top process when I'm
building this thing why I'm choosing it
to do the way I'm doing it how pieces
all are all working together and kind of
just give you a little bit full
knowledge not just how the code is
working so what is talk to you about
each particular part why technology so
let's just start with the package what I
would call the backend and what I would
call the front it or the front this is
pretty basic or there's less stuff on
the front end I'm using react and that's
pretty much it I'm using you could say
I'm using HTML or CSS I chose but pretty
much react is the front-end and the
front-end framework why did I choose to
pick react and we'll fall through with
each one of these why I picked it before
I go into each one my philosophy behind
picking technologies picking frameworks
is just try it just try one see if you
like it and if you don't switch and
torrance so this is actually the first
really front-end part but I liked it so
much that I was like I'll switch to try
something else so view or angular but
react works good for what I'm doing
and I I don't really feel the need to
change
I'll keep this in mind I the way I pick
technologies too is I switching the next
day like if I feel like tomorrow you'd
way better than react for some reason
I'll switch in a heartbeat and just
totally switch to a different framework
if need be there now I'm loving reacts
and I'm not really having any problems
that's the other eye if I'm having
problems with something probably be
researching how these problems might be
getting fixed and I might little things
better and so then I might switch
frameworks but I learned Mike Jess first
and I just well I pyramid picked it
because it was the most cooler and I
liked just a look of it when I was first
starting and we're functional
programming like paradigms in it so
that's why I polar in that so now that I
know that very well and I'm enjoying it
that's why I picked it from anything
else for the fronton right now these to
react in Postgres I would prove for all
applications right now I'm really link
both of these so that's why I chose
react basically I really like of
programming in it I feel like the
performance is good
Android developing it so I'm going to
pick that up so right now I'm on react
spikes which in the future though right
and I'm switching anytime I feel that
react I'm not enjoying it so now on to
the backend why did I choose this trio
of things these guys are kind of like a
package actually so uh note I actually
don't like JavaScript that much I don't
like to literature as much I like react
well I actually like the new Java
screechers so that has kept me enjoying
JavaScript a little bit more not like
hating it but like for back Android but
using a different server so this is the
database that I'm using I should I
actually add a little database I'm using
this is the server that I'm using this
cuff like middleware and this is the
front end this is the front page right
so why the heck like these guys are
after actually so express is a
JavaScript
back-end framework it's a node
any word and they're really the only
reason I'm using Express that works so
nicely with graph QL and it makes it so
easy I literally have to write so little
code is so small for this this is the
code for to the most recent version this
one line so this is a hundred and
forty-one lines and this is all the
server code I need and this is not even
like a lot of this extra stuff right
that I don't need like I'm not even
doing face but not too good like 40
lines but like this is super shut up and
I have an Express server running really
nicely and I love Apollo Apollo data
mail that I'm using the graph key
library that I'm using the they pretty
much made this little endpoint that I'm
using its graphical and the graph QL
express that's around them and it's just
so easy that I love using and I've had
no problems it to write maybe I'll go
look somewhere else if I was if I had to
write mode and if if I wasn't using
thing the real reason I'm using Express
a reason I'm doing JavaScript in the
backend is because I really want graph
QL like really really really badly after
you'll so much now I like it's so much
better than doing an OL backend that
this is a must right now for me or any
new project without graph QL so adding
grammar s is so easy like the best
library right now for crypt library like
it just has the most features easy to
setup resolvers and your schema and
stuff with a junk server now don't get
me wrong the other ones are not hard
they're decently good too like for
example on for the backend but like so
the graphene well that doesn't even
support subscriptions or at least it
wasn't even the other thing this
supports all the graph QL really easily
subscriptions no problem couple lines
and you have it so it just works so well
with graph Kelton and I'm using Express
if for some reason I did not want to use
graph QL I would use elixir well at
least experiment with elixir in the
Phoenix
framework I don't know if I would pick
that for sure because I haven't done
enough with it but I've heard good
things and I like that style so I would
give that literally right now the only
reason I'm on Express is because it's
writing much express kit like I'm not
writing a lot of junk really so we set
up the server and then super super basic
and then I'm just have like usually just
calling the database right like this is
how many resolvers we have here as I
literally just model in the database
right and see so that's this just makes
it so I'm loving with graph QL and
Express it makes server like my I didn't
all my time pretty much doing react I
barely spent any time on the backend
now I set up my models and Postgres and
then set this up and then I'm just
leaving recurring reactor inca boats
because this is super fast to get set up
so I'm really liking that so that's why
I'm picking this and this is my certain
unnecessary piece but I like it so much
that I have it and necessary but
technically you don't need it all right
why am i using Postgres sequel why am I
using sequel both databases you can use
MongoDB and whatnot
you guys I'm using Postgres sequel
because you'll like I've heard so many
good things about it
people recommend time that I just tend
to use it a lot
I mean 99% of the time or 9% of product
data is also relational so it makes more
sense in this database rinse I feel like
this is the one the best sequel
databases tend to use sequel and this is
like what I feel like is the one of the
best things better than my sequel but
take take I have not tried this our
databases
I've literally involved because again
I'm willing to switch to any technology
it stops working for me if this stops
working for me I'll switching create
anything I try to do it works just great
so that's the other thing I usually I'm
sure people recommend and then usually
oh because like I didn't start with this
piece right
I mean to like I didn't always use graph
QL but I realized no I was missing
something making servers
and I felt like I wanted more look for
solutions and then I found graph QL and
I want to use it more so like I would
really like Postgres equal right now and
I feel like the pure 8 it's really fast
I like using sequel I don't mind it at
all some people don't like sequel but I
like it it's not bad
and honestly seem just enjoyed I want to
enjoy developing so I libraries these
frameworks so that's what I'm I haven't
spent too much time on no sequel and
people recommend using sequel if your
data's relationship relational so that's
recycling really well so I don't I'm not
I'm going to wait until adopting else so
that's why I picked this stack and this
is using for all web applications right
now if I'm going to start the stack I
want to use this got these guys right
here I'm just loving them so much like
I'm enjoying this stack I think it's I
feel really productive building stuff is
robust everything's working the
performance is great I've just been able
to do really like advanced feature
flakes so I've been really liking it if
you guys like you know this is my
recommendation for you guys when picking
a stack pick the things enjoy and then
if it starts not work switch it up this
we can use this if you want to to
process behind picking these languages
pick yvaine works for this application
and for future applications whiip
pickings yeah and then i want to make
more videos like this in the next video
I'm going to go over into how these
pieces actually work together with each
other
how does Postgres work with express
house expressed word um maybe I'll about
how the data is gained passed through
and stuff and just like I more
high-level overviews so that's it for
this view guys thanks for watching let
me know if you have any questions below
about stack or have any questions about
why I pick them I be happy to answer and
let me know
what status link I'm curious what you
guys use at work whether you like what
are you using for personal projects I'm
Carol and if you're not using graph QL
why aren't you using graph to a question
so yeah thanks for watching guys I'll
see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
