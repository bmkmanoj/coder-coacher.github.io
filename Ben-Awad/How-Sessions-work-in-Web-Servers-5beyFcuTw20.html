sessions work in a webserver and I'm
gonna be going over one way that's very
common and that works really well but
there's other ways to do it as well
so if you're not aware sessions is just
like a piece of data that a server keeps
track of of a user as they're using the
website and this can be very helpful
because they want to keep track of what
the user has done before and what
they've done on your website so far so
it's a way of keeping track of what
they've done and this is how it works
so let's say you're on a website and you
make a request this might be the first
request you make or maybe you've just
logged in it's gonna go to the server
and then the server is going to create a
session and so when I say they're
creating a session what that means is
they're gonna be creating an ID and
storing this in maybe a Redis or a
database or just in memory and what I
mean just in memory that might be just
like a object where they're storing a
whole bunch of sessions or a long array
something like that that's just in the
memory of the server as opposed to like
a database or rest so for example I have
a little piece of sample data here this
might be like what looks a session might
look like some data so this thing up
here is the session ID SID and so to
create a session ID what you would do is
write a SID like this so session ID is
just a random string could be a UUID
which is probably recommended and if you
don't know what that is that's just a
good way of creating an ID because it's
a random string with some specific
attributes of how it's made but yeah so
it creates an ID and at first you don't
have any data whatsoever in your session
now they're making the first request you
might be able to store something from it
but most of the time what you're going
to do is you're going to send that ID
back to the website and the website is
going to store that ID in some way
maybe they're gonna store it in cookies
local storage session storage pretty
much it doesn't matter well it does
matter but they're strong it in some
place where it's persisted and what I
mean by that is when the user refreshes
the page or leaves the site and comes
back they have that that ID is still
associated with them and then every time
the user makes a request the server will
look and see whether this ID is stored
in whatever they're using to store it
and so what this allows you to do is
when the user is making requests and
doing stuff on your website is to
gradually add data so the session is
just a basically JSON object there's
other ways to do it but like this where
you just have the session ID and then
any other data you want to keep track of
so as the user is browsing the site and
making requests you slowly generate more
data or you can generate more data and
you can also generate for example an
expiration date so maybe after seven
days or five days there it's expired and
this they get a new session and the data
gets old or whatever so some use cases
for this are keeping track of whether
the user is logged in or not
so right here I have the user ID so I
know who the user is after they log in
and I can store that as the user ID and
I might want to store also some metadata
so whether they're an admin but you can
also use this for pretty much any kind
of tracking you want to do so one thing
you might want to do is make sure no
one's spamming your log in and trying to
hack in and brute force the log in so
you might want to keep track of how many
times this particular user has tried to
log in now you may want to also do that
for example by checking the IP address
but also this is another way you can
maybe bring up a CAPTCHA to slow them
down after they've tried to log in a
couple
so you just know basically it's a way of
keeping state of the user on the server
so all this data is stored in the server
right are at least in Redis or the
database whatever you choose all you
send all the website has is this ID and
this ID is meaningless at least in this
way I'm with this setup of sessions if
you've heard of JWT tokens that's where
you actually store some of this data and
the token itself and the website can
decode this and see it but in this case
the website has no idea what data you
have or that you're holding in the
backend all they see is this ID which is
meaningless to them so all this other
stuff is stored here so that's nice so
the user has no way of seeing it
whatsoever
so you can store all kinds of stuff be
sensitive data anything you want and it
can be very helpful so yeah that's how
sessions work they're super handy I'm
gonna be doing more videos about them
and getting in depth of how to actually
do this with nodejs
and graph QL very soon so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
