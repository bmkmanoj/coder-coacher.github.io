continue cleaning up the actions here
now for recipe and I'm going to use the
exact same logic so just export console
quest recent recipes request recent
recipes and then we're going to receive
recent recipes and then we're going to
add recipe finish I think I'm going to
say create that makes a little bit more
sense to me I think requests create
recipe we don't need to receive it we
had--we to me for that recipe fetch
requested request a recipe receive
recipe my recipe so we can actually just
copy this and prefix the recipe part
with request my recipe this this will be
my recipes receive my recipes request my
recipes this see my recipes awesome um
then here we have recent recipe
succeeded veterus p i think that was it
we have okay so we get we got recent
recipes we got recipe we got request my
recipe and we have create recipe up then
we don't need these and then I'm just
going to kill all that export Const
request recent recipes create action
request recent recipes my intellisense
is not working that is we
I need to fix that actually because it
would be nice here receive recent
recipes receive this and recipes request
create SP I'm just going to go down this
and I'll switch over request recipe just
see recipe requests my recipes see my
recipes ok now let's do these requests
Cree recipe requests great recipes
recipe oops request recipe receive
recipe request my recipe and the last
one receive an IRS piece a lot of
boilerplate there okay so now we can go
into the sagas and we can fix this all
up so now we can do require a receive
recipe recent recipes so let me receive
recent recipes by recipe fetch done that
would be receive recipe my recipes done
I'll be receive my recipes and then this
will be request recipe request recent
recent recipes
request my recipes request create recipe
awesome so now this will be received
recent recipes
this one will be so we're recent recipes
requested request review sent recipes
nothing here add recipe requested
request create recipe recipe fetch done
edge request or Cu recipe requests
requests recipe this last one is um this
is my recipe so we're going to receive
my recipes and the last one request my
recipes dang that was a lot of
boilerplate also let's rename the sagas
so they match up nicely so my recipe
saga call you a local beat this one will
call call um my recipes actually not
call my fetch recipe I don't like that
name call my recipes that's fine each
recipe saga so just be recipe saga this
will be call recipe
address posaga
address apiece are not plural call
address P let's do call create a species
a little bit more explicit recent recipe
saga that's perfect
call recent recipes cool alright that
name is good let's go to our reducer
receive recipes receive recipe receive
my recipes and receive recent recipes so
resource pieces down here let's see my
recipes and here we are see your recipe
now let's go through and add those the
most part it should be pretty has
request create recipe crust create
recipe will fetch this in my recipes of
course my recipe will be now request my
recipes
okay and then I throw home we'll have
stuff request recent Oh diary fix this
request recent recipe see I did or it
was really good and then the single page
request recipe up that was good naming
alright so again we changed a lot of
stuff there let's make sure everything
is working so for example I can fetch a
page ok good I can log in and I can go
to mine fetches my ok you can add a
recipe um new recipe and we added ok
could add it okay so is there any other
functionality that there was um there's
adding a recipe and this it goes about
it yeah because they're just adding this
that there's for them cool so that's it
for this video we added all the actions
in the next one I will go through and
make all the functions peer or all the
components peer that I can on that makes
sense too so that's it for this video
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
