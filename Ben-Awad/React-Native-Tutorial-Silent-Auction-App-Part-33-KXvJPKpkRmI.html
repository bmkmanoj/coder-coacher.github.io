video we're going to be working with the
Android emulator so I've been using iOS
the whole time so when to open up an
Android so it looks like I noticed
there's this air that happens when
basically try to do anything that
requires the tether server so for
example here's me just trying to sign up
and it causes this big crash so we're
going to fix why this is happening the
main reason is for iOS you can connect
the localhost on your computer
but for example this I'm using jinni
motion and maybe this does work on the
Android emulators with Android studio
but it did not work for my Janene motion
and the reason for that is it does not
no it does not go to the right localhost
you have to change the value of this is
and when I came over and I just googled
some stack overflow when they
recommended using this instead of
localhost I found another one here which
had some other ones they tried that
worked out for them so using the same
crash at home give these a try and see
which one works for you this will not
work for me because I'm using genymotion
so what we're going to do is we need to
basically say if it's iOS you localhost
but if we're running an Android app we
want to use this so the way to do that
is with the platform which we get from
reactant ativ and that just tells us
what which OS is being run so we can
call platform OS and then we can check
if it's equal to iOS and if it is we'll
use a little post else we'll use the 10
0 30 32 ok and now we can just instead
of your localhost hard-coded here you
can use what our basis alright and so
now that should work for Android
reload this Oh
as you can see it just logs me straight
in so I'm good to go now so everything
else looks and works well the same as
iOS it slightly look slightly different
of course because native base changes it
for Android which is nice but notice how
there's a little bit of space here I'm
in the iOS simulator we needed this
space but Android we don't so I'm
thinking we just do the same thing where
we do this little check in our component
to remove that space and that is not our
option form is in our view options view
and biele if you're wondering what
folder I was in I was just in other
modules index is where we change that
okay so it was this so margin top here
so we can just say Const segment margin
top is equal to platform dot oh s is
equal to IO s if it is we set the 15l so
we set it to zero and we just need to
import platform from the AK native so
import platform for on react native and
then we can use this segment margin top
here into the hard code 15 so you can
add Marge pop okay so now if i refresh
this hopefully this little space there
will be gone and it is cool and that
looks nice so that is it and we are
actually done with the silent auction
app we are finished employing all the
features on that I wanted to add but if
there is anything you would like to see
on please leave a comment below and I'll
take those features and I'll actually
add them to the app if you'd like to see
them so do let me know if there's
anything you want to see being added and
I'll go ahead and I'll make a video
showing how you can
add those in so thank you guys for
watching and that's it for this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
