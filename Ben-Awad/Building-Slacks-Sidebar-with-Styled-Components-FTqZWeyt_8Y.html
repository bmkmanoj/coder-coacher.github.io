this sidebar to make it look more like
slack and now we have these little
blocks that we're using for the teams if
I hover I see a little border and if I
hover over here I get a little line and
then I have these little dots to
represent whether users are online or
offline I'm just gonna walk you through
the CSS and show you how I put this
together so first I'm going to show you
how to make those little blocks I did
with the team so here's what the mark-up
looks like for right now team wrappers
the same as you saw I created a team
list this is very simple I just took the
default list style off so we don't see
bullet points and then I set the width
to the whole width of this so it's this
whole width right here and then also I
just took the padding off because it
smashes it to the left otherwise and
then I just again mapped it and then the
team list item has all the mark-up in it
so I did a bunch of styling to make this
into a square and I think it'll be
easiest if I just inspect this and go
one by one and show you how this was
done so I just made it a height 50
pixels by 50 heightened with I said 250
pixels this could be decreased or
increased some but basically making a
square then background color I just set
the background color of this guy and
then the color for the font there and
then the margin bottom is so there's a
little bit of spacing here so you can
increase this more of them the more
spacing and then margin auto just
centers it then display flex this guy
centers the text right here in the
middle and then I said a line items
center and the justify content center to
get the actual text the letters in the
middle and then I said bump the font
size up to 24 and then I set 11 pixels
on the radius just so you see this
little curve so it's not a square like I
got rid of this notice how was the
square me it nice and curvy so now if I
add a little hover to this guy we can
see we have this little thing here and
this is just a
order style solid thick and then hashtag
seven seven six so 76 96 76 for the
color I think I picked this one just
like a random great they go well with it
and so you'll notice here's how I do the
hover and style components we don't
actually know the class name of this so
we just use a ampersand to represent the
class name and then I just put all the
styles I was just talking to you about
and then we use this team list item and
you'll notice I kind of just put all
these little stylee things on the
component itself maybe if I had a ton of
these I'd move them elsewhere but since
there's not that many I don't want to
create a file for each one especially
when we want to show you what I changed
to the channels I added a quite a few of
these things I don't want to make it
file for each maybe if I was using them
other places I would but since this is a
view component anyway I don't think it's
bad to put CSS in the view component
anyway
so that's how we got those little blocks
now let's move on to the channel these
things had a couple of these but very
little CSS in each one this one's very
easy to look at okay so I'm just gonna
go from the very top and walk you guys
down so the first thing he did was
create a little thing called push left
and all that does is you see how there's
like a little space right here between
the edge that pushes the team name and
the username over to actually I should
really call this push right because it
pushes to the right I'm pushing off the
left though so per foot left I just add
a padding left and you'll notice how I'm
using the string template here to add
the padding left value and this is just
a div so padding left is a constant I
think where do I have padding left
here's padding left a constant for 10
pixels padding left and then the team
name header I just made that a header
and made it white so where's that a team
name header so I white bumped up the
font size and then I made this guy a
header so it's big and then underneath
that I just have the username still
nothing changed and then I created this
thing called a sidebar list that I'm
using for both of these it's very simple
I'm pushing it
the left with a padding of what or sorry
not pushing it to the left I will be
pushing the items off to the left but
the actual container is not so I had
wanted to add this little shadow so it
needs to be the full width so that's why
the width is 100% on the list and I got
rid of the bullet points and then I got
rid of the padding left so it spans the
whole width of the container so I'm
using that for both of these because
both of these need to have a little
hover and then the actual items themself
so then I'm just mapping users and
channels you'll notice I also did we'll
talk about the mapping in a second the
header I created a sidebar header a list
and all that's doing is here it is
putting it's a list item that has a
padding left so I put a padding left on
these notice this doesn't have a hover
hurt this does I just want to move this
over to the left zone so I just added a
padding left on that me it still have it
as a list item though could change that
the font size or something there too
so next we have our items I'm going to
talk about the channel item because
that's a little simpler cuz it doesn't
have this little bubble all I did with
the sidebar a list item we can take a
look at it here is added a padding left
and I added a hover and so for this
hover what it's doing is it just sets
the background color that's it pretty
simple and because it's paying the whole
width it goes across that's how you can
see it go across like that and if we
wanted to we could have like a little
bit of padding it would probably look
good on this guy like maybe five pixels
and it'll push up a little bit if you
want more spacing in between these items
that looks like maybe a little bit too
much maybe you just want like I don't
know two pixels or something like just a
very little amount that way it's a
little thicker
here you can play with that number that
actually messes up the padding-left
Oh cuz we set padding of two pixels so
you need to add the padding at the top
here and notice this will actually push
the padding left over and I'll still
look good cool actually think that looks
pretty nice with a little bit more
padding alright so I just added some
padding spread the moment there padding
left pushes it over and then the hover
you notice I'm using the ampersand again
and all I'm doing is wrapping the oh the
item right here so I'm putting the name
and I'm wrapping it's the list item so
it has the hover and the attributes here
now with the user I did a same thing
right they need to have hover the only
thing added was this bubble so this
bubble is actually just a unit code and
you'll notice I basically have a boolean
value I'm you can do on or off for the
bubble for now the bubble is on for true
up set the default value but we can turn
off so if it's on we're gonna show a
Unicode circle and then I turn it green
by just making a span and in the color
green this is the color of slack screen
so it copied that and then otherwise we
just show a little you know code there
string so real quick I'll show you what
it looks like if I put on equal false
and we can see we see a whole hollow
circle
so that's how we're gonna like show
different ones like we didn't pass the
user whether they're offline or online
and then the bubble will go on and off
so that's all the markup I just added
the CSS this codes gonna be up on github
if you want to check it out in the next
video what we're gonna do is actually do
some graph QL make some container
components which are going to actually
make requests to our server get some
data and then pipe the data into these
view components that we just made but I
think we're looking pretty good close to
slack with this so I'm pretty happy we
haven't done the messages yet so that's
something we'll have to create but that
should be pretty easy because semantic
UI has some nice message components so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
