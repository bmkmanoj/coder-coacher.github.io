and our slack clone and then we serve
those files using Express using this
line right here now we're throwing them
in a folder right here called files but
when we put in a docker container we're
putting it in the files in the container
so when the containers destroyed any
files uploaded in that files folder
inside the container will be destroyed
so similar towel with our image up here
with the Postgres database we set up a
volume where we said all the data would
be stored in a volume called PG data and
so when the container destroyed it would
persist we need to do the same thing for
our images or our files so I'm gonna
come down here to our web image and just
add a volume so I'm gonna say volumes
and on our computer it's dot slash files
and then I'm gonna say slash app slash
files so this would be the folder inside
of the container and I did slash app in
front of it because if we check out our
docker file our working directory is
slash app ok so this is well and good
will now be able to persist any files we
upload but there's a better way than
having our Express server serve the
static files now that we are using
Engine X it has superfast and it's
really good at serving static files much
better than Express so we can just leave
express to serving graph QL requests and
have nginx be the one that serves static
files so what we're gonna do is change
our nginx config to support this
so right here I'm going to add a new
endpoint that we're going to grab and
that's gonna be slash files so this
right here matches what we're using here
and we're gonna a leave alias this to a
folder on the container so we're gonna
create a folder called slash files so
this we're gonna have to create in our
container and this is where all the
files are going to be located and that's
what we're gonna serve so our doctor
compose file over here we want to add
another volume for the files and the
cool thing about docker is you can have
shared volumes so both my web and my
nginx can access this dot slash files
here I'm gonna map it to slash files so
notice we were mapping it to two
different places on the containers but
on my computer it's the same dot slash
files folder so now in the Express
server if they upload a new file they'll
place in the files folder and then both
nginx can get it and it can render the
static files so cool next we're just
gonna say gzip underscore static on what
that does is it compresses the files win
when sending it to the client next we're
gonna tell the browser to cache the
files if possible and we're gonna say
expires max on that and we're gonna say
add header and we're gonna say cache
control and you can set the cache
control to public or private we're gonna
set to private since the images are
private information so this expires max
here the reason why we're saying it to
max is because the images never really
change the names of them the routes
never change so it's always going to
match the same image so there's no
reason to expire the cache but what you
could do is if you have something that
would expire you could set
one day or pretty much anytime you want
we're gonna keep it to max here
so this is good that's all we need to do
to set up engine X and I'll now serve
static files but before I demo this for
you guys and show you this working we
need to make a quick fix and that's our
subscriptions I totally forgot that
we're using subscriptions so we're
currently not proxying WebSocket
connections which we need to do so
notice how we just have location and
we're grabbing all requests so it is
grabbing subscriptions but we need to do
a special thing in particular for them
so if we remember we are using the slash
subscriptions in point it should be here
somewhere
there we go so slash subscriptions in
point so we need to create a new
location here for that and then here is
the documentation on docker on how to
handle WebSockets and proxying though so
I'm gonna copy this paste it here
and now I'm gonna put subscriptions now
I gave this a try and for whatever
reason when I have the slash here it
broke it and when I got rid of it it
worked so I'm gonna get rid of that so
we're gonna proxy this to web 8081 slash
subscriptions and then I'm just gonna
keep these settings here these are the
settings needed to proxy what Brooklyn
or not what we Chris but web sockets and
then you'll notice here I'm not doing
like web sockets here and that's
intentional you just need to do a CP
there and that's good so yeah now we're
gonna be handling subscriptions good and
then in location here now I'm going to
go ahead and just change this to slash
graphic you L I talked about that in the
last video but I forgot
we actually had other endpoints that we
were supporting so it's a good that I
kept this open but now there's really
only slash graph QL
maybe I'm graphical too if we want
that in production but I'm not gonna
open graphical up in production so
really the only end point I want to
expose for my express servers really /
graphic UL and I'll just let nginx
handle everything else alright this
looks pretty good the only other thing I
wanted to change was over here so now
that we're using nginx
the server URL that this picks up is
actually web instead of a focal host so
it actually breaks when using this right
now so I'm gonna just get rid of this
for now and we're gonna use an
environment variable so processed I am
dot server URL or I'll just set this to
HP / localhost okay
so and we can get rid of these arcs so
in development we're just gonna do use
localhost
and I guess I should say little host
8080 one I believe is what we need so
this will work in development and then
whenever we release this / - into
production we'll just set the
environment variable to what we need it
to be in production so we don't need to
set anything in our docker file right
now because we want it to actually
access a little closed 881 all right so
that's it so let's check out the changes
we made let's make sure that
subscriptions are working with engine X
and we can now upload files and they are
being served so I'm gonna come over here
just do NPM run build because we just
made a change to our source code and so
I'm just gonna build docker build and
then when that's done building I'm just
going to docker compose up and then
we're gonna come back over to our server
I'm already logged in and everything so
we're just gonna try sending a message
and then uploading a picture so docker
compose up
okay oh this is the other thing I forgot
about that so we just got an error
message invalid number oops and valid
number of arguments to the proxy set
header and we get this we exit basically
engine X crashes so I'm gonna ctrl C out
of that and just docker compose down the
reason we're getting that is because our
docker compose over here we're running
in the subs I don't even know what this
stands for but what that does is it
actually substitutes in environment
variables and so it thinks this is an
environment variable when it's really
not and this we're not using any
environment variables in there I'm just
gonna use cat instead so we're just
basically gonna cat this file into the
correct location that we want it so we
don't do any kind of environment
variable configuration now if you need
do that I'm not really sure how to
escape this but this is how you get rid
of that error if you don't need to use
environment variables so come back over
here docker compose up okay looks like
things are still starting up engine X
looks like it started up okay it looks
like our web is up now so here's the
site just do a quick refresh okay so I'm
just gonna say hello okay so we see
hello so our web sockets are working
awesome now I'm just gonna drag Timo
over here paste him in and cool we see
you Timo pop up so now we are serving
these images using nginx instead of
Express so that'll be faster and we're
telling the browser to cache it so and
to gzip it when possible to compress it
so now we should be serving images
faster which is nice so that's it for
this video guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
