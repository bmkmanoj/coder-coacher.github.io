how to handle errors in your graph QL
resolvers so right here I have the
register mutation and what we want to do
is handle a user that basically already
exists in the database we don't want to
allow someone to create multiple users
in the database with the same email so
there's a couple different ways we could
do this the first is by just go ahead
and on our email field making it unique
like this so just setting unique true
and then what what that would do is
basically type warm with through an air
be like hey Postgres through an air and
said you cannot insert an email that are
exists we can have that database do the
check I'm not going to do this in this
situation for basically two reasons one
we might want to add a later date like
phone number and then allow users to
basically have their email be null and
in that case we can't have it unique
because there might be some null columns
in that case so I'm not gonna use unique
here but instead I'm just going to go
ahead and check and also it makes it
just a slightly easier for air handling
to just do the check ourselves so the
way we're gonna do the check is to
basically just search for a user so I'm
going to say comp user already exists
and we're going to await user dot to
find one so as long as there's at least
one and we're gonna say where and
passing in that email and the other
thing I'm going to select oops
only the ID so this is just like a small
optimization I don't want to select all
the fields because we don't really need
them all we're doing for this is to just
make sure this kid exists
so I'm gonna say if user already exists
then we're gonna go ahead and we want to
throw an error right and this is where
the error handling comes in and I was
talking about there's also multiple ways
to do error handling so one of the
approaches I used to do was to just
throw an error and you could say hello
or whatever you want to say in that and
then also there's a way to set up errors
to where you're actually able to pass an
object in like this and be like alright
email already taken and that's kind of
how I used to do it but there's another
way you can do this and I've started to
like this way better and this is
something I've done before as well and
that's basically you pass the air as an
object so I'm gonna return an array and
I'm gonna say the path is email and the
message is already taken so basically
what this is is now I'm going to return
an array of errors from my resolver and
what the errors look like is they're of
the shape so it's going to be an object
where the path is a email and the
message is whatever you want to say and
the reason why I have two fields right
here is this is basically the field it
references or the path it references
like is there something wrong with the
password is there something wrong with
the email that sort of thing like maybe
you want validate how long the email
should be or how long the passwords
gonna be so we have to specify what
field we're talking about that's what's
wrong with one of the fields like their
password might be perfect but their
email is rate taken right and then the
message here is whatever we want to say
and then I'm gonna return instead of
true I'm just gonna return null down
here because we hit no errors okay so we
have to change up our graph QL now
because right now we are doing a
slightly different stuff is what we're
returning so I'll just look over the
code real quick so here we are finding a
user
if he exists we're checking if we got
and by the way it's gonna return
undefined if it can't find one so we're
checking if we got anything back if we
did get something back or returning that
the emails already taken and this is an
array because it's possible we have
multiple things wrong with basically
what they input so we could return
multiple but in this case there's only
one thing wrong and then down here we do
the same little stuff you did before and
then we were terminal so now my schema
diagraph kill over here instead of
returning a boolean where I wanna return
is an array and of the type air so
here's what error looks like so the path
is going to be a string and the message
is going to be a string as well
oops and both of those are required
fields so we're gonna say error and
notice how we're gonna say errors are
required in the array notice how we're
saying no bang sign at the end of the
array that means we can return null from
this and that's how we know whether we
get any errors at all we just check if
it's null or not and also the other
thing is this error type I might want to
use across multiple different schemas or
modules so what I'm going to do is
create kind of a I'll call it shared
graph QL and I'll put some of this code
there so any graph QL I want to share
cross schemas I'll put here and then the
way I access it is thanks to the graph
QL import library what we can do is
actually add in a comment hash tag and
then import be from graph QL so we're
gonna do that
so in our case we're gonna do import air
and from my new dot dot dot dot shared
background go so now we have this air
kind of in a shared graph QL file and
then we can access it and maybe we will
need to modularize the shared graph QL
later but I think this is fine because I
don't think we're gonna be sharing too
much stuff between schemas this is just
kind of probably about the only one all
right so we have all that let's go ahead
and now update our tests because our
test expects different stuff so I'm now
gonna select both the path and the
message to get that back and then now
let's set up a test for this so we are
going to wait for the response and now
we're saying what it's equal to
so now register really should be null
because we should be able to
successfully register and then we can
keep the same logic here we're just
finding whether there how many users are
certainly only one in the database and
all that stuff right there okay and then
after this I now want to try to sign up
again so we can copy this and I'm gonna
say response to and then here we're just
going to basically check to make sure we
did get an error back so we can copy
this expect
and we're gonna say register and now we
expect to get an array back and the
array should have as the path email and
then the air first I should say message
is gonna be already taken now I don't
think this is great the way I'm doing
this and what I mean by that is if I
change the message this test is gonna
fail I don't really care what the
message is here per se I only care that
I get register back and I get an array
and it has one element and I guess the
path is email so I don't really care
what this message is so I'm gonna break
this up into like a couple different
things so first I'm gonna expect
response to and I guess to have length
and I should expect the length to be one
and this is gonna be a dot register and
then after that and I don't know why
it's getting mad at me Oh cuz this is an
empty array I'm gonna say this can be of
the type of any and then after that I
want to check and make sure the path is
an email so two equal and we're gonna
get the first element we're gonna get
path and that's gonna be email
all right so just to go over this check
one more time so we're making a request
which should cause an heir and the way
we check we have an heir is that
register returns an array and in that
array we have a length of at least one
and we're well actually it should be
exactly 1 in this case we don't expect
to get any other heirs and then the
first element we're grabbing checking
the path making sure it's telling me
that the email is what's wrong and the
other thing I want to do before we run
this test is in package that JSON in the
test here I'm gonna add - - force exit
this is a tip that one of you guys gave
me so then we don't have to ctrl C after
running this test I'll just finish
automatically and we'll see if this goes
ahead and works or if we have any
problems we need to fix and cool so it
looks like we passed all right so now
we're successfully actually sending an
error message back to the user and in
the future I'll go over how you actually
would handle that and your front-end
with for example react and there's one
last thing I wanted to do and that was
another cool tip you guys gave me so
right now we are doing a before insert
here to pass in the ID and this is for
basically creating user so whenever we
create a user we're creating a new UUID
and we're doing this before we insert it
but we don't actually have to do this at
all and the reason for that is because
we can get typos um to do it for us
by using this generated primary
generated column and because we've
specified UUID here it's gonna
automatically generate that for us
so if we want to and get rid of these to
get rid of this and if you don't care
about that library anymore we could just
remove UUID from this project don't
think we're gonna need it again we might
have to add it later for something but
we can slim it down and if you run your
own tests again make sure everything
still works and that we're good to go
assuming this test works we're all done
with this video guys so thanks for
watching what I want to do next is to do
a little bit more air handle
and that is for example like the length
of the email or length the password
maybe I want to check for some special
characters that sort of thing
but we'll talk about more that in the
next video
