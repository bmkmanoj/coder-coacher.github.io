but it's going to be the same setup as I
have on my Mac and you may have noticed
the app is now crashing based on our
last video where we set PS lint it's not
just you when I changed this to JSX it
starts crashing and I had forgotten that
create react native app expects this to
be called app dot GA s so we're gonna
change it back to comply but when we
comply with this rule we're gonna get
these red lines in our es lint because
of the eslint which we don't want so to
get rid of this we are going to copy
this rule and just turn it off we're
just gonna ignore it
so in our dot Uslan RC file the way to
ignore things is you can create a rules
object put the rule you want and just
turn it off so by putting a CRO there
now on Windows you'll be noticing more
little red things because of es lint and
that is because line break style so
we're gonna turn this rule off as well
now this is something you don't worry
about on Linux or Mac because they're
line break style is just fine the
windows one break stuff okay so now our
app is rendering like before and we
don't see any red here so we're good to
go and continue so we're gonna be doing
today is building the layout for our app
now I'm gonna be stealing inspiration
from this one right here I'm gonna be
doing this kind of top view with these
three bars and then the buttons at the
bottom which is kind of basic all
calculators but I'm gonna have the
triple view of the stack I think I'm
willing to do three instead of four bars
and then I'm not gonna do all the
buttons they have here I'm going to
simplify it cuz I don't think we need a
lot of them I'm gonna be doing a clear
pal swap and these guys and in the
regular numbers so yeah let's get into
building the layout so to start us off
while I'm thinking is and what I like to
do when building layouts is to kind of
break it into chunks so let's take a
look at this again it's kind of split
there's a top half in a bottom half so
the first thing I'm gonna do is split it
up like
so I'm gonna create here and I'm gonna
get rid of the default container style
except for the Flex so what flex does if
you don't have you never seen it before
is it expands to the whole container
with so flex one is exactly what we want
this is gonna be basically our
background and it's taking over the
whole screen and what I like to do to
kind of just confirm these things or
look at it is set background colors so
if I set a background color of blue we
can see that this container is now
taking up the whole app screen so now to
create a top and bottom we're gonna
create a view here that's gonna be a
kind of like our top panel view and a
bottom panel which is gonna be our
bottom and when doing this again I'm
just going to keep using this background
color because it really helps to
visualize it so I'm gonna get rid of
that I'm gonna create two new styles
here so I'm gonna create a top style
oops and a bottom style now the top I'm
gonna make yellow
actually let's just make it blue
background color blue and this one red
so then we're gonna add this style
styles dot bottom and style styles top
so exactly like we have here and then
I'm just gonna add a text in this so we
can see it I'm gonna say hi and then up
here we're gonna have zero three times
and refresh okay so we can see the zeros
up here we can see the high now this
high is gonna be our bottom block with
all our buttons and I want that guy to
fill up the whole screen so I'm gonna
say flex one on it and by saying flex
one it's gonna expand the rest of the
container with like we want and now
you'll notice how this is kind of
bumping into the top bar here I'm just
gonna set a mmm let's add padding
padding top of maybe like 20 pixels and
we can kind of see it we'll see if this
is enough we might have to add more
padding later so we can see it at the
bar okay so the the number here I'm
going to add style to so we can create a
style for them you want to push them
over to the right give them some color
give them some padding and stuff let's
just call this
Louis call number that's fine so and
we're gonna apply that to this textile
styles that number and we're gonna do
three of them so here I'm gonna make the
color white and I'm gonna make the
background color now the background
color I use for this is actually the
color I want it to be and then call it
42 42 42 which is kind of like an art
nice blue background color it's a nice
dark color and then I'm gonna say
text-align:right to push it over
and then I'm just gonna say padding I
don't know ten pixels just gonna pump it
and then increase the font size of it
say 30 and let's bold it
font-weight:bold okay so we kind of seen
this top part come together we can add a
border bottom with one pixel and then
border color I can make white just to
kind of differentiate between the
different rows cool that looks nice
so I'm pretty happy with this top part
now let's start attacking the bottom
part right here so for the bottom part
we're gonna have rows and rows and
numbers so each row I'm gonna create a
view so I'm gonna create a new style
here called row and we're gonna have a
view and each view is gonna be a row
so I'm gonna say style style row and in
the style we're gonna have just some
text which is gonna be our buttons here
now I could just add text like this but
what I'm going to do is actually create
another component and use it here so I'm
gonna create a custom component and the
reason for that is we're gonna be adding
extra functionality to this later so
it's getting easier if we abstract this
so I'm just gonna create a new file
called button J s and just like the
other file I ran port react from react
and I'm going to say Const button and
I'm gonna use create a functional
component here as opposed to oh we have
a functional component over here now too
so this is a function that returns a
component and it's gonna do here as well
I'm just going to export default button
and so here I am for now I'm just gonna
say text and then what I want to
actually do is take as a parameter of
this function the text at the bun should
display so as a parameter it takes props
and we can extract props like this so
I'm gonna grab text and then I can
display the text between tags like this
and we need to import text react native
so what i'm doing here is i'm taking
text from the props and then i'm
displaying the text in between these
text tags notice how i had to do curly
braces because this is JSX and JSX
whenever you're using variables or
JavaScript things you have to wrap it
with that okay so now we can use this
button component in our app KS over here
the first step is to import it oops so
I'm gonna import button from a dot slash
button so now we have access to that
button component we have over there and
so I can just put a button in between
this for you so button
and the text for this I'm gonna say
clear and I might simplify what the word
says so notice how we see the word clear
there so it rendered our text that we
passed and I'm missing prop types I'm
gonna get rid of this I don't really
like adding prop types it's a good idea
to but I find it slows me down a little
bit if you don't know what prop types
are their way of validating the user
input or the input so for example over
here and text I were to add a number
like this instead of doing a string like
it's supposed to
it'll just give me a little warning
telling me I'm doing it wrong but that's
fine so I just disable that rule and now
the text I am trusting myself to use as
a string so here I'm now going to use
that all the way down so I'm gonna have
a couple buttons I'm gonna have POW and
what was the other ones that I wanted
clear pow I wanted to swap as well and
then we're gonna have division so now we
have one row now you notice how the
items are like this and really why I
want them like that right I want them in
a row I want them in columns instead of
a row because these are all straight
down so my row right here I can say flex
direction
bro and now notice how they are lining
up all in a line like I want them to and
I want to show you guys background color
for this let's make it a pink so this is
where our row is currently and I want my
road to expand the whole width of this
so I'm gonna say flex one and save it
now as I add more rows you'll notice so
let's copy this paste this row and give
it a save notice how these two split so
that's how flex works if two rows so
this guy and this guy have flex one on
them because we have styles row what
happens is instead of both of them
taking up the entire space they split it
in half now if I do this another time
they'll split it into thirds and if I do
this another time it'll split into
fourths so now I have 4 rows 1 2 3 4
broken up and we don't really need the
background colors blue and red anymore
so we can get rid of those
okay so now here I'm gonna fill out the
buttons that I want so here I'm gonna
have so I have clear here I'm gonna have
nine eight seven and then this is going
to be an X for multiplication this is
gonna be six five four and then a minus
for subtraction and we're gonna have
three two one
and we're gonna have a plus and now my
create one more row this one's gonna
have three or not three sorry zero and a
dot four decimal point and then we're
gonna have a button here that says enter
so this one only has three buttons and
here's what we're looking like right now
so not very pretty and the reason for
that is our buttons are not taking up a
lot of space so let's look at what the
buttons look like right now so I'm gonna
come over here and I'm gonna start
styling them so style them we're gonna
be using style sheet like reducing right
here so I can just copy style sheet
and copy you so now we have a Styles
over here so I'm gonna create a
container style for this as well so I'm
gonna call this container and then I'm
gonna call this text so I'm now gonna
create a container around this guy
so view and the view is gonna be the
container so I'm gonna say style I'm
gonna say style is that container and
then the text it's gonna get the text
style I don't know what text style I
want to add yet so I'm probably gonna
leave that off for now oh I'm gonna just
probably do font size and stuff so style
is you go to Styles dot text and this is
game at me because I have not imported
for you okay so here I want to say flex
one now similar to what you saw before
and you know what before I flex one I'll
show you guys what this looks like so
background color red for example notice
how this doesn't take up a lot of space
because right now the width of it is
depending on what the text size is but I
want the width of this view to expand
this whole width and break up into equal
parts so by saying flex one it should
split into fourths here say that again
for some reason it's making me saved
twice for it to refresh over here so now
you notice it splits and equal distance
is these guys notice the down here it
splits this into thirds cuz there's only
three of them we're gonna have to fix
that in a second the bottom one is a
special case so I'm gonna get rid of
this red because it's really hard to see
instead the background color I'm gonna
use for this is fa-fa-fa which is just
kind of an off color of white that looks
pretty nice um yep so we're gonna keep
the Flex and then the text artist set
text size as maybe like 36 pixels
I don't know if we want this bigger than
that text size Oh font size font size I
use the wrong property name and so you
notice these are not lined up right now
so what we can do is say a line items
Center on our container in an align our
text and that looks pretty good I can't
tell if that is I think I have to use
justify items as well it looks a little
off-center to me justify looks like
justify items is not a prop I think me
it's just by content they have all yeah
I think I saw justify content so here
are all the props that you can use for
styling tent
theoria so now are centered vertically
and horizontally that looks nice
so we have it as fa fa fa is her
background color and this is starting to
look pretty good now this bottom guy is
a special case and I want to kind of
differentiate the buttons here so I'm
thinking about adding a little border so
maybe first thing our row so set a
border bottom with one see what that
looks like okay maybe set the color too
I'm gonna get rid of the pink I think
that was only clever you're adding yeah
I'm gonna set the border color to white
alright you can just barely
differentiate these right now cuz this
is not very uh because this is an off
shade of white and that's white white I
might change what the color of this
we'll leave it for now
and then the button over here I kind of
want to add a wine right down here so
we're gonna say border right with is one
border color it's going to be white as
well border I spelled right wrong and I
spelled it right or wrong again there we
go so now we can see a little bit of a
border around the things I think we're
gonna have to change the color of one of
these guys maybe if I made this a guy
gray this might be too yeah Emily this
says how it is right now but we might
come back to it okay so notice this guy
down here we're gonna fix it so it moves
over nicely so the way we're gonna do
that is our enter we want it to take two
blocks here so instead of flexing one
we're gonna have it flex more than one
so that way it's 50% and these guys are
25% 25% each so we need to give it more
prominence basically so this button is
gonna be special so I'm gonna call it
I'm gonna pass in a prop called special
so I can either say special is equal to
true but yes lint does not like me using
that syntax same way you can say special
is equal to true it's by saying it like
this so now my button over here I have a
prop I can grab called special so we're
passing that in so none of these buttons
over here using the special prop only
the enter button is so whenever we get
the special prop is true
we know that this is the enter button so
we're gonna create a special container
style so we're gonna say special
container and we wanted to have all the
same styling as this one except flex a
different amount so I'm gonna call say
const base container and we're gonna
grab all the props oops all the styles
we have here and we are gonna share them
between these two containers and then
this one is just gonna flex two so if
you haven't seen the dot dot dot syntax
what that does is it takes all the stuff
we have here and puts it inside of that
object so see did that work I can't even
tell so oh yeah we didn't even do what
we need to do so here we're gonna say
special styles dot special container
otherwise so this is ternary if you've
never seen ternary how it works is if
this condition is true at the front then
it runs this code otherwise it runs this
code so we're gonna either apply special
container or regular container if it's
special we apply the special container
now I want to set a different background
color for this so we can move the
background color here and this
background color I picked out a special
color but in a color tech txt over here
this is a green color feel free to use
whatever color you like didn't copy that
correctly
and I'm also going to set the font color
so just color to white and comment that
and oh I need to pass that to my text so
I need to also create special text
because I want the text to be a
different color for this so do text
special text
and here we're gonna have I'm just gonna
copy it since it's literally only one
thing I guess you know what good
practice will say Const text base text
font size 36 and here we can actually
just set it to base since that's the
only thing we want base text base text
okay so now we're sharing that across
and we're gonna use the same ternary
operation here special style stock
special text otherwise please regular
text give us save so cool now we have
our enter button here and we have our
layout pretty much complete feel free to
alter this however you like this is just
the kind of basic one that I came up
with that we can clearly see the numbers
and stuff up here I might switch this up
as we were making this but this is a
decent start I'm pretty happy with this
and I think that's it for this video we
got this working nicely we'll start
adding more functionality now that the
layout is complete in our next video
that's it for this thanks for watching
