am a sophomore computer science student
at the University of Texas at Dallas now
this summer I will be interning at Bank
of America as a software engineer and I
want to make this video to explain how I
got my internship the first thing I did
was apply for the job through my
smallest job board now what I did is I
just put in my resume and about a week
later I heard that you're like we're
interested in you could you could we set
up a phone call with you for an
interview and so maybe a week later we
had the phone call and they basically
just did a little phone interview for me
now what they did is they asked me
questions some behavioral questions for
example I think what one was hey have
you ever worked in a team how did that
go and then after they did some
behavioral questions they were like
we'll give you a little technical
questions I guess this is what they
called technical questions first they
asked me if you like Java object
oriented stuff like what is
encapsulation what is inheritance that
sort of thing and then they got into
asking about databases I think to fancy
like what is a foreign key do indexes
speed up searches and that sort of thing
pretty basic stuff if you know if you're
familiar with databases that is and then
actually at the end they're just like do
you know what a for loop is so it was
actually kind of confusing why they
asked them at the end but anyway yeah so
I did well in that phone interview and
then they were like hey we wanted to do
a follow-up phone interview here's how
it's gonna work so we're gonna give you
two basically people that are gonna
interview you the first one is gonna
call you and then you're gonna get a
five-minute break and then the second
person is gonna call you back to back
and so I was like okay sure
alright so I get the first phone call
we chitchat for a little bit and then
he's like I have a technical question
for you and he asked me about Luther
about like a billion lines long and they
have different stuff on each line he
wants to know you basically wants to
diff the two files is there any lines on
the first file that's non second or
vice-versa so happy how would I do that
so the first thing I told and I just
said this is the first name problem to
my mind this is I know this is not the
fastest solution it's but I'll tell you
anyway it's the first thing I thought of
so obviously you could do a four route
to the first file it in each line you
run a for the second file and you're
like is this line in that file and if it
is you say okay there's a duplicate here
or there's not but this ran an N squared
time and I told him that he asked me
what the run time of the algorithm was
and then I was like but I know the
faster solution that we can do and that
is to run through the first file and add
each line to a dictionary or a hash
table and then do a for loop through the
second locked file and each line
compared look it up in the dictionary
and see if it's there and that's one way
you could dip the two files and he's
like an answer and he asked me what's
the runtime of the algorithm and hash
something into a dictionary it takes a
little one time then you're going
through the list one third twice but
you're not stacking for loops so I
thought it was open time that was right
he was happy with that solution and then
basically I just asked him a few
questions about what he did America and
that sort of thing and then that was it
I took the five-minute break and I got
my second call after my second call it
was a little bit different this guy just
wanted to chat a little bit and then he
was like hey I just asked you a real
question the one particular you asked me
I remember is if you're going to learn
technology and I just talked a little
bit about how I would
then after that about week later I got
an offer for make of America baked
America went pretty well I thought and
that's because I felt very comfortable
and you'll notice that once you start
answering the questions the same
questions pop up each time so eventually
you actually start memorizing your
speech of what you're going to say for
an interview and it makes it really easy
so I recommend just practicing and
confidence have confidence of what
you're saying it makes it super duper
easy so yeah that's how I got my
internship I had Bank of America so if
you liked this video give it a thumbs up
and don't forget to subscribe and if you
have any more questions about the
internship we should process or any of
that stuff you can leave a comment below
I'd be happy to answer your question
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
