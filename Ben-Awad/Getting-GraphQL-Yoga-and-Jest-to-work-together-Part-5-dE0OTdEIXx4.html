few different options to be able to
start the server run the tests on one
command so the first thing we're gonna
be trying is this library right here and
basically it's just a little utility
that will run two commands so we're
gonna install it and then what we have
to do is we're gonna add a new script
and our package of JSON so let's copy
this and let this download real quick
I'll miss a yarn add as a dev dependency
so capital - D and let that go and so
then in our package JSON and scripts
we're gonna add a CI or you could call
it whatever you like and we're gonna put
the name of the package and then here
we're gonna specify the name of our npm
command to start the server which is
going to be whatever we have in scripts
and then after that we specify the URL
so this is where your server is running
and then lastly the npm command to start
the test alright so let's look at
package of JSON go to our scripts and
add that stuff so I'm gonna call it CI
and then to run our server we say test
server and then we are running on the
local host 4000 and lastly we just run
test
that's our command to run tests to run
jest I mean alright so let's try this
out if I do yarn CI it should go ahead
and start up the server and then after
that run the tests and then we can just
close it all down afterwards and be done
so you can see server's running low
close 4000 awesome and here we can see
our test is now running and then when
that's finished cool it's passed we're
all done I can control C out and we're
done so that's a pretty good option it's
a little bit slow as you may imagine
took 6 seconds to run the Jes test which
I guess there's nothing we can do about
there that's probably just how long it
takes to drop the database but then also
start the server we're doing a lot
duplicate work
so what I wanted to try was this thing
called super test and what it allows you
to do is just pass in your express
object so here's Express they say
constant AB is equal to Express
and we use request app and then we can
make a request now graph heel yoga uses
Express under the hood so I thought this
might work and when I was debugging this
I almost got it to work but I actually
stumbled upon something I like even
better just because of how simple it is
I found this little gist which I'll link
and we're gonna use basically a very
small part of it that works nicely for
testing with graph QL yoga basically
when we run app start we can just pass
the port of 0 and then I'll go ahead and
I'll show you we can pass in the server
address and then this thing right here
but I'll explain that all right now all
right so to do this and our index is
what we need to do is conditionally
specify the port so here I'm gonna say
port and I'm gonna say process the
environment and we're gonna get the new
environment so if we're testing we want
to do
port 0 otherwise we want to work for
thousands all right so now we're going
to conditionally start it and I also now
need to save this so I'm gonna say call
it app and I'm gonna return that so now
I'm gonna call start server over here so
I'm going to say kotts and call app is
you get to start server and I'm going to
need to await that you'll notice I got
rid of the create tie form connection
the reason for that is we're already
creating the connection here so we don't
need to create it twice the other thing
we're returning this that's perfect
there's one small problem with running
it like this though and we'll see that
problem if I were to like run this right
now and that is start server dot I
thought when we import it right here and
get close these guys it's gonna run this
start server here and then it's gonna
call start server so basically it's
gonna be run twice because we're calling
it here and we're importing it and when
we import it it's getting called so
really what we need to do is create a
new file and maybe yeah whoops create a
new file called start server dot TS and
I'm just gonna move the the logic so all
this stuff to start server and I'm just
gonna export that and so then I'm gonna
call it here okay so now in our start
server the whole purpose was that is we
don't have the function call in this
file so now when I call index such TS
over here we're still starting the
server because we're calling start
server but now over here I am not
calling it so all right so I have this
app so now I want to get the port and we
just need to import this from a
different location now so they're real
so comps and I'm gonna say ports is
equal to AB dot address
okay and really what we need to have is
the port B I'm gonna say so before I was
saying the host was constant I now need
to create basically a little function
here where I'm gonna say the Const and I
have a safe Const get port or I'll say
I'll call it get host and by default
it's going to return an empty string but
I'm gonna set get host equal to so we're
gonna make this let that way we can
redefine this function so I'm gonna say
get host is now equal to a string and
the string is going to be HTTP 127.0.0.1
it's when we specify the port of 0 all
right so we have this we set our get
host function and so here instead of
just using the hard-coded host we're
gonna use get hos there might be a
better way to do this supposed to
getting the port here and whatnot but
this should work because before all
should finish running before everything
but yeah let's give this a try so just
oops not just just beyond test so didn't
start up any server we're just basically
letting all of our test code run and
nice so I went ahead and passed it
worked awesome and now we didn't even
have to start up a server
well at least externally we just run
that one command with this so this is
the way I like it and I think I have
basically a decent set up for now doing
tests and how I'm going to be doing
tests in the future
we can go ahead and just clean up a
little bit of code so we don't need this
comment anymore
and in our package up JSON we can kill
both of these and then also we can just
uninstall that library because we don't
actually need it so you could use this
if you want to I'm gonna do it this way
just do yarn remove get rid of that
package and then we have testing working
pretty nicely I'm not sure how I want to
kind of like share this code across
multiple I guess tests so I'm not sure
how I'm gonna do that quite yet but
basically like if I create right now
this is registered test if I create I
don't know login test I don't want to
basically run I guess I get some export
my before all logic and to like a
function that I can call multiple places
or maybe I need to create like a global
before all if there's a way to do that
so I have to look at Jess and check that
out that's it for this video guys thanks
for watching
