be doing is working on this page we want
to create recipes and then hopefully see
them on the home page and before we
begin give that a try I want to come
over here to our routes real fast and
just remove the authentication from home
because you should be able to see all of
them whether you're off in kid or not so
let's just fill this out so put ABCD
chooser spm edge it's to Tino face and I
submit okay I'm not sure what happened
there looks like it all went to the
header for some reason oops
so let's look at what's going on in this
address beef one I can close the rest of
these mom and recipe you know
okay so handle submit you prevent the
default and then I call this the props
to add recipe and add recipe is getting
plugged request add recipe there we go
quest add recipe that might have been it
so now we'll go through this again
ABC and that didn't seem and seem to
have done the same thing so I'm not sure
it'll submit or preventing the default
here this should be called so console
dot log and I'll submit and the console
dot log function called
let's see if those are happening so as
if I submit ok refresh if I submit
recipe name and image are required so
let's add both of those submit and I
need to preserve the log
ok that's waiting to do and then we
should be able to see what's happening I
saw an air um I'm assuming it's because
that was blank
I hope this up props thought address P
is not a function so could it be request
address here was that recipe saying
request that recipe right request that
recipe is not a function um this stuff
props that request address P is it
because request at recipe doesn't exist
okay nope I'm just a little noob here
again I Street recipe and we see me I
made the same mistake here yep and I did
let's just chain all these recipe and
I'm assuming single recipe ideas it may
take two yeah alright save myself some
trouble so now let's try that again so
if you didn't
that the problem was I just forgot to
get use the right path so ad that I 1 I
2 I 3
stop stop stuff submit alright now we're
talking okay
request entity is too large and okay
we've come across this problem before
this is a feathers jeaious problem and
if I actually just go to my github we
just need to add something to the server
code and we did this before so forget
what we did I'll just click on the
server and we can look at it what hat
what I did and here we go we just need
to add a limit so I'm going to stop the
server source app and in our body parser
here we can create a limit of 50
megabytes 50 megabytes all right start
server backup and now when I submit I
don't even need to refresh should be
able to go through function called and
awesome we're able to submit it to the
server so now we know for sure that
there is a recipe so we should be seeing
recipes here so this is a real problem
that we need to address so let's take a
look at that um oops sorry keep going
the wrong direction there first thing
that I want to do is just remove these
console logs because that is working now
but view is good at least here so let's
go to the home view let's go on see
what's going on there so this step
prompts the recipe I'm assuming the
style recipe is
what's happening there so we're not
authenticated so okay so we we required
authentication for this view and we
really shouldn't have so we can fix that
so source middle we're not Middle where
we services excuse me recipes hooks okay
so when do we want to authenticate so
you're going to thin to Kate not on find
not on get the authenticate on create
them and on update and on patch so put
off indicate there and there and there
okay so now we're no longer
authenticating for find or get which we
don't want to because we want to have a
user who is not logged in I be able to
access and see all the recipes here so
now when i refresh um recipes up maps
not a function okay so let's see what's
going on there let's see if what recipes
is equal to so connected here oh that's
actually not what we need this is the
just the recipes view um recipes ok
recipes is an object and okay so we just
need to pass data that's all so now we
can go to our recipe sagas let's recent
recipes payload
our recipes here this needs to be ESPYs
dot data area now let's see Gary propper
your sub screen of undefined and that's
because we have some objects in a
database that are probably posing errors
so I'm going to do is I'm just going to
go to postman real quick and delete them
so when this is loaded up what I'll do
is all first authenticate BAM so we have
that now now we can see which objects
are causing problems so if we go to
recipes the problem ones are this
something something so that those have
these of idea IDs looking like that so I
can delete those and the header need
authorization passing in my token oops
what I do there and then at the end here
ooh what's going on ok it looks like it
auto fix it I was going to say because
there is a quote at the end here so we
can copy this and then go to localhost
30-30 slash recipes slash and ID and we
can delete it and we can delete this one
too and now when I do a get require a
fine request it should only need one it
does so now when i refresh nice this
shows up now I think there should have
been an image for you so let's click on
this and see
um card group connect home press P image
URL am I using image URL here card
header let's see image image URL
this is just a lowercase URL let's like
split this valuables again yeah just
lowercase URL so like that all right
awesome so we have that showing up now
so that's good for now
rest it for this video and the next one
we'll worry about sorting because I
don't think we're showing the most
recent one here
and to sort those we might actually need
to create a hook like we did last time
to add the was created to the database
so that's in store for the next video
and I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
