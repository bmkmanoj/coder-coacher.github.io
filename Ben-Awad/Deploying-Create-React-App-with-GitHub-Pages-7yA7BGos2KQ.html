to put your create react application on
github pages right here is a sample
application that I have here this is a
react app it's super simple it's got two
pages I can click on this little link to
go back and forth and it's using react
router and you'll notice how there's
this little hash here which is a little
weird and the reasons for that is I had
to use hash router to get to work on
github pages and the other weird thing
you might find is hey that doesn't look
like github pages that is Vinod com and
the reason why it has that instead of
like Vinod com dot github dot right
because this is my github on username
and that's the usual prefix that you see
when you do a github pages I have a
custom domain Benoit comm and so that
replaces the cubed I I apart that's why
it looks weird so if I went to this URL
which we can go to it allows we just get
redirected to Ben Awad com
so it's the same thing this is hosted on
github so let's go through how this
actually works so the code is on github
right here and there's two branches a
master branch and a github pages branch
the master branch is where my actual
react application sets you have pages
this is the static website so we're
going to take this react application we
see on the master branch make it into
static files and put them here so let's
look at the code for this so first let's
start with package.json because there's
some stuff you change the first thing is
you put the home page of where where
your application sits so right here I
have been Awadh calm but if you are what
you would do is you put your github
username then dot github I like that I'm
replacing banana wad with your github
username I
this because I'm using a custom domain
and then this is the name of your
repository right here so my repository
has name that and that's why you see
that there I also installed the github
pages as just a Deb dependency and the
reason for that is I run github pages -
Dee build whenever I deploy so these two
I added to my scripts so all I do is I
run NPM run deploy so NPM run deploy
whenever I want to like deploy a new
version of the site or make changes and
what that'll do is they'll actually
bundle react and put it into a build
folder so if I just do tree build we can
see this is what it looks like this is
the static site this is what the react
turns into so it runs that and it
uploads it to github for me so that's
what the package of JSON looks like had
it install that dependency and I'm using
react router Dom now you can't just do
regular react router on this page you
actually have to use a hash router
that's why you notice there's a hash tag
right here in the URL right there and
the reason for that is github server
doesn't handle a browser router
correctly now and create react router or
and create react apps documentation they
do have a link that shows you how you
can get browser router work but I've
never had any luck get it to work so go
always just used hash router when doing
a multi-page react application that I
want on github so been using hash router
and it's a one for one replacement with
browser router I didn't have to change
any other code so here's what my routes
look like I'm passing in these two pages
in the pages you'll notice how I just
have links they look regular the -
there's nothing special about them I
don't have to tell them to use a hash
router they know and then you'll notice
I also got rid of the service worker in
react router the service worker just did
not work for github pages I'm not sure
exactly why so I just removed it and
everything
smoothly so that's how I got my site up
and running on here so I just made those
changes and just do an NPM run deploy
takes my code bundles it into this build
uploads it to github and then it's live
right here so if I come over here you
can also come to your settings and you
can kind of see here's github pages
little settings page I can add a custom
domain if I want do HTTP and I can
choose which branch so this is the
branch have it on and it'll give you the
little link of to go check it out and of
course I have a custom domain right now
Benoit comm set for it that's why I have
it switched over so as you can see this
code is up on github I'll link this in
the description if you want to come see
how this is made but there's really
nothing special about this at all all
you need to do if you want to get your
site up or your react on vacation up on
github is make a repo add your home page
download github pages put these two
lines and your scripts and then do
github pages or NPM run deploy and
deploy it and then if you're using react
route or go ahead and switch in a hash
router so that's it that's how you set
it up on github pages and now everyone
can come visit your website so I
encourage you I'll put a link in
description below for this if you want
to come check out this little site here
come visit this see if you can check it
out
so thanks for watching guys that's it
for this video and I'll see in the next
one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
