to be showing you how a nation works in
feathers so right now if you want to
change how it works for a single service
how you would do it is have the basics
feather server up here I went to the
source there in the services and then I
picked my bagel service and then I
clicked on the service file underneath
that and you should see something like
this now paginate right here is what
controls how paging works and I'm just
going to start up the server and then
console.log it so you can see what it
looks like so just do NPM start in this
folder and you see it says default 10
max 50 now I'm just going to come over
here at the postman and show you houses
working so if I just send a request to
my bagel service as a get request you'll
notice I get 10 bagels back
that's what limit tells us total tells
us how many bagels there are and the
entire database and then skip allows us
to move forward and you notice this
limit 10 matches the default here so if
we change the default if we don't change
you know go pass any parameters in
that's how many we'll get back in a
request and then max is the maximum you
can request so let's say the defaults 10
both say I only want to what I can do is
I can at the end here say limit and put
a two and then we get this and this can
also be done just like with the feathers
client if you wanted to do this for
example and react so notice how you only
have two here now or I could ask for 20
and I get 20 so here's a limit basically
tell sects how many you're going to get
back but notice I can do this all the
way up to 50 but let's say if I try to
get 60 it doesn't let me limits me it
stopped and doesn't let me go pass that
so that's what limit is doing now I just
want to show you kind of how skip is
working and how if you want to do pages
in your application how that may at work
so notice how we have eleven seven and
70 here
I do skip dollar sign skip that's how
they do it you'll notice how it just
shifted everything up by one shift it up
by 2 you should see three here and then
960 and then this is a new one we
haven't seen before so if I want to get
a fresh page I could do skip 10 and I
could skip 20 and you can just basically
go through the whole just keep going
through all the different bagels or all
of your different items in your servers
that's how skipping limit is working now
let's say we want to change the default
or the max I would like to get only 5
bagels back or maybe I want to get only
20 bagels back by default what you can
do is you can go to your service and
paginate is literally just an object
instead of getting what the global
default is you can just pass your own
object in default maybe I want oh no 32
that's that's just what I want and max I
want to I want to say you can't get any
more than 75 and now can rerun this you
can see our changes and now if I just on
this by default we now are getting 32
back and now I can get all the way up to
limit I can now get 75 bagels if I
wanted to but then still so I want to
try to get 80 doesn't let me so that's
how paging works and feathers that's how
you can change it back here and this
changes it per service and you can now
customize your app to change how many
you're getting back per page so thank
you guys for watching and please leave a
comment below if you're interested and
more in depth video on how paging works
I'm thinking about doing one with react
where I show you how to do with the
client and I do kind of like an infinite
scroll or I'll show you how to like just
key
loading items as you scroll down the
page so thank you guys for watching and
I'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
