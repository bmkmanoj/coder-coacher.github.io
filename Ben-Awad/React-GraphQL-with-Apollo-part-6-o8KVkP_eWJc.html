video we're going to be adding the login
page so it's basically the same thing as
the sign up page young mr. off by just
copying the signup page and the login
page and we can go from there ok so the
imports are just going to stay all the
same of course I can rename this the
login login page constructors who must
say exactly the same because we're going
to have a state with you using me and
password that they're going to be
putting in and tangles them it's going
to be exactly the same to accept it's
going to be a login prop that we're
going to create down below with a
mutation not sign up and then through
our form I believe this stage exactly
the same when we just look it over so we
username we're going to user name again
or an update the same way password same
thing yep so that's going to stay
exactly the same sort of sign up so
we're going to say walk in and then our
a query changes a little bit here we're
going to create a login mutation going
to be now login it actually stays
exactly the same and if you want to come
over here to our interactive you'll see
login is exactly the same we just grab a
token now and we don't even really want
the ID it's a token and then we also
would like to get some we could also get
data like for example if you want to get
the secret burritos for that user we
could I don't think we really want to
for now I'm just going to just grab the
token and that's it all right now for
our actual function here we're now I'm
going to be login login page
and we're going to be using the login
mutation and going to call it login
we're going to be passing email password
and then for this one I actually want to
put the result I just want to console
dot log the result that way we can see
if the login was successful or not and
then we're just going to go to the
homepage ok and that was really fast we
finished doing the log in this work so i
created a bog follow up here awesome we
got an object here see if it shows shows
the token ok look perfect ok so the last
thing we want to do which will actually
rule this will be a short video will do
this in the next video is I want to be
able to click create secret burrito and
it creates a secret burrito for me and I
can see it pop up right here so in the
next video we will be working on hooking
up this button and finishing up this
website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
