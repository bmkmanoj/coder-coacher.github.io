video on learning terminal or command
line so I want you to open terminal I'm
on a Mac computer so it's terminal for
me unlike any type of Linux will be very
similar if not the same commands and if
you're on Windows I recommend
downloading PowerShell or cygwin they're
very good and very similar to terminal
on Mac and you'll be able to follow
along so when you open up terminal it'll
give you a little prompt like this
unless a little squiggly um this is your
home directory and in the name of the
user so the users been awad so I've been
wat here so the squiggly signifies
something important this is your home
folder and you can I'm just have the
home folder open on bin Awad and finder
here you can see I have all these
folders here but I currently have you
could think of this as the home folder
open on my terminal and I don't see
anything so how do I actually see files
you type LS and hit enter it will
display all the files and folders and
your terminal notice there's looks like
there's a lot more here than there is
over there notice how there's these dots
in front of them with LS it doesn't show
those by default you have to do it a
special with this flag which we won't
talk about right now so if you just type
LS we'll see some different folders
documents downloads and you'll see same
thing is over here now similar to find
her I can click in so let's say I want
to go to the desktop I can click on the
desktop item and it'll just go right
into the desktop now to do the same
thing in terminal it's called CD its
genes for change directory and then you
would move into say the desktop and you
hit enter and now you notice how this
changes from a squiggly to the word
desktop you have now moved to the
desktop folder and now we can do LS and
will notice different folders and files
are now here
now and you know finder I can hit this
back arrow and it'll take me up a
directory now this sometimes doesn't
always take you back but for now let's
say it takes you back up to the main to
do that in terminal you CD dot dot dot
dot means you go up a directory so you
know some back down to the squiggly and
I can see the back to desktop and we now
desktop now notice when I did CD desktop
that is what's called a relative path so
in finder here I can see desktop it's
inside my home directory it is basically
anything that is you're telling it from
the current location that you're in how
do you get to the destination so from
the home folder all I do is I move
directly to desktop but let's say from
desktop how would I get to say the
documents well I was CD i would first go
up a directory taking me to the home and
then i would then go to documents and
that's basically the path to get to
document so if i type in ER and that's a
relative path because i'm saying
relative to desktop I go up to and then
to documents now a different way is this
is called absolute path so I can do the
till day which means the home directory
and then the till day special you can't
for example I couldn't just say start at
desktop and then go to you know
something else so for example a folder
you have on your desktop the till date
is special so this would be an absolute
path so I could go from any folder I
could do CD till day and then go into
downloads for example so for example if
I want to get over to documents I could
do this documents till they documents um
but in documents I couldn't just CD
downloads because there is no folder in
documents we just do an LS these are the
folders in my documents folder you'll
notice
these are downloads so you can't just
say CD downloads want to get to CDs or
to get to downloads from documents I
have two ways I can do a relative path
where I can go up one and then go to
downloads or I can do the absolute path
where I do starting from the home
directory I then go to downloads like
that both of those work um and you can
go like this as many times as you want
each time you're going up a directory so
for example we could go all the way up
to the very top of the computer so we're
currently at / which is the top of the
computer and then we can go back to our
home by just doing CD and then the
squiggly will take us back to the home
directory so this is how you would
navigate around different folders by
seeding different places and then you do
LS to look at the files inside the
folders that you're in and so there's
two different ways you could either do
it with absolute or relative are the two
ways you can move around and tell them
where to go using CD so that's kind of
the basics of how CD works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
