that we are a part of and that we've
created so I'm currently logged in as
Bob 17 he has created team one and Team
two and because he's the owner he should
be able to create channels and invite
people but I'm also part of team a and
cool team and these teams I'm a member
of but I don't have owner status so I
should not be able to create channels or
invite people but it still lets me do
that right now
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
add a permission to our back-end to stop
that from happening and then we're gonna
also honor front it not even display
these items if they are not the owner of
the team so let's start with the backend
over here so with our create channel we
want to first make it require
authentication right now you can create
a channel and not even be locked in the
way we have it set up so let's first
guard against that and the way we do
that is by using this requires off
function that we have so paste that in
and I'm just going to say requires auth
dot create resolver
and wrap the whole thing I went one too
far the real so now our create channel
you have to be logged in at least to
create a channel but now in our try a
try-catch here we need to also check
whether you're the owner of this team so
if we check our schema notice how we're
getting the team ID here so what we can
do is we can actually fetch the team
that this is associated with some
mistake haunts team is equal to a weight
models team got five one and we're gonna
say where I'm going to say ID is equal
to our X dot team ID and I'm gonna make
this a tall query so now I can just
check if we'll save team that ID or will
say owner it's not equal to user to ID
and the user we get whoever is logged in
then we want to return an error so we're
gonna say okay is false and airs for an
array and the path here we're gonna say
name and message is going to be you have
to be the owner of the team to add to
create channels
okay otherwise we should get past this
little if statement block that we check
here and await the response all right so
we shouldn't see this button but let's
see we should be stopped from actually
making a team here so when I create the
team we cannot read property channels of
undefined not sure why we're getting
that I don't see any errors here if i
refresh let's make sure nothing pops up
good doesn't look like it's getting
created let's look deeper at that
message though and see why we're getting
an error message like that so cannot
read property channels of undefined so
that looks like it's in our update
function so if I come over here to team
modal or add channel modal right here
we're saying after the create team if
it's not okay we just return which
doesn't look like it's happening we put
okays false so why don't we in our
console dot log oh it could be in our
optimistic UI here that could be
breaking things I think that's what's
happening so let's just do a console log
here and log okay there you know let's
log create channel this is the response
from our mutation and we can see what
the values it takes yep so it looks like
okay it's true and it's undefined and in
that case false so the okay true here is
because of the optimistic UI we have
here so it thinks creating a channel
will work but it actually doesn't all
right so we're not gonna really worry
about trying to fix this error from
happening I'm instead really just gonna
hide this button from the user if
they're not an owner now we want to do
the same thing for inviting people
making sure you can't invite people when
you're not the owner of a team and that
should already be good I believe if we
head over to our resolver our team
resolver here add member we're checking
if a team owner is not equal to the user
ID so let's add Bob at Bob 17 so I am
Bob 17 let's might Bob 18 to this team
we should get an error yep cannot add
members to team awesome ideally we show
that error here but I'm not gonna worry
about fixing that now in our front end
we're just gonna prevent them from
checking that now the way I was doing
that last time is so this is HIPAA xur
UI in my graph QL over here I was trying
to add an owner like this right and the
reason for that is I thought the owner
was just an integer like it is in our
database
but I forgot and my schema I made owner
a user which makes sense but we don't
really actually need to have the whole
user so I'm just gonna make this an
integer for now because our team should
return the owner which is an integer
because if I look at my user I use them
user model or my team notice how we have
a Association to user and we call it
owner so this is going to be an integer
of the ID which is all we really need to
check whether they're the owner or not
so we're going to change that to an int
and then we might come back and change
this to a user type if we need
more data in the future so now when I
grab the owners here we shouldn't get
any problems let's see all right cool so
no airs so now in our sidebar over here
we get past I believe we get past the
team yep the current team and we pass
that to our channels we also pass the
team ID we also want to pass in the
owner ID so so owner is it gonna be
equal to team owner
so in our channels over here we can grab
that prop and then we can conditionally
render this so if owner is equal to the
current user and how we're going to get
the current user so that is stored in a
JWT token and this is really logic that
shouldn't go in this component itself so
what I'm gonna do is pass do the check
up here my sidebar since we are already
even decoding the token here and then
just pass the result to this channels
component because what I was gonna do is
grab this owner and do something like
local storage dot get item and get the
token and look at the token and see
whether their user or whatever up here
before I render well let's not even
bother with that let's just say pass is
owner so if is owner is true then we
want to display this chunk right here
which is invite people and then in our
channel right here we have a little add
a little plus icon we only want to
display that if they are the owner so if
his owner is true then we'll go ahead
and display that otherwise we won't so
now in our sidebar up here we have the
user and now what we can do is we can
say
const i will say let is owner is equal
to false and is owner is equal is set
the true if user to ID is equal to team
owner so the team we get past in here is
the current team so if the current
team's owner is equal to the user ID we
get from the token then we're gonna set
is owner and pass it in here so is owner
is equal to is owner and now i'm gonna
get rid of this owner i have here okay
so now you can see we don't see the
little plus in the whole thing here for
the cool team but if i come over here to
a team that i actually own like team one
i see both of these and now if i try to
add a channel it should still work
because I own this team but now I don't
even see this value here so that's
awesome
so that is a nice little addition now I
want to do one other quick thing and
this is kind of an optional thing
because right now what we have works and
I want to talk about how we're grabbing
the invite teams right now if we look at
how this query is working I believe it's
right here this is a little bit small
but we are doing a I believe inner join
see if we can find the word inner join
here yep here's inner join and we're
joining members and then with that we
are also joining on to the user to use
their table so we're basically doing
appears in the other join so enter join
1 enter join two to grab the users and
the members which makes sense because if
we look here we're saying team we want
to include the user and for it to do
that because this is a many-to-many
relationship it has to join basically
this table with the member table and the
member table with this so the two joints
but we actually only care about looking
for the user ID so we don't actually
need the whole user table we're actually
sufficient with just the member table so
we can simplify this to one join
with the team and the member table so
I'm gonna show you guys how to do that
so you saw how we use this include last
time sometimes there's things that
sequel I just can't do and I believe
this is one of them where you can just
enter joining with a table era not that
I know of
so we're what they allow you to do is
actually write the sequel query yourself
so that's what we're gonna be doing and
it's very simple
we're gonna write and it'll save us one
joint so optimizing the performance now
if you just want to keep it like this
we're here should get the same result
and it's just one extra joint but I'm
gonna be showing you how to make change
this into a little bit more optimized so
I'm gonna get rid of this for now or why
don't I comment this out so you guys can
see the before and after so copy that
and we'll get rid of this here so now
we're gonna do models dot C equal eyes
dot query so just like this and then
we're gonna pass in a model to tell it
which model we want to create so it's a
teen model that it's going to be
creating and then notice how you can add
replacements here and put question marks
and it takes whatever you have here and
puts it where the question mark is so
I'm gonna move the UI over cuz we not
gonna do that anymore so query and so
the first thing here I'm gonna put it's
just the model which is gonna be models
dot team because that's what we want to
get and then we're gonna write our query
so here we're gonna select all from
teams and remember our database actually
has underscores or is camel cased or not
camel cased snake case so it's gonna be
like user underscore ID
so from teams and then we're gonna enter
join so enter or was it we can just say
join an upstate inner join join users we
don't need users members on and we're
going to say team ID is equal to ID and
ID here is our team and I kind of wrote
this backwards but it doesn't matter so
grabbing the where the ID is equal to
the team ID so team ID is and members
IDs and teams and then we're just gonna
do a where and here we're gonna be
looking for the on our members we have a
user ID where that's equal to whatever
the current user is so that's a little
question mark so that's our query and
I'm gonna say that
and it just crapped out I think this is
I'm just trying to see if I have any
kind of error here it could be this big
comment block oh I need to wrap this
with an R there we go so I just forgot
to put a little print to see right there
so here's our query I'm gonna add the
replacements believe it's called hip
replacements I put in the same thing and
I use my model the model should go here
too so replacements
and the only thing we're gonna replace
is one question mark with the ID we have
here it's a user ID so if I didn't make
a mistakes will see this query and see
if we get the same thing on our
front-end alright cool so it looks like
it worked and we didn't get any errors
because we get the same result here now
just to show you this is what the sequel
I squeak created so it did this but then
it also did one more join so it did that
and then it did join user on user ID is
equal to and then users ID
and this is the users table so join on
the users table and then where user
underscore ID is equal to user ID but we
don't need that part because we don't
need to know anything about the user we
just care about that user ID okay so
there we go
so sometimes in your code you're gonna
have to write your own sequel queries so
that's why it's good write sequel it's
not that big of a loss if you were to
write this but it is slightly optimized
to do that all right so I think
everything is working the same with this
it looks good so that's it for this
video guys thank you for watching
I think next what we're gonna do is
start working on our little message pane
right here and get some messages popping
up and then maybe typing some stuff into
this form so as always the codes gonna
be up on github and you can check it out
if you want to see anything we coded in
this video so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
