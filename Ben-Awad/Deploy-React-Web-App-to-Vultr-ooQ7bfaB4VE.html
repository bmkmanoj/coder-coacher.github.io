to show you how to host a real react
application on bolter now for this we're
going to actually need a react
application that we want to put into
production and host so for this I'm
going to be using the menu unki
application and I actually just upgraded
this so if you're following along and
things look different that's because I
just did a bunch of work on this and
updated it so if you follow along with
the video series and have your own copy
Biggs might be slightly different you
should be able to follow on just the
same but if you want yours to look
exactly like mine I recommend coming in
cloning the repos so I'm just going to
start straight from here and just start
cloning them over so I'm going to start
from scratch show you guys how you can
do it so I'm going to get cloned the
client and I'll call it client I'm going
to CD in the client and I'm just gonna
type yarn so it installs and then I'm
going to go to be back-end as well and
clone that to get cloned and I'll just
call it server and seeding the server
and yarn alright so one of these
dependencies finish installing and once
they're installing what we're going to
do just actually get things set up so
the first thing we're going to be doing
is actually combining kind of a client
in the server into one usually what I do
is I'd start the client server over here
and then I would go over here and I
would start the server over here like
for example I'd be like NPM start and
this would start out the server on both
coasts 30 30 and then run NPM start over
here and then this would start up the
server on low close 3000 and I have your
react app running here and your server
running here and the two would
communicate over HTTP and talk out way
well--we're I actually do is we're going
to have the feather server here post the
client eerie act act because
we can do you're not aware I could just
go into package of JSON there is a build
that we can do and we run NPM built this
will actually generate static files that
we can give to feathers but before we do
that we're going to have to go into our
source modules and then our index and we
just need a change because we're no
longer going to be whoops we're no
longer going to be using localhost so
you want to change all your basically
anyplace you have localhost you want to
change it to just an empty string and
then like for example service users
we're actually going to make a post
request like slash users and it's the
reason you could do that is because it's
going to be on the same server so we're
fine just leaving this empty so the
other source modules you can then just
set that empty it out looks good so NPM
run build that guy is good to go when we
run the NPM run build what it's going to
do is it's going to spit out a folder
called build and it's just going to have
all the HTML and JavaScript needed for
our website and then when that's
finished we're going to do is we're
going to come back over to our server
here and you see this public folder
right here we're just going to kill that
and we're going to replace it with what
build oops we're going to place it with
the build that happens and if you notice
we just open-source IGS you can see
what's happening is we're serving all
the static files from that public folder
when we go to the root index so let's
see if it's finished it is so I'm going
to just go up a folder go into om I did
it oh look at that
I accidentally copied the file and to
client so I get cloned into client
that's
and cause a problem for this but those
silly to do so I'm just going to copy
the build folder and go make it public
so now I have this now if I do NPM start
and I do not start the client this is
only starting the server I can then come
to localhost 3030 and we should to your
application running and should work as
usual we can click on it you can do all
the stuff you thought you would but
there's a small problem with it right
now I just like so if I click on for
example to sign a page it works right
but if I like refresh we get a 404 page
not found and the reason for this is I
go to source app just what I was just
showing you this app got use is only
works on the home route so what we need
to do is we need to copy it and paste it
right above middleware and do a star so
now any route that is not the index
route and is not any of these routes so
it's not authentication it's not any of
the services there's going to be caught
by our react application and that's what
we want so for example sign up sign up
does not the root index it is not
service so it should be caught by our
application and we should sir we should
handle a reactor outer on one thing with
this is will no longer get four or four
messages like for example if I was put
in a rapid or during this reactor outer
handles that now not other server so
adding that and adding a star here
handles that so now if I just restart
this and we come back over here and I
click on that I don't notice how the
react app location is rendered cool so
now I working all nicely and looks good
so what I'm going to do is all we need
to do now is put this on a server so I'm
going to actually get stash that I
should have I wanted to go into a
different branch before I actually
maybe I can so I just want to switch
branches so masters kind of been my
development branch and then create a new
branch forget and I'm going to call it
production and then get status cool that
make a commit I'm just going to say
ready for production so it's now all
good to go so now we're we can start
doing stuff with vulture so the first
thing we're going to do is actually not
create an instance but set up an SSH key
so if you create a vulture account and
then just go into their panel back here
instead of instances you can click on
SSH key so I'm going to add an SSH key
and we're just going to follow their
tutorial on how to generate one I'm
going to show you how to do it with Mac
but if you have a Windows you can follow
the Windows one so I'm just going to run
this command and we can make it more
secure why not so we run that I'm going
to keep the default I'm going to go
ahead and overwrite I'm going to leave
it empty empty passphrase and it created
my key and now we can cat that and I'm
going to do PD copy if you if you don't
if you don't want PD copy we can do is
you can just cat and copy the output and
then you go back here and you paste in
what the output of that key was and you
can give it to name I'm just going to
call it my my temp SSH key and we're
going to add it okay cool so we created
our SSH key this allows us to SSH into
our instance later so now we're going to
go ahead and create an instance so I'm
going to plus sign to deploy any one I'm
located in your Dallas so I'm going to
click this Dallas one but you want to
click the location
it's basically nearest to you or where
you think your users are going to be and
then you can click your server type I'm
going to be using Ubuntu I'm going to be
using the newest one but you can click a
different one if you like but the
installs going to be slightly different
the process is the same though it would
be like different commands if you like a
different operating system better and
then you can click on the server size
you want I'm just going to use the
cheapest one that's available for this
example and then additional features you
can add these all go ahead and enable IP
version 6 we don't have any startup
scripts that we want and I'm going to
click this H key I created and the
server name I'm just going to call it
menu monkey so we can deploy that and
that will mount install and create our
server now what this is actually like a
virtual machine and it's an actual
computer running on their server that
we're basically that we're using ok so
we just let this thing finish installing
and when it is we're going to click on
this and we can already just copy this
this is our IP address for our server
and it's getting it what we're going to
go to so for example here we would go to
localhost to test our application we're
actually going to be going to this URL
to test our application and to SSH n
we're going to SSH and then we type root
for the user and we can paste in what
oops what's the IP addresses here and
then also when this is done installing
if you click on this it'll show you the
user and password that sets up for the
initial one so I'm just going to refresh
and see if it's finished
ok its resizing so it's almost done ok
cool let's look at this so right here
that was IP address it'll give you all
your staff that you have your OS and
then here's your username and password
for the user and if I click on that I
can show you my password I'm not going
to and then also there's this button
called view console here I'm going to be
doing every
think through SSH but if you didn't want
to ask this h you can actually just
click on you console and you could go do
it that way and they'll basically give
you a console they can do everything and
then we can just try SSH in and seeing
if it's ready and cool it it so once we
have this h we are in here and you
should see a prompt like this now I'm
going to just split screen because we're
basically just going to go through and
run a bunch of installation things so
okay so now here we're just going to
follow along with this digitalocean
tutorial on how to install in nginx on a
bun too and it's actually very easy
we're already up to date all we're going
to do is we're going to install it and
we'll hit yes and then after that we're
actually just good to go we don't have
to worry about any of the firewall stuff
they have some more information on how
it works and how you can configure it if
you'd like to read this I'll put all the
documents I'm going to use for this in
the description below but just running
that we can now go to that IP address
that we're given by voltar
if we just go to that in our URL we
should see an engine X welcome screen
because we just installed it if you got
that you're good to go to the next step
so next thing to do is we're going to be
using MongoDB at least that's what our
application uses so we're going to need
to install it so run that to install
Mongo and then when that's done running
we'll have Mongo installed and we
actually don't even need to check
anything that the next thing is
installing node because our application
will be using node and then this is how
you install on bun to we're just going
to copy this one actually no we're not
we're going to copy this one because we
want version 7 of node and then we're
going to install a node get after that's
finished I don't think we need this
build essentials but we might
and we can install nodejs now and then
when that's done we'll actually have
node on our computer and also MPM so
we're going to run node and with the - V
flag make sure you get seven and the
next thing we can do is we can set up
our application our NPM application and
actually before we go through setting up
this I want to just clone our
application so we ever back-end here and
I made that production
I made that production branch and I want
to push that to get hub so I can then
get push origin production so I can then
clone it for my computer okay so that's
pushing up and now on my back to the
vulture server we have I can clone the
code that I want so I'm just going to
get cloned
this this will be the server and I can
see D into server so now I can do get
check out branch and the branch we want
to check out is production so now we
have all that code that we have that we
wanted before and what I can do is I can
do NPM start oops
increase we have an old an errand let's
see what that's about
so you'll notice this might happen to
you
and you get some errors if you want to
just put them to a log you can like this
NPM start to caret sign log and I'll
print everything to log and you can do
them log you can see up that's right so
I forgot to run npm install on that to
install the dependencies so when that's
done we will stir up the server and when
we start up the server what's going to
happen is it's going to be on will be
able to go here on 3030 and use
application
just fine but what we want to do is we
want to be able to go to here without
the port number and that's why we're
using engine X which then will allow us
to do exactly with this either the
reverse proxy server and then we'll set
to whatever what we want and it'll do
its thing so now I can do NPM start
while I'm inside the server and now if I
go to not localhost but if I go to here
my IP and do 30 30 it should render the
application now I should be able to if
we can open up console and we can see if
we're getting errors I should be able to
sign up create a new user here log in
and should be able to add a recipe
so first oops first recipe and we can
add one click get the timo from our
desktop I 1 I 2 stuff and we can submit
and cool we see a recipe and we're good
so applications we're working good we
notice it was like I was saying it's
just on 30 30 so we want to change that
and that's why we're going to spell and
follow this for in turn X and that's why
we actually setup engine X so we can
control seeing cancel out of starting up
or server and what we're going to do is
we're going to go to this directory I
prefer using them instead of Nano so
open up this file using nano if you
prefer I'm going to use them and then
like it says I'm going to look for the
location called or sorry the place in
the file named location so if you're in
them you can do a slash and then
location and then it'll take you to the
places location and then I'm going to
remove all the stuff and location I'm
going to paste and this now the only
thing we want to change is instead of a
DAT
we want 30 30 because that's what our
websites running on and we can cancel
out of that and save it and now we're
good to go we can run this through
though engine X to make sure we did it
correctly the dash t flag and then
here's the last thing we're going to do
just restart nginx with a new
configuration so now that we did that we
can do NPM start and now just what
happens if I don't start the server of
course when I come here I'm going to get
site not reached but now that I do NPM
start and I come here we should be
seeing our application and we do and
everything works as we it would expect
it to so that's awesome and now your
this is a really look really good way to
set up your application but there's one
extra thing I was I recommend doing you
don't have to do this if you go onto but
what happens if right now we're just
starting the server of NPM start what
happens if the server reboots or
something happens and no crashes you
want it to automatically restart and
that is what they talked about earlier
in this article with the digitalocean
does so they're going to use something
called p.m. - that's I recommend as well
it's very good so I'm just going to ctrl
C and we're going to go through
installing and setting this guy up so
it's going to handle starting node when
we for example reboot the machine if
something happens to it
or if something crashes it'll handle
that for you so you do p.m. p.m. to
start instead of for example note so
what happens when if you guys didn't
know when I run NPM start here what's
happening as it goes into package.json
and it runs this start command which is
just node source so instead of doing
node source we're going to do NP to
start so MP to start and then source and
what it will do it goes ahead in the
background and it's actually running on
application so notice how I have full
control here I
do stuff but in the background this
server is still running
I can go to it and I can use the
application still that's that's exactly
what we want and the next thing I'm
going to do is actually set up so we can
start on reboot so before you actually
do this p.m. to start up what you're
going to want to do to p.m. to save so
it knows which process to restart and
you do a p.m. to startup you can do
system B if you're on the bun to which I
am but PM 2's will detect it you just do
startup it'll detect what you're on so
you notice how it detected system B so
now you're good if you wanted to what
you can do is you could come on over
back here to vulture my q2 servers and I
could actually just restart this thing
so I'm just going to exit out of here
and I'm going to hard restart the server
and if we come back over here and
refresh this page when it's done
restarting it should be back up and
started as we expected so and that's
that's it for setting this up we now
have a application running live this is
a live thing that people can come to the
only other thing that I would recommend
doing is setting up a custom domain name
here and then maybe doing HGPS that way
it's secure so this thing restarted and
we can SSH back in cool and now if I do
p.m. to list see how it says there's a
something running here I come over here
and i refresh you notice it's still
running all our data is still there so
that's exactly what we want to happen so
now if something happens to your server
or something you're still ok you're up
and running as long as the server
restarts so that is it for this video
you have any more questions or comments
please leave some below if you have any
if you're wondering how to do anything
else with full
I'd be happy to help so thank you guys
