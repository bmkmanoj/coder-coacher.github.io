last session I kind of left us with
things not working with the async and
creating - dues so now we're going to
rework things what I'm going to do is
we're going to edit the server and just
let you pass an API key using this a
mutation so what does that mean we're
gonna go into graph QL and into
resolvers know first schema so route
mutation query viewer now needs to take
a token which is just going to be a
string and that's required sign up login
that's fine and then this is going to
acquire a token which is the string so
notice how we're passing the tokens and
at their mutations now now with our
resolvers data create so this is gonna
be what we don't want to pass and so we
need we need to basically grab the text
boolean just complete and token here we
can pass in the token here we pass and
text and complete and then viewer root
args are just going to be a token
flips a data passing in the data
okay now let's restart the server now we
should be able to create two dews from
here so let's first login email is equal
to Bob at Bob calm and password is equal
to Bob now it creates this token now I
can actually create to-do text being
hello complete being true and token
being that long nonsense prettify and
we're actually able to create it to do
okay so now we can now do this from our
application our to-do app so first let's
save this so get status get add pass
token as parameter to mutation start the
server back up and we're hop back over
here the first thing we're gonna mess
with just foreground first thing we're
gonna mess with is Saurus reducers index
we no longer need to worry about passing
an authorization because that's not how
we're gonna do off anymore get token we
can put this guy in our
Epic's so we have saved token and we
have get token so that's that sides
looking good so save token token saved
error that's fine
this is if there's some kind of air you
need flux
okay so save token saves it to that so
what we will basically want to create
another epic now which saves we wanted
us now save the token and the reducer so
let's create a reducer and get out here
so this is a very simple token this is
going to be export defaults the state is
going to be a string um a defaults going
to be empty action and this is going to
be a function the switch action dot type
default just return the state and then
case action there our type will be save
token and we return action token
so now in our reducers index and for
token from token and now we have a token
which we can now add so when do we want
to call this or initiate this action
so whenever so we save the token right
here and I think I'll log in succeeded
we want to issue another action we don't
really care about set items exceeded too
much I think we actually want to do it
in our epics actions I think we want to
do it right here so login succeeded
we're passing in the data right actually
maybe we want to just like the only
thing login succeeded is doing is saving
the token and then okay change my mind
of how I want to do this so we saved the
token
and then we passed this thing we
actually don't care about it this is a
nasty little expansion to get the token
what we should really just be passing
here is the the token like this and then
in our routes a bit nope none our epics
and our routes login view data dot data
dot login star token
and then we would also do all again
succeeded ad token I think what would
what do we call it in our reducer we'll
just match that name soyou've token and
that's not really I don't like this name
of the action will say why not call it
save token no save token is not a good
name used to be like we're putting the
token in the props exposed tokens not a
good name either I'll just say add token
to props
I had token to props that's the best
name I like that name to props
I had token of props passing in the
token I like that name it's a lot more
expressive routes login actions
make sure that still works token token
two props pass it in the token and then
add token to props all right cool
so we're calling that function after the
logging succeeded which will save that
to the props we want that I'll just run
that real quick and make sure it's
working let's get this guy over here oh
we have we're actually on the login page
unterminated that's fine
we can test this later the other thing
is on this index page and the
constructor crops super props
I just want to this dot props dot I want
to basically dispatch an action out and
how do I want to do this
so whenever the app loads I'd like to
add the token if it's saved in the async
storage to the redux state so this props
get token from the storage this dot
props get token from storage
the decent name for it and we can call
it we need to map now this action to the
props here so we can do for this is we
can actually just do the same I don't
like having a view on this layer but we
might need to okay this is kind of gross
but we're gonna do it
so reducer oh I really hate this now I'm
just thinking how what I want to do for
my naming schema cuz right now I have
this right that's being called in the
constructor and what I wanted to do is
grab the token and actually you know
what maybe you don't want to grab the
token right now I think what we want to
do is we want to authenticate we want to
see if the user is logged in or not
right to check if they're logged in we
have to get the token and then we
redirect them to different pages
now this is fine no it's not fine
can we change the I'm just thinking how
I want to do this how do I want to when
they open the app and I basically come
to this page if I'm a logged in user
versus when I'm not a logged in user
that's fine I can comment this out for
now how I want to handle this because
that's something we should do now
because if you're not logged in user it
should take you to one page so I kinda
want to look up how other apps do this
because the check if they're logged in I
need to check the async storage you get
the token and see so I'm thinking I'm
trying to think if I can do this with
rxjs
I think I can't routes
and then this this will be like a
redirect engine okay so why don't we
create an epic Kahn's tech if logged
check if logged and I like the name site
I like sign it better signed it so this
is going to be in our action action
dollar sign dot of type check if signed
in and what we want to do if they're
side them or what do we do to check if
they're signed in we're gonna be doing
basically this right
except now we are getting the token
so we're empty if we're doing blank so
now we a say if this is our token if
token is equal to is empty then they're
logged in and we react native router
should be something on how to sign them
in detail the example I should be in
mini-tutorial I think well this is kind
of how I do it
I'm trying to find to see where they
switch actions dot login I don't think
that's what we're doing
actions stop page two I'm assuming
that's the key that I used so let's do
that so
okay so if token is not equal to
anything then we say actions and then do
we just that's it
actions dot and that's and it goes okay
we say login else they're logged in and
then we can return the action we can
return is type not logged not signed in
okay else that they're signed in so now
we trigger the other action which is we
get the keen we add it to the state so
add key to props we don't need to do
anything if for Lara log then we only
need to redact down to the other page
get token
let's add this check if signed in and
let's make a get token get token epoch
get token gets the token I actually know
I'm bad I'm bad I don't need to make
this we have the token here we do come
in grab make sure we can look at the
action okay then we dispatch so if
they're logged in and we got the token
we want to add that to the prop so ID
token to props and they pass in the
token that we got okay that works nicely
so let's refresh this and see what
happens
okay the user is logged in that's how we
would expect it now let's go to routes
home view mutation how did I do this
before I want to pass in a variable now
mutation
so a mutation dollar sign token is equal
to string okay that's easy
and then token is equal to dollar sign
token UT and I pass it variables right
variables
touken is equal to own props docked okay
alrighty now refresh the page oh yeah
okay let's do react native log iOS okay
we push the button and what happened
possibly unhear network press failed so
that's possibly because there's some
kind of syntax error here it's console
dot log on props token make sure that's
an actual thing click on that and it's
undefined so it's not being mapped to
the props the states not okay so let's
just print out what own props includes
refresh
okay
I think what I need to do is just grab
it routes login no this will be home
index token is equal to state token I
think I just need to map that like that
and then if I do store let me go into
routes make this faster login now this
is home
um view now try that oh we didn't get an
error message here let's see what the
log says and look at that we can create
to do is from our app now is really cool
so we successfully authenticated our
user then and I can just create a couple
if I want just create seven of them and
that's just amazing that is really cool
okay so we did a bunch of the
heavy-lifting now so now we can just
like basically make a pretty UI to go
over this and we have like a basic to do
structure so let's do that let's pick
out some components that you want come
over here and create I kind of want like
a almost like a form but not really I
just want an input button form elements
we might be doing a form element we
might be doing a form input again
to create a bit to do now let's do that
for right now
for now anyway so this is like our
little wrapper actually there's not much
going on in this this functioned so we
can just like put our components in here
okay
so what is it gonna go where to build
this I want so we do have formally what
we do so put this here and I think I
just wanna like copy kind of how we did
the thing before not the thing before
but how we did login so let's let's
split screen this there we go that's
better split source routes login view
and we're going to touch home you as
well okay so we can take this text field
and use something like that
and maybe we actually export textfield
to like because like I'm bringing this
over here we should export this to a
file maybe we can do that later if we
need to use it more that might be a good
idea though and what was it going to do
next we actually need to make a field so
this is going to be to do to do
component text field all right I don't
know we need to create an on submit to
create a little submit submit values and
you're going to pass any props to this
let's see
so you can copy the submit up here not
just to do actually she just call it
text
if text by email
if not then we will create to do passing
in just that we don't need a passing
anything actually oh but we should we
should be passing in the text and true
oh no false cuz it's not complete at
first so we got this going so I can just
fullscreen not login failed this is
empty to do
so
text which is a string and then we can
also do this for a complete dollar sign
complete and all our sign complete is a
boolean and is required
oops
dollar sign text complete dollar sign
complete now down here passing the
variables text complete okey-dokey let's
render this so I just need to something
with my render function she's near app
all these interview it can't all be on
the same level so there needs to be
basically one outer tag
handle submit this
props got this stop props to do Hale
submit is not a function
oh oh we need to create this as a form
home okay so we don't we don't actually
Const
area you don't need we don't need to
make this a real function don't need
that why he helpful excuse popping up
alright tab that over
all right cool so they pass it in the
props and here we can grab handles
submit and create to do and now this is
actually a redux form so let's add that
syntax to the bottom
oops yeah you know actually this will be
caught home for now there yeah
refresh that go shopping create and
getting out up react native walk iOS and
we created a to do awesome now let's
show all the to dues that the user has
down here so that requires two different
things I already know I wanted to make
this like a real time to do app so let's
do I haven't actually done this before
but I hear there's something called
Apollo subscriptions Apollo client which
we can use for real-time stuff so I want
to see if we can use this
clients say today they'd like to
subscribe to bison Acree with
subscription keyword tutor
based on the subscription field name and
the map your transcriptions yeah the
thyristors we'll know more when
something is published to one of these
channels server around their hilly
regions and in real to the client very
cool look on the client developer just
as any other subscription than you
relevant series I'm like canister and
more than one results so a long live
connection is for your arms and they
should we use WebSocket connection then
P apparently we create okay
Jacob and is giving me an NPM package
called subscription transport or
gemstones website as a different row
Hall weekends that package that
subscriptions here those are yet okay so
we have to add some extra stuff all
right so those have this stuff so yarn
and I'll download that for us
and then let's add this now if we go to
client what you created in our reducers
we can import this stuff
huh Ponce knew WebSocket client of
course knows it doesn't point to graph
QL create an effort interface Yui okay
so this just does that this does that
I'll just let's just try it so we create
a new thing ours is at 30 30 and then we
just do slash crack ul and then in our
network interface just copy that I don't
think we need this network interface
anymore
so now we create like an Apollo client
network interface is equal to okay
network interface with subscriptions
okay so now I think we have a
subscription setup
hey thinks interrupts I'm glad you enjoy
it
screw this now we'll use subscriptions
called comma added as example our
subscription lessons for new comments on
the comet page for a specific repository
on the client we use subscriptions API
ok component did mount this this not
subscribe so how are they creating this
subscriber Evo name oh okay
update query function why are we passing
in a repo name
oh do we
to actually set up stuff on the server
it doesn't just automatically do that
that's gonna be annoying on the server
we need we need to start a WebSocket
server that implements the subscriptions
protocol and this is a package to make
each part as usual it also be separate
Garko and the published parts okay so
before we try implementing a client
let's get this server set up the part
that actually handles the description is
a package called rosh chodesh and i have
to be important
I wonder if they have better
documentation on this if they actually
have documentation and so just a medium
article I don't like how but I like how
much work you just add subscriptions to
this
all right they don't have anything for
subscriptions and their dogs yet it
doesn't look like see if anyone's done
anything with for those GS before looks
general
looks like something else as well
this is fun fun little setup there real
nasty so can we do this with just
feathers Jess WebSockets um not easily
because then we wouldn't be doing it
with graphic UL okay
I will attack I just muscle through it
and go through an abscess to their
server see if we can figure this out I
want to go through from the github
looked a lot less lengthy for the server
setup
client browser
all right so let's start messing with
the server did I install yarn for this
yet
yes I have
so let's add this package please your
graph you know place the graph Cal
schema object pub/sub starting the
server create a new simple so if your
manager is pub/sub in terms of
Sanitation all right you got a source
services graph Gil service so let's look
at the index for a segment I think we're
going to be doing stuff here
I'm not really sure this step right here
does
looks like we use it here
subscription managers equipped a new
subscription manager I also see okay so
the subscription manager here is equal
to new subscription manager here cistern
manager is equal to new subscription
server what's going on here this
documentation is not very clear let's go
back to this real quick they look like
they set up in one thing set up
functions we don't have to worry about
setup functions I don't think
pub/sub export subscription manager and
pub/sub really where are they using it
though
I'll just copy copy this mm-hmm before I
just copy this over and start using it I
want to understand it better so we're
creating a server right head 404
response top end okay then we're telling
it to listen on port 5,000 console dot
log it's fine
path
create regular network interface by
using Paulo's API now we use
subscription to the planetside use
Apollo client but subscribe or subscribe
more these Doc's are very convoluted
so our graph QL endpoints is slash graph
G well so this one's kind of interesting
there WebSocket is a different place
than there just to graph QL one no
because this is at port 5000 this is a
port 3000
where do we pass the schema into this I
think I pass it in here okay I think I
kind of get what we have to do I'm gonna
copy this and we also doing some stuff
here create server from HUP so let's
download these two we're gonna install
these two packages here that and this
guy as well
okay so a little bit something like this
each Pieri have or something and it
looks like it should be fine though
just a warning yep
so we imported those correctly
schema which we get from here
passing the pub/sub
sure let's put our port let's just go
straight from this
let's do port 5,000
but actually let's create this after we
create our graph QL endpoints because I
think it they might use it just through
this okay this looks fine
this looks fine subscription server on
connect implicit handle manage
connections we don't subscription
manager
servers WebSocket server path is just
that okay
oops sorry guys they keep going over to
the wrong one
okay let's call that good because I
don't know what else we would do let's
just start it see if it starts up you
have a problem I kind of expected that
we're doing some weird stuff async
function okay let's just not worry about
that because it it said they're gonna be
empty
just do the subscription manager so I'm
just removing that on connect warning
the printer exports from we remove the
next version see wearing the printer
exports from over your moved I don't see
where do we using printer that I don't
think that's something from us okay
we're now on localhost 5002 so now we
can come back over here and you can
create the client so we keep this the
same Network a nurse oops so this is HP
I'll close 33 we keep that the same this
is now at 5,000 this is where our
sockets are reconnect is equal to true
do we care about any of that stuff
this is WS client client that's nuke a
new subscription client we just created
a regular client all right
let's create a subscription client I
don't know why we why that the regular
client was just their new subscription
client subscription new subscription
client
and let's do that that sounds fine let's
reconnect ad graph QL subscriptions or
doing that and okay it looks like we're
doing this we're matching now when you
want to use subscriptions in the client
side to use Apollo client oh before I
even do anything else let just reload
this and make sure this actually doesn't
crash okay doesn't that's cool all right
modify the store and return a state with
new archived data
okay so Apollo client does subscribe to
more subscriptions
today did I do all know the viewer how
do I get the two dues oh this is gonna
be a problem how do we actually get oh
the show should be under query we
actually just have one query which is
the user we have to pass in a token
so we might need to create a new
mutation or new query it gets that
basically gets my toque or my two dues
but we can do that with viewer right now
okay so what my worry is right now is I
can copy this paste this over here but I
don't think it's gonna work how we think
it's gonna work so if I go into I'm just
going to copy and paste this whole thing
because why not let's put in the this
thing for now yeah sure let's do it in
the constructor just to test it out
Apollo client so it's client that
subscribe more and import the jaql
you're the ear of cold tabs
so subscription on a query how does this
work
we might have to dig deeper into this I
don't think I'm doing it right view
we're passing the token whatever it is
oh we don't even need to we can just
subscribe like that I don't want to see
why it's not all we care about is it to
dues which is going to be get the text
and then complete okay
so cop this this is the query you'd like
to do and we'd like to do subscriptions
so a little idea subscription
subscription you're passing the
variables token I kinda need a way and
do this
I need to do this when it loads I was
like triggering that other thing we are
never calling check if login this epic
is not being run hold up for a second
let's comment this out just had like a
crazy realization I thought it was
working for it ever reason it's not okay
so I was thinking that my epic this
thing is running it's doing its thing
all that jazz
check if signed in is never actually
this action is never being done I don't
think I'm just gonna create a reducer
and I reducer I'm just gonna log say
logging are you sure that's fine okay we
ready we are you doing that so react
native log iOS that finish
see check is not doing anything
reload yeah never checks obvious I think
he was checking so the token how is the
token getting passed to the props how is
the token in the state right now well I
just need to make sure that to-do list
items are in the database real quick
yeah they're in here somehow here we go
they have no and righty oh we're not
entik a ting we're not indicating the
token
we're not offing it okay let's fix that
well it's twofold we need to fix
multiple things let's fix the server
first so yeah let's go down source
services graph QL the index that were
you're doing then
touken provider that's fine
index resolvers
provider is equal to context that
provider how is to do is being created I
thought it was guarded should be a hook
yeah we are verifying token on all of
them we're doing this how how was it
getting past this I don't understand
then it's passing the resolvers console
dot log token just see the token that
we're getting we're getting past okay
now let's start this up now on this side
let's actually pass the token end so
index so we gotta grab the token and
this is what I was having a problem with
before because now we have to actually
create basically something to map to the
props I'll be over here actually
there we go create those two guys create
two functions here
one of the actions is going to be oh
this is nasty those are just nasty I
don't want to do this here I should be
coating this here I'm just gonna get rid
of it I should be writing cleaner code
basically I want a dispatcher in action
right here do I know anything about
react fibre no I've never heard a
reaction fibre what's react fibre so we
need to find the best way to dispatch an
action right here we can we connect it
with this okay you know we're gonna do
it like this so right now we're
importing the route let's say app
container no this is so bad how do we
want to program this
okay you know what I'm just gonna do it
like this because so we're gonna create
actions that yes I'm going to touch
we're gonna copy gonna move index to
view a gif and copy routes Dex here our
view we're gonna keep the same now you
can say this stop props dot check if
signed and check if signed in so export
check that's what this checked if signed
NZ review actions where do we name the
action we map it to props I'm having
just like a total blank for a second
here okay we do it like that okay cons
check if signed in is equal to we're
gonna pass nothing in and we're gonna
return type check if sign and see if
that's what we used source reducer token
and token two profs check if signed in
so these actions match up so that's all
we need to do that's all you need you
there
and then in our index let's actually get
a better index copy from our routes sign
up no it's Gary login one there we go
think we've done a lot of changes I
should be committing more either way
let's run this I expected token actions
I just need to wrap this in parentheses
not fine store in either context or
props oh because this is the outer one
we can't do this here
oh boy this is a mess this particular
thing is a mess okay let's just do it in
home move index to move actions to
routes um move index to outs
um move you to index stuff yes so index
will stay the same
check if signed in we'll do that from
home so this will be an index nope
routes home view
you need to dispatch an action it's
quite annoying
check is signed then check sign it okay
see if that works
alright we don't get your problem there
can I update doing an existing state
transition what does that mean
because of that I just see what happens
when we create this well nothing's being
sent to the server that's for sure
see if anything's going to the log key
let's actually just type it react a lot
of iOS
well that's just refresh so he added the
tokens token to the props right-click
that Apollo mutation error possible
failed request warning cannot update
during an existing the stage here in the
sisters winter should be pure component
will amount okay I think what it doesn't
like is I have I'm putting check if sign
in right here pretty sure if I just
comment that out that's what was causing
the problem yeah because it kept
checking if they were signed in as I was
typing I think and we only need to do
that once
let's create a class here so class
caught home stands react dot component
render and then component will mount and
then we want to call this check if sign
in this prop stop this is just a form
right this is a that's at the very
bottom so this is gonna be this is a
form that we would want to use in here
form sequel to export export default
return what I just push okay and I
basically when I render this form in
here I don't even know if we can what
are we calling this home form call it
it's a pure function right here this is
form Const form should we create this as
a function I think we should home form
Redux form home form what does the name
given to me we're gonna use here so
we're calling this home form right here
and then we're wrapping it call it form
there anything that conflicts with the
name note form see if that will render
expected a component got object
still gonna work how we gonna use this
Felix get rid of all this junk real
quick okay so we have this this view
thing working right so CD into routes
home maker components move you to
components form what is this to do form
we should capitalize that components two
components to do form okay so to do
perform is looking quite snazzy go
import react from the act and import
what was it to do form from components
slash to do so create a class call it
home
extends react component component will
mount this dot props that check if
signed in then a render function turn to
do form so basically we're just wrapping
our class in a form or wrapping our peer
function and non pure function
we're just a sport this so just to
explain again what I did is we basically
needed to use compatible amount for this
to do form but the form need to be pure
so it is they basically just made this
little wrapper for it create and we're
getting written error let's see if nope
it's not even going to the server I'm
sure you've been rendered at least once
before snapshotting all right
Oh this index token is equal to state
dr. Kim now try it we just needed a map
that I believe nope still okay so what I
think is the air is happening so let's
confirm Rashi in the air we think we are
so I think token this is undefined I
think this is going to be undefined so
let's make sure it is data is undefined
so we just need to figure out how to add
token to the props because right now
it's not being added to the props oh I
know why
hehehe
so this rapper the props are going here
it's gonna say just props I just need to
pass the props down I'm thinking and bam
look at that token I know I was so
excited I said BAM before but now it
actually looks like it's working let's
get rid of the token let's make sure
this is doing what we think it is
notice how grab the idea that's exactly
we wanted okay so it is working now at
least that's a small part of it so we're
checking if it's signed in okay so now
subscriptions back to the obscure pians
I think I set up the subscriptions thing
let's let's do some git git status yeah
oh it's create a get ignore or not
create to add to it dot turn port I
don't need to have that good status way
twice turn port still showing up I
headed to the gate ignore we are in the
same folder right okay that is the turn
port not there so let's get commit over
here so what did we do since the last
version started implementing graph QL
subscriptions
create two dews and anything else
save save token and check if logged in
those are some big ones okay so now we
actually want to do subscription stuff I
also need it want to check to make sure
it redirects okay for not logged and so
I guess we'd have to like delete app but
we can do that later delete the app turn
little iPhone emulator and restart it
let's kill this text so subscriptions
let's do that
let's just pass in a working token to
see if it's working
you just hard code it for now I just
want to see if this method works put
some logs to see if this actually works
variables don't worry about it okay
I just thought get token from storage
I don't think do we do that now I pretty
sure yeah you're that get token from
storage it's not a thing all right let's
just see what happens with this no
variables let's get our token so let's
login
come on just one do react
blog well I got us to refresh the page
subscription store is not function
subscribe to more is not a function so
please subscribe to more isn't a
function what what it literally tells me
to subscribe to more Apollo client and
we didn't set it up correctly then from
reducers index and reducers guys look
this is literally the client I'm
exporting just like this but it doesn't
have subscribe to more I did spell it
right right subscribe subscribe to more
subscribe to more so subscribe to mark
if you don't use any package you know
stuff to you this package amazing
package serious
I don't understand
some fan to encode an angular look kind
of like act okay so this is actually
just not an error people have had boy
writing application to do with that
params is undefined so this function
just does not exist that they told me to
use that's confusing let's go to the
medium article
yeah medium article does stuff
differently maybe we'll try this okay
either way I'm gonna finish here for now
in the next video we'll be working on
getting subscriptions working and trying
some different stuff with that so thank
you guys for watching I'll see in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
