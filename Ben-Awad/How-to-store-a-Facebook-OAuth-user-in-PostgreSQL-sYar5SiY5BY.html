loss login and we are giving back we pop
back over here to terminal this is what
the data looks like but how we actually
created user from this how should we
store it in the database that's we're
going to be answering today I'm using a
Postgres sequel database so I'm going to
be using sequel ID to do this but it's
going to be very similar if you use a
different database you use the same
concept so this is the data we have
working with us and let's get to it
so first thing we're going to do is set
up our database to handle it
so when we sing up some foreign keys
just wanted to show you guys this is the
syntax for stayin up foreign keys right
here
using belongs to and then you use your
two models that you want to relate and
then here you specify the name you want
if you don't know what foreign keys are
also another name is one-to-one we're
basically saying that I mean this makes
pretty good sense a user is a part of a
company belong to a company so we're
going to be doing that and so we're
going to abstract our user model a
little bit because now there's two ways
to login right we can login with
Facebook or we can login with an email
or password so we're going to do is
actually create two different models so
yeah I'm going to be working in the
models folder primarily and if you want
to follow along have starter code below
with this server so you can do the same
thing I'm doing so we have bottles here
what I want to do is create two things a
Facebook and what we'll call FB for
short Facebook credentials I don't know
how I want to spell this I think I'm
going to camel case it put the table
name want Facebook credentials say
Facebook off
I'll do it like that FBI then we create
another model called local off now local
off standing for using a user an email
and password and Facebook off login
through Facebook and then our user model
is no longer going to have an email and
the password it is also okay good
I think username is nullable we're gonna
move out to find out create an air we
might need to make username I think by
default it's knowable but might not be
anyway we're going to move so I'm going
to copy user move it over to local off
so now local off here
both of these are jf files alright to my
local off here we're going to call it
local off and table is going to be
called local all I should have been
doing this admin doing this you want to
use snake case for post grass so here is
just going to have an email and a
password and then we're going to
associate local auth with user we're
going to say local auth dot belongs to
models user and then we're going to
store a foreign key and we're going to
call it user ID and then we're going to
return our little claw so local off here
is going to store the email and password
and it's going to link to a user
so our user over here is then still
going to be have these relationships
that no longer needs to have email
password so now for our facebook login
it's going to be similar to local off
we want to set up Facebook off I don't
know if I should lower cases that looks
kind of weird naming here I'm not sure
how I want to name this I guess this is
fine now I'm going to do it like this
even though it's a little weird
I don't like triple uppercase okay and
then I'm going to name it here FB off
for this is the database table name and
then here what we want to store
definitely FB ID so the Facebook ID that
they give us so I scroll up here and so
I want to store this username display
name say user name and display name we
don't care about this other stuff also
for me I mean I'm testing this I don't
even have a user name so I'm showing a
store display name but you can just you
can do more fields if you like too
so display name and we're going to call
this thing a string sure and this is
going to be okay so they started the
string - we can store it at this string
as well and do data types that string
and then unique we don't we don't want
to do a unique check so we can actually
just do this and then here FBI FBI FBI
okay so we're going to save the ID and
the display name and then we set up
relationship to a user and that's going
to have the user ID so that's pretty
good our databases set up good to go now
over here what we want to do we need to
create this as an async function because
we're going to be doing some eight sinky
things so first thing we want to do is
we want to create a user account here so
we're going to say model dot user
dot create and we're going to pass in an
empty object I want to pass in an empty
object I think I could do it just like
this so we don't want to we don't have
any of the fields filled out so we don't
know if they're an admin and we don't
know if they can have a user in it like
we don't we shouldn't imply their
username from Facebook we could like for
example that we could grab their
username from Facebook if they have one
I don't have one so you could do it that
way if you want to do like a little
check and say Const username and grab
that from the profile we're going to
grab the ID the username and the display
name so we can pass we can say if
display name so our username you can
pass in the username here you know but
I'm not going to worry about that
because I don't have a username okay so
we're just going to create I might have
to pass in an empty object like that I
don't know I'm trying to try creating it
like this and see if we let those create
a user okay then what we want to do and
oh by the way we actually shouldn't
create a user right away if this is the
second time if this is the first time
they're logging in so let's write a
little comment about this there's two
two cases case number one so number one
what could happen is first time login
and then there's second case other times
so in case one there's their fruit of
their first time logging in we actually
need to create a user for them right but
if it's not the first time we don't need
to create a user for them we just log
them in right so in this case we need to
know whether they have
if they are a user if this is the first
time logging in and the way we do that
is we're creating this facebook login
right so we actually first want to check
if this ID is already in our database so
we're going to say we're going to a
Const
Facebook user is going to be a weight
models dot Facebook user which is
Facebook off and we want to do find we
just want to find one I think there's a
better I think either's I can get
possibly where you just get one if not
we can just limit it to one yeah let's
just limit it to one I can do limit one
so we're looking for one where Facebook
ID is equal to ID okay so we're going to
look for your facebook off in a facebook
auth model we're going to try to find
the user we're only going to get one and
then we're going to say let's console
dot log Facebook user and see what we
get I think we should get an array
reaching find all four nine nine so
we're going to say if Facebook user dot
link if that exists then don't create
user right but we're going to do not so
we're only going to create the user if
it doesn't exist so this is if we can't
find the user here so we're actually
what we should I'm not sure if we should
check I'm not sure if what this is going
to return if there's not any users in
the database like if there's no Facebook
user that we find I think it might be an
empty array that we get hope to see so
but if it's the Facebook link of the
user link I guess we should say Facebook
users here
so I make more sense so Facebook users
even though we'll only finding one check
the link if it's zero then we need to
add a user and so we create a user then
we also need to create a Facebook user
right so SB user it's going to be a
weight models dot Facebook auth dot
create and here we're going to say a
Facebook ID is equal tidy this excuse me
and display name is equal to display
name and real quick I what I forgot to
do is just import these into my index so
it's important to this is house my
sequel eyes set up work since I just
need to import FBI and local off well
off let's be off okay coming back to
index over here and this looks pretty
good so we only really need to store
stuff in the do-it database created if
we don't find it all right I'll create I
think this looks pretty good
so first just walk through this one more
time we are given this data here we
check if I erased or this guy in the
database before by looking for his ID if
we find if we don't find any users of
that length will not users of that
length if find all returns an empty
array then we know it's not in the
database so we create a user we create a
Facebook user and we also need a pass
and user ID here and we really we should
be doing a user ID like this and I'll
show you guys also at the end of this
video why
I'm doing snake cave too so I should use
snake case here and for local law too
I'm going to start using snake case more
and everything so the user ID is going
to be user that ID there should be
lowercase u all right and then I was
pretty good
so we create that user in the database
and here we can this thing doesn't
really matter this callback we could
even put in an empty yeah we should
actually just do empty Fenna this is if
you're using sessions if you're using
sessions you'd want to put this callback
and pass in your Facebook user but we
don't have to worry about that because
I'm not using sessions put these console
logs together and since we don't
actually need to do anything with this
user we'll just give her that
alright so let's give this a try now and
see if everything works so and also
before I do this I actually need to drop
the database so on a piece equal real
quick draw database test graph kill DB
and the reason I'm dropping the database
is because we did database changes so
whenever you do that at least with
sequel eyes you need to either do
migrations which you make you do them
yourself or what I find faster is to
drop the database and restart it alright
so I'm going to go here what we expect
to happen is for a user to be created
just straight nothing so if we come over
here I didn't close and grok so I still
have it up so we can run it page just
not found oh should be s logging not
sure why I did this other one I set off
said it was good we come back over here
cool it was an empty object and we can
see sequel eyes print out the commands
we can see we create a new user that
worked out okay and we inserted a new
user into our Facebook
login and just to prove it to you guys
if we want to piece equal I can connect
to my database test graph QL DB select
all from Facebook Roth and we can see me
add it here so cool that's how I like to
store it in the database and that's it
for this video I'm going to go over two
extra things I want to talk about but
these are totally not necessary
the first is environment variables these
things I should be storing environment
variables and then why I'm starting to
use snake case so first make case but
feel free you can prove done with OAuth
for now I just want to go over two quick
things snake case look at this this has
quotation marks around that the reason
for that is uppercase whenever you
uppercase letter Postgres at quotes
marks to it and that's super ugly so
that's why you snake case and that's
pretty much it
so now I could do select all from
Facebook auth where if I had done
uppercase I would have to do something
like that right so using snake case for
tables properties now all right cool so
that that covers that and then I want to
talk about storing keys I put this into
github knowing sq in this videos out
it's already these keys are going to be
invalid but you should never do it like
this and I'm going to show you what you
should do instead what you should do is
do process that ends client ID Facebook
quietiy I store these as environment
variables so what I can do so I can copy
these to my clipboard come over here and
do export Facebook client ID and
that's that equal to this number that
being the number right here
and so I don't have to actually have
this hard-coded I now just secure a bit
from the process which I'm putting here
and now this is not going store on
github right so then now you're not
exposing your T's this is very important
so your key you don't get exposed
because people can hack your account and
do stuff with it so we do the same thing
here
Facebook secret ID and I'm just going to
copy that and then we're going to do
Facebook secret ID all right so now it's
going to grab those values and just to
show you guys we can rerun this to make
sure we don't get any errors just to
make sure I did everything right but
that's a great way to store any kind of
secret passwords you don't want and we
should be doing this for the secret here
but this doesn't matter as much because
this is just garbage right now so now if
I come here and I can go to F login and
get off was good and if we come here Hey
look we actually see the user that we
grabbed we got we see display name then
we pulled this from your database so
that is it for this video guys I hope
that was helpful how I like to store
this in the database next I'm going to
show you how the heck you do this like
I've created backend for this right how
am I actually going to log in with
Facebook using I don't know maybe say a
react front-end so with next J s I'm
going to use I have a little going to go
off of that and show you how you can log
in using Facebook using this server that
we have set up here so I'll see you guys
then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
