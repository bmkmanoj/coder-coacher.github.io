when we create a message I am a message
we don't see anything pop up in our
message pane right here and the message
is created we just have to refresh to
see it because we're not basically
looking for updates so we're gonna be
turning this into a real-time
application using graph QL subscriptions
we already set up the infrastructure on
our server and our front-end to be able
to handle this so now we just need to
implement implement it with
subscriptions and the thing that we want
to do is a little bit special because
what we want to do is I have multiple
channels multiple teams here so you
don't want to be getting messages from
other teams and other channels so we
need to filter who's seeing what so
that's what we're gonna be doing there's
a with filter function we're gonna be
using from graph QL subscriptions that
allows us to filter where who were like
sending events to and so if I'm part of
this general channel I only get general
chant general channel events alright
let's take a look at the backend start
working on this so the first thing we're
going to do is create a subscriptions
types of subscription it's kind of like
a query or a mutation type and here I'm
gonna say new channel message and we're
gonna need to take in a parameter here
so channel ID and that's gonna be an int
so the channel ID parameter right here
is gonna tell us how we know which
channel to send events for and then
we're gonna return a message now in our
resolvers over here we're gonna be
filtering using this example so we're
gonna copy this
and bring it over here so I'm gonna put
it up here at the top and in our index
we have this little pub/sub guy we're
gonna be using him over here in our
resolver so I'm just gonna move them
over save my index page all right and
we're also going to good with filter now
pub/sub we need to create an instance of
so I'm gonna say Const pub/sub is equal
to new pub/sub and we need to capitalize
that now we use this pub/sub in our
resolvers now if I needed to use pub/sub
across multiple resolvers I would put
this in a different file and export it
but this is okay for now now there can
be lots of different subscriptions in
your applications and for pub/sub to
differentiate between them you have to
create what's called an event name
basically so this is called comment
added we're gonna create constant up
here for it so I'm gonna call this new
channel message and it's gonna be a new
channel message is this string and so
how with filter works as we say the
event we want to admit so or what we
want to listen for so though the event
we're going to listen for is whenever
the pub/sub publishes a new channel
message and whenever it publishes a new
channel message what we want to do is we
want to check whether we're in the
channel of that message that was just
created so the way we're gonna do that
is variables this object here is the
arguments we could call this args since
that's what we've been using all other
places so that's this thing so for us
our only argument is channel ID and if
we wanted to we could actually just
expand this but we'll just say args
stopped channel ID
and then our payload we're gonna compare
this against the payloads channel ID
now the payload this is the payload
that's gonna be sent to our client and
this is what happens when pub/sub
publishes and this will make more sense
what our payload is in a second so now
we want to publish a new channel message
every time we create a message
so in our create message here after we
create a message Const message is equal
to this we are going to say pub/sub dot
publish now notice how it has a trigger
name which is the event our is this new
channel message and then a payload which
is an object and you want to say new
channel message the name of this
property needs to match the name we put
over here so we call it a new channel
message so that should match here and we
also it should match here as well
it's a new channel message and then here
is our message so the message that we
have is message and we have to do dot
data values the reason for that is this
is a sequel eyes object and we need to
get the data values from it okay so this
payload object is sent to our pub/sub
over here and it says hey this listener
does he want to get this event that was
just published and we're gonna check the
payloads channel ID which we currently
are not passing in so let's pass that in
channel ID is equal our channel ID so
this create message if we look back at
our schema create message is passed a
channel ID which we're using right here
to know what we're publishing okay so we
use this to figure out what channel
you're in and this is what we're sending
to our client so they can add a message
to their to the so we can see the
message life and we don't have to wait
so that is our back end and let's set up
the front
so on the front end side we first need
to call that subscription so if we go to
localhost 8080 one we can actually type
this subscription out subscription and
we have one variable channel ID which is
an int and then we're gonna say new
channel message and we're just gonna
pass in our channel ID now we want to
grab the same fields over here so I'm
gonna paste them oh I didn't copy them
so we want to grab the same fields that
we're getting in our query here so that
way we can update correctly so grab that
copy it and then we're actually gonna be
using that in a second first we have to
call a subscribe to more function so up
let's refresh
so in our react app Lakai ssin it this
the component we're working with here is
called message container now if I come
over to message container you'll notice
we have this data prop which we know we
get from graph QL we have this subscribe
to more function that we want to call
and what that allow us to do is we can
pass a document to it right here and
this is a subscription and then that
allows us to like listen for whenever
new things we're subscribing to that
data so how they recommend doing this is
subscribing on component will mount so
what we're gonna do is we're going to
turn this guy into a class component so
I'm gonna move this down here and it was
a class and this is going to extend
react component and we'll put this all
the way down here
and we're gonna have two curly braces
down there because we're gonna render
and now this is going to be Const and we
can still destructure but we're just
gonna say this dot props or D
structuring and then we're gonna return
right here and I want to say component
will mount and then in this function
here is where we're going to be doing
our stuff our subscribing and I think
this is it's not Auto formatting oh we
shouldn't do an equal sign there there
we go
so that format all nicely so I know the
syntax is right
so now hidden here I want to call this
prop slide atta dot subscribe two more
and then we want to just pass similar to
what they're doing here so we're gonna
copy that
and so our document is the subscription
that we made in a graph QL over here so
I'm gonna copy this and we're gonna say
Const
new channel message subscription sequel
gql and just paste that in there so now
that's our document so new channel
message and then variables are only
variable here is we need a channel ID
and we're getting that from our props
already if we notice down here we're
saying props that channel ID so we're
passing it in so this stop props dot
channel ID okay so now in our update
query what we're gonna be doing is we're
going to take the previous value which
is an array see how we're mapping it's a
array of messages and adding a message
onto it so I'm gonna get rid of this
so here we don't have a data so I'm
gonna get rid of that so we're gonna
keep those originally and the previous
query and then we're just gonna change
what messages was so this is an array
and we're gonna keep what the previous
messages were so we're new previs ages
and then at the very end we're gonna add
our message that we just created which
is called subscription data dot new
channel message all right so now when we
we save this and we see it run we're
going to be getting in air and I'll tell
you why so hello run BAM we get this
cannot read property of user undefined
which I'm very surprised by so we get
this air and the reason why we're
getting this air is because in our front
end we are asking for a user so we need
to have the user in this object but our
message here doesn't have a user right
because we just create a message there
is no user so when I call new channel
message and I'm passing the data values
that has no user but it should fetch the
user for us because we have this
messages message thing right here right
so it resolves the user field for all
messages so when I call pub/sub publish
you think it should go in there and and
this method is indeed called which is
the oddest part it just does not work
and I'm not actually sure quite why that
is but there's a little workaround we
can do to make this work still so and
how I figured this out was I just got
rid of this user right and so if I don't
subscribe to the user I'm gonna get an
error but it still pops up here so I -
okay we just get a whole different error
because we don't have a user okay forget
that we need to submit a grab user dot
username I thought we would be able to
grab it okay but we are not okay so what
I did to test this
theory basically is in here now if this
is the parent object so I'm going to
check if there's already a user object
so if there is a user I just returned a
user otherwise I returned it promise and
this the promise is to fetch this and
they're real so now what will happen is
if I pass and so I'm just gonna hard
code this right now and then we're gonna
go in and actually fix this so I'm gonna
pass in a user and my user name is gonna
be Bob Bob what 13 will say so we
hard-coded Bob so that's not good but we
should see if this actually does work hi
3 notice how my hi 3 pops up nicely so
this is real time data now as I'm typing
we see it but we hard-coded this Bob
their teen Valley that doesn't feel good
let's fix that so I don't know why but
it whenever it tries to actually do this
fetch like I'm just gonna console dot
log to show you guys this I am here like
this function gets called when we pubsub
for whatever reason so I'll be
reconnected so okay here's the console
this is pretty small font so I don't
know if you can see this but I'm just
gonna say hi 4 notice how I am here this
function gets called but if I get rid of
this this crashes for whatever reason it
doesn't like let this promise resolve or
something and so it's getting undefined
on the client I'm not really sure so if
you guys know what's up with that I'd
love to know but we're basically now
what we're gonna have to do is call this
ourself so instead of hard-coding our
user Bob here what we're gonna do is I'm
just gonna create so it would suck right
to be having to do so conce user it's
going to be a weight models dot user dot
find one
and we can say we're right and we're
looking for where the ID is equal to
user dot ID so the current user
basically so we're fetching the user
while we're creating this user right
here okay we have already user so we'll
say should I say username now we'll say
user I don't know what to call this
current user we'll say so current user
and I'm just going to say user is equal
to current user dot data values okay I
believe that will work let's see if it
does so high-five BAM works and we see
Bob 17 there so that works but this
feels kind of bad right and if you're
paying attention closely you'll notice
is in a weight and a weight so we're
having to wait for us to fetch this
current user before we're hitting this
publish and returning which might be
okay if we don't care about returning
this true right away but we could put
this in a synchronous function so I
could just say Const async funk and I
could have called this async and
basically all its gonna do is it's gonna
do these two things
and we can call our async funkier so
basically the reason to do this instead
of what I had before is it doesn't hang
and wave rest to fetch the user it
returns and then whenever we're finished
fetching the user we then publish I'm
100% sure this will work but I believe
it will so let's see hi six and sure
enough it does work we see hi six so now
we're not waiting for this to finish
this bit will run async asynchronously
okay so that was pretty cool what we
established so let's show you guys now
side by side so let's fullscreen this
and let's open up another tab and what
we can do now is we should be able to
see people talking back and forth so I
don't know who is invited to this team I
don't even know who the team person
leader of this team is they're the owner
so I'm just gonna come over here
maybe it's Bob 15 maybe was Bob 16 I'll
just log in and see and let's view team
all right looks like we're part of cool
team we can see hi six so hey I'm Bob 15
so we see Bob 15 pop-up over there funny
enough it doesn't pop up over here I
wonder if we're getting it and are we
getting in there okay we are getting in
here that's kind of interesting
so encounter two keys with the same node
two chillin with the same key so team 13
well we'll worry about this warning in a
little bit I'm also not sure why I
didn't pop up over here it popped up
here maybe it popped up at the top no I
want to just try refreshing yep we see
it here so whatever for a reason this
guy did not subscribe but this guy
subscribed so now I'm going to say
I'm Bob 17 and it pops up both places
here again okay now we seem to be
listening on this and for whatever
reason the subscription didn't look like
it got started
so as we're typing stuff now we see it
pop up on both screens like a real chat
application so we can chat back back and
forth now I don't know what this warning
is about waft we'll fix this in a future
video but that's it for this video guys
we finally have real time subscriptions
working and now we're subscribing to
specific channels so now that we
switched over to here theoretically
let's see if it actually does work if I
type this we shouldn't see it over here
and we do so something's messed up with
our filtering actually I think we're
actually since we subscribe to this
general we didn't unsubscribe so that
could be a problem so we'll have to fix
that but let's see if I type in this one
so this guy hasn't been to this channel
yet
I don't think so hello okay so we didn't
get it here and we didn't get it here
interesting all right so we have some
bugs with this we'll fix this in the
next video that's it for this guys
thanks for watching and I'm going to be
pushing this code up on github
