how a full-stack
application works how data flows between
each component and what I'm talking
about full deck here I have a react
front-end and Express server and a
Postgres sequel database but this is
very general and work with any kind of
front-end back-end in database now
there's way more ways you can complicate
this with other things that this is the
basics and this is how a lot of websites
work so labs are front-end for example
react and what it will do is it'll be
rendering the view what you see on the
screen is react and whenever it wants to
get data or maybe change something what
it will do is it will communicate with
the server that's our first arrow here
and one have to communicate with the
server what it will do is it'll make a
get post request or a different kind
there's delete update and a couple more
but the most often what you'll be doing
is doing a get request or post request
now these are HTTP requests and it's how
you talk to Express
and most the time what you'll do is
you'll actually send JSON data to
Express and say hey Express this is what
I want you to do an Express knows what
to do based on the JSON you send it or
the route you go to so you can go to
different URLs on the server and the
server knows how to handle it now this
is a little different with graph QL but
we'll get to that later
so once Express knows that you want to
do something react told it I am getting
a HTTP request Express now knows exactly
what to do and what it will do is I'll
actually make a sequel statement and
call the database to actually either get
the data or modify the data in whatever
way so whatever react told Express to do
Express maybe they'll do some
authentication to make sure the right
user and they'll go ahead and do the
requested authenticated and everything
is properly formatted and it'll make the
request to do that on you know grab the
data from the database update the
database in some way so the write a
sequel statement if it's sequel or if
it's Mongo or no sequel they'll write
some kind of query statement to grab the
data
and then Postgres sequel will send the
data back or the database will send the
data back to Express Express might
format the data and it will send it back
to react and then react renders to
screen and it just goes around and
around and around like that so as you
navigate through a website when react
needs something from the database maybe
it needs some data
maybe it needs to change something in
the database it'll make a request to the
server and the server updates the
database and then the server sends back
data for react to update the screen and
notify whether react whether the request
succeeded or because sometimes it can
fail sometimes you make a request and
Express says that and it'll go back to
react and be like hey something wrong
sorry we can do the request then react
can handle this on the front end and
view whatever you see and make sure
everything looks good so that's kind of
the basics of how a full-stack
application works now I'm going to talk
real quick about how graph QL changes
its up so graph QL would sit right here
I would say and right here it's like it
takes the data that Express it does two
things
it comes it handles the incoming data
and outcoming data so you could think of
it as kind of the logic that an express
to help format the data and to format
what the request looks like that
reactions it some earlier house telling
you there's different like URLs you can
go to and the server will act
differently with graph QL you usually
have one server and the JSON you send
from react changes how the graph QL does
so react will send some JSON and
different JSON that reacts ents are
always setting it to the same end point
but graphical will do different things
with it graph QL will actually format
the data and all it won't format the
data but it's you basically in graphical
you say a specific schema that you want
and it expects the data in that format
you can say it validates the format
that's a better way to say it or
validates the data it makes sure it's in
a proper format and then once it's in a
proper format you can then you know you
still build the sequel statement and
then you get the data back graph cool
might do some little bit of
formatting and validating that the data
it gets back from the databases correct
and it sends it back to react so graph
QL basically helps validate the data
inter Express and also have only one URL
you have to go to instead of going to
multiple so that is how full stack
application works please let me know in
the comments below if you have any other
questions or comments and let me know
what you guys think of this if you guys
like to build things in a different
manner or how you guys build your full
stack applications I'd love to hear it
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
