going to be trying react QL I've never
tried it before I'm just going to see if
I can get this thing set up and running
and play around with this a little bit
i've only ever used create create react
app it's kind of like a boilerplate
starter kit and here's another one a big
fan of graph QL and I will agree
actually mix the two is really nice so
we're going to try this out see if it's
any good so all I haven't even looked at
anything so far with it I've only just
ran NPM install just ran it here
so now just jump right into the
documentation so you can get this thing
set up see what happens okay so we
reinstalled the CLI we'd like to start a
new project somewhere around this
command so happened I'm going to Prague
all this my first to MIT will install it
here oh so we can choose if you want
typescript of JavaScript I'm not sure if
this is the latest typescript
actually one point one point two I'm
going to go ahead and click JavaScript
because I don't know typescript well but
I'm actually curious what version
typescript is out right now because that
looks like an older version of
typescript but I could be wrong with the
latest typescript is yep typescript two
point three is out so they have an old
version I don't know if the latest
version of es6 is so using 1.7 esc is
version es6 I don't even know what that
is I don't even know what the latest one
is I I knew that typescript was at at
least two I'm seeing a really long time
to live I don't even know where the
virtual would be
I heard about this okay so it looks like
it's set up first and navigate to yep
I'm right here I can do can build up her
production start production server after
building cool this looks very similar to
their one
I just ran in p.m. start Oh a create a
folder called my first has a CDN do npm
start alright so first thing you get an
air command not found run p so we just
open up oops package.json we can see
what's being run when we start so run p
browser over dev so they have a system
requirement here go to you for missing
anything
we have nodes so you have the latest
node up i have seven point six looks
like it needs seven point six at least
so I use mbm which is a node version
manager can do install seven we have
installed the latest one yep I'm
upgrading to ten now I'm sure there's a
way to just upgrade I'm not sure if that
Oh yep it just upgraded my automatically
cool now if I do NPM start don'ts in
there
gave the browser bundled targets ie and
on watering promises okay
installing CLI creating a new project
well that's weird
maybe I just have to do I'm gonna try
yarning sees their yarn lock so there's
no you are knocking the yarn in it
wait command not found let's just happen
because I need a team ah Oh
get out of here it's not it's not
because it's not because I'm in team ugh
so I just upgraded my node to ten right
so now after we install everything
because like if brac react ul doesn't
even work so I guess we reinstall react
ul and yarn and I'm actually curious
let's just open NPM five just came out
I haven't upgraded to that yet I should
do that because it has some nice speed
improvements so I'm going to go ahead
and upgrade that you know why not floppy
right over here upgrade I think it's
like this is how you upgrade an NPM
package and then from PM looks like it's
doing stuff okay now I'm going to try
doing NPM to start my project directory
still doesn't like it all right let's
yarn let that run install our packages
alright cool so now are we on NPM five
or not how do you upgrade to NPM five of
green and PM
how can I update yeah oh I need to do
gloat oh ha I think I just create a
package no and then I needed to use the
- G flag I think that was all I need to
do how do I update MPM - G so I don't do
this upgrade flag I just do - G coz it's
a global dependency check out all these
things that yarn is installing so I
guess it didn't react QL didn't tell me
that I needed to do that
I guess I was supposed to just you know
that so let's check out though
react QL had some pretty cool things
going on for it I want to show you guys
just the homepage so it's got a palo
built in which is really nice a power
just makes working with graph QL and
react really easy and really nice Redux
is you know we use forced or react
router i've used in the past it's nice
for routing webpack type things up this
is how you can add CSS there's a bunch
of different things to react project so
it comes pre-built with that and looks
like it's using koa which is very
similar to express it's a node framework
and I think server-side active
server-side rendering so this I think is
faster rendering I actually have never
done server-side rendering before I've
only ever done
just regular we got some blunting it
looks like hot code reloading I like
that ultra fast blah blah blah
aggressive no one cares about like this
stuff everyone should have redux toward
dehydration rehab
raishin interesting just basically
persist your redux tour and we're good
to go
MPM start no such oh do that to the
whole man to install these dependencies
okay it looks like it's starting up for
click it's creating some node
environment number some of our variables
here what pack is watching does this
mean it started nope now it means it
started okay so running locally writing
the server-side rendering here hot
reloading here so go to both of these
pages see what's on each okay hello from
graph queue the exact same on both page
so hot reloading browser I'm not too
familiar with how this works to be
honest I'm curious do we use the the
server side just for production and you
have it there for testing am I supposed
to be using this because this one's
reloading I assume the cell we got the
about page contact interesting stuff
going on here let's get out here and
let's open visual studio code check out
the code I'm going to just start up the
server again so we can take a look at
this so we got the server up and running
that's nice do this okay so these are
our folders here babel RC docker editor
interesting i wonder where these are
here
could the excellent looks like the air
DB style got quite a few not too may
actually that's a nice rules i'm
actually not sure what each one of these
rules does i'm not going to worry about
reading the lnternet
Brad the list not sure what that does
gig nor hopefully give you a lot of
stuff dockerfile this darker sensor is
recognized for this Baltic sure thank
you
package lock package you react object
nice let's see what dependencies so
these are dependencies ad I've never
heard of boxing or chalk or IP alright
let's just go straight into the source
code now Pass project looks like if
there's some config stuff we might not
ever need to really touch ok
so it looks like it may be setting you
up with graph cool right away which
looks like it is so for those of you
that don't know what graph cool is I'll
show you real quick graph cool graphic
cool is basically makes it really fast
this out a graph QL server so I'm
assuming I could just change this if I
wanted to say run my own graph QL server
so this looks like it's just the cool
you wouldn't actually do your graph QL
server here browser I don't think we
actually look at this stuff this looks
yeah this is distribution the line gets
bundled kit with kit
on here import chalk terminal library
this is the servers I'm assuming this is
just what server-side rendering looks
like looks like they're some react code
here Lib I have no idea how it works
let's look about later static files
queries ok so after I have okay this
looks familiar
I've seen code like this before looks
like it's got the newest react router
using version 4 that's nice kit Lib
routing ok so it looks like we're
getting stuff from here home they've got
a lot of comments oh nice so create
react app does not have this yet they do
not have so you can do these little
annotation so it's really nice helmet is
for adding headers I know that to your
code and ok this is the only javascript
file and doesn't look like as you'll see
a code like graph QL stuff yet
interesting I didn't know you this is
how you import graph QL files in so
it'll click is importing this graph gal
file into here interesting
okay graph QL message and it's a tag
what is this okay such this if we get
grabs all messages or loads it put it
here is loading yep
stat so now if we come back over here
you can kind of see what's going on I
guess let's let's check out a hot
reloading so message from graph QL
server hello from graph cool if I get
rid of you oops hit save
lutely look lictors we're just not hot
reload oh there we are oh did it not
even reload the page all right do you
guys see that look P rid of that look
nothing just update and whoa that is
really cool I wonder if that's because
it's using server rendering this is
pretty cool and go back over here this
is Kim look at what we have all messages
so all messages do a quick query full
parameters are necessary but if I just
do none nothing happened maybe get in
there
I can generate the code that's nice well
that was not what I expected I expected
something happened okay
I guess the graph QL is not so bad
I asked you don't have to point out my
graph QL phaser but look it's message
from graph QL server hello from graph
cool okay look look at the query we make
it will copy that first okay do first
there we go
txt hello from graph cool 10200 M
test and now you have a bunch of these
ok night so this is the graph QL server
that we're set up this so looks like if
I want to create my own graph server
graph QL server I would come up to
project and I could change this so for
example I could say well we're not going
to have HTTP what local host 30 30 or
3,000 and I can create a node server and
I could create a graph QL endpoint and I
can start interacting with that that
would be pretty cool but I think that's
it for this video I just want to get
this installed take a quick peek at what
this looks like I'm going to be trying
more stuff in the future with graph or
react QL what's called and trying this
out I'd only use graph cool maybe I will
later but I want to create my own graph
QL server to interact with so if that's
it for this video guys let me know how
you guys think
if you use react UL if you like it if
you're interested more react you'll
videos let me know in the comments below
and hit that subscribe button because
more are coming in the future
so ci is in the next video
