run and we're in the same air yes and
it's because the children okay so how
can we do this
okay I have an idea what we can do is
create an ArrayList of string we'll just
call this slash
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
pass it like what I like
did I call something slashes all right
just like that right there
slashes
string s /
and then it's going to do same thing we
did up here Cooper not doing this we're
gonna say slashes dot add string
lastly back
good or that near this try statement and
this catch statement
and we're gonna put back down here yen
/ / okay so now what we're gonna do is
and it's a dr. Hasson s slashes sorry /
and so we're going to do this passive
ArrayList this is slash slash slash is
we can just call this one rayless
slashes and call in slashes is equal to
slashes hey what's up man
okay now down here what we want to call
is we're setting this item name I want
to do a quick check is if that in the
slash is dot get I that is a good
position sorry we want to catch Center
and that is equal to note activity dot
slash unexpected token maybe I need to
put this before
what is it not like I'm slash not get
can I cast a string internet string all
right integer dot parse area
then we want to say we want to add a
slash to it then we're gonna call holder
dot item okay let's give this thing a
run and see if it works so now what
we're doing is when we call notify the
I've been working on this project for
probably a little over a week I have a
couple other I've so far extreme that
they broke again I screened the whole
process except for one video which I
accidentally missed messed up the
recording cannot cast integer into a
string what the heck why is it telling
you that let's log what the heck let's
log in slashes got to sting
and then for now I just want to say
items like I was saying I've been I can
show you why posted the earlier ones up
on YouTube you go to youtube.com and
then if I just go to my channel
if you come over here I should actually
post this link on my twitch page I've
just been a little lazy and you come
under videos I have the I have the hots
online you faced it by not copy at maybe
I have the other videos so let me paste
it let me try which taught to run
okay so what is what are we looking at
and I didn't do anything right now I am
a senior blonde taking classes at what
do you call it
at a local community college and next
year I'll be going to utd University of
Texas and Dallas and I will be going as
a computer science student max-q finger
roll is currently 14 seconds please set
it to 2 seconds here's the link to the
my youtube channel and yeah I'm just
coding for fun enjoy the app enjoy
making the apps this is my third app I'm
working on I've done two already one is
a arcane calculator which stands for
reverse polish notation which is the
cool calculator that you can use that's
a little bit different than a regular
calculator I like it better anyway I can
close this down really is any more I
like it a little better than a regular
calculator and also I've made a legal
legends one that connects with the API
what was I doing again I just oh yeah
yeah I was looking at the log statements
to see if the items okay I'm just gonna
make a tag
Slash's
Slash's plus this actually I'm actually
pretty sure this is empty right now all
right all I can show you a link to it I
should just keep this open I don't know
why I keep closing it oh yeah I should
to clip I should lower my keyframes
believe it's great it's called league
Scout Google Play Store it is called
wall Scout basically what it does is you
can look up your user and here it is you
can look up your user and you can get
stats on them and also you can you go
you can track how much time you're
playing league on you get notifications
it gives you stats it's pretty cool and
why don't I learn my keyframes real
quick settings video please turn off any
outputs to change video settings audio
output bitrate maximum heat rise audio
video bitrate that was talking about Mac
know it's keyframe
I have no clue how to change the key
frame okay I'll to look into this later
I don't know if I got it right now
okay let's click on this okay so I'm
thinking is slashes is empty is that
true
did it run okay I'm just gonna make a
tag real quick so public static the
public static final string tap tag is
equal to come on items array dot class
that's simple oh the bowl name and the
reason I'm doing that that's just kind
of a habit I've gone into for my log
statements I learned it in a team
treehouse video and I've kind of just
done ever since okay
alright popped up again and let's crash
good ok so where are we breaking ok
we're breaking on a way different line
right now why did I think I was breaking
right there
accept it yeah knocking injure cannot be
cast to a string Wow
ok wait what was I doing so this is an
integer but I was storing it let's try
doing boss maybe that'll work well okay
so when I was a junior I did I took a
MOOC course which is a free online Java
course to do for AP credit which is like
a test that you can take to get college
credit so I took an AP test or AP course
and it taught me a Java and the course
was Java course and I could job a test
and so that's where I learned the basics
of java and i actually from there just
started making some apps for fun and I
started learning also from just some
free sources and also I use team
treehouse a little bit and yeah Java was
pretty much the first language I learned
and then I actually know Python also I
spent some time learning that I actually
took it
I actually am just coming back to Java I
took a little bit of break and went to
learn Python for a little bit and I'm
actually back again and doing some Java
again so I actually know Python pretty
well so ok so thread
nullpointerexception
what the heck is going on oh I bet this
is just empty let this log not be let's
take a look at what this is looking like
I bet this is just an empty array right
now that I keep trying to do this is it
an empty array I don't know what it's
gonna look like let's just see and to
learn Python I didn't know if you heard
of learning Python the hard way
it's pretty popular book I use that to
learn Python
okay okay so this is what the array
looks like zero one zero so when I call
slashes get what's okay let's see
slashes the clashes JSON it's root dot
get it's returning an object so with
this this break
yeah cuz it wants a string ye doesn't
not let me cast into a string
maybe I here let's just do
let's make slashes a it sure
oh I ready know what the problem is
I never initialized slashes okay slashes
is equal to new ArrayList okay that was
what my problem was
I never initialize slashes okay and
let's actually just do that now let's
run it now sure almost thought that code
Academy is pretty good I use code
Academy right as I was I I remember
using code Academy right as I was
beginning with Python and also just when
I was very very beginning before I even
learned any programming language I went
there I think it's very good as a
beginner course I haven't been to it
lately so I don't know what has changed
it's pretty cool if you made some red
box why are we breaking now
what was it gonna say is I like
Codecademy but I think I think you need
a supplement it with some other
instruction because Codecademy it just
teaches you kind of like the basics and
if you want to go more in depth you need
to do other sources though what like I
started with code CAD me and I and then
I want to learn Python the hard way
though I don't know if learn Python the
hard ways even that much more extensive
I think code of Canon basically it's
well you can do whatever you whatever a
way you learn best and I do like like
the interactive console with code
Academy
the only other thing I was having a
problem it was buggy on my computer
sometimes not to string null pointer
exception so and the slashes is null
so the only thing with learned Python
the hard way is you need to be we need
to be careful is it's he can't he kind
of yells at you a little bit in the book
and also he you kind of yells at you in
the book a little bit it's also a little
bit repetitive so you need to make sure
you're doing projects on your own and
it's something like it in the very
middle of a course what kind of feel
demotivated almost and you do a lot of
typing he's very big on memorization so
he doesn't get a lot of typing exercises
to get your memory jog your memory and
memorized the stuff that I learned I was
trying to use the most general base type
of data structure when you're declaring
a variable like the list there try now
why it why is it good to do that to make
it general cuz don't you want to use the
type no actual difference performance
what helps you you ever need to refactor
okay I see in case you ever want to
change like an array list from being a
string to a same integer array list then
you don't have to change it all to the
other type you just keep it object and
is that for is that for everything or
just for ArrayList is that for anything
that has that type of bracket type thing
okay so why is it why am I getting a
freaking nullpointerexception
more than if you want to change the type
of list link list double interest okay
thanks for the tip I'll be sure to
next next time I meet I'll be sure to
add that in I've I don't know I
I've just been I'm just got used to I
don't know if I watched a video or what
but I'm just used to typing in string
like it just just as easily put object
but I'm gonna keep it string us now
because I'm gonna have to change I'm
gonna have to go back and change
everything not everything but I'd have
to go back and change when the next
realist I'll make I'll they get a object
slashes no problem I'll endure here see
for some person yeah
it's a it's a good idea I've never
thought about doing that okay so I
forgot I think I'm getting into air
right now with my I'm getting a
nullpointerexception all right not the
janitor the Type O so instead of using
an arraylist use list is that what you
mean but instead of using ArrayList keep
it as a list
oh okay I know what you mean ow okay
okay okay okay okay
I see what you mean okay yeah I got you
so like right here doing this all right
thanks okay okay okay
yeah per second I thought you said
putting object as the generic sorry I
got confused
okay so why am I getting a
nullpointerexception
so M slashes oh I know what it is I'm I
forgot to add it no no I added it so let
me log tag instructor slash dot let's
see what it looks like here yeah that
would be I would imagine that caused all
kinds of problems
okay so log okay so it's it's we're
getting a nullpointerexception
unable to start okay so I'm passing in I
know so when I pass and oh I'm a
freaking idiot look at this I put in the
slashes above okay that was just super
stupid I was adding slashes to I was I
was bringing it through this method
before I was initializing it so that's
why I was Randall so and I need to put
this in a try-catch because sometimes
wait do I need to put this through try
cash no I don't I don't cuz every time
there's there should always be something
okay let's run this and see what happens
maybe I need do I need it
so I'm think I'm trying to say whether I
need to put that in a to try statement
I'm thinking I don't just because
there's whenever there's oh my goodness
it worked yes let's go
hallelujah
let's get out of the app and run it
again and make sure this is for real
where the heck is the back button on
this thing I don't want to power off
decrease volume rotate crap where's the
back I know right
I thought there's just that stupid
mistake I was making okay here it is
and good now let's make sure when we
click that lets go
that's work baby all right cool
let's get rid of these log statements
now that's working we don't need them
that was a lot that was actually a lot
easier to fix than I thought it was
going to be all right we don't need this
content provider thing do I have any log
statements I just copy get rid of this
and good okay so I think we're looking
pretty good for now I like I like what
we're getting
oh boy
that just crashed and I know why too
no pointer exception okay so okay so I
know it's happening when we add an item
or when we try to add an item I need to
set okay I think I know how to fix this
when we add an item to the list get
dialogue got Show
okay so I'm gonna hmm I think I ought to
fix this but before I fix this I'll be
right back
okay when I hit add item I need to make
that alert me let's add this to do okay
when I add this item I need to also add
a what's that called
a whether it's slashed or not I need to
put default value into the every time I
add an item is that right though your
dialogue so in this dot ad I want to say
slashes got add and we just want to add
note activity dot
unselect I'm / and because this is a
string and this is an INT we just need
to put the quotations okay let's see if
this works
click on this is a new item let's say
ketchup
ok let's get outta here come back in
alright good
let's say Tilly beans
and say kale
and okay I think that's working now
that's good
next thing I want to do is add this
little alert so in my list view I only
want them to have a max of a hundred
items that way doesn't like explode so I
want to give my user a little message to
let them know they've reached 100 Saylor
dialogue builder builders builds a new
alert dialog builder oops
builder this
then we just want to say builder dot set
title say max items and say God said
what is that called description is it
called what's the set I you what is the
middle car called card Oh message that's
called set message you have reached a
maximum number of items
one list can hold one
okay and actually we don't want to just
cut that half and wanna set it positive
button just say okay and we don't want
to do anything once they forget hey
what's up what's wrong with my line
indications am i doing something wrong I
can come up here and have it clean it up
reformat code I can have it reformat all
my code
I'll just reformat my code real quick
okay there we go
I guess you guys know each other huh I
went ahead and just reformatted my code
so it should have took away all the
extra spaces and whatnot
you
let's see if I change this let's say
instead of jelly beans we just want
jelly okay good let's try deleting a few
leave back good
I appreciate less when I saw him in he
was discussing okay
pretty sure I wanna delete item and say
what is that called slashes dot remove
and in position
okay it's looking nice just be working
appropriately
you
I think what I want to do is let's do
that happens let's see how this ListView
folds under the button so I'm just gonna
make a bunch of ions
alright oops is holding nicely under
this button
through those come back in let's uncheck
them again okay I'm not gonna check with
their actually looks lower this to two
and then let's see it if it's worth
eating correctly stupid icons use
gestures I'm not sure what you mean by
that I've grabbed the icons I'm just
using these icons are thrown all right
see a hold to when you enter swipe left
or right a hole to open menu or swipe
left or right to delete a slash edit
okay so it was yeah I was gonna see if
that was working
no messages popping up okay so the only
thing about swiping swiping left or
right to delete slash edit is how many
letting my users know that you can swipe
left edit and swipe right to leave
should I make a tutorial for them cuz
like if you're just looking at a list of
stuff how would you know that swiping
left to right was a Dame bleeding or as
these icons are universal
I like the idea that's my only concern
with just doing a gesture
so I click add item okay okay
I could add like a wolf
okay I don't think it'd be that hard to
do a tutorial all I would do is have
like when this launches have like a
little pop-up not a pop-up but you
you've probably seen in the apps where
it's like a little dialog like looks
like a little pop-up sticking out of the
ListView saying like swipe me left or
right to delete / edit I was actually
let me show you let me see if I have
this on my phone I was looking at this
one app called swipes
I don't know if you guys can see that
but you can swipe left or right that's
how they do their list so I can try
doing something like how they do it for
now I'm just gonna leave the icons and I
can go I can always go in and add that
in later as a nice feature when I go in
I I do like the swipe left and right
better than the icons because they kind
of it kind just like there's a lot of
them on the side here and I don't know
how easy it is to press on with your
thumb okay so why isn't this dialog
showing so if items dot size is greater
than two or a less than two shows else
oh I need to push - Oh Phil there dot
show
yeah I agree with you I do think
gestures are very usability yeah Gmail
uses it to what so if that especially
bad legs yeah good point
all right so and now is she to pop up
there yeah max I know she'll reach the
number of items 100 you reached the
maximum number of items 101 List can
hold one I should say note one note can
hold all right
all right chats getting a little carried
away here let's try adding gestures I
mean I'm all for it let's go ahead and
go so I need to change to my layout the
row layout just need to comment that out
am I going to hear layout just check out
this item rebel just comment these out
and then I also need to go into my
adapter holder dot set
oh good
now I've never heard of Java no that's
how you pronounce it well what I could
do is I could I could also add added as
a setting to hide so that week if you
like the buttons to click edit and
delete you can do that or you can add
gestures I think what I'll do for now I
kind of like the gestures I'm gonna add
those in and when I get closer to
finishing the app I can make a final
decision on which one I like better but
I would do want to try and I need to
practice making I've never made a I've
never made I should make this a pop-up
I've never made I've never done gestures
before for a listview so I wanted to
practice that lets you gesture oops
ListView gesture listener I thing is all
I'm here
our newbie got this tutorial on
highlight atmosphere here I implemented
it works fine I need to implement a view
switcher for the same like little coupe
the problem is to detect touch gesture
right there for you let's rephrase our
Google search let's say swipe left
listener let's view Android
how that enjoyed laughter Shuang the
open different in try this dot set on
touch listener a set eye on them
item click listener sly protector Java
I'll just show a slight bottoms so how
do I do this thing working
swipe detector dot swipe detected
all right I think I think I'm gonna go
ahead and call it a night tonight and
work on this tomorrow I think I'm gonna
implement these gestures tomorrow looks
like it looks more complicated than just
doing it on item click listener so I'm
gonna go ahead and stop streaming for
tonight and finish this up tomorrow so
