video we're going to be creating the
signup page for creating users in the
app so we have our routes and we're
going to create a new one now the one
we're going to be creating is going to
be sign up and lower cases thought and
we're going to eventually make this into
a component that is connected to redux
tours so let's go ahead and do that now
next up GS okay so this is our sign up
page right here Graham an index in a
view and we're going to create a new
route or new scene going to be cold sign
up and the component is sign up okay and
we can just put this above I believe
it's called initial now under it and I
forgot to start my emulator so let's
just go ahead and start down the
background okay so we got our signup
page connected with our app and it
should go to the signup page first and
if I come over here to view now this
indictment in imports I up we're going
to really be importing this index page
what does the next page is going to be
doing is we are going to be using react
redux and we're going to connect the
application just like this so I'm just
going to copy this taking this from the
documentation of react redux this allows
us to access the Redux store within our
react application and I react component
so oops just popped up over here you can
go back won't need that so import
connect from the Act redux
and then the spine action creators so
whenever we should keep that then
whenever we add basically something to
the state and we want to use in our
application turn our application of our
component or sign up component will come
here and put it here right now we don't
really need anything but we're just
going to sit this up for now so we can
use that later and right here again if
there's any actions we need to add we
have actions here and now we import vu
from view and then here we just grab
that so any actions and any props that
we want to pass through our component
that we get from redux we're going to
add both of those and that's what these
guys are doing and we're connecting
those and allowing our view component
right here get access to that okay so we
have that you come over here and we're
going to be making a sign up page that
looks a lot like this so I'm just going
to copy this this is from native base
save it let's eat it finish it did let's
refresh this and we can just see if we
can see that get rendered and we can see
right so we see two input boxes no
button so Oh looks like they don't have
a button what did it so they have a
button this example but then they didn't
show it okay that's okay air input box
we're going to be using this later but
okay well though we need now button full
button so we want to do like primary do
the primary one
tab it over and we say sign up refresh
that and we need to import button and we
also you import text actually we should
get texts from here and I'm just going
to make this into a peer component so
export default
all right the spacing is a little bit
off because they use I think four spaces
that's okay all right so this looks good
for the sign up it needs to be some
spacing here so let's add that why not
set up right now bring that over we're
going to over one okay and we need to
have one more when we're creating we
also need to have an email and right
here again save files and we can save
margin top 10 and we can do the same
thing here start button and we should
add fool to the end here all right let's
see if that adds a little bit of spacing
their styles did you mean style yet so
styles to style now refresh that and we
have a little bit of space without a
little bit more so let's have 50 let's
try 50 here to interesting this goes
full length those are sold because its
last that one there we go that looks
kind of weird doesn't it xirrus look
like that will form
there's will click on sort of last all
right so we make the button up I want to
make it curve like this and we got that
okay so let's go to our button this
looks about how that looks but they just
have the margin may be at 20 there and
then their button they add rounded
buttons not that much rounded button
theme grounded icon button sighs block
that's what we want it's called block
full block see how that looks nope maybe
this this fool looks like it's
overriding the block alright that looks
better now Stiles thought in b4 i have
no idea what that's doing I assume
that's giving it some padding on the
side here block disabled
button block that's what we want we just
don't want it to be container content we
have container content too so let's add
a new style here that'll be margin all
around actually margin 50 is going to be
too much yeah Marge and right 20 margin
left 20 all right that looks very
similar to the picture now we go back to
form yeah let's make it 10 though
refresh that and all right I'm happy
with it so now we want to be able to say
my user name is Bob Bob here whatever
and we can sign up so to do that what
we're going to do is we're going to do
we're going to use Redux form this is a
nice library that mix forms really
easily so just going to follow the
implementation guide here so I'm going
to need to add it to my reducers but
before I do let's go to our application
and just add it so muse yarn to install
it Redux form and just let that run in
the background ok now I'm going to come
on over here to my route reducer and
we're going to add this and now we don't
need Bob anymore we can say form is
equal to form reducer
okay and then step two is to import
Redux form in our forum so come up here
and import and then here we go so I'm
going to say comps this will be sign up
so it will export default don't need
this stuff don't need this stuff and we
will sign up and our forum will be
called sign up okay so that hooks up
rocks form we can now use these sealed
components so what we'll do here is say
field and I think what I want to do is
actually because when they're getting
errors I'm coming back over here we have
a custom field 1 i'm looking for one
that uh here you have submit validation
I think believe has it looking for an
example where he has it broken out like
this okay this is what we want we can
copy a constant your field
so we can grab the type let's say pass
end and then placeholder and then we're
going to render that so here we're going
to say field name is going to be
username type see actually we don't need
type we just need something to
distinguish between password fields will
do that in a second though so the name
and then just placeholder equal to user
name so then I can a review and then up
here what I'm going to do just going to
copy that paste it here and then our
placeholder is whatever we use we pass
in as a parameter so then we refresh
that see if it shows up okay and if it
looks the same this allows us to add the
functionality that we want okay expected
a string for the component so we just
forgot the past a component in here
component render field so now I can
refresh this and cool and i can type and
stuff it looks ok so now i can copy and
paste this for each component so now
this will be email and we have password
down here so the only thing that's not
working or is that we need to make more
modular is noticed i when i type the
password it shows that so we just need
to come over here to our need
base component if you go to text it
should tell us how to make text not text
input a password actually right here
adult 60 even I don't think they're even
telling it so react native password
input because we want to hide the text
so he's some way of doing that and
that's going to be 0 an auto capitalized
we want to get rid of drop that thun
your line auto capitalized I believe
it's none excuse me so none I'll get rid
of capitalization Kappa Tau Kappa Tau I
real and I'm just looking for keyboard
type that's not very important on change
text we're going to need to do that
maybe I i missed it should be like okay
here we go stick your text entry and
this is going to be true and just to set
a true value you don't set to true you
can just add it there so on change so in
react native it's slightly different
from regular react I believe there's an
FAQ out let's see if they have it and
that this form instead of doing on
change they use unchanged text whereas
an input for the web just uses on change
so we actually need to basically change
this here you yes it does most of the
cosine there a minor difference okay and
this is what I was talking about so we
need to copy that so now we can map that
on change then we can do dot dot dot
rest input okay okay so that basically
adds all the other props so now let's
make sure the password looks okay Oh
equal to secure text entry and we can
pass that in as a prop secure your text
entry so down the pass were here i can
say your text entry all right you're
under
good token 10 go line 10 think I just
need to do that alright so now i can say
Bob ball at Bob and my password it's all
blank out okay cool so now we can all
those values are working nicely and now
we have this error field let's go ahead
and do that while we're at it so
whenever there's an air ok so its input
group iOS closed circle icon trying to
see if there's different way to do it we
move the only way they do it we don't
have to add that I guess we can just win
air can I add the arrow to this input
air I just want to see if this will show
up red now and it doesn't do I need to
do an input group I guess so
I guess let's copy this into this work
come on over both set and we don't need
that okay now you can remove air from
that let's refresh and I like on this is
getting quite long so let's drop this to
a new line
okay now we can put icon there okie
dokie so now air is equal to touched and
air so if the field has been touched and
there's an air then there's an air and
we only display the red X if that's true
as well so we're going to say touch and
air now when are you reach fresh there
should not be any red lines and there is
it very nice ok let's drop this to a new
line now we're going to work on
submitting this so I believe it's on
press and then on press we're going to
say handle submit and this is something
that Redux for and passes to you so it's
something we get from the props handle
submit and then we can call our submit
function shall call on zimmet so we have
our on submit function here on submit
and it's going to go ahead and pass in
all our fields and our fields where
username email and password so what I'll
do is I'll check if they're empty so let
air is equal this and then what is air
equal false
and then if username trim is equal to an
empty string then we'll say errors that
username is equal to acquired then we'll
do that all the way down and we'll check
for email and we'll check for password
just layer checking and we'll say is
there is equal to true and then we'll do
a check right here if is err else will
submit form so throw the air back go
back to read X form we have some air
handling we is Nutella Dacian submission
air so you import that and then down
here we throw a new submission air throw
new center snare or pasta airs just to
show you that this is working now if we
leave one of the fields blank then it
should give us an heir
undefined is not an object so if they
don't specify feel that comes in on
behind so we just set default values as
empty strings we don't get that error so
refresh so you use your name Bob say we
don't leave those we try to sign up and
it says hey can't leave these blank and
looks like we got a warning build.prop
type and i'll prob type air of type
string supplied to input group expected
boolean and input group created by oh
let's not liking it because I'm not
passing in a boolean basically I mean I
could do this true false let's see if it
like that better if it likes I better
all right whole key bet for now that I
get rid of warning which should be the
same thing okay so now what should
happen when we submit the form let me
submit the form we'd like to make a
request to the server so anytime we're
doing that we're talking about doing
Redux saga so let's get into that so
what we're going to do is let's create
some actions that they can call and for
this I want to use a redux action
there's a library for making actions and
it just helps for basically not doing
duplicate code so install this library
yarn ad and then we can add some actions
so we'll import that and we'll say cons
request sign up is equal to request fine
up and then we'll say comps and we're
exporting all of these and then the
action will be request sign up is equal
to create action passing in request sign
up and now we're going to create a saga
import come actions we're going to
listen for request sign up and we're
going to take latest not take every the
difference is if you send another
request like if I double click the
button it will only send once and that's
what we want so this is going to be sign
up saga and it's going to call sign up
call sign up and we're going to create a
new file called sign up from api so
we're going to create a new local file
called API that we are actually going to
create the sign up request so so we're
listening for the sign up saga when you
do we call this and we're going to call
we're going to pass an action not
payload what we're going to call this
sign up and then what we're going to
listen to for is an air and response
if there's an air and we're not going to
transition to the next page if there is
we're going to transition to a new page
and also to throw the error back to
redux saga we can come over here to
action creators like let's say we try
creating when the user name has already
been used any type of error what we can
do is we can start and stop some it so
import start submit stops emit from
Redux form so when we call sign up what
we want to do is going to say yield put
start submit and I'll just be an empty
oh we need to put the form that we're
submitting that's going to sign up okay
so we start a submit to the server and
we need to tell our ex1 that we're
stirring the submit and then at the very
end what we're going to do is we are
going to stop some it for this and then
we're going to pass the response back to
our plum and if if again air or whatever
and then if we don't get an air we're
going to change page and we'll that we
it will implement that later so put stop
submit so then we also need to create
our sign up so API GS so here we're
going to do is we're going to import
some stuff from we're going to go up one
we're going to import from this index
file here so index
and we're going to get users so let's
create users so export con users is
equal to rest app service users because
what we're doing actually yeah xik we're
creating a new user and then we're going
to create we're going to create an async
function for this so Facebook networking
react they have some nice syntax we're
going to be using the oh wait syntax
that's really nice i'll show you it here
it is using this async functions alright
so we're going to wait users create
payload via from here and this is going
to be sign up so we're going to pass in
the username password all that stuff
here and then we're going to send it
went way for their small that we're
gonna get the response and then we're
going to return it and then if there's
an air we can print the air and we can
return here we can just return a weight
response thoughts case on and my
ready come back is JSON this might throw
an air well we might we'll have to play
with that a little bit here though we're
going to return air dot airs and sure we
can console what that is and errors the
errors is something from feathers yes I
believe has the wrong thing here but
we're printing it out we can fix this
later if we get an air okie dokie so
we're all ready to accept an action now
oh no we're not could we need to just
listen for that saga so now we do import
that would be signup saga from nuts user
/ saugus and now we fork signup saga
okay so now we're listening for it now
in our signup index file we're going to
do is we want to call that action to
start the sign up so we're going to say
import request sign up from we're going
to go up one directory to directories to
modules user actions and then we're
going to pass that to the props request
sign up so now when I come here come
down to the bottom I can now grab
request sign up and I can pass it in
here on submit field and request MIT
request fine
so field requests sign up and now we can
accept two parameters up here this will
be our request sign up now we can say
request sign up passing in the username
password and email okay so everything is
connected I'm just going to open up on
your window refresh that when we run
this it should create a user but we
might have some errors so what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to their start
logging for this so i know we have an
arrow we'll look at that in a second
time as per inch tutorials okay so react
native log iOS so now we can see what
we're getting from and i also want to in
our sagas before i forget console.log
response okay now to our air we're
getting unable to resolve module user /
loggers Oh throughout the dot slash
okie dokie so now my username be Bob Bob
to and sign up I shouldn't may not have
been defined might have an undefined
type property have you misspelled it
constant okay not sure what that means
create action a quest sign up of course
sign-ups sagas oh here we should be
doing requests sign out actions
reactions may have may have it undefined
type property Kree action let me just
make sure I have the syntax right I
guess from critics actions here you go
Const increment yeah this looks good I
think it might have just been that old
Sita hey still some things wrong with my
my thing so request sign up for more
sagas who are grabbing it I'm assuming
it's coming from here or quest sign up
from user actions request sign up
request sign up is equal to create
action this looks good
forgetting oops request signup request
sign up a question oh you know what
there could be um would I just open
sorry okay hey I'm thinking the air
might not might be with this with this
start submit and the stops in it so
let's check the Redux form start submit
stops mint you'll put comment goes out
I'll just see if that's what's causing
it or if it's my actual other action I
messed up sign up view 07 oops there we
go
guess it's not that I might have
misspelled a type this is really weird
I'm doing something silly create action
cause sign up action doc Taylor console
dot log is it even making it to this
action I wonder let's see yeah let's
just start putting print statements to
see where this area is coming from okay
have you misspelled in action okay so we
don't even get here it's actually only
calling request sign up cross sign up ah
here we go I just had should be getting
requests sign up from up here and
accidentally pass it as a prop there
okay now you're on that and I can go
back to my sagas okay good we didn't
change anything a uncaught at check call
argument function is undefined okay I
think it's probably something to do with
this even then we call handle submit
let me make sure rioc saga it's handled
submit yep to handle submit let you pass
and on press for handling submit which
we grabbed some up here and on assume
that we call with our field and request
so what is this console that error
uncaught at check argument f and it's
not to find all right I'm guessing it
has to do something with our saga so
consulate log hello I think it has
something to do with our or sign up if I
would have to get up yes I do i do I
know it is we're not exporting X for
Claire we go now refresh a ok page not
found that's fine ok so we're getting a
feathers air up / users / / oops
because in my index here put a slash at
the end of host now sign up also JSON is
not function responses are JSON response
okay as I was expecting responses are
JSON isn't a thing we just returned we
actually literally just return this our
call from create so refresh on run run
validation error okay validation error
airs and we now we want to get the first
value message path okay so path is
username okay so we want to do because
when we get an heir we don't return
heirs we're training object and whatever
it's called and then air and the thing
that goes here is air that airs getting
the first one path so what tax is going
to be is going to be username and a user
name must be unique so this is going to
say username here and we're just passing
air that's fine we would want to put
better error messages but this is ok for
now again the validation error okay
so it looks like the we're having an air
with property name but wanna try is this
just works if I have a good one so Tom
at Tom Tom and that should create a user
let's check that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
