video I want to touch on something i did
in a previous video that I kind of just
glanced over and I want to revisit up to
make it a little bit more clear I'm just
going to go to my downloads there's
nothing there i delete everything from
last time um but what I'm going to talk
about is the dot so you saw let me do a
command I'm just going to make a few
folders ABCD you saw me do move
something in a to the current directory
I just want to explain what was
happening there so I want to create a
file and a called some some file clear
so we have ABC and if we do an LS na we
have a sub 1 so someone is in a and if I
want to move someone to the Downloads
folder so just to be clear I want to
open up finder and kind of show you guys
how this is working on find your loop
atheria so in downloads we have a folder
called a inside a BF some file and I
want to move some file up to this
directory right here so there's a couple
ways so I can go about doing that so
move first like I am currently in
downloads I could go into a and now I'm
currently an a I could move some file up
a directory that's what dot dot means so
it would go above a and go into download
so if I do an LS above me and move some
pile up there now I'm just going to move
some file back today and it's back now
the other way is from doing it from
downloads as I can move a dot some file
into the current directory and you
specify that by using the dot so I'm
moving a dot some file where am i moving
it to the directory directory i'm
currently in or the folder in the end
which is this one right here that you
see on your prompt so that moves it
and if we run it sure enough we see some
file so it's pretty simple but I just
want to go for that make sure it was
clear another thing that can sometimes
be helpful is to know like a path they
like to the current director you're in
so if you do pw PWD that shows you the
path so i am currently in slash user
slash bin Awad / downloads if I go in to
be a new PWD you know this is the same
thing as above except i'm now in the B
folder so that can be helpful sometimes
to see where you are relative to other
things there's one other command I want
to cover real quick and as the bang sign
this will let you basically do commands
that you've done before so what does
that mean so for example let's say I
touch now let's not touch let's what's a
good one for this let's go back out
let's say I want to yeah let's CD into a
no that won't work what what the bang
saying does is it will do the same
command that you've done before typing
in that same command so for example if I
did cat-on-cat too bad one if I did LS
will do LS if I did LS on see there's
nothing there if I did bank sign LS it
would run the previous command the ls on
see and notice it doesn't pray anything
it just tells me what command it ran if
I didn't LS just here I would see ABC
some file and if I did bank sign LS it
would then run LS doing the same output
because it's running the same command
but notice I kid for example move up a
directory I'm if I wanted to go to been
Awad and I can do the bank's time LS and
it still runs the same LS you know
command we're just in a different
directory so it does something else so
it just runs the command that you ran
before so let's go back to downloads
and this can be done for anything so for
example I can do the CD that I just did
but of course I'm not currently in a
downloads who won't go anywhere better
example is like for example if on a CD
into a desktop I'm now a desktop let's
say I want to go yeah let's I could do
CD and we stay and desktop and we
basically run the same command which
does nothing but this this is not
exactly these these commands aren't
exactly where this is super helpful for
example let's say you do write a longer
command maybe I'm removing on ABCD in
this one folder and then I want to
remove these another folder so i do bang
sign RM and it runs it again but
basically it's good to know this will
come up this is kind of an itch a
command that is very helpful sometimes
but you don't use it all the time it's
the repeat commands and unfortunately it
does not actually let you expand and no
the command that you're going to run
that would be nice but non bash and
other shells which we'll talk about
later you can so bang sign lets you do a
command you did before PWD prints your
path and then dot as i said is your
current directory so CD dot does nothing
but that's good for moving things around
and that sort of thing copy so i hope
that was helpful and those commands make
sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
