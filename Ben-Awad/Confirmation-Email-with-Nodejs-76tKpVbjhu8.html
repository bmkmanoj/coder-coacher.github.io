different websites when you register for
an application they send you an email
and you have to click on a link and
before you click on the link and confirm
it you can't access their website they
require you to click on the link and the
reason for that is to avoid spam and
people trying to put fake emails and
that sort of thing so today I'm going to
show you how to do that exact thing
using no GS now we're gonna be using a
library called node mailer to do this
you could switch this out with a
different service like SendGrid
or AWS has sending emails the same
strategy will work for all of those but
first let's show an example of how this
works so I'm about to register for an
account I have a temporary email right
here I'm gonna use to demonstrate this
so I'm just gonna copy this email here
and I'm gonna register using that so I'm
just gonna use that for the username
email and password I'm go ahead and
register and as you can see it takes a
second to register and then we will see
registration worked and the reason why
it took a little longer to send there or
to get the response back it was one or
two seconds is because we're actually
sending an email before we're doing the
response and then if I were to come over
here and I try to login paste this here
we get a please confirm your email to
login so we can't login yet because we
haven't confirmed or email so I'll come
over here and we see we got an email
here from bin Awad Apps and it says
please click this email to confirm so
I'm gonna go ahead and click on this
link and I take it to the login page and
I'm gonna console ok click on that and
we put it in and log in worked so cool
we successfully confirmed our account
and are able to log in now of course you
could do different splash screens in the
middle there and say hey you just
confirm doing email click this button to
login now or what not I just was
redirecting them straight to login so
let's I'll show you next how we actually
got to send this link how this link is
working in the code
kindness the power this guy because this
is pretty cool so let's come over here
this is the code for it the first thing
I did is I made a confirmed attribute in
the user table or property so now I know
whether the user has confirmed their
account or not and by default that is
false and then whenever I am logging in
the user I'll just check user dot
confirmed and if they are not confirmed
I'll say please confirm your email to
login so that's kind of what I'm doing
to check and make sure that the user is
logged in now to send the email I told
you I was using node mailer and that's
what this register function is doing
right here so it's first creating a user
right then it's using node mailer
and we created a transport I'll show you
that in a second we're creating a
transport and we're also passing an
email secret because if you look at this
closely over here this is actually a JWT
token I'm passing back so you can use it
for multiple things and one of them is
email confirmations it's really nice so
we're signing that token with an email
secret and the transporters actually
send the email now there's two different
types of emails that I'm going to show
you guys of ways you can send the email
I prefer the async email because it's
faster so you saw when I clicked
register it took like a good 1 or 2
seconds to get a response from the
server and the reason for that is we
commented out async email and right here
we were doing synchronous email and the
way synchronous or how this is working
is I'm actually creating the token this
is the token that I'm going to send in
the email and I'm all I'm doing here is
I'm passing the ID of the user so I know
when the user I basically know which
user to confirm so we're storing the
user's ID here and we're using the email
secret and I'm saying this expires in a
day he could do a week however long you
want your basically link to be valid for
then we're linking to this confirmation
so this is the Express server localhost
3000 slash confirmation
passing that token I'll show you guys
how this route works in a second but
that's the URL we redirect people to and
then we're doing transporter dot send
mail and we're awaiting the response so
this is what's taking a long time
because we're actually waiting for the
mail to get sent and make sure and if
not we're catching any areas that occur
and we could like tell the user hey the
email wasn't sent for some reason but a
lot of times you don't see that a lot of
web sites what they'll do is hey did you
not receive your email click the link or
something right
to resend it because they're making
their email sending asynchronous because
you saw how long it takes as you can see
here's our actual email the subject is
confirm email and then the HTML all I'm
doing is putting a link in there and
doing the URL that we created right here
so let me show you guys though how much
quicker it is if I do this one so this
is an async email I'll show you guys how
much faster this one is so let's come
over here I actually can't use this same
email actually I'll do is I'll just drop
the database real quick so I'm gonna
come over here to index and I'm gonna
say force that's true so this will drop
the database and let me to recreate this
user so I can show you guys just how
much faster this register is so go ahead
and put all these fields in and we hit
register and look how much faster the
responses but it'll still send the email
for us it just sends the email and a
different thread it's asynchronous so if
we wait here a little bit longer we
would see probably another message pop
up I'm not sure if you're gonna see the
same I don't know how how this truncates
messages since it's the exact same
message I don't know if it's gonna get
rid of it or what but okay we don't have
to worry about that but you guys saw how
much faster so with the sync async one
what I'm doing is I'm signing the token
and they can't give you a callback
function and in that callback function I
am
the exact same thing I'm creating the
URL and then I'm sending the email in
the same way the only difference as you
see I'm not awaiting the response so
this is happening asynchronously okay
let's take a look at what this end point
right here is doing so you see how we're
signing the token with the ID and we're
saying it expires after a day and then
we're using this email secret this is
important and then we're sending them to
click on that link so when they click on
that link what's gonna happen is they're
gonna come to this endpoint up here this
is has nothing to do with graph QL right
now this is just plain old rest endpoint
confirmation expecting a get route and
we're accepting a token as one of the
parameters in the URL so you saw here
how I was doing slash and then I'm
passing my token I'm reading in that
token right here and that's what wrecked
up RAM slot tokens gonna be is whatever
they pass here so I'm just doing a
try-catch here I first try to verify the
token using that secret that I have
that's why I know no one tampers with
the token and changes it in any way and
make sure it hasn't expired it's been
passed a day we don't want to verify
them or whatever long so we grab that ID
that we had and all we're doing is we're
then with our sequel eyes model I'm
updating that user so where the ID is
equal to the ID we stored in that token
we changed them to confirmed if
something goes wrong we just do res dot
send air and then I'm redirecting if
everything worked to the front end and
I'm just doing slash logins so they can
log in so that's it guys that's how it
works so as you can see it's actually
not too bad to do email confirmation and
you can switch out this portion of the
code right here in the resolver so in
the resolver we're sending an email with
this transporter using node mailer but
you could do something else besides node
mailer and I was going to show you guys
the transporter that's up here here's
the transporter this is me carrying node
mailer and I'm using my gmail account
using my gmail username and password
I'm storing these environment variables
so I don't show you guys my credentials
but you could store these as strings if
you wanted to
and then yeah we're just confirming the
token that we created in our resolve
Rove here make sure nothing has been
tampered with and then we're updating
that user so pretty cool
and let's see sure enough we get the
second confirmation email here so it did
work using the async method so I would
recommend you guys doing this and what
you could even do is have like a little
length the user could click on if the
email doesn't get sent or something that
they can then do this so that's it for
this video guys this code will be up on
github so you can check it out and do
confirm e confirmation emails yourself
and the link will be in the description
below so thank you guys for watching and
let me know if you have any questions
about this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
