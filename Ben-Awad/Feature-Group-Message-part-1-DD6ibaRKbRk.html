because we are going to be refactoring
how we do direct messages now that we
have private channels we can pretty much
call how we're doing direct messages
refactor it and underneath the surface
behind-the-scenes we're going to be
creating channels but what the user
thinks is that their direct messaging
users so it's gonna be pretty cool but
before we get into that I noticed a
small bug we introduced when we did
private channels and it's when you
create a new user and you don't have any
private channels so I can come over here
and try to make a public channel like
hey great Channel and actually just
crashes on me and the reason for this is
because I have no private channels
here's the code that we're using to grab
the channels notice how we are
implicitly joining on this table PC
members we're doing that over here the
problem comes if we don't have any PC
members implicitly we're doing what's
called an inner join which means if we
look at this we want to do this type of
join a left outer join here's what we're
currently doing an inner join so if we
don't have any elements in table to our
table - is the PC members so even if we
have channels if we have no private
channels it returns nothing because
there's no in-between part so we need to
change this from doing the current
implicit inner join to a left outer join
where we also get the channels that are
public even if we have no private
channels but we still get the private
channels if they do exist so we're going
to do a left outer join
and the way we're going to do this is
now instead of from channels I see and
then also grabbing it from that I'm
going to say left outer join and we're
gonna say on and we can just bring this
down and we're gonna copy the condition
we have right here so when the channel
ID matches with the member channel ID we
want to match up and then here all we're
gonna say is we can get rid of that part
there so now we're fetching the teams or
sorry the channels where we have the
team ID like we want and now we're just
checking if it's public or if the user
ID matches up if we're invited to that
channel and giving that a save giving
that a sec to refresh that'll solve all
our problems over here with the channels
getting messed up okay so you see all
the channels I have now for this new
user come over here can create some more
channels and they pop up just okay and
none of them are private that still
works alright now let's get started on
refactoring our direct messages the
first thing I want to do is use this
component right here right now I have no
other members on my team because I
created a new user so right now I just
see myself and I want to use this select
members to my other members in my direct
message so I want to see it here because
we don't want to just invite one member
now we can do multiple members and we're
able to that easily because we're
treating them as channels underneath the
surface and before we actually move it
over I also want to refactor how this
works because right now we're able to
see ourself which there's really no
reason to invite yourself to your own
channel or direct message you're
creating so let's just filter that out
okay so we're good with this now this is
our multi select users we want to grab
the
current user ID and just filter on the
list that we get so filter teams where
the team ID is not equal to current user
ID and now we need to pass the current
user ID to our multi select user so
that's in our add channel modal so we're
just going to pass in current user ID
current user ID but we actually don't
have current user ID in this component
so we need to pass it to the props
current user ID and so we're not passing
it to the ahead channel modal either so
the component that calls this component
needs to pass in the current user ID
which is our sidebar so here I have to
say current user ID pass that in and hey
look our current user ID is not in our
sidebar either so we need to pass that
in so we're gonna get this from the
props as well and so what calls our
sidebar component well that's our view
team over here and in our view team
we're gonna pass that in current user ID
current user ID and the current eye user
ID is coming from this me query that we
made and that's just gonna be the ID of
the user and I'm gonna rename it to
current user ID and now let this refresh
we now should see herself an empty list
because there's no other users on the
team perfect so now let's use that
component in our direct messages so
we're actually just gonna pretty much
copy and paste our add channel modal
into our direct message modal now cuz a
lot of the things are gonna overlap
now we don't need downshift so I can
actually just kill downshift on one big
swoop and now the form field that we're
going to show is going to be this guy
right here a multi-select
and I'm fine using the same value set
field current user ID all that stuff and
we don't need this we're not gonna worry
about history here at least and so we
don't need downshift we get rid of that
we don't need this query we don't need
graph QL we are gonna be using formic
now with formic and actually my bad we
do need graphic UL we'll keep that there
we're just gonna be doing a different
query than what we were doing before
before we were doing this get team
members query but we're not gonna be
using that and we have a lot of
higher-order components now so I'm gonna
use the compose power component which
allows us to just comma separate these
guys like this and because we're gonna
also add formic to this component I'm
gonna say with formic add in that and we
have one too many parentheses and I
think we're good now make sure we had a
comma there and we're gonna be adding a
new query that we're gonna be running
it's actually going to be a mutation and
we only have a cancel button right now
so form dot group I also want a
submit button or a start messaging
button if you will so on click that
should get handle submit handle submits
coming from formic so let's grab that
you know it just doesn't like the way
we're indenting so let's import first
our multi select users so multi select
users from the same multi select users
this components is in this field so
we're gonna grab that and then we want
to just pass in all the format crops so
and also we need current user ID so
formic has all these guys so give that a
copy paste them in save and then we're
also need to in our sidebar we're
passing in the current user ID do that
for our direct message modal we don't
need handle change or handle blur or is
submitting we can give to these two
buttons so is submitting that's gonna be
disabled so we disable it if we are
submitting disabled is submitting we're
using set field here for our members
that's good select members to message
reset form we should be I'll talk about
that in a second actually for now I'm
actually not gonna do this graph QL hi
we're component because we don't have a
mutation that we want to run and I'll
talk about that in a second we just want
to basically console.log what we select
here and I'm gonna come over here and
grab the formic
area copy paste it in so this is all our
formic stuff all our format props we
don't have a public or a name we just
have members and the handles submit we
don't need all this junk in here quite
yet
give that a save and this looks fine
also we want to reset the form when
we're cancelling so II I want to call
reset form and then I want to call on
closed on e give that a safe okay so
when we're canceling we're gonna reset
the form reset forms coming from formic
this looks pretty good to me
we're not running any mutation when this
runs but let's just see if it looks okay
again since I have no users yet I don't
see any users I can select a message so
I'm going to create some users in a
second so we can see this but first I'm
going to wire everything all together so
cancel now we need to add another column
to one of our database fields and that
is for our channel because when I create
a direct message it should pop down here
not up here so if I'm creating channels
I need to know whether this channel is
for direct messaging or just a regular
channel so we're gonna create another
field called diem in our channel which
is gonna pop right here we're basically
going to say if the channel is a DM
Channel then it comes down here alright
so let's just come over to our back-end
and see me models channel I'm gonna just
create another boolean field the default
is false for this and it's going to be
called direct message so by default it
is not a direct message channel we have
to especially create it
now because we just added a field to
this we're going to have to give them to
our index over here and sync force true
so I'm going to lose all my data so I'm
gonna have to come over here and go to
register to create a new user now and
let's just make sure cool we're done
forcing it so Bob Bob Bob calm okay cool
so here's our team so now I count on
that we'll split this in the UI in a
second but what do we want to happen
when I select my users and then I click
start messaging so let's actually add a
couple users so we can see that that
working because we're not gonna be
dropping the database anymore so I'll
create Bob - Bob - copy paste and let's
create Bob 3 Bob 3 ok
so two other guys and I'm still logged
in as Bob and we'll invite those guys to
the team so invite Bob 3 and we're gonna
invite Bob - and now I'm gonna direct
message them cool so I see them pop up
that's perfect now let's make sure
everything is wired up ok so we can
close this what I mean by that is I want
to just console dot log values dot
members
so when I submit I should see and we can
discover that for now what should happen
is I should console.log values not
members so I should see the members that
I selected at least their IDs so empty
about three start messaging perfect so
this is ID of Bob three now originally I
thought what I would do is just call the
create channels mutation that we created
passing our members here and then just
automatically create the name based on
the people that are in the channel but
there's one small problem with that and
that is what if I could open up direct
message I come over here select Bob
three Bob two and I start messaging them
so I just created a channel with both of
them and then I come back to here
and I start messaging again then I would
create two channels with the same users
and we don't want that so really we need
to create a new mutation and what it
does is it finds a channel if it exists
and if the channel does not exist then
we create it so it's gonna look at these
two users search for our database if we
have a channel already created between
these two users a direct message channel
specifically and they're the only two
members then we're gonna just return
that otherwise we are going to create a
new one all right so let's do that
okay so first thing we're do is come
back to our schema and our back ends so
channel over here we're gonna call this
get DM channel and I'm just gonna pass
in the members and that's gonna be an
array of events and what we're gonna
return is an int so the int that we're
gonna return is we're either gonna find
the channel and return the channel ID of
the channel that they we've arey created
we're gonna create a channel and pass
the ID back and then that's we're gonna
be using to show the users so that's
what get direct message channel is going
to do we could call it get or create
channel save and then let's create the
actual result so we can copy this get or
create channel pass in here so we need
to obviously be authenticated so we're
gonna do requires auth around this so
how are we gonna know if the members so
args here the only args is members which
is an array of IDs and we could say
const
real members actually no I was gonna say
let's just push on to this members dock
push and we're just gonna add the users
ID the current user ID so use it ID so
the you the members that they select and
then we're also adding the current user
those are all the members so first we're
gonna check if channel already exists
with these members if direct message
Channel so the way we're going to do
this is by doing a special query so I'm
going to say Const
response is equal to a wait models dots
equalized query and we'll run that query
here so actually fiddled around with
creating this query for a little bit and
here's what I came up with I'm gonna
copy this and explain it over here how
this works
so paste it so the first thing we're
gonna do here is we want to get the ID
right so I'm selecting cita ID where C
is from channel so from channels we're
group bys what we're gonna be doing and
then having and I could capitalize those
okay so let's walk through this so the
end result of what I'm going to be
getting is the ID of the users or of the
channel I mean sorry the channel that
has the DM channel that's created now I
also needed to add to our where clause
where channel dot DM is equal to true
and also yeah so that's good and we also
need to do grab the team ID from this as
well actually so team ID
so seedot team ID is equal to team ID so
couple other where clauses here but okay
so we're looking at channels and private
channels and the reason for that the
reason why we need to look at private
channels is because of course direct
messages are going to be private
channels so here you know we could add a
so we're making sure that channel that
DM is true we could also check C dot
public is equal to false so another
condition for us to check there
so we're joining these two tables on
this and in this case we're fine doing
an implicit join enter join because
we're only looking for private channels
so that's good and then here we are
finding the ones that are direct message
channels and that are not public and
that are inside the team that we want
and so we're gonna pass as a parameter
the team that we want so all that should
be left just from this bit here filtered
down is the channels that are private
direct message channels and our team and
then from that we just need to verify if
the direct message channel is actually
it contains these members so to do that
we're grouping by channel ID and we're
looking at each Channel and what we're
doing is we're grouping together
that's what array aggregate does this is
an aggregation function by Postgres that
we're using and what that allows us to
do is take this list and put into it ray
basically so we have an array of user
IDs these are all the user IDs that are
in the current channel that we're
looking at so that we grouped by and
then this is a little special symbol by
Postgres what that means is contains so
it's this thing right here and what
we're basically doing and this is going
to be a parameter as well we can
actually just like
asses in here like that we're just gonna
do members join and we're gonna come on
that guy so we're saying does this
channel contain all the members that we
have here and then we also need to just
check and make sure the length of the
array or the count of that list is equal
to the number of members we have so that
way we have members dot length here and
we could we need to do a substitution
because actually we could just plug in
the team array doing a string
substitution here and here so we can
just sub this into so this is another
way you can do it you don't have to do
sequel i's substitutions you can just do
a string template like this and this is
a little bit simpler downside to this is
nothing's getting xscape t' but notice
these are all numbers so we're safe
um and we're at type checking both of
them and let's come back over to our
scheme area real quick team ID and so
we're safe from the sequel wise
injection here but if these are strings
you want to make sure you do
replacements with how they do it and
we're gonna do raw here or with the
sequel eyes replacements so this is
gonna grab oops this is gonna grab the
channels or the channel check if the
channel already exists right with these
members so this is a pretty complex
query this is probably our most complex
one that we've created and what's gonna
get returned from this is hopefully just
one channel with the ID or nothing and
since this is our first time running it
I'm just gonna console.log and see what
we get from this response and I'm gonna
return one
some to save this make sure this all
works
not sure something went wrong because
this thing is complaining so we have
that and I think I just need to close it
yeah there we go
I'm setting we're all equal true because
I don't want any sequel eyes junk coming
back okay so let's run this see what
happens get or create channel so it's
going to be in our direct message modal
and now we can add graph QL and I'm just
gonna say Const and we should grab the
team ID here from the props I'm gonna
say Const the response is equal to a
wait and it's gonna be our mutation
which is gonna be mutate and that's
coming from the props as well and
variables from our values we're gonna
have members so members and team ID and
here we're just going to console.log the
response so we can see what we get
this looks good let's finish our query
here so it's gonna be say cons get or
create team
oops channel gql and we didn't pour that
so here we're gonna be doing a mutation
two variables members and team ID so
team ID which is gonna be an end and
members and that's gonna be an array and
then we're gonna call a get or create
channel and that we should pull out
mutation get or create channel mutation
and we're just gonna pass in our team ID
just team ID and because we're only
selecting or not selecting because we
only have we don't have to add a
selection is what I mean and the reason
for that is we're just returning an
integer so T my team members passed in
here let's give this a trial see what
happens
looks like there's an area could have
just been refreshing still looks like it
was so Bob to and Bob or yeah Bob to and
Bob 3 so I'm going to start messaging
the response from this should be an
empty string or an empty object from our
query but we got an error looks like we
just have a syntax error in our thing
over here in our query so comma
what syntax here in here or here I'm
just gonna copy this come over here to
see equalizer on it that'll probably the
easiest where CID ah this should be all
ands not commas and and and and okay
just give this a try again and I think
we're just still reloading on our server
side
I always refresh this way too fast okay
our response should be one cool let's
look at the server's response looks like
we got an array with the first one
object being an empty array so I'm
guessing we look at that so I'm going to
say result and then data so we're gonna
basically D structure this so this will
be in our data component or sorry I
variable and this bit will be in result
and we don't really care about result I
think this is where our data is going to
be and so here we're gonna say come down
here and of course we want to
console.log data and result actually so
we can continue seeing it if data dot
link and we'll say not
then here we want to create a channel
otherwise we just that we actually just
return so if data dot length we're gonna
return data 0 right
and I think it's ID I'm guessing is what
we do off to see but if we have data
we're gonna grab the first one which is
that and then grab the ID from that and
return that that's gonna be our channel
otherwise we need to create this channel
so to create this channel what we need
to do is pretty much run the what we
have right here and we're also doing
this little check at the beginning of
our create channel so maybe we should do
this check well you know we'll do it
we'll add some authentication at the end
let's get it working first I think
that's better so we need to add all
these members to our channel so we're
gonna be doing something like this so
let's copy that so we're gonna be doing
a transaction we're gonna create a
channel and here are the thing so what
do we need to supply to our channel
let's look at our channel model so the
name for now I'm just gonna set the name
- hello we're gonna come back and fix
that but I want to get the rest working
public is gonna be false so public false
and then diem is true and I believe if
we need to pass okay we all seem to pass
a team ID I believe to tell it which
team ID were associated with so team ID
is just going to be t ID so good and
then here so if art is not public we
already know by default it's not gonna
be public so we don't even need to do
that if statement
here it's trying to find the members we
don't need to do this we already have
the members here it's mapping through
the members okay so when we create the
channel we want to just add the members
to our channel that's what's happening
right here this looks good user ID all
this looks fine and then we both create
the members this looks fine to me and
then we're gonna return response because
response is going to be will return
response to ID right and actually you
know what let's just return this will be
channel ID channel ID or turn that
channel ID and then our return value
here is gonna be dot data values and you
know what why don't we just say can't
see ID because it's not changing so we
only get it once we don't have to keep
referencing it and then that's what
we're gonna return as well
okay so let's give this a try now so we
should be creating our channel our
Direct Message Channel
with these two guys so start messaging
all right looks like we created the
channel let's see if there's any heirs
or anything no no heirs so now when I
create it again start messaging I should
get get a return to perfect and notice
how we get our result has an ID of two
we grab that and returned it so it looks
like it's working perfectly right now
now you notice nothing's popping over
here what's going on I want to say it if
i refresh we see hello here so now it on
our UI we just need to bring hello down
here all right and feed it into direct
messages oops that's gonna be in our
sidebar here so we basically just need
to do a little bit of a split so we're
gonna say Const what team my channel so
we're gonna say Const nan diem channels
and on will save regular channels is
equal to an empty array and Kant's damn
channels is another and then here we're
just going to loop through team channels
and we're gonna say for each team and
we'll say if TDM else we do this and we
also need to select the end we need to
remember to do that so if it is a direct
message channel then we're gonna say
this should be channel right that should
be a see sodium channels that push see
otherwise it's gonna be a regular
Channel stop push guys save and we just
need to change our team query over here
and grab channels diem and in our schema
down here we need to support that so
it's gonna be channel utter resolvers
here we're gonna have a DM field which
is a boolean cool so now we need to
actually pass those accordingly so
regular channels should go here so
regular channels so now I should see it
not show up alright cool so I see our
Channel and I'll show up and it should
show up below so we need to pass DM
channels to over where is that I guess
users so instead of users it's gonna be
DM channels now sodium channels so that
in our channels component we need to
handle this differently so instead of
users we're gonna call this DM channels
over here DM channels dot map DM channel
passing in the pass in the DMC and DM
Channel we're gonna have to rename this
up here now damn channel so instead of
an ID and a username we're just gonna
have an ID and a name I'll show the name
here this kind of messes with our little
bubble thing though but that's another
whole message ok so hello pops up here
now Oh interesting when we click that it
pops up there
oh because that's our direct messages
right now and we didn't change that okay
so we have this mostly working but
there's a lot of things we have to clean
up but this video is getting very long
so I'm gonna pause it here and then
we're gonna finish wrapping everything
up in the next video so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you in the
next one
