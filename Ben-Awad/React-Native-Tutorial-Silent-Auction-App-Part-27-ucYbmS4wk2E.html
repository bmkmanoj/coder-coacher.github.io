going to be cooking this and then
updating and making bids so to do this
what we're going to do is we're going to
add basically a function or not not just
a function but in action to our auction
module and this is going to be called a
quest bid call requested here class fit
and then in our saga here oops too much
we can copy our last function because
it's going to be very similar to this so
here we're going to do the dis saga and
we can come up here to the top and do
quest
bid that's coloring dice called make bid
now I call requested oh it just cuz I'm
never using I was wondering why I was
getting lines under it okay is because I
haven't easy yet so requested I'm not
sure why it's not Auto completing is
going to do call bid be called bid in
here we're going to do bid passing in
the payload on and then we're to respond
and then we don't actually have to do
anything here actually if there's not an
air we print out the response and then
we're going to receive auction not
actually we're going to see auctions
we want to dispatch not here here so if
we make a bid successfully we then want
to update the UI and I basically just
want to research the data with the
updated bid
I actually know not to do that because
we already have sockets listening
so actually I'm we're really good don't
even need to do anything because we have
talked it and that's why I saw its
really nice because I don't even have to
do anything here all I do is I actually
just make a bid and then the sockets
will do the rest so now to our API we
can go ahead and set up a bid should I
bid call it bid and the auction service
we're going to do a patch here let's
expand this why don't we pass in the ID
and then the airf will say current price
here we'll do ID and actually you know
what you don't even have to do that you
can just pass the params actually just
fetch the ID for now we'll set the
default to 5 so current price 5 so every
time they click the button they make a
bid for 5 more dollars we'll just set
that as the default all we're getting is
the ID of the one that we should be
bidding on we pass that and then that we
good don't need to do anything worth
reducers and actually that was super
simple so now we'll go to back to our
guy right here our view auctions we need
to add our action that we
just created in our auction module and
we need to import it and add it to the
props so we can import it here request
bid and then down here I can request it
so now it's in the props so now what I
can do so I actually need to pass it
because notice how this is a pure
function here I requested
so when I requested map auction this
will be a I
hey I am a quest did this dot crop stock
replacement so we're getting this from
the props which we just added and then
we're passing it to our auction function
here and then our auction function
instead of expanding it here we're
passing it as a third parameter
requested and we should also be getting
the ID now because we need to know that
to request the bid request did pass and
the ID all right these I worked on that
and the ID front cannot be no so it
looks like the ID here is null so I
guess the ID when expanding here is null
so I'm guessing we're console logging
the ID should not be null I see IDs here
and this is where passing to the
function we're pulling out the ID here
from the auction passing it into a quest
bid
I think what I'm doing okay let's see
console.log action payload let's see
what the value of that is it may just be
the ID and non object I'm I thought I
would pass an object PID
if 32 you notice how it just passes in
the value itself so in our API here we
don't need to do that we're going to say
ID like that because it's actually
passing in the direct value it's I
thought was passing an object with the
property ID okay click on that and
notice how they updated both the value
and look through the top bidder is now I
can keep bidding on that and the price
goes up top bidder stays the same here
I can bid on that and awesome so now you
can now bid on items and in real time
you can see the values change and the
top bidder here changes with that so
that's it for this video I'll see you
guys to the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
