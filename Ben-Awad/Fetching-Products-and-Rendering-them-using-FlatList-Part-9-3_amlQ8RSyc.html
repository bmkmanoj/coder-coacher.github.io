products we're gonna display them in a
list on our products page that way you
can scroll through and see all the
different products that have been
created now the best way to do this in
react native is with a component called
flat list this is a list view that
displays items and it's good with
performance and it's gonna be really
nice when we want to do lazy loading and
infinite scrolling later on to load
products because it's built in to this
itself so it's gonna be really nice but
before we dig into how flat list works
and using it we first need to fetch the
data from graph QL or our server so if
we look at our schema graph QL we need
to add a query for products now I didn't
know exactly where what we wanted to add
as its parameters and stuff and really I
just wanted to use what is on the
database because it has it already nice
so I wanted to see what we had had
available so instead of starting my
server with NPM run or sorry NPM start
right instead what I did was run it with
NPM run dev and it runs a different
thing and the thing that it runs is it
starts up a playground that we can see
here and what this playground does is it
has both our default so this is our
server and it has the dev and the dev is
where we find our graph QL or a database
or Prisma server and we can see all the
things we have available to us and
played around with it additionally you
notice how they added a header for us
automatically this is a JWT token if
whatever reason yours didn't show up
here what you can do is create the token
yourself and then add a header like this
and to create the token all you need to
do is run Prisma token and it'll go
ahead and generate it for you and you
can just paste it in there so there you
go all right so what I want to do is
call this products query right because
this has everything we really want and I
don't want to change it in
way so I want to directly call it but we
can't access the database ourselves only
the app can or only our server so we
first need to connect to our server
which then calls this for us so we're
going to be using this to create our
query on our server so since I want it
identical I looked at the data model or
sorry not data model but the generate
graph QL and you can actually see what
the query is so we can copy it so for me
on line 455 there is a product query and
this is exactly what's on the server so
I'm gonna copy this and I'm just gonna
paste it over here and my product in my
query and you'll notice how these things
are other types that we need and there's
like an example this on Prisma website
and you can actually import other things
than just the post type from the
generated Prisma so we're gonna do just
that and then after that in our firm
mutation since it's gonna be exactly how
our server is instead of rewriting the
mutation or exactly our database I mean
we can call this forward to function
this is coming from Prisma binding this
library we already have in prism
installs for us and we just call it and
notice how we don't have to write out a
mutation like this so that's what we
want to do so I'm gonna import both of
these types and I'm double importing
here I should have just don't like that
it's coming from the same place so let's
do that
and then here I'm going to say just grab
both these guys and import them
and then this guy as well okay so now
those two are getting imported and we
have our products query exactly how
people want it and this is matching the
server we could change it in any way we
want
I think we're gonna call it with no
parameters at first but really we want
these options so we're gonna keep them
so then in our products all right we can
add a query here and actually I think
we're we're at exporting these as
mutations if I remember correctly yeah
so query is in dot slash query okay so
they put all the queries and dot slash
queries so we're gonna come over here do
this I suppose so just like how they
were doing it over there we can import
from prism binding and we're gonna get
the forward two and then we're gonna
save products and we're gonna forward
two and then they had a string where
they said DB and I believe that's just
the name of the key that you use here so
we also use the word DB here so we just
put DB there and I think we're good to
go we should have a products query that
we can access so let's try running both
of these just in the playground over
here to make sure it works so
if I run products with nothing we need
to add at least something so we can see
I have a couple products in there and
really I want to see more than just that
price and the picture ID there picture
your relative name all right so we can
see all this this is what we want to see
this looks good and then let's see if
this now works on our app over here
because we should have a products query
and we see it looks good so let's paste
it and see and perfect so our app is
getting the same thing that the database
server is so we can now access this and
call this from our front end so let's do
that alright so back to products ah yes
I'm gonna import graph QL and this is
coming from reactor Paulo Paulo and then
again we need gql from graph QL tag so
we're always gonna need the same things
every time graph QL attack every time we
want to add graph QL to a component so
I'm gonna call list products you noticed
a const products query equal gql and
then i'm just gonna paste in that and
then down here we're an export default
products and so we can get it rid of it
here and then we're gonna wrap this with
graph QL the like just like how we did
with the mutations that we rated so
products dr e alright good
and I can't to format this so unlike so
at first this takes some time to load
right so the parameters that graphical
adds to our component our data and
loading there I think there's other
stuff too but this is a really the ones
that are relevant to us so while we're
loading I don't really want to display
anything so I'm just gonna say check it
for loading and if we are render null
otherwise or under our component so you
don't see any visual change but now it
won't crash if our data is empty and
then from this we should be able to get
products and that's really the data that
we're gonna pass so if you remember when
we got this plant list here's a really
simple example
copy that put that underneath here the
data they are passing in for us the data
is gonna be used let's delete this is
gonna be products
and fly lists comes from react native
and how are we gonna render this so for
us we're gonna get an item item that key
is not we can do item name if we wanted
to missing keys for items make sure to
specify key property on each okay so it
looks like it we need a key on this so
what we can do is just map the products
and say product is equal to itself and
then the key is gonna be p2 ID what
doesn't like undefined is not an object
for products done map
weight is products I'm not sure what I
did wrong here so here we're returning
an array a map key for a reason this is
crashing it I'm actually not sure
evaluating products on map is not an
object did I lose and I see the curly
braces all right
I'm not sure what the problem with this
is I can do it up here before I return
maybe I was just making a silly mistake
so we're gonna return and we can do our
calculation above so and I can move my
condition so return null so oops
so for loading we're gonna return nil
and graph QL will automatically say
change loading to true or false when
it's finished so we don't have to worry
about that so now I'm gonna say Const
products with key so we're gonna add a
key to it we're just a product map and
now I'm just gonna do the same thing cuz
I think it should work
so dot dot dot P and then we're gonna
say key is PETA ID
all right let's console dot log products
products might not be what I think it is
because we keep crashing so switch over
to NPM so products is just undefined so
loading or not products so if we don't
have any products there we go
I don't know why loading is false and
products is undefined so we can just do
this check right here so if we don't
have any products and we're still load
or we're still loading will display that
okay so our data here so let's get rid
of that warning will pass product with
key so nice so we got rid of that
warning but right now we're only
displaying text so we might want to
display more for example the price so
let's wrap this in a beauty
and let's also display text and we're
going to say item dot price and let me
just make sure all my tags line up cuz
it looks like they don't and that's why
I messed that up there we go and let's
go ahead and cease to be explosive
Oh something got really messed up I
don't know if I messed it up with em or
what there we go so now our render item
here and we can refresh we're gonna
display the name and the price and
additionally we want to display the
image right so image and we're gonna say
source but we can fill this out but it's
not gonna work great and I think
actually I actually forget how image
works from this but we can plug it in i
think you pass in a uri and it's gonna
be item dot picture URL
oh it's called source not source so
there we go alright so notice how
nothing shows up here and if we print
console dot log products and we're just
gonna look at the first one and what
we'll notice is our picture URL is not
really pointing to a real URL so what
we're gonna do in the next video is fix
that problem and also to fix this on our
server we have to like display the
images that we have in our images folder
so we'll discuss how we'll do that and
we'll also make this look a little
prettier
cuz right now it's kind of ugly and I
think we should just clean it up
slightly so we can get at least a semi
nice view yeah so that's it for this
video guys
thanks for watching
