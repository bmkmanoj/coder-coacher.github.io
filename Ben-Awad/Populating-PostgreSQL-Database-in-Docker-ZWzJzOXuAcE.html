to seed our Postgres sequel database and
docker now if you don't know it means to
seed a database that just means to
initialize with some data now before we
get into that what I want to do is
actually get our reconnect logic working
that we started in the last video so the
reason why it wasn't working I
discovered was we are creating this
equalise instance in this try-catch but
we don't actually try to connect to our
database until in our index.js file down
here when we try to sync it up
so when we call models let's equalize
dot sync that's when we make the
database connection and realize we're
actually not connected so what we need
to do is actually make the connection in
our try-catch block so I can remove
actual creating of sequel eyes move that
up here and we can just make that
constant now and there's a little
function that sequel eyes gives us to
make sure we're connected and it's call
off indicate so we can just call sequel
eyes dot authenticate to make sure we're
connected and I'm just going to wait
that and copy the insolent so now that's
gonna happen is when we we defined our
sequel eyes object we're gonna try to
connect to the database if we can't
connect we just keep trying to reconnect
so I'm gonna come back over here and
just do MPM run build and then I'm gonna
run the docker image or build a docker
image docker build and then we're gonna
do docker compose up and if you remember
I have this line commented out so we're
actually not waiting for it we're just
going to use our reconnect logic that we
created right here and if you guys want
to you can play with how long we sleep
for and how let me reconnect you want to
do on your own so now let's run docker
compose up
and see if we are able to connect all
right so here's Redis log we see webb
reconnecting in five seconds perfect and
it looks like our DV is still starting
up hasn't started up yet
looks like we're waiting five more
seconds and awesome now our database was
ready to accept connections and our web
we see it start up okay so it looks like
our reconnect logic is now finally
working let's make sure I'm gonna
refresh the client over here and cool we
see John at jong-hong so now I want to
show you guys how I like to seed the
Postgres equal database now I'm not sure
what the right way or the correct way to
do it in docker but I'll show you the
way I like that's pretty easy so the
first thing we're gonna do is just open
up a port on our database service kind
of like how we do for our website now
the port that it's running on is 4 3 or
5 4 3 2 1 they're not 1 4 5 4 3 2 and
that's the default for Postgres sequel I
believe and then here we want to pick
any port that we want to run them on our
computer or bind to and I'm just gonna
say 30 30 give that a save so now when
we say docker compose up where you can
actually connect to our Postgres sequel
database so let me show you guys that so
I'm gonna cancel that and just say
docker compose down afterwards clean it
up and then we're gonna start it back up
and I'm just gonna start it back up in a
background tab so dr. can goes up that
way I can connect to it now what we're
going to do is just PG dump so whatever
you want to seed your database with I
like to just do PG dump of my current
database so here I'm going to dump our
slack database that we have
and I'm just gonna put in a file called
dog sequel so now I want to use this
database I just created or I just dumped
which I called dumped sequel and I want
to use that to basically seed my
database so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna connect to our database that we
open we create a docker and then dump
all this data inside of it so now I can
connect to my database
hopefully it's up so the host is gonna
be localhost port is gonna be 30 30 our
user is gonna be Postgres and the name
of our database is slack and now here we
have put our password for the easier
Postgres and that is Postgres and now
i'm in and if i select all from users
hopefully we see john cool we see John
at John calm so this is how I can
connect to it so what I can do is I
could say drop DB and we'll put in our
password
Postgres and then I'm going to create
the database called slack so Postgres so
I just deleted our original database
called slack created a new one called
slack so now what I can do is I can say
P sequel and I can put dumped sequel
inside so this is the syntax for
basically putting the sequel that we got
from dump sequel and tired of slack so
what's gonna do is it's gonna run the
code and let's just run this and show
you guys and it's gonna put all of our
data inside that database so now if I
come over here to my original command I
can see who my users are so select all
from
users and now we see the Bob characters
that we originally have and I can come
over here refresh and we can log in as
Bob okay Bob at Bob calm and we should
see all of our messages and stuff that
you sent before cool and come over here
see all this stuff awesome
so that's how I like to see the database
is to basically take a dump of the
current state of a database that I like
so example the one we've been using in
development and then just put that into
the container
I don't dropping the prior database
creating a new one and then just using
PC cool it'll pop it in there and so
that's it for this video guys and note
how I was using port 30 30 over there
because I put 30 30 here you just want
to make sure those match up but that's
it for this video guys thanks for
watching I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
