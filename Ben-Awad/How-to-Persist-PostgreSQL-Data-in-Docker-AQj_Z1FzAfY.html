video but we weren't persisting data for
post for a sequel database
so whenever the container turned off or
was destroyed we lost all our data in
our database which is a problem so in
this video we're gonna fix that by
adding volumes this is the way doctor
recommends persisting data and how it
works is we set up a place on our
computer where whenever the container
writes to a certain folder it also
writes that data to the folder on our
computer as well so when the containers
destroyed we still have that backup on
our computer and it uses that when it
starts back up - so let's get started
with doing that
it's called volumes and we're gonna be
adding this to our database service so
we're gonna say volumes and we're gonna
create a new one and first we specify
the place on our computer I'm gonna
create a folder called PG data right
here so new folder PG data and I'm gonna
specify where I want to be written
inside the container which if we go to
Postgres equals docker image
documentation it talks about right here
how the default location we're gonna
copy this is right here for Postgres -
writes data you can't switch it of
course but I'm gonna leave the default
so now by specifying this whenever
Postgres writes its data here in this
data folder it'll also write to this PG
data folder that we have right here
right there so when the container is
destroyed we'll have it in PG data and
then when it boots back up it'll read
from PG data or not read it they might
keep them in sync I'm not quite sure how
it works underneath the hood they have a
little diagram and more documentation if
you want to read up on that but yeah
let's see if this works
and before we get started I am gonna
just in my docket ignore where are you
here you are say PG data that way BS
code does not just crash based on all
the game
Changez because P G dad is about to get
a lot of data in it okay so I'm gonna
come over here and just say docker
compose up and I'm just gonna go over
ahead and run it in this mode so we can
see the logs and make sure everything
starts up and runs okay so databases
gang started looks like our web is
waiting for database and stuff to get
set up and then when this is set up
we'll go ahead and create a user and
I'll show you guys okay so this is
something that kept happening to me and
I thought this was quite annoying so I'm
getting this sequel eyes connection air
and basically you can see why the
database is still booting up and then it
starts booting up here our wait for it
script basically isn't working it thinks
the database is live but the database
hasn't finished initializing so the way
we're gonna get around this and fix this
is why not just reconnect so
unfortunately a sequel eyes does not
have a reconnect script by default so
I'm gonna come over here to my models
index so what's happening is we're not
able to connect here and so it's storing
an error and the whole thing crashes but
really ideally we'd like to try to
reconnect after a hundred milliseconds
or something so we're gonna write our
own custom basically rerun so there is
not a sleep function in JavaScript but
you can make your own sleep function
this is how Stack Overflow recommends
doing it so what we're gonna do is
create our C equalise object if we crash
we're gonna sleep for a little bit and
then just redo so let's copy this paste
it in here so I kind of want to make
this this file into a function now and
like an async function so
I'm gonna put it all the way down here
and we're just gonna export default this
guy export default this async function
here and I think I can just return like
that cool I can and we're gonna say
Const here and we're create this into a
regular function so now instead of just
returning an object I'm gonna return
models so we're exporting an async
function that will return models so now
what we can do is actually maybe we
should name this thing I'm gonna say
maybe we can make this recursive but
that seems like something like this
making this recursive seems like a bad
idea so let's just say let connected is
equal to false so while we're not
connected we're going to try to connect
and we're gonna just say let C equal
eyes so we're going to attempt two sets
equalize here
and we're gonna catch and so if we're
able to connect we say connected is
equal to true if we're not able to
connect why don't we just console.log
reconnecting and let's say five seconds
that seems like a good amount of time
and we'll just sleep for five seconds
and what's going on here and expect to
wait inside a loop oh it doesn't like
that I'm just going to say you Slynt
disable next line cuz we're not gonna
worry about that stable next line okay
so we're gonna try to connect and maybe
we should set a max connections so let
max rican x is equal to I don't know
let's say 20 say not connected and Max
reconnects and then every time we
reconnect here we say max reconnects
minus equal 1 and let's subscribe to
what okay so here as long as we haven't
connected and max reckon X is above zero
basically we're gonna keep looping and
if we make it down here and we have not
connected we're just gonna return null
so now in our index file over here we
kinda have to change stuff so instead of
models we should really call this get
models
so I'm gonna say get models dot then and
then we get models from that and then at
the very top of our function here we can
say if not models we can return and
we'll call it's a log could not connect
to database so now I can move this
inside of here
give that a save and that's good so now
we're gonna call our async function to
get the models once we get the models
we'll make sure we connect it okay and
Ike I just want to run this and see what
happens without even doing docker and
make sure it does work and we have no
just syntax errors and stuff cool looks
like it started up no problem so now I'm
going to do docker build and we'll just
build that and then we can run docker
compose and all that stuff and I'll
switch to running it over here so you
guys can see a better moniker composed
and I'm just gonna run down to clean up
anything that wasn't destroyed below but
now we should be reconnecting and even
if wait for it doesn't work in our
database is not quite up we should
reconnect a couple times before just
crashing out because that's kind of
annoying okay so we built that so docker
compose up and I know this wasn't the
point of the video to make this little
reset or this reef connector but it was
annoying that this kept disconnecting
here we go
looks like we started up okay but yeah
what I wanted to show you guys with the
volumes is now that we set that up and
our DB just ran oops
look at PG data look at all this stuff
in it this was an empty folder that I
created
but because Postgres is writing data and
stuff too
popped out there but okay so this is
running now I can come on over here to
our server and I can just say okay I'm
gonna create a new user called John John
at John comm paste him in here login
create a new team so I'm just gonna say
hallo world and I'm gonna come over here
destroy it and then when that's done I'm
gonna run docker compose down on it to
make sure it's all cleaned up and then
we're gonna boot it back up just to show
you guys that John is still alive
so docker compose up and while that's
starting up I'll refresh show you guys
it crash cool crashed because it hasn't
started up yet and then when this thing
starts up will refresh and hopefully
John is still there okay database was
interrupted the database system is
starting up sequence connection err the
database system is starting up why did
we get that we should have reconnected I
added a try/catch
DB is available after nine seconds did I
run oh crap that's why I didn't run npm
build alright so we actually weren't
running the new code and docker even
though I ran docker build and I'll show
you guys why so docker compose down so
while I did build docker what I forgot
to do is NPM run build I should really
make a little command-line that does
this for me so now we can build this so
I just forgot to update our distribution
here okay but that shouldn't affect John
being there or not so okay so I built it
I'm now building the image when that's
done I'll pop it back up and hopefully
our server waits to start up so the
docker compose up
okay so our website is waiting for the
database to start up as usual the DB
cool and that looks good I wonder if we
actually nope wait for it just worked
that time so we don't get to test out
our script but if we refresh unexpected
token I and JSON what is this this is
something let's refresh again this is a
consistent error let's look at our
network tab it looks like invalid option
provide Apollo server models is not
defined okay so looks like this did not
work let's go over our code real quick
models for returning models enter index
here
Oh up here our app dot use models and
how does not work so we need to wait to
create both of these instances down here
after we get our model I don't think
anything else is relying on the database
model yes it is this is really our ad
user middleware so let's add our ad user
middle layer paste that in here we need
to grab both of these so we're gonna
move all of this inside of our get
models function now okay so I just
missed that I'm surprised our server
started up when I dim p.m. start before
I guess I should have double-checked it
actually worked but let's give this
another try so I'm gonna close this over
here docker compose down after that's
done wrap this up
rebuild that and we'll see if our new
function works and I suppose I could
just NPM start refresh but actually John
won't be there anyways and we're logged
in as John already so we have this
already here let's just run it from
docker compose up I kind of hope we get
a chance to see if our reconnect works
maybe I'll root after this I'll remove
the wait for it okay so it's stir it up
let's see if moving those insights fix
that okay cool I see John and we see our
message hello world hey you are alive
so I'm pologize for how many errors we
got and trying to set up this reconnect
but I hope you guys get the idea of how
volumes work and setting up Postgres so
the data persists and now I want to do
one quick test to verify that our
reconnect logic does indeed work and I'm
just going to comment out this command
and remove the wait for it because we
basically have our own custom wait for
it now so now I'm gonna come over here
close that and oh I did it one too many
I did not gracefully close that
container but that's okay so now I'm
gonna say docker compose up and if this
does work we reconnect logic should be
decent
it's a shame sequel eyes does not have
reconnect object that we can just use
and cool it doesn't work
so under handled rejection sequel eyes
connection refused connect econ
weird we should be reconnecting but
we're not all right we'll fix this in
the next video I want to focus this
video on volumes and we already have
tangent it way too long into this so
that's where I'm going to stop this
video in the next video we'll get our
custom reconnect logic working so we
don't just crash if our database isn't
quite up yet and our server is so that's
it for this video guys thank you for
