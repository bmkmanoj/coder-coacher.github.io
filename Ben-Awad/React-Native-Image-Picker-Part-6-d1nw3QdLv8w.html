on the products page now before we can
really display any products we need
products so to help us create products
we're going to be creating a forum where
users can fill stuff out and products
will show up on this page so I'm going
to add a button on this page that's like
takes us to another screen where we can
actually create a product so I'm gonna
just grab a view and a button from react
native and we might restyle this guy
later but for now we're just gonna have
a text component or non text component
just a regular button component I'm
thinking like it would be nice to have
like a floating component floating
action button but we'll get into that
styling this guy a little bit later
alright so title I'm just gonna say
create product and then on press I'm
just gonna go ahead and change pages so
the change pays it pages I'm gonna get
the history from the props and I'm just
going to transition pages so history
push and we're gonna get a go to slash
new product and now we don't have a new
product page so let's create that so I
will this oops
with this angry format and new route
Pulis new product j/s and let's see
we're gonna need to change our routes or
not change it to add a new one so new
product and it's gonna use the new
product component so the product your
product and then over here our new
product is gonna be very similar and
we're gonna a warning because this is
empty I believe very similar to like our
signup page is gonna work so we can just
copy that at least that we're gonna have
a form right and we want to have I'm
gonna Center it why not we'll just stick
with that for my
we'll come back to the graph QL in the
next video this one we're just gonna lay
out the form because the graphic QL is
gonna be actually a little bit
interesting but we are gonna be using a
text field we don't care about tokens
the values here we can check out
I forget actually what fields using the
ones we care about our name picture URL
price and seller will actually say like
we don't really care about so really
just these three the name of the product
the price and a picture for it so we
already have name here added price and
by default we'll say the price is zero
dollars and a lot of picture URL and
they'll be empty for now class I'm gonna
call this new product and we have a form
inside here we can export default new
product and we're gonna get rid of the
graph QL for now and so on submit we're
gonna be doing some interesting things
we're gonna be mutating passing the
state this is pretty much what's gonna
happen we might change what happens here
and here someone just comment that out
for now and we'll deal with that later
on change this is fine art unchanged
it's gonna be the same right because
we're just gonna be updating the value
here we don't care about async storage
so we don't need to import it we're not
really gonna have any links out to other
pages and we're gonna go to products on
submission that's good so let's do
structure these we're gonna have a name
a picture URL and then this thing is
going to be price as the last one all
right so we're gonna have two text
fields and then kind of a special field
that we're gonna do for the picture URL
so price
and here we're gonna say we don't need
an or we're gonna say create product or
we could say add product right not
really creating it so if we go here we
can see value of type number supply
textbook expected string all right let's
actually just make price a string and
they can get cast to a float later all
right so we got our prep our name and
our price you can say 0.33 we're not
really doing any validation on that
right now maybe we'll do validation
later this is actually where um
something like formic is really nice for
validation but I've done a lot of form
validation I think I'm just going to
skip that okay let's we have we're gonna
show airs for the email let's get rid of
that because we don't have any email we
might show airs for this but this is
really what I wanted to do in this video
was how are we going to get the picture
you're out right and let's korea since
we're I'm gonna use it so on a phone if
I am uploading a picture of a product I
really want to pick either take a
picture right away or take something
from my pictures on my phone so if
you've used any apps before that need a
picture usually you can just go through
your pictures on your phone and with
Expo you can actually do this
so there is a image picker component and
we are using ex post so we can actually
just copy this little image pic here and
we're gonna just use it for ours so I'm
just gonna paste him at the bottom and
then take those snippets that we need
you know you'll notice how we're
importing image picker from Expo and we
actually don't need to install that
package but because by default we
actually have Expo and our dependencies
because create react native app comes
with it alright so we don't care about
these things right here I'm gonna move
minja picker to the top because we do
need that and let's see what's going on
here so you'll notice here what they're
doing is the usual right they're having
a state for the image and then they're
updating the state when they get it and
I'm just going to delete this because we
don't need that and it looks like how
they're rendering is they're rendering a
button to click or the rendering the
image of the image exists so we can copy
this bit and I'm gonna put it right here
so you specify a name a price and then
we'll put the image underneath and then
we can copy this pic image function
which is really the only thing we need
right all right and we don't need this
all right so we called ours picture URL
picture you're all so I'm gonna put that
there and this I'm just going to call it
pic image without an underscore because
there's really no reason to do it
underscore here async and your notice
for calling this launch image library
async so this is something coming from
Expo the image picker so cool and looks
like we're just setting the state
afterwards now for us we just set the
state a little bit differently we don't
need to console.log the results it's
just gonna be the URL to the thing so
here we're gonna say really we can call
change text we're gonna do the same
thing that we're doing here so
well let's call it so on change text and
what are we gonna pass those are
parameters well the value we want to
change which is picture URL and then
pass in the value which is this and this
is gonna update our State updating this
value with that and we're about to see
that and after we actually select so
this looks like I doesn't like it
because of this so image we can import
from react native so we don't need text
anymore I'll just grab image and I don't
see any more errors let's see if this is
good raw text cannot be used outside of
text what are we doing our alt text I
don't know where I think I'm guessing
this so we're gonna do it or we're gonna
render no I don't see any other area
where we're showing we're all text yeah
that was it
so sometimes when you do the and it'll
actually render an empty string that's
why you need to use ternary like this
sometimes I'll give you problems okay so
these guys are just hitting up against
each other I really don't think we need
this outside of you I think that's
what's probably messing it up yep so
pick an image from a camera or add
product well this isn't the prettiest
styling kind of hard to read but it'll
do
so now when I click on this button what
happens this pick image is going to
occur which should launch a image
library that I can select an image so
let's click it nothing's really
happening up it just took a second and
actually let's see if I have something
slows I made a video about this slow
animations I think I have mine okay good
ticked off I just want to make sure
because that can slow things down so
let's pick this waterfall choose and
nice so we see the waterfall showing up
here so that's how we can select images
with our phone we really didn't need to
do a lot of work right
so we get the results of the picture
that they chose and all we're doing
after that is grabbing the updating the
picture you're updating the state and
now that we have an image we are going
ahead and rendering image so we're just
conditionally rendering an image right
if we have one now I believe if we click
on this we should be able to click a
different one and overwrite what we have
so choose now we have a new image so
nice so this is how we can import or not
import but choose images and add a form
with images on react native so in the
next video what we're going to be doing
is actually uploading this to our server
so how are we up loading with graph QL
and image and it's actually quite
interesting so we'll get to that but
that's it for this video guys thanks for
watching
