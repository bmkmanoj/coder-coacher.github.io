the back end to handle uploading of
files now before we had started with
that I found a small little thing I
forgot I wanted to add and that's right
here in our create file link we are just
stratifying the body twice when we don't
need to so if we do have a file I'm just
gonna say Const string body is equal to
serializable body since we already
turned it into a string by certifying it
and then when we override it here and
off the read json the body i can just
pass in the string body here okay
so that's all I want to change with that
now let's get started on our server all
right so here's our server now how are
we going to do this well Apolo upload
has a server attachment to it so we're
going to copy how they do this as well
now since we're not using Apollo client
the upload one we need to basically do
the same thing look at the source and
grab the part to get to work for ours
now he recently just changed this nine
days ago to add Busboys and he is
holding basically the stream and memory
I believe now in the resolver and before
how he did it with is with formidable
and I you did the one with forma before
and I got that to work and I really
liked it so that's we're gonna be using
this new bus by one I'm and take a look
at and see how I like it but I'm not
sure how I like holding the stream in
memory that's kind of interesting I
suppose but I prefer how formable does
it where it just writes it out to a file
which you guys will see so we're just
gonna come over here and we're gonna go
back
it well a couple commits here so ten
days ago he had the four middle version
so we're gonna gun that commit and we're
gonna browse files
I'm right here to Saurus and look at the
index so here he is with formidable and
this process request functions but we're
gonna take over so the first thing I'm
gonna do is come over here and say yarn
add formidable to install that and then
copy the inside of this so we're gonna
make some middleware here that's going
to do this for us
so Ponce file middleware and we're I'm
just gonna paste this guy right in there
actually no I'm not undo
ah I got rid of my file
okay because what I wanted to do is add
request and response
and we're gonna put our code in here so
this is the bulk of it but down here you
notice he adds a little wrapper where he
just checks this and we're gonna use
next I suppose as well and we're gonna
copy this alright so first things first
we want to check the request if it's a
multi-part form data if it's not he's
returning next we kind of just do the
opposite so we're gonna return return
next
I guess so the way he's doing it if he's
returning formdata return next and I
prefer using curly braces so we're gonna
clearly brace this guy so basically it's
checking whether the request is a
multi-part form data which is how we're
sending it from the client if it's a
file normally it is JSON data that comes
up so that's how you know whether
there's a file included and if there's a
file included he wants you to do all
this stuff here so let's copy that and
paste it in here okay so first thing he
does is make sure the upload directory
is good so for us we are going to close
some of these I'm just going to create a
folder called files and I'm gonna call
that my upload directory so Const upload
dirt is equal to files and so I don't
have to worry about keeping this up to
sync and making sure it's created now if
you want to create for example the
directory on the fly for whatever reason
you could use nodes make dur function
here okay or what he was using oops so
we need import formidable so import
formidable from formidable and this is
save it should reformat didn't yet what
isn't like your trailing space I'm just
gonna format this real quick
I Ryoga tourism the red so he returns a
promise here we don't really have to do
a promise because we can just call this
next function whenever we're done with
the middleware so I'm gonna get rid of
the promise here and we don't need you
and we don't need you so how formidable
works is it'll parse the form that's
what this incoming form does we don't
worry about that and then parse is the
function that is called where to
actually parse the file and we just pass
in the request so passing a request and
then here operations that is one of the
fields and then it grabs here all the
files now if we come back to our create
file link real quick
you notice we pass two things our files
which we called file but that's fine no
matter what you call it it'll put all of
them in a files object and then
operations here matches that name
matches right here and this operation
has all the all the graph QL body that
we need so first thing he word Rex if
there's an error we're just gonna
console.log if there's an error since
we're not doing a promise here he is
just parsing the operations into an
object that way we can set the variables
for this so
get rid of this I'm gonna say Const
operations that's fine and actually we
already use operations so I'm gonna call
this document and so here we're checking
if the files uploaded we don't really
need to do this I guess we can do check
I mean it's fine to check the files
length I suppose you don't need that
comment all right so put this here so
this is the meat of this now this won't
make sense unless I show you one thing
so come over here I'll show you
oops I wanted to show you guys to read
me there we go I didn't like that I
opened another tab okay so we need to
create a schema type called upload or
we're gonna call it file and what that
is is it's gonna have a name type size
path and this is all of the file so this
name has to match what we expect in our
mutation so actually before we finish
with this so this makes more sense we're
gonna set up the schema and then we're
gonna populate the schema data that we
need right here in this guy so I'm gonna
head to our schema and I'm gonna add
this to our message so on type message
I'm going to create two more fields I'm
going to create a path which is a string
and a file type which is a string so the
path is basically going to be the URL
and we could call this
a path that her name would be I guess
URL and so this is gonna be the path to
the file so that might be something like
localhost 8080 slash files slash upload
uploaded file right so we're going to
store that so we can reference it later
and then the file types whether it's an
image or audio file or a text file so we
know how to handle it later and so we
need to create a new input type so type
input which is a file and this is gonna
take two fields we don't we could take
up to four but I only really care about
the path and the type so that's all
we're gonna grab so type is going to be
a string and that's gonna be required
I actually know we don't have to require
it or we should require the type if it
is a file and in the path which is a
string as well look those guys are
required and then when we create a
mutation the text is gonna be optional
now because now we can either send a
file or a text and maybe I was gonna say
maybe we create two mutations create a
message with text create message with
file but I think this is fine so either
we allow text or we allow files now to
be uploaded so this file will have a
type and a path so how this works is we
send the whole file object which will
have more stuff and then we just upload
it to our files directory and then we
pick off the type in the path and we
send that to our resolver to hand to
handle it to do whatever it wants it to
type in the path now let's also add this
to our models so two more fields on this
guy
with both our strings so this is gonna
be the URL and beat what did I call it
the file type I'm just gonna call this
actually I was gonna say to avoid having
to add another camelcase guy but we
don't even need to worry about that
because this is not camelcase to file
type that's a string as well okay so our
database has it a scheme that has it so
now I need to pass to the resolver this
input so it type in a path so this file
object here files and we're really just
gonna be worried about one file and that
is if we come over here a file called
file because notice how we're going over
the keys here and checking if the length
basically just checking if this is empty
or not and one of our files should be
called files dot file because that's the
name that we uploaded
so we can just get him now if you have
more files you can do it in a more
generic way like they're doing here so
we're gonna grab our file and then from
our file we can get the name the type
everything that they're getting here but
we only care about two fields type and
path from our file and we could do this
in one step right type path those two
are equivalent so let's get rid of that
and this will automatically upload it
for us so we don't have to do anything
about that we're just gonna use this
path and show you guys I'm just gonna
console.log the type and the path so you
guys can see it path and I don't need
any of these things now here what
they're doing is give us save so
operations path dot set variables path
all this junk what it's doing is this
document document has variables and so
we need to set what the type and the
path is for the file variable because if
we take a look at our schema over here
we're expecting a file input with these
two fields so variables dot file is
equal to and it's expecting a file type
which is type and a path which is path
and we're gonna get rid of this
so once we set the document how graph QL
works it expects the document which is
all the graph QL query or mutation in
our case that will be mutation to be in
the body so we're gonna say request our
body is equal to document and then we're
gonna say next and next just means go on
to the next one and am I using path
twice where we using path o you know up
here yeah to join these for the types
okay
so let's call this something else so if
you didn't know this you can rename this
guy just like this you do a colon and
then whatever you want to name it so
we'll call this file path and will say
path is equal to file path and I don't
know if that should be lower cased or
not we'll just camelcase it that's fine
and I'll call a console log the file
path as well okay so now we can handle
this we'll pass it to our resolver so
let's update our resolver to handle this
so we're gonna come over here and in our
message create message all right here so
right now we're just passing in the
arguments but we need to do a change to
one of our arguments right so I'm just
gonna grab the file off of this
so grab file
and then args so I'm gonna say Const
message data is equal to args and I'm
going to say if file we're gonna say
message data dot file type is equal to
file dot type and then message data that
URL is that what I called it we're
trying to match these up now so you up
URL is equal to file dot path and then
we just need to pre pin this with ap
localhost:8080
slash and alright cool so this is just
our URL for our server and we don't
really want to actually I change my mind
I was about to hard-code what our server
is localhost into this and we plan on
putting this into production so this is
bad to hard code this here so instead of
having that there what I'm going to do
is actually just store the path you know
what you know what we're are gonna store
the URL that's fine but when I grab this
message we're gonna have to do some
manipulation on the URL that way we
don't feed back just the path we need to
grab the server's URL to okay so this
looks good and then here we're going to
instead of args we're gonna say message
data so all we're doing here is saving
two extra properties and we're also
uploading in the middle now we did a lot
of work on the back end let's see if any
of it means anything and if this stuff
actually works so let's come to our
front end here and we're gonna create a
message
so let's come over here to our send
message for example this is gonna be in
our file upload component is the one
we're gonna change so on drop we want to
create a new message
so message we can come you know we're
just create a new query that's cool with
me
so localhost 8080 we're gonna come over
here to graphical and oh man 80 81 RNA
yeah okay well good thing I didn't put
8080 in there too so we're gonna created
a mutation here to create message this
one is just gonna have a channel ID and
then a file since we're not gonna have
any text so file and I don't know what
the response of create messages so go
over here create message okay just a
boolean that's fine so let's create our
channel ID variable which is just gonna
be an int and then a file variable which
is a optional file so I'm gonna say
Const
create
message create file message will say
mutation is equal to gql paste this in
and I'm an import gql from graph QL tag
is in here and also import graphic ul
from react Paulo and I misspelled that
and we need to wrap this like that and
so we're gonna wrap our opponent with
graph QL and we're going to inject our
mutation create file not factory create
mutation and so here is one of our props
we're gonna have a mutate prop and now
we need to pass in channel ID as well
that way we can use that as a variable
to our mutation that we're using here so
instead of console log files what we're
gonna do is instead of files we're gonna
just grab the first file so file so I'm
be structuring this grabbing the first
element in the array and then I'm going
to say comments response is equal to and
I'm gonna make this an async function so
we can listen to the response to see if
there's any problems is equal to mutate
passing in variables roles and here
we're gonna have channel ID and file and
the names match up so we're good
and down here I'm just gonna console dot
log response so we see what happens we
get this and looks like I just needed to
remove that cool so I think we're good
on the front-end to try this out we need
to pass in our channel ID here so
everywhere we're calling file upload
which I believe is in our message
container here past the channel ID and
are we already getting the channel ID
here we need the channel ID and it's one
of our props so perfect so let's grab
that channel ID pass that guy in here
channel ID and we're gonna do the same
thing for sending a message so channel
ID and do we have the channel ID for
this one possibly not yeah I don't think
we do so channel ID we need to add that
channel ID
okay so anywhere we're using this send
message component which I believe is
just indirect messages and create team
we're gonna worry about direct messages
at a later date so I'm just gonna get to
create our view team working so this is
where we have send message and I'm gonna
pass in channel ID which is equal to
channeled ID okay cool so all this looks
good let's give it a try
all right so already getting a problem
and that's because we need to law again
/ no that's not because we need to login
I'm gonna say I haven't even dropped the
database yet which is actually something
we need to do we're getting a map error
I'm assuming it's a problem with so
let's look at the network tab refresh
I'm assuming it's a problem with our
graph QL because this was working before
let's see what we get back column your L
does not exist yeah okay so we just need
to drop the database
I believe so let's do that I was gonna
drop from P sequel but we can just come
over here and say force in our index say
forests true and format that guy there
we go
say butter do its thing so we're gonna
have to create a new user and create a
new team to allow us to do this and get
rid of that now save it and that should
have gave it enough time I'm just gonna
come right here to see all the users
there should be none of them cool and
actually I need to register first
so Bob at Bob calm
and we'll login create a team team one
cement cool were in hey cool I can still
send messages that didn't just break
let's try uploading one and I'm just
gonna come to my desktop and upload our
team oh and upload our team oh and we
broke stuff so let's see what went wrong
I like to search by graph QL looks like
it did make it to the server so I'm
gonna open up the server's logs right
here
and we can see what we did wrong must
provide a document so it didn't I think
it didn't like what we were doing in our
middleware didn't look like it uploaded
a file either oops
I'm gonna try refreshing this actually
and see nope no file there so come back
where you have this up so I'm gonna
console.log this so we our console
logging this and we just did not add the
middleware so file middleware let's add
that so file middleware I'm gonna add
this after body parser and let's try
this again plus Teemo
all right we still getting air
looks like the file uploaded correctly
so very cool I will show it file type
unknown field and type type expected
string found no variable file got
invalid value file type and path yeah
because we are supposed to let's check
our schema over here I think I just
messed up I think I messed up this I
think this is just supposed to be called
type and type and path I believe is
where I said it yeah I just messed that
up so it needs to match i shouldnt
explain this we needs to match this
input because that's what it's expecting
so that's all it was complaining about
let's try this again it i upload the
file correctly so that's really good
let's upload it again karen return null
for fueled message text o so that's a
thing now let's go over to our message
type so text cannabinol okay
cool
I think this message right here is our
image so we haven't got working to
render images yet but looks like we
didn't get any airs we see our file
uploaded here so that's cool what I can
do is I can LS files and I can open one
of the files open on Macs we'll just
open up the file and sure enough we see
the Timo that we up uploaded so cool
it looks like uploading worked I'm also
just gonna go into peace equal connect
to slack select all from our messages
table and so first one got messed up
because we didn't actually pass in the
right thing so I'm just gonna delete
from messages where ID is equal to one
and select all okay so this looks good
so here restoring files slash upload in
the name of upload and our file type so
now we can run for this as well so I
think we're done with this video I think
we got everything we wanted to get
working here our back-end can now upload
files okay so our next step with this
that we're going to take is to actually
show the images here because we know the
image is path because we're storing that
in our database and we see the files
right here we have them we just need to
get Express to render the files or serve
this these static files grab them here
and then we're gonna do a couple
interesting the reason why we stored
this file type over here is we're gonna
do some interesting stuff we don't like
show the image file type the same as
maybe a text file and so forth so we're
gonna show it differently depending on
what the file type is and right here so
that's it for this video guys thanks for
watching and as always I will push this
code on github
and I need to get ignore these files so
I don't send you guys all these files so
let's just do ad files there save that
cool so thanks for watching guys I'll
see in the next one
