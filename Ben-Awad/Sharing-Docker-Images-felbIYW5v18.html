and deploy it live on two real servers
so you guys can try it and also learn
how to take our server and our docker
images and docker compose and actually
put this on a server run it and let
users all over try it now to do this
it's really helpful to have our docker
image images hosted somewhere so I'm
going to show you in this video how to
host your docker image on docker cloud
so if you don't already come over here
to docker clouds
home page and create an account I
already have create an account and the
first thing I'm gonna do is click on
repositories and create a new one now I
already used my private repository but
they give you a bunch of public ones so
you can just create a public one if you
want everyone to see it or if you
haven't used your private one already
you can create a private one so only you
can grab the docker image but I make
mine public and the name of this I'm
gonna call slack clone server and that's
just gonna match the name that I have on
my computer but you can call this
whatever you like and you can give a
description but I'm gonna go ahead and
create it so now that I have it here I
can push this guy up here just as it
says here so you can copy that and what
we're pushing is our docker image now
you need to make sure and login with the
command line tools over here if you
haven't already it'll prompt you when
you try to push like we're about to do
or you can just type docker oops docker
login I believe to login and you just
want to login with your credentials you
have here so we're gonna do is say
docker build now normally we've been
building like this but now we need a new
name for our image so mine is bin Awad
slash and this is the name of my
repository or my image
and then I'm gonna tag it with latest
now it's a good idea to take your docker
images and version them so you could say
v1 or you could just say one here but
since I'm gonna be making more changes
to the image most likely I'm just gonna
call this latest for now and then when I
have the first release I'll go ahead and
start versioning this so this last part
is called the tag that I have as latest
and then I chose bin Awad here as my
username so that's what the first part
is and then here is that part so I'm
just gonna rebuild the docker image that
we have here with this new name and it
should just read everything from cache
since I've already built the other image
so it's nice thing about docker is it
caches everything so it actually won't
do two MPM install any of that stuff and
then after we do this we push it we're
gonna push it up so docker paste that in
docker push and our tag name is latest
so it's basically just pushing up our
image to cloud over here and then when
that's done I should be able to refresh
and see it pop up over here I guess it's
still going and then when it's on the
cloud over here in docker compose
instead of using slack clone server I
can use I can use bin Awad slash slack
clone server and grab the latest version
and so instead of grabbing this from my
local Dockers images it'll actually
search for this guy which is hosted on
docker hub or I don't know what this is
called docker cloud and then whenever we
make changes what we do is we push the
image up here and then we can pull the
image with docker compose okay so that's
all done if i refresh over here I don't
know
if I see anything different all right we
can see we have our latest tag right
here cool so when that's there I can do
docker pool and do my image so been a
lot of slack cloned server so after we
if we were to make changes to our docker
image and then run docker push if we
wanted to get the new changes we can run
docker pool on that and that'll get the
new ones
what we haven't changed anything so we
don't need to change that but now you
guys can download my image if you want
and you can put out your own image and
you can now share your docker images
this way so now my docker compose I can
use my image that's on docker cloud or I
could just use my local one like that
depending on what I want so pretty cool
and we're gonna be using this cuz when
we post our code on a server we need to
get our docker image from someplace one
method of doing that is to just SSH the
docker file into the server you're gonna
build it on but you're also gonna have
to also SSH and all these other files or
get them there so it's nice to have to
just build the image push it here and
then you can pull it from all these
different places so that's it for this
video guys thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
