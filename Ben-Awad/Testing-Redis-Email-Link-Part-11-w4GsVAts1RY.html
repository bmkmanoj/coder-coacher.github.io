test for this function and this other
function over here basically we're going
to test them both at the same time make
sure we're able to create that link and
then make sure that link is valid I'm
actually able to go to this Express
server with this link and it does work
so first off we're using Redis for this
so I'm gonna start up my Redis server so
just by typing Redis server we can start
it up and it is now running so next
things we're gonna do is I'm going to
create a test for this so create confirm
email blink test about TS and all we're
gonna do here is we're going to say
describe and here's going to be our
function and here I'm going to say make
sure create confirm email link works and
I don't think right now we have like
more than one test we could actually
just turn this into a test and then
maybe later I'll switch this to describe
if we need to do more than one test
there's really only one thing I need to
make sure that it works well actually
there might be a couple of things we
might convert this over in a second but
to do this we're going to call that
function so create confirm email link
and I need to pass it a few things and
by the way we don't have to start the
server in this test because we already
have it automatically starting so as we
can see we need a URL which we're
getting from process dot and dot host
test toast so that's what we set up
yesterday and then the user ID is the
user that we want to create this email
link for and right now we don't really
have a user that we want to do it for so
I'm going to set up a before all and
what we're gonna do is set up the user
there so I'm going to say create type
warm connection and let's make this
asynchronous wait that and I'm gonna say
user dot create and a little dot save
that save in the database and I'll say
user and we also need to await this and
so fields email is going to be Bob I've
at Bob calm and password is going to be
I guess we should have this hashed and
stuff but I think that's fine for now
and all I one do this for is so now I
have a user ID so I can say Const user
ID and I should say this is let because
we're gonna be using it down here so
user ID is equal to user to ID okay so
we creating a user down here or at least
before this test is run and we're
setting the ID so that's the user I want
to check this for so use your ID and
then lastly we have passed in a Redis
instance
and not this and this is coming from
that library that we installed IO Redis
I believe Ariel and Redis and do I
import it so it's a default import we
can see how we did it in start server
and yeah well that's exactly how we want
to import it and then close that ok so
this is going to give us a URL back and
I need to say as string and also as
string for both of those this is not let
me cast it to a string I'll just hit the
default equal to an empty string okay so
I have created this confirmation link so
now once I've created it two things
should happen I should have updated
something in Redis so right we set
something and it should expire after a
little bit the other thing is we now
have this URL that we need to test and
make sure that it works so I want to
basically hit that URL and the way we're
going to do this is we're gonna make a
request to our server because our
servers running and the way I'm gonna do
it is by using this library called note
fetch there's a lot of them out there
that you can just make requests
Axios this one's pretty simple and it's
similar to fetch so I like it
something installing this and using this
so let's add this yarn add node fetch
and we can import note fetch and also I
guess I'm gonna have to install the
types for this as well what we're gonna
do is we're gonna just do a get request
to this URL and see what happens now
after we make a get request to this URL
what should happen is if you look over
here we should get okay back and it
should say invalid after we've already
requested it once which it currently
does not do so like check out our code
here so we're doing Redis get but we
never like kill the ID or remove the key
right so we're getting the ID here but
we are able to confirm it again which is
okay in this case but I think it's
better to remove the ID from the
database or from Redis once we have
confirmed their user ID or once the ID
that we generated
okay so let's also install a yarn the
types for note fetch and then I can
import up here
okay so let's go ahead and request this
so I'll say response is equal to wait
fetch URL and it's actually not just
actually this URL
I was thinking it wasn't just your L cuz
I forgot we actually do a pen confirm to
it so it's perfect um when you make this
asynchronous and fetch is not liking it
I think it just doesn't have the right
type I'm guessing can't vote an
expression whose type lacks a call
signature right so I think what we need
to do is just import it like so maybe
you know then it's like this this is the
last thing I try usually cool and oh
yeah this is gonna be a promise so good
thing type script caught this for us
so when we call this function it's
returning a promise so let's await all
right cool and we have response here
let's go ahead and we can say I'm think
we're returning a over here just a
string rate not JSON data right now
that's fine what we can do for that is a
Const X is equal to a response dot text
and that should be a promise again and
I'm just gonna console.log the text
because I don't know what we're gonna
get
we should get okay or invalid but I want
to make sure it does in fact give us
that and I don't want to run these tests
over here over and over every time so
I'm going to do is I'm going to put
in watch mode so force exit so instead
I'm gonna say watch and I'm gonna start
this the arm test and after this starts
up I shouldn't have to restart it every
single time alright so we can see
server's running on localhost 4000 so
that was our setup and cool so turning
this only this test that's exactly what
I wanted and it passed and okay we see
the word okay so I think that was from
our console log over here so it in fact
it did say okay so let's go ahead and
expect that so expect text to equal okay
oops looks like we I guess when we I
saved this at reran the tests and looks
like I don't know that the user ID up
here or not the user ID when we create
the connection looks like it has the
name default it never closes the
connection there might be a way to check
whether the connection is already open
before we open another one but I guess I
can adjust control see this I'm not sure
the best way to avoid this error
happening and to be able to just quickly
iterate through the tests I'm not to
play with that a little bit okay so I
get okay so there's two things I want to
check now I want to make sure one
confirm is equal to true for this user
and two we removed the key from Redis so
let's check the first thing so I'm going
to say Const user is equal to
user dot find one and we're just going
to say user or where user ID is equal to
or actually just ID is equal to 30 so or
finding the user that we have here and
we expect user dot confirm or confirmed
I believe is what's called two to be
true to be true thee there we go and
let's see it's possibly undefined so I
guess what I should do is I should also
check that so if user so I don't know
this is not really part of our test if
we're not able to find the user I think
actually I'm just gonna go ahead and say
um cast it or maybe I guess I should
really just cast it to a user if you'll
let me
there we go I'm gonna assume we get a
user back there's no reason to like
check and make sure it's undefined and
things if it is undefined we have a
different problem because we didn't
create it up here correctly alright so
there's that and then I also want to I
guess it's keep a handle on our Redis
instance
pass it in here so Redis dot get and I
guess there's not a great way to get it
I guess we could do it with the URL what
I wanted to do is check if the ID is
still in Redis but I guess we're
returning the ID on the very end so what
I could do is say chunks is equal to URL
dot split and we're gonna split by a
slash and then I can get the last one
which is going to be the Paredes local
key is really a better name for it
chunks and we'll get chunk Scotland
minus one so what I'm doing here is I'm
grabbing the ID from the URL which is
the last thing right so I split by slash
which turns this string into an array
and I mean the last element which is ID
and so I now have this key and now I
want to get this key and I expect this
to be undefined so and I think after a
weight thing so expect and yeah I get
the key expect value dot to be I guess
undefined or maybe no I don't know which
one it'll be so we'll keep this for now
and then we'll see what it is and by the
way this test should fail let's make
sure it does indeed fail
and let's see if it doesn't fail okay
cool it does fail so we do go ahead and
get an ID this is what I expected
because we have not actually removed the
key so let's do that so start server so
after we actually successfully update
this and confirm it I'm gonna say wait
Coretta stop remove I want to remove a
key I don't know how you remove a key
using this I guess we could set the ID
to okay so I looked it up and we can use
delete or del to destroy this key and so
it should no longer be in there and we
can run our test again and I guess I
really should just turn watch off
because it's getting messed up well
that's okay and I don't know if there's
anything else I want to check with this
and yep so we get null that's what I was
wondering to be you know it all makes
more sense for it to be the thing that
it returns and I don't know if there's
anything else I wanted to test with this
I guess the other thing we can test is I
pass in our I go to that URL with a bad
ID and that doesn't give me anything so
let's try that and I'm going to create
the Redis instance up here so Redis or
equal neuritis
and so we all use it here so I'm gonna
go ahead and split this up in two tests
so describe and we're gonna be testing
this
all right so tests one we're gonna do
make sure it confirms user and clears
key Andres so the second test I want to
say test sins and valid back if bad key
or bad i decent okay so in here what i
want to do is just like this bit right
here and i guess this is kind of a
controversial test right here or at
least including this test in this file
because really this bit right here is
only testing this function right here
it's not really testing this and i'm
putting it here i don't know if this is
i should split this off and actually put
it in its own folder I think I'm gonna
leave the test for now in the next video
I think I'll split this up because I
think that makes more sense
alright so sins invalid back if the if a
bad idea so what to create a bad idea
what we're gonna do is just like put
some random numbers or something so
process ends
test toast / confirm / and then the ID
goes at the end so I'm gonna just like
put that and our response should be
invalid okay go ahead and test this
again and we'll see why that like that
gives us so cool both tests work so I
think that's all I want to do for this
video guys I think what we'll do next
video is clean up these tests and I
might split them up and also split out
do some refactoring of this code and
clean it up but this is kind of the idea
of what I wanted to do to test these I'm
also curious I was thinking a lot about
how I wanted to test these what you guys
think of this method if you would test
this in a different way but that's it
for this video guys thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
