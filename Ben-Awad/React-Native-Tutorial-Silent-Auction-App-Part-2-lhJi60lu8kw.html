you last time is you wanted to add the
user name of the user who created an
auction so I didn't just want to see the
ID but I also wanted to see the user so
to do this we're gonna change our model
a little bit our auction model and we're
also going to add a hook to help us out
so we're gonna modify our model by also
adding another field called seller
username and it's gonna be a string and
that's all we're gonna change to our
model but because we changed our model
and we already created basically our
database schema we're gonna have to drop
the database and remake that but before
I get into that we're also going to be
making a hook to add this seller
username so when I create an auction I
don't want to supply the seller user
name I want to be Auto picked up so I'm
gonna say feathers generate hook and
important when you're doing feathers
generate hook that you're in the root
folder of the projects on the server
here I'm gonna call this hook add seller
username this is going to be a before
hook and it's for auctions and it's only
gonna happen when we create an auction
okay if I come back over here I can go
under source hooks add seller username
here is our hook that we're going to add
and this is gonna be real basic all
we're gonna say is hook dot data dot
cell or username is equal to hook dot
params dot user diet username so this
hook object is something that is called
before create actually happens and what
we're doing is we're just adding the
seller username field by looking at the
user and grabbing its username because
don't remember how auctions we said we
want an authentication for it
so we actually have the user because
we're passing that token in so that's
this part right here in rich grab and
username
and setting it and that's it so we can
come back over here I'm going to go into
P sequel and I'm gonna drop silent
auction and create silent auction and
I'm gonna get out of it so I'm just
gonna just drop my database recreated it
I'm doing an NPM start all right now if
I come on over here to postman I can
make some requests so I'm going to
create a user so we the reason we also
had to remake this bob user is because
we had dropped the database so I'm now
gonna log in when I grab this
authentication token I'm gonna come over
here when I create another blueberry
auction send and now you see seller
username Bob so now when I come back
over here I get the auctions let's make
sure we replace that you see the seller
username Bob but what we can do is we
can create more than one user so it will
say use your name Tim we can say Tim at
Bob calm so we created Tim user come on
over here we can login with Tim now we
need to copy his access token the pace
that here and maybe Tim is going to sell
a blackberry his is gonna be twenty
dollars and 21 cents so he can create
that now we see these still our username
Tim and then we can come get all the
auctions and we can see that there's
currently two auctions one by Tim one by
Bob okay so now we added successfully
added the seller username and seller or
just we just add the seller username
that's all we added so that's in there
that's how we wanted that to happen now
to actually make an auction the way we'd
like to do it is we'd like to come in
here and we'd like to make a update so
that's gonna be patch and we can just
come over here we can copy this so for
example let's say I want to bid on
blueberry so currently current price is
$14 oh and notice how this is true gang
truncated right here I didn't even
notice that I think that's because
decimal maybe I might when I put two it
looks like it was counting these two
digits I'm curious if I come back over
here quick test let's say I say $300 is
the bid numeric field overflow okay yeah
that's what I expected we go we need to
fix that we'll fix that in the next
video but a decimal field is off but was
gonna tell you about is let's say I want
to bid on blueberries and on a bid for
15 so I come over here and I need to
grab this ID 1/1 and so I'm gonna bid as
Tim so my grabbed Tim's ID which is over
here there we go
so authentication authorization actually
off there paste that in opes
a copy
then what we can do is you can say
current pair is $15
okay so now I'm gonna get all the
auctions over here notice how this is 15
did I create two BlackBerry's on
accident well it looks like I did but
anyway notice how this is 15 and I could
bid on it again to 16 and we can come
we're here we can get it now is that 16
so that's how we're gonna bid we're just
gonna basically do patch requests to
whatever I don't we'd like to and we had
the new current price but we would like
to do is we'd like to know who the who
has the current bidder who's winning the
current bid and who's like possibly
going to get it if time expires so in
the next video what we're gonna do is
we're gonna fix whoops we're gonna fix
that overflow problem and we're gonna
allow the decimal fix it so we can
actually get decimal places and we can
get larger values and then we're also
going to this update we're going to save
who makes the update that way we know if
Tim is the top bidder or who is so
that's all for this video thank you guys
for watching and I'll see in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
