been acting what back in do I use what's
my favorite and why I'm just video on
explain what I'm using and why so
currently be back in that I like to use
is plain old Express when we're and pair
this with Express graph QL with graph QL
and node and Express together is my
favorite pairing and if I were to start
production by BAP today it'd be using
this back end and I'm currently actually
working on a project so I want to go
over what the alternatives are and not
to use them so one of them I have used
for a very long time and E and there's
many others like this that are basic
backends that have a lot of builds if we
go to documentation we can see look at
your emails users admin uploads the
features that strappy comes with and
sing with feathers jet stuff for you and
it's really nice right and I actually
written very nice I actually haven't
tried strappy but just looks nice from
looking at it as used and I've really
enjoyed but the main reason I'm them is
because I want to use graph QL I
projects that are not graph QL
I'm just very much and think it's way
better I would hate to make a back-end
with her it's kind of like when you try
really good food I want to go back and
eat crappy food again now that you've
tasted what I've tasted graph QL
I really like it and I don't want to SQL
anymore because I just like it so much
I'm doing a project well so for that
reason I'm not using feather text wrap
you right now and I won't be using any
other know node or Python or elixir back
really set up for rest to use graph kill
because it does look there's a little
graph QL section with graph QL set on
this you can graph you'll set up on
feathers I meant to use graph QL they're
meant not they're meant to be rest
frameworks they're not meant to use
graph QL collection on graph QL but
that's not their primary you know use
case so that's why I'm not using it now
an alternative though so that's
the main thing I like graph QL now that
we've established like I want to use
graph qo what are my options I can use
right one of them is actually craft QL
graph cool which is serverless back end
and the reason for that is you just
create the graph QL on their website
here and bam you have and I think I
haven't tried this but it looks super um
you know graph QL ski bytes and get tons
of functionality super fast anything
holding me back from using graph cool
and that is I can get a much better
pricing if I were to on Express and put
on AWS rather than going in to graph you
know buying a package and then run it
that way they do have an ID which I
should definitely you know try it out
and see how I like it
a to but the one thing that's holding
back from graph cute using this I know I
can get a much better price and run my
application way more like way less using
a domestics press server but what I
really like about the thanks way faster
like you can get a server set up waste
you can with Express that's just a fact
Leggett it's so going to hook up I mean
you can see it here o auth in this
Apollo so this is a great Ottoman if
price doesn't matter to you but I want
to build a very efficient low-cost
back-end and for that like these two and
on a minor note you get more control
right because I get to control every
aspect of it that will you lose some of
that because it's doing so much for you
and right now this is what my current on
graph well however to do graph field
this is what it would look like my
server I'll put a link all the way to
this last one I had just added join
monster to this this is your big file
and a lot of this like I have facebook
off in here and not but this just gives
you an idea does not like to use this
this is what the river looks like and
Express and set up with Postgres see I
really like this this is what I'm going
to be using for future stuff head up
with back-end services and why I am
using this
over some of the other options because a
lot of options are still run and I
highly recommend using feathers or
strappy well like if I was not using
graph QL it would be a totally different
story would not be using Express I'd be
using one of these guys but graph QL
that's right now
and I'm loving it I love this setup
right now Josh QL and it's working well
for me so that's it for this video guys
thanks for watching let me know if you
have any questions I'll reply in the
comments below and go
