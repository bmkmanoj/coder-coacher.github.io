you in last video we work on is the
button here and that's what we're going
to do
I also found a small flaw that we're
going to be debugging I noticed when I
just like refresh the page the time here
of 170 is at the top but we should see
the least time left first that's how it
should be sorted and look this is less
time than that but this is not top of
this so we're going to dig into why
that's happening but first I'll tangle
this button so or this icon we're going
to turn it into a button actually and
that's what's going to make it do the
cool stuff so I think I actually just do
this and it'll look give a nice little
effect on it at least that's how I was
working with the other ones so just have
a spacing beautiful at the bottom here
anyway what the heck is that how are we
doing the flutter flutter flutter
flutter I wonder if the footer is oh you
know what that's probably a button right
here well that's weird I was not
expecting it to do but now I think of it
I guess that makes sense
today we're doing this button here I
wanted to do button like that but I
guess they wrapped in this flutter tab
this footer tab just make it work well
tack it a little bit not hack it but use
footer tab where you wouldn't expect it
what if I put floater tab around this
ish look it cuts off this a little bit
and doesn't actually add anything all
right
scratch this idea guys we will just
leave the icon as is is it actually a
little bit cut off I can't tell or if
that's just the way it is I think it I
think it just waited I think it's okay
okay so now let's tackle this debugging
problem okay so right here time left
we're sorting it L time left and time
left the first thing I'm going to do is
just console.log what the picker says so
let's see we should be seeing time left
L time left so that should mash up let's
make sure it is sorting sorting by time
left so it should go into this statement
okay looks good so it actually is
sorting by time left but for some reason
this about this oh you know what time
left is a string it's not a an actual
value well okay it's not in like minutes
since okay so this is a problem I think
we're comparing strings like this which
was a very dumb thing to do instead we
need to compare like the times which we
actually need to look at the moment J s
to do a comparison I'm showing try this
this may not work at all I'm just going
to do end time because that's our moment
object our moment object it might have a
comparable by default
and it does look like it has a
comparable that's exactly what I wanted
to yeah okay
so that looks like it was it so if you
didn't catch what the problem was time
left is this string here and so we are
doing string comparisons so this string
value like here was less than that
string value but we needed to look at
the time value itself and the time value
is actually stored in this object here
which has a basically a comparison looks
like it's built in so we didn't even
have to do that okay so that's good um
I'm gonna do some research guides on I
want to make this button slightly like I
want to do something when I click on it
so we need to give a response to the
user so the user can see they've made a
bid you can see the but the number go up
that's good but like there's no response
that you clicked on it I want to kind of
give like something so yeah let's we'll
do the next video thank you guys for
watching I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
