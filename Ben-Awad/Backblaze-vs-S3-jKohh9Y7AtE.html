that needs to store images that users
upload now originally I was using Amazon
s3 for this but I was storing my server
on vulture and I was using this plan
right here and it comes with 20
gigabytes of SSD so I thought why not
store my images on there too so I was
using nginx to serve these images and
then also route to my server but what I
noticed is images loaded a lot slower
now I think the reason for this is I
don't have a CDN and it's not caching
and s3 just has a better and I'm not
using a lot of memory right on this
machine right here so I was like okay
and another thing that I disliked is I
was now having to store people's images
so I had to back them up which also took
a lot of room because I'm now basically
keeping multiple copies of their images
to make sure I didn't mess anything up
so to do this I was like I don't really
want to do store them on vulture anymore
so I was gonna switch it back to s3 but
before I switch it back to s3 I wanted
to look at some other options of where I
might store some images so I came across
this thing called back Belize which has
which competes with s3 and you can see
here's a little pricing chart and it
looks like it just blows Amazon s3 out
of the water like just what the pricing
looks amazing so always looking into it
and I want to consider using this over
Amazon s3 so let's take a look at
whether Backblaze is a good option over
Amazon s3 or a juror or Google cloud so
with AWS here is one way to upload files
from a server so to be able to upload it
to s3 you need to have your credentials
so my AWS credentials I use to upload a
file to s3 so a user on my website would
send a file to my server and then my
server would send this image to s3 and
then it would tag along my credentials
so that way I'm not exposing my
credentials so I don't want the website
to be able to directly upload to s3
because then I'd have to give them a
website my credentials which is not
great but one downside to this plan is I
have to send the image to my server
which then sends the image to s3 and so
this whole transition of me sending the
website there's two trips right and
sitting an image is not that cheap of an
operation right because we're sending it
two times and it also holds up my server
because my server is now having to
upload images so there's a lot of people
trying to upload images at the same time
my server can get bogged down so Amazon
has this really sweet feature called
signed URLs so how this works is now
let's say I have a website user and he
wants to upload an image instead of
sending the image to this server he
tells the image or the server hey I want
to upload an image and it says get me a
signed URL and so what the server does
is it sends s3 and it's like hey s3 we
need to get a signed URL and now I have
the credentials on the AWS server here
so that's how s3 knows who I am
and I send it up and I'm like hey give
me a URL and then s3 sends back a URL
and I give this URL to the website so
what's special about this URL well I can
basically put my credentials in this URL
so this website can now upload an image
to s3 using this URL that it gives me so
what's really cool about this is now the
request between my website and the
server and the server in s3 are now just
sending basically some text and now I'm
no longer sending in whole image to my
server and this is a much faster
operation for my website and server to
do so I'm offloading write the work so
now my website and s3 are doing the
brute of the work send me well the
website always has to upload an image
but now it's uploading it to s3 and s3
he's gonna take the image directly and
it avoids coming to my server now how
this works is this URL I can for example
put limits on for example it may only be
valid for 30 seconds
so the website can send up an image
within 30 seconds and then it's expired
which makes it secure and safe to use so
this is a really nice feature that I
really like and any place I go with I
would want to have this so I was looking
at Backblaze and I wanted to see if they
had a similar scheme to this that I
could do this with and so here's the
documentation for Backblaze and
uploading and I took a look and it says
to upload and I'm really just uploading
a single file at a time it says first
call this get upload URL and then then
you call upload file and this looked
very similar to what how s3 does it
right because if we come back here I'm
requesting a URL and then I upload the
image using that URL so it looked very
similar so I was excited I was like cool
this looks like has real potential so I
looked at to get upload URL and two
things I really didn't like when I
actually dug into the details so notice
how get upload URL works so first even
before I get the upload URL I have to
authorize account I have to call this
authorize account API which is fine I
can do that on the server to authorize
it but notice this for 24 hours it is
valid or if something gets rejected so
assuming you don't you know mess up your
request for 24 hours you can upload
images to this URL and notice you can
upload as many as you want so that's
very important and that's if we come
over here it talks about that actually I
think it talks about over here but as
many URLs or as many files as you want
to this URL that you request here here
it talks about it here so that is what I
really didn't like about Backblaze so
now I was able once I get this URL if I
were to send this to the client right
because if we look at the diagram I have
to send this URL to the website for it
to make the request to the s3 so now my
website has access to this URL where
they can send as many files
they want for 24 hours and that did not
seem cool with me I didn't want to give
my basically my website the client
access to that much cuz then they have a
lot of power now and they can abuse this
power with the URL so I wasn't sure if
there was it didn't look like there was
any options I could do here's the
request it didn't look like there's any
options I could pass to this get upload
your rel to change this it really looks
like something I have to call on the
server and not and just upload the image
from the server and another thing I
really didn't like about Backblaze was
sometimes the upload URL fails so take a
look at these two paragraphs here and
this this scared me I was like why the
heck would I have to do this this seems
really annoying but basically they
upload the URL that they get is directly
pointing at this storage pod thing that
they say and sometimes the storage pod
might not be able to take the data so
what you have to do is you have to get a
new URL so that sounded really bad to me
and they said we recommend at least five
different upload URLs before sending in
air so what that means is I would have
to send a request here the server would
send a request to Backblaze we have a
new URL I send it back here I then try
uploading if it fails I have to go
through this process again back and
forth to get a new URL and I really
didn't like that so with that said with
these things I decided not to go with
black delay back boys
and I haven't looked at what a juror and
Google cloud offer it looks like Ezra
has a little better pricing than s3 and
at least in these two metrics Google
cloud looks like it beats s3 and storage
but not download but there's some other
things to take a look at with the
pricing and I want to see if these offer
the signed URL that I was talking about
as well so I'm gonna be comparing those
I haven't decided yet where I'm gonna go
with but I'm leaning towards s3 over
Backblaze right now for those reasons
but let me know if you've used back
please
before and if you know how to get it to
work like I was talking about without
needing to expose basically your
credentials for so long yeah but that's
it for this video guys I hope this was
helpful let me know also if there's any
other places I should investigate for
storing images I don't really need
something like cloud I think it's not
CloudFlare cloud front one of the cloud
an area that's what it's called
for example iCloud Neri I don't really
need a place where the change the format
of images transform them I just
basically want a place like s3 where I
can just store a lot of images that are
uploaded by people and I need an API for
that where I can just store them and
cheaply ideally right now s3 is probably
my top option but yeah let me know what
you guys use for that that's it for this
video guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
