take a react native app and deploy it to
the Apple Store or the Google Play Store
so we're gonna take our stat calculator
and put it on both of these stores so
the first thing you have to do if you
want to put your application whether or
not it's react native is create an Apple
Developer account or create a Google
Play Developer account
here's apples it costs $100 every year
they're just to be having active
membership whereas Google Google doesn't
really have a landing page for theirs
you just come over here to this Google
Play console and you can log in with
your Gmail or your Google account and
there's a lot more reasonably priced
only $25 one-time fee to be able to put
your app on the App Store so this is
different than Expo Expo is free and you
can just put it up there
these guys make you cost money but the
difference is with Expo that's running
on your through the Expo app right
whereas this will be an actual separate
app on your phone and this is where most
people don't know about Expo everyone
knows about Apple or Google so you want
to make sure to put on these stores now
I'm not sure why Apple is more expensive
it could because they do their stuff
slightly differently Google Play has it
automated when you deploy your
application or your app they have a bot
that checks your code to make sure
nothing's malicious and then they you
know put on the App Store so everyone
can use it
whereas Apple actually has people that
will review the code and make sure it's
okay before I actually put it on the
store I don't know what else they review
I just know there is a review system
that takes a couple weeks whereas
Google's can take just like a couple
hours to get on the App Store so it
takes it actually longer to get into the
Apple Store than it does to the Google
store but let's look at how once we have
on
on setup we can actually build our code
and put it on here cuz once you make an
account you can create like a store
listing and then somehow you need to put
your you know bring your code and the
way you do that is running a simple
command expo makes it really easy or
create react native app makes you really
easy to do this but we need to make a
little change to our app JSON file and
we just need to add two things oh I
guess three things the first is the
version so you're gonna start out maybe
1.0 or something and every time you
release a new APK that's Android version
so we're gonna be creating basically a
bundle for your code it's called apk for
Android and I forget what's called for
iOS maybe I PA or something like that
but it needs to have a version is
associated to it and then when you if
you could ever create a new apk or
version for iOS you want to just
increment this number here in any way so
this is using looks like Cimber if
you're not familiar with that Cimber
this is how you can version your code
version as in you know about release new
versions of it I recommend taking a look
at this if you never heard of it before
so he needs the same thing here I'm
gonna use 1.0 for our first release and
iOS and Android have this thing where
you have basically a little identifier
associated for each one with iOS it's
called bundle identifier with Android
it's packaged so you need both of these
and by the way icon and name are
required so you need to have those but
notice how you build this so here I put
my name this is generally where you want
your company name or you know your you
could put your name too and notice how
this is different or backwards
both of these are calmed up in a wad and
then here's the name of application I'm
gonna call it stack calculator makes
sense and so this is gonna be the
identifier in the store as well okay
so once you have that it's very easy all
you do is run Expo build Android or Expo
build iOS now I currently don't have a
iOS account but I will or an Apple
account which I will be setting up in a
little bit so it will take a little
longer to get that out in the store
anyway but I have a Google Play account
already so I'm gonna go ahead and build
mine with Android now when you run this
I'm not gonna do it right now cuz it
takes a little while but when you build
it what's gonna happen it's gonna ask
you if you'd like to sign your own thing
if you have no idea what it's talking
about I recommend just as they as they
say let them sign it for you and then
they'll get you a link at the very
bottom so you'll click on the link and
they can go download your what's called
apk file they'll give you at least with
Android and then you don't even need to
actually have your Play Store account
set up before you set up apk but once
you have that apk when you'll set up
your Google Play listing you set up your
account you can create an app and then
you'll drag that apk file actually into
Google Play and they'll know how to
handle that and that'll be the code
that's run now with iOS if you do build
iOS this is gonna require you to log in
to your Apple account and have that all
already configured which I don't have
figured right now on this Apple kinda
later in the future I'll make a update
video to this later when I have my Apple
account updated but yeah that's all this
this is quite it's actually quite easy
to bundle the code you just run Expo and
then build Android or Bill iOS and you
should have this exp thing that I'm
running in front of this if you already
went to the Expo store remember how we
ran Expo published
now the cool thing about this is when we
do this build let's say I make a code
change like in my app KS over here or am
i well weed out me code there really and
I main over here let's say I instead of
this color I want to make it blue I just
do Expo publish and it'll automatically
update Android and iOS devices for me
and they don't even have users don't
even have to go back to the Play Store
an update it sends updates over the
Internet which is super cool so I just
published a new version and it's good to
go
but yeah so steps set up an account with
one of whichever one you want and then
make sure your app dot JSON over here
has the things I talked about named icon
version and then the identifiers for iOS
and Android you know if you're doing iOS
both iOS so on Android if you want both
T and add both and then just run expo
build of your environment that you want
and then upload that when you're
actually setting up the thing in the app
store so that's it for this video guys
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
