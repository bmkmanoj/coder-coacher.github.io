permissions and graph QL now I have a
graph QL server in nodejs
and I want to be able to tell if the
users authenticated maybe if they're an
admin if they have some other privilege
I want to be able to check that before I
go and like fetch stuff in the database
and do different actions so I'll be
showing you how to do that now I drew a
lot of inspiration from this library
called Apollo resolvers and there's
actually a talk about it and I'll link
both of these in the description below
now I'm not actually going to be using
this library normally I would just if
there's a library ready-made for what I
want to do I'll use it but it's a light
I think it's a little bit bloated
there's a lot of things that you don't
need in here and then it's going to end
up being like maybe tens lines of code
to actually get the permissions set up
to make this create result or function
and we're going to do it very similar to
how it is here so yeah but feel free to
Charles this library and check this out
too so I'm going to pop over here to the
nodejs arrow sake mouth because a graph
QL set up already on it and if you would
like to get this code I'll put a link in
description below to github so you can
follow along and check it out too so the
first thing I want to do is the first
thing I want to do is go into my models
my user and just add another field that
to kind of exemplify how permissions
might work so maybe I want to check if
the person is an admin so I have a field
in my database called is admin which is
a boolean type and we'll just set a
default value of false and we stay put
comma there and perfect so I'm just
going to go over to command-line real
quick and drop my database and remake it
and we can stop the server for a second
so test and recreate it that way it just
creates that a field test
fql database all right come back over
here just run NPM start start that back
up alright so now we're going to
actually get into how permissions is
actually going to work so I'm just going
to right click create a new file called
permissions da Jas now this is where I'm
going to create that function I was
talking about rate resolver which we saw
over there and basically what we want to
be able to do is what I really loved
about this too is this going to be super
flexible and you can also use this for a
bunch of other things which we'll talk
about soon but what we want to do is we
want to basically check if a user is
authenticated checks there's an admin
before we run a regular resolver so
maybe before we for example I don't know
create a board maybe you have to be
authenticated so before we actually
create this board or run this resolver
we want to check if the user is
authenticated if there is a user
associated with the account so how would
we go about doing that and that's what
this result with this create resolvers
going to do this it's going to run some
code to basically check before but it's
going to do in a super generic way so
we're going to create a function that
takes a resolver and it's going to
return a resolver and then what we're
going to do is we're going to call this
the base resolver so we're going to
we're going to add some stuff to it in
the middle because our base resolver can
create other resolvers which as you're
about to see this is going to get a
little bit complicated so we he'll have
a child resolver here and this will be a
function so what we have here is when we
call this create resolver function we're
going to pass in a resolver and then we
want to be able to with this resolver
create another result or passing in a
child resolver so
this resolver runs before this resolver
so what we'll have is this for example
create board while hava is authenticated
resolver that runs before the creep Ord
that way this checks see the throath
indicate if they are comes and calls
this child resolver so what we'll do so
we'll create a new resolver here and it
is going to take an async function and
it's going to take this is the same
parameters as our resolver so and we
could pass more if we wanted to we're
going to pass in the parent we're just
going to take have three parameters
parent args and context and we could add
more if we wanted to and what it's going
to do here is its first going to call
resolver it's going to wait for it
passing in these parent args and context
then like I said it's going to return
the child resolver and again you want to
call parents contact parent args and
context on the child result or two and
then down here we return create
resolvers and we pass it our new
resolver okay I know this code looks
incredibly complicated but using this is
very simple and it's going to be very
intuitive and it's going to make sense
and be super flexible so that's why it's
really nice but basically what this code
is doing is it allows you you can create
a resolver which that resolver can
create another resolver so it's a
recursive function that we're creating
here that can call other this we're
going to create the base resolver which
then can create more resolvers and so on
and cool thing about this is the outer
resolver could return something so maybe
you know and we could pass that as a
function to our as a parameter to our
child
Oliver if we wanted to now I don't
really have a use case for that right
now but that's something you could do in
the future okay so how do we actually
use this thing so we could create a is
authenticated resolver like I was saying
so what we'll do is you call create
resolver only pass in our function
parent args context and then but if you
excuse me and we put in a resolver here
so we could check we have the context
and one of the things that I'm passing
in the context is if we go to to just my
right here to my graph you'll Express
route you see in the context I'm passing
the user if there is one so I could just
check if context dot user so if there's
a user good right we don't have to do
anything but if there's not a user maybe
we want to throw new air not
authenticated that's nice so what about
if you uncheck if they're an admin well
is admin can create or another so here's
the thing
we could create a resolver right like
that or what I could do is they don't
only have to be an admin we also want
them to be authenticated so we could say
is authenticated doctor a resolver and
then you pass in your function here args
context so now I can check if and I can
check context user and we know the user
is going to exist because offset is
authenticated runs first and then we can
check is admin and you could also call
it is authentic a is authenticated you
could say requires off that kind of
makes more sense
requires admin and then here if they're
not an admin we'll throw new error
requires admin access and here
authentication required authentication
acquired and it's not authenticated is
fine actually
okay so we have our two ones requires
off and requires the admin you know
you'll notice the difference between the
two is acquires admin actually uses this
function to create the result so what's
going to happen is it's going to run
this then it's going to come here and
run this and then we could even create
more right I could say requires admin
dot create resolver and I could do some
other check I don't know what other
check I'd want to do maybe you want to
check if their username if they're using
maybe a band username so Const and
username check and you can say context
dot user username is equal to dawn then
throw new error bad username right so it
doesn't really matter what you have in
here you can do any logic you want
what's going to happen is this resolver
what's going to happen is when this is
called requires authors called then
requires admin is called then this is
called and you'll see this when I do the
example in a second here exactly how
that's working now I'm going to get rid
of this this is just an example but
these two are actually helpful and now
we're going to actually use these so I'm
going to export these oops
both these so now in our resolvers we
can actually import and use them so
import acquires off and requires admin
and this is from permissions and I think
a culturally where's Ivan right yet ok
so now any of the functions I would like
to make this requirement on I can write
so create board let's say so it's this
function here I can just wrap it with
requires off grab the whole thing so
just wrap the whole function in that so
now I can't try to create a board unless
I'm all set decay tit so let's test this
out and show you guys it working in
action so mutation so I'm not
authenticated right because to be
authenticated I am checking the headers
and getting the token from authorization
header which obviously is not going to
be there because we're using graphical
and graphical you can't at least the web
browser you can't set a token so we're
going to create a board and call the
owner ABC and name whatever right and
we're going to run this fill the fetch
my apologies guys so requires off here
need to write create resolver okay so
now if we come back over here run that
argument owner has invalid expected and
found ABC so console
hold that did not work at all so let's
come back to our permission
sir permission was not is actually not
working so it looks like maybe context
user is defined so one other thing you
can do to check is this
so if user doesn't exist or context that
user ID right so sometimes they have an
empty object path so you can check
whether it has an ID because it has an
ID user definitely exists so let's try
that again same thing
all right let's console this out console
dot log context that way we can actually
see what this value is and I'm just
going to log context and then I'm
actually gonna restart the server and
pipe everything to a file so you can see
it because spits out a lot of stuff so
come back over here run this again
actually it might not even be making it
to the server expected type int the
owner we wife was the owner expecting it
that's weird
create board Oh owners net just kidding
guys I don't even think it our mutation
is getting called our resolvers getting
called okay there we go
so the problem was you saw I was getting
an error before that was just because I
was passing in the wrong value type of
graph QL so graph DL checks that so we
don't have to worry about this get rid
of this okay started server back up and
let's continue so you can notice how we
got an air not authenticated right then
let us so you could put anything here to
check whether the user I think this is a
decent check you may or may not need
this part depending on what your
authentication setup looks like now
let's show you if I am logged in it
actually
works so to do this I'm going to create
two users here username we call this guy
Bob email doesn't really mater Bob
password Bob and X is oh you know what
you come back over here to my schema we
need to add to register the ability to
add an admin is admin is a boolean so
now we refresh it should let's say
whether he's an admin or not is admin
we're going to say false and we're going
to create another guy called boba and go
over here is an admin all right conflict
because they have different ease ileus
field to fetch both obvious and alias I
like forget how to do that I think it's
so ok the problem is is register and
register both return the same thing so
you have to do a graph QL alias which I
forget how you actually do haven't done
this in a very long time so basically
just renamed it um here we go
r1 and this is our register two pretty
fine
is that not how you name it right
comparison of backwards are two so the
name of what you want to call it and
then then you do the function it looks
like our one okay so we created both
these users now I'm going to log in with
our first user Bob login email Bob
password up get our token here now I
want to try creating a board
authenticated and make sure that still
works so I'm going to have to use this
program which is a graphical desktop
program I'll put a link in the
description below so you can use it too
what this allows us to do is actually
add an authentication header
I forget is it authentication or
authorization
I checked okay so I check the
authorization header to grab the token
so pass that in here so now I can now it
knows I'm Bob so I can do a mutation and
I can say create board owner one name I
don't know
so we create the board and bam we get no
air whatsoever we try doing this over
here right not authenticated so it does
check the authentication see if you're
logged in now I want to also demo the
other resolver the so we're going to I'm
just going to actually use the same so
you can add this to any of these
mutations right now I'm going to show
you how the admin one works so now that
admin one works we come back to the
permission it does checks if they're
authenticated still so even though we
just did you know check if they're an
admin not authenticated right because it
checks whether they're authenticated
before it checks if they're an admin but
now if we run it over here we should say
non admin and BAM
since we just made create board that
require admin access analysis requires
admin access because we're trying to
create a board as bob and bob is not an
Advent but if we log in so we're getting
two different error message is it you
notice that depending on how we are
doing it here we're not indicated so we
get to not as indicated over there we're
not admin so pretty cool so it chains
down so now I'm going to log in as Boba
so a password and we're going to set
this off header and we are going to see
if we can create a board or if we get an
authentication err oh man I reset here
all right theoretically it should just
go through because we are an admin going
to check that we're an admin it's going
to be like hey admins can do stuff
you're good to go alright I don't know -
all right that did not work so either
bow-bow does not have admin access when
we think it does or our permission is
not working so I just want to make sure
I was pacing the token okay I am
oh okay so there's so there here's the
reason why I didn't work I just realized
what's happening so when I create that
token I'm actually just I don't actually
set so this is going to be in resolvers
when I create the token I only pass in
the ID in the user name field I also
need to pass in is an admin and now it's
going to work because we actually didn't
weren't telling whether they are an
admin or not so that's not good so here
let's log in as flippy bobba just to
show you that bob still can't create
stuff will log in as bob to
password okay so let's do Bobo first now
we've created this new token this new
token should have admin access to run it
BAM
create the board a ok now everything is
working this guy bomb should not have
admin access and cool forget our air so
that it for this video guys a little
bumpy as you can see permissions are ya
Tessa make sure they're working but I
hope you can see how cool this method of
creating permissions is I can infinitely
chain these permissions I can create as
many as I want or you know you can mix
things up create different types and
it's really just running a piece of code
before a resolver happens so you can do
you know you can extend this to not just
permissions but other things maybe I
want to do some logging and maybe I'll
just like you know console log here
every time and do I don't know log
someone accessed a authenticated
endpoint right so you could log that
someone is doing that so there's a lots
of different use cases for this I highly
recommend using this if you want to do
basically change the permission give
access to different levels of resolvers
and your graph QL server and of course
all this code is going up on github and
I'll put the link in the description
below so you can grab this play with it
give it a try and let me know if you
have any trouble trying implementing
this yourself because as you saw I had
some errors when I was trying it this is
not the simplest lines of code even
though like I said is only what ten
eleven lines of code and we created this
whole beast but easy to have errors of
it so
thank you guys for watching I'll see in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
