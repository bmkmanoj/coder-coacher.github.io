more things you can do with react
drought or native the first thing I want
to show you is passing data between
pages so it's very common to want to be
able to send from for example our home
page and this is a route and whenever I
go to the products page maybe I want to
pass it some information and the reason
you might want to do this is because
from some pages you might want to send
different data so I'm going to show you
two ways you can do this the first is
through a URL parameter and this is
really more relevant for when you're
doing through the browser but you can do
for example it may be the name so if you
put a colon like I just did here and
then a value so for example name you now
have a variable in the URL so when I
push over here slash Bob instead of its
gonna match this path right here so
slash products slash name and what's
gonna do is it's gonna store whatever
you put here in a variable called name
I'll show you what I mean by that so one
of the things that react router gives us
is also a thing called match and if we
wanted to we could actually just show
you what that is so I'm just going to
json.stringify the match object and I'm
now gonna change pages so one of the
parameters you can see or one of the
things that has is something called
parameters and side of that is named Bob
we'll talk about that in a second but
that's what I was talking about with
matching parameters and grabbing data
from the URL so there's some other
things you might be interested in here
inside of match that you can use but
like I said we care about the params so
I'm gonna just show that so we have name
is Bob so what I could do is I could do
dot name
and we would get Bob here all right so
we have Bob and the reason for that is
because we passed that as a parameter
here so if I put instead of Bob I said
Tom we would now see Tom there so
whatever I put at the end of the URL
that's gonna be passed to that component
and it's called name because we put the
name here so prams dot name if I were to
call this for example you could call
this whatever you wanted so I can give
it call it first name so then in
products over here I would do match top
params stock first name so that's those
two names match up so we have Tom here
but this is not really a great way to
pass data at least a lot of data or like
sometimes you might want to pass an
object so there's other ways you can do
this but this is a nice way really for
if using the web browser and you want to
use react router and you want to store
like maybe an ID of a product or
something the other way you can do this
and we'll just get rid of this is when
you push there's a second parameter and
this is basically the state so I can add
anything I want here so value value one
is gonna be Bob Val two is going to be
five and I can store whatever I want so
the second one is just an object over
here and the way I access this and I'm
just going to get rid of and there is in
products there's another thing called
location and we get location and match
again the reason we have access to those
is because we have it as a wrapped so we
pass products as a component
okay so we have location if I wanted to
I could show that here so we can take a
look at what location has so it has
again some other things that you can use
so path name search but the thing we
care about is to stay
so let's click on that so it has Bob and
battle five so whatever I pass now and
that object we can access on this screen
through locations state so if I were to
change these values and this is going to
be a really big number now we would see
those values reflect and change in our
products and we could do different
things with this now so that's how you
can pass data between pages and then
actually receive that data and do
something with it is so just to recap
you pass it through history push when
you go to that page and you can change
whatever data you pass to it and then on
the page you get it through the location
so that's the main way you really want
to be passing data especially if it's an
object especially in react native when
you don't really have a URL okay the
next thing I wanted to go over was a lot
of times you'll create components that
need to use react router so an example
let's say I want to create a new one
called change page button and instead of
rendering on the home page here a button
I'd like to render my change page button
and let's just say I returned a button
and that's that's what this does so a
mistake I see a lot of people do is this
so I'm gonna render my change page
button so I have my change page button
here and my change page button notice
I'm getting history from the props and
then we change to the products page so
that it's basically the exact same code
except now I changed it so this button
is a different component all right so
let's run it oh we get a problem
undefined is not an object evaluating
history dot push and the reason for that
is history is actually not in the props
it is not a route it's just a random
component that we have here so history
is not there so we can solve this by
doing one of two things first we could
just pass history down so we're getting
the history prop because home is around
so we could pass history to our change
page button and so now our change page
button we have history and I can now
change page is no problem but sometimes
it might be nested quite deep
for example maybe change page over here
called another component that then needs
it the alternative way and we'll get rid
of that is you'll have to use any of
these things as long as this component
is being rendered inside of a route you
can do this so I'm going to say Kant's
change page button and we're gonna
export this change page button and we're
going to use a higher-order component
college with router and this comes from
the library so I react router native
with Robert and what that does is it
actually adds history to the props and
also location and match and all the good
stuff that basically reactor gives you
okay so I can for example look at this
so we have not passed in the props and
if I click on this we're able to change
pages just fine so that is the other way
you can basically inject or have access
to these react router props is through
adding this with router higher-order
component so that's it for this video
that should give you a good footing on
how to use react router how to setup
screens send data between the two pages
and then also be able to access these
props from any component now again this
code will be up on github if you want to
check it out and the link will be in the
description below thanks for watching
