just log your to-do list because what I
think is happening is after I'm changing
something here it's going on to find
here Prince that complete
so just a list of to do's okay so that's
not right so reducers wrong always
pretty sure this was right list
khan's new state console.log see what
we're returning from that
okay so this is a new state to list a
list of lists either way it's not right
so everything looks right except for the
first one the first one it's returning a
list oh I don't know the wrong guys to
current list no sorry to list so to do
list you expand except are now changing
the to do's and let's not spread that
that's actually wasteful so we're trying
a new object the to-do list it's going
to keep it same name but now the two
dues are going to be that to do is start
to do spreading that okay same things
going to go here named do list
that's going to be to do ok sit to do
this is equal to do's and we're
filtering ok again one last time name
can just copy that copy that so now so
doing this doing this way so the problem
was my reducer I was thinking they're
just returning a list still which were
not expected Toki online 30
in your app using parentheses the return
object
okay that didn't work
and added please to the bottom I don't
know why newest didn't work okay so it
breaks after the second one not sure why
let's first make this more modular for
ethic that way we can clear some of the
of the to do's because they're getting
really long so Redux observable of type
multiple actions
fetch user okay there's going to be
example where they need to listen for
multiple actions let's see if they have
examples they do
single one single actually maybe we just
need to look up of type I wonder if
there's the different one that's similar
of type your junks observable
can we do it like this maybe
I'm going to find is not an object t2 ID
okay we're adding the to do whoops we
now need to get this replace working
so it on infinite recursion just make
the type Bob for now let's console you
console dot log type it looks like
listening for multiple epics is working
now to delete to do need list and your
score ID so JavaScript replace string so
we're doing something wrong
you
I guess I could do global underscore
need list ID
nope do I need to xcape these maybe
looks like that was it no for whatever
reason I just want to try needs this one
word I was putting an extra s I'm just
dumb there we go let's give it a try yes
bye-bye okay okay so it looks like our
creates not working what's working oh
that one didn't even work OE is because
we have something else up okay it's
working now doesn't work now network
request failed
so does that mean you have a problem
somewhere else think our epic is working
fine maybe with our to do form mutation
create ID create to do ok so we're
logging when we create it to do so let's
see if that is happening so ABC
that's no
I was returning null I mean it worked
but why is that arterial call that data
data create to do is just know why is
this mutational that's really weird
putting off the mutation works and works
fine the first time and its associated
it to this list okay but I mean we don't
want a response so that's fine in fact I
could just get rid of that so we don't
need it I don't know why it's returning
nothing it should at least return the ID
now when I would build this AWS it
breaks okay so something weird is going
on
so let's just dislike just dump
everything and let's see if the values
are just like getting messed up that's
the only thing I can think of that it
works the first time in not the second
there's some time the values for
whatever reason are changing okay you
have some we're cluttering the output
here new state is fine now all right
printing using the view okay it looks
good area
this tile is undefined
so that means a little study that we
pass end that means this is getting
rear-ended so this list ID is undefined
at some point so actually yes you need
to console that log curr to do list
because we're passing in a undefined
from this object when this object should
ever be undefined okay so you're looking
good
kill one of your guys still looking good
kill another kill another okay
so I'm not singing okay so notice that's
how there's an ID here and the ID
disappears and that's because we're
being bad to do form you're just fine
it's our reducer current list to list so
the reason I'm not doing a spread is
because I didn't want to copy too many
to do is twice because we're setting
them you here okay all that stuff's
working to create one here pop over to
my second let's go to yellow k one here
create a couple here pop back to one pop
back to yellow go to l 34 why not yo ok
so our update function is not working
what everything else seems good so let's
go check out that so to do is start to
dues just forgot to map that okay
ok so our adduce are still not working
what do do passing in the new to do so
when the ID is equal because it to do
otherwise we passed Yvette
update passes yep update passage justice
do I'm thinking it's our reducer that's
not working I guess let's double check
everything yep we're calling the reducer
so it's actually just not update on the
state darn it it looks very similar to
how other producers are working so why
are you being different update to do is
to do is list to do stop map we're going
over every to do
and to do is I DS match up I guess let's
console dot log
the state
IDs 38
so let's see if we're getting the right
idea guys see if we're going to write
list ID and the right to do
we're not getting the right to do Nolan
old text and actually we can leave that
there for now
okay looks like it's a server problem
because we're just passing just straight
add data back
we're doing patch that should be fine so
let's cause a lot of it to do here to
see if this is really bad to do
and let's see what the text is I guess
so let's restart connect BAM and that's
a whole lot of output so let that start
up probably is about started okay so
update that looks good then
giving us multiple to do's type II the
brawl wall no
that to do looks good let's look at what
the to do is from the subscribe so I'm
guessing everything looks good on the
server I'm guessing it's this object it
doesn't like I should be grabbing this
value
it's just it to do okay let's let's see
what that gives us that's kind of
interesting because I assume this is
what we give right back to the client
okay click null so get the log look at
the bottom now that's weird but to do is
really ugly here
this is instance of data values so when
it created I'll and curious let's keep
this open diary closed already closed it
actually now let's I want to see what
it's like from the create point of view
so we're looking at when we update we
know our creates working what should
actually look like create to do okay and
what does it get down here let's look at
the log one more time I'll be right
killed it that's fine i think it was to
do that instance and let's not worry
about it that's not going to matter too
much so start the server with that give
it a second
look at the log so this is what our
updated is dog created oh I'm done I
need to actually create an object to
okay so it looks about the same when we
create okay it looks the same about the
heck is this instance data values that's
for created its own selves or updated I
definitely updated the done did not log
that come on yeah then log it create
looks fine now the data values look good
going difference is it expanded that one
object expanded data values okay this is
an array actually okay that's the
difference this is array that one wasn't
array why is this an array patch nice
patch ring or returning array to do is I
patch okay whatever to do's task the
first one in that is really weird
all of a sudden the update is now an
array your patch returns in a red
Oh Klein what's the problem
Oh
all right it works just fine now all
right I think that's where I'm going to
stop streaming for now we got less
implemented I'm not sure what I'm going
to do the next video we're getting close
to wrapping up the to do list I think we
have a lot of the functionality that I
wanted to add maybe like some smoother
UI for these two components and also I
want to like when I switch this close
this drawer and also possibly some other
small things so you have that to look
forward to the next video I'll commit
these changes in a minute so yeah done
streaming thank you guys for watching
and I'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
