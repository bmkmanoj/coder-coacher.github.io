to add to our slack clone is image or
file uploading we're gonna make this
generic so if you want to upload images
you can or our audio files or text files
whatever you want you'll be able to do
that now here is the plan for
implementing this feature I'm going to
break it up into three parts what we're
gonna do today is add our component
which will s to upload images on the
react side and we're gonna be using
library called react drop zone which
makes it really nice and easy and then
we need to change our Apollo client to
be able to handle images or files and
send those to our server and then next
what we'll do is we're gonna be creating
some middleware on our server using for
middle to handle the file and save it
and then we also need to change our
database our schema and resolver that
way it can handle this new image or file
that we're now storing and then finally
we are gonna serve these static images
or files with Express and then preview
them in our browser alright now before
we get started on coding this up today I
want to talk about the design of this
real quick so the way we're doing this
is actually sending the file through a
mutation with graph QL but this is not
the only way to do files with graph QL
or with react and I really like this way
because it sends it in one request and
you're still using graph QL but I see
two other methods that work equally well
that you could consider doing so the
first is actually just forgetting about
graph QL and sending a creating new
route
you know maybe slash slash upload that's
really small slash upload on your
express server and then just upload the
file and do a post request with all your
data there basically saying forget about
graph QL for this one request but that's
kind of annoying because you want to
keep everything in graph QL so I chose
not to do that or you could host it in
somewhere else like for example have it
host
s3 or any image hosting and then just
save the URL in graph QL using graphic
QL so just a string of the URL but those
two methods are kind of you know trying
to get around it I'm just gonna go
straight through and show you guys how
to do this with graph QL but as you guys
are about to find out there's not a
standard way to do this right now and
it's a little bit hacky so let's get
started with this so first off we're
gonna configure a react drop zone
install that and get that set up so it's
right here and all we have to do is to
npm install in the sucker and we have it
so I'm gonna say yarn add drop zone and
I'm gonna come over here and the first
thing we're at is a little button to our
input field over here so I want to add a
little button here so I can click on it
and we can upload a file that way so
this isn't our send message component
from semantic UI I'm gonna grab a button
and an icon so we can create a button
icon kind of like this and the icon that
we're going to be using is this little
plus but you can use there's plenty of
other icons you can choose from if you
don't like this plus and we're just
gonna copy this button and paste it in
here and I'm say plus now if we just
leave it like this it's not gonna look
great because we didn't expect there to
be a button here when we wrote the CSS
for this so we need to change the CSS as
well so in our input I'm gonna get rid
of this fluid and I'm gonna display grid
up here this is our wrapper that we have
here so display grid and similar how
with our app layout how we defined
columns and rows we don't have multiple
rows we just have columns so I'm going
to copy that putting that over here and
I'm gonna use percentages so three
percent for a button in
7% for our input because their button is
really small and sweet that's looking
good so now when I click on this button
here what I'd like to happen is I'd see
a little file menu where I can select
the file that I want to upload so we're
gonna create a new component for this
and I'm just gonna call it file upload
j/s and we're an import react from react
and I say Kant's file upload and we're
an export default file upload so for
this we're actually gonna take some
children and we're gonna be using drop
zone from react drop zone now first
thing is this is right now just going to
be a wrapper around drop zone you get to
do what we want so we're gonna render
the children inside of drop zone here
and we're just gonna say on drop for now
we're just gonna say console log file
dropped and give that a save so now our
file upload over here I can wrap my
button import file upload
and we're just gonna grab that component
we just made and we're gonna wrap our
button file upload now if we just do it
like this with no other changes to drop
soon it's gonna look a little funky that
does not looking I want to look but it
does work so let's click on this and we
see it pop up so nice to get to look how
we want we just need to say CSS or class
name it is equal to ignore so by default
drop zone has a class name on this and
styles it for you as you saw if you
don't like the styling it gives you can
supply a class name and do your own
styling I'm not gonna add any other
styling to this so I'm just gonna say
ignore for the class name and we see it
goes away but the functionality stays so
now I can upload whatever file I want
and let's just show you guys this in
action let's inspect console and let's
see the file dropped and you know what
let's actually show you guys what what
what they have they are not just file
dropped I'll show you the files who
loved this reload okay
so let's go ahead and add my Teemo head
and we can see we have a an array of
files and we can see our first file the
cool thing about this is it gives us a
little preview as well if we went to
that URL and then we can see the name of
the file and some other stuff right
there with the type so perfect and if
you want to you can restrict on size and
type we're not gonna worry about any of
that because we want to open it up to
allow anything so nice I can now drop
using this little plus but I also want
to drop you know just drag my file in
here so I'd like to be just like dragged
this guy right on there and for it to
work which drop zone allows you to do as
well that did not scale
well look at my my thing eating the
button oh I think maybe if we come back
over here we say 3% and then auto that
will wreck out better let's see my CSS
is not very good nope it still eats it
and you have to fix that at a later time
but I want to drop this guy right on
here
so how do we do that well drop zone
actually supports that by default so we
don't need to make any changes to this
and we're just gonna come over here to
our message container which has all
these we just need to start listening
for files being dropped so I'm going to
import file upload components file
upload and I'm just gonna wrap right
here a messages file upload
and oops
need to close the tag video so now it's
gonna be listening so I didn't add any
CSS so we won't see anything but it has
some nice API is if you guys want to
come in here and style this up so I
actually see something when I drag over
here and it allows you to change the CSS
but if I do drag I do see a file pop up
here so we can't upload now but there's
one little quirk about this right now
we didn't turn off clicking so if I
click right here notice how this little
hole pop-up comes up so we just have to
disable clicking so we're gonna create a
new prop here that says disable click
and then our file upload there's
actually a prop called and we're gonna
put this up in disable click is equal to
disable click and we'll grab that as a
problem
so now we can pass it in so clicking
still works for our plus but now when I
click here nothing happens
I can still drop it of course or I can
click here and upload our two stuff so
what we're gonna be doing is instead of
console logging this actually sending it
in a mutation but before we can send
this in a mutation we need to fix some
stuff so the standard way let me just
move this over here so one way to send
files through mutations is using this
library called Apollo upload client and
it's really nice and then I made a video
about it before using it and I'd love to
use it again but there's one small
problem
so in our Apollo right now we have after
we're which looks for the response grabs
the headers and refreshes our tokens
automatically and I really like that
it's a really nice feature we don't have
to do anything about refreshing tokens
it handles it for us but for whatever
reason with Apollo upload client it
breaks after where it just does not have
this response with the headers so this
is unusable but or basically gonna copy
the method that Apollo upload client
uses so we're going to basically come in
here to the code source code and copy
the method he goes about actually
changing the client and how he does that
is implementing and let me just show you
guys the example of how he suggests to
use this so instead of using right now
we're using a cheapy link you would say
use his upload link instead of it and
what we want to do is do the best of
both worlds so we're gonna use this HTTP
link and we're just going to basically
add on this functionality that he does
and we can't just add stuff on to this
HTTP link so what we're gonna have to do
is come over here to Apollo client check
out the source for this and use that so
we're gonna go to packages and then
Apollo client ACP source and index dot
in our HP link I went to the wrong file
it was this one so we're gonna copy this
code right here and this will work just
like we have here because it's the same
exact code and then we're just going to
add on handling files like he does in
the Apollo upload client so first thing
I'm gonna do is copy all this stuff and
they wrote it in typescript so we're
gonna have to do a little bit of
destroying code so I'm gonna create a
new file called create file link and
we'll paste in all that code here and
I'm gonna delete this and import create
file link and this is the thing that
we're gonna create so first we're gonna
get it working over here so create file
link oops did not mean to do factory
create file link so first we're gonna
get this working and then we're gonna
add files to it so we don't need types
so don't need that don't need any of
this stuff
I can kill all these types thorough
server error we might use we'll give her
the type get rid of the type here and
here this looks like you're just
checking for error check Park fetcher
this is something we don't have to worry
about Apollo client does some extra
checking that we just don't really need
to check for because we know we're doing
it correctly this is warning if we don't
have a fetcher we know we have a fetcher
so we're good and we don't need this
interface we're gonna keep this create
signal thingy and here is this create
HTTP link we're just going to export
this function by default and I'm gonna
get this is the very bottom of the file
I just jumped to and I'm going to delete
that thing at the bottom we don't need
it the class it makes this function
right here's the bulk of the code we
want and we don't need this either
that's the
type information so here they're doing a
warrant if no fetch and check if fetcher
you can keep these checks and if you
want to but I didn't think I wanted them
/ needed them so just gonna grab those
out of here again they're checking for
the your eye and stuff you can keep this
if you want to either way doesn't matter
and we're gonna get rid of that and get
rid of that pretty much all all these
red lines we just kill and not sure why
it's super angry expected parenthesis
around oh there we go give it a save
form add stuff let's see undefined we
won't worry about these errors that's
fine too we don't use request handler
let's get rid of that come here at the
bottom we don't need this type
information either okay so this is I
think this is pretty good now we're not
getting any air airs just some things
oh they're reassigning stuff I'm just
gonna instead of passing in the fetch
here
I'm just going to set the default fetch
so fetcher is equal to fetch pumps and
we'll get rid of that stuff because I
know I'm gonna pass into your eye and
stuff okay so I'm gonna come over here
and just make sure our application loads
and see if we're doing anything wrong
all right abort controller so abort
controller okay so it doesn't know what
this thing is I'm gonna get rid of the
signal I was gonna keep it because I
didn't think it was gonna mess anything
up but it looks like it's gonna mess
something up so just get rid of it and
there do they're using Create signal
here and we'll just have to get rid of
that signaling I believe is for
canceling requests so let's just get rid
of that yep here they talk about
canceling requests so we don't have to
worry about that we'll just get rid of
it okay so it it loads correctly looks
like so everything is working as usual
let's try making sure you see hey pop up
cool so the HV link is working as
expected now that's good so let's add in
our code that makes sending files work
so how we're gonna do it is we're
actually gonna pass the file as a
variable and so how this guy does it is
he he create his own thing called
extract files and basically that looks
through the variables object so if
you're not you know what real quick let
me show you guys how this works
so this variables here is the variables
you pass when you're doing a mutation or
a query
so console dot log variables I believe
we're using some variables when we load
this so let's see if we see any okay so
notice how we have team ID and channel
ID so one of the variables that's gonna
come in here is an actual file and we
can't send a file to graph QL because
they only accept you know strings and
boolean x' that sort of thing
they don't accept file objects and you
can't just post a file all the libraries
expect it sent as form data so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna detect
whenever a file is in the variables so
he uses extract files this is a more
generic way to do it I just know I'm
going to call my variable file and so
I'm going to check if the file is in
variables and if it is I'm gonna do it a
special way so how he does it is he
first checks if there's any files and
this is a nice generic way to do it
because now it works for any file name
anything and then he pets it into this
file and then over here he just checks
if there's any files we do the special
way and the special way I'm talking
about is just using form data otherwise
you don't change anything you just let
it do how it normally would at work so
let's copy this because this is a bit
that we're gonna be using
so notice right here how it the
serialized body it stringify is the body
we're gonna do it right after that
okay give this a safe okay so for us
we're not going to be checking the files
because we're not gonna extract the
files but if you wanted to you could do
it like this and this is a good generic
way but I'm just gonna say if variables
dot file so I'm gonna say import as from
lodash has and what has does is it just
checks whether an object has this
property like has improper T so we're
gonna say has variables has file and so
when we do our mutation we need to call
the file file so we don't need this okay
so we're creating this special options
we're passing form data and you notice
here we are stringify the operations
this is the same thing as up here and
otherwise they just stringify here so
notice how on apollo what they do is
they check whether it is possible
they're just basically checking whether
this guy is even possible because
sometimes you can't parse it and then
fetch options see how they're using the
serialized body they use it down here
setting the body of fetch options we're
just going to move this up a bit
and put it above here and we're not
gonna worry about we're gonna assume
that this serialized body is okay that
we can stringify the body if you want to
you can keep the check in but we're
gonna remove it we're gonna assume we're
in the past good data so now instead of
saying the body here what we're going to
do is just have this vector options like
so and then down here and the else we're
going to set the fetcher body by
stringify the request operation now this
request operation thingy is just if we
come back the body of the actual graphic
you all that we're sending up so remove
that so down here pass in our body so
this is how it normally works you just
send JSON up which is the body of our
passing the variables in a query or
mutation but if you don't want that if
we do have a file we're gonna send it as
form data so we're going to stringify
the body and that's going to be one of
the fields in our form data otherwise we
are going to append a file here they are
stringify this and passing it up
multiple files and stuff we're not going
to worry about this we are just going to
well I guess so they're creating a map
and then depending the files because
they're supporting multiple files we're
not going to worry about multiple files
for this we're just going to do one file
and we're gonna delete that and then
here we're just gonna say variables dot
file this is how we used to do it and
we're gonna just copy that
and we're gonna put in our file so
variable stop file alright so now we're
you just stringify the body as usual but
now it is in its inner form data as
operations and you're gonna see this
come up later in our back-end when we
use it and I'm calling this variables
and then the name of it this is
something I took from how he did it
and the reason for this is this is just
the path and the variables
I'm object here we could also just call
this file and then hard-code it but
either way you know what yeah we'll just
call this file because that makes it
simplest why not okay so let's make sure
this is still working over here and make
sure we didn't break anything and it
looks like we broke something because
username undefined we only set stuff
here I'm assuming it doesn't like so I'm
gonna copy how we did it here for
reference copy you and I'm assuming it
doesn't like because we got rid of the
serialized body
and yeah we can get rid of that so I
just undo all that and this is the last
point where I was working so give it a
refresh but make sure that is cool so
this is really tricky stuff because we
were messing with someone else's code
right now and we're gonna just paste
this back so we were also setting the
headers here okay so it didn't like it
when we moved that stuff up so I'm not
gonna move that stuff up so let's get
rid of this and I'm gonna comment you
guys out right here all right yeah so
that's the only thing we added so the
headers we also want to change so I'm
gonna say up here I'm gonna go slower to
make sure each part we change works so
the headers were setting as JSON for
this and for this one it needs to know
what to form data so I'll copy this and
put that here so Const headers and we're
gonna say accept everything and you know
what we'll keep that for there for now
and we're gonna pass the headers in here
so the reason why I'm moving headers up
here so we can actually set this and
we're also going to set this body
serializable body so they're stringify
yet here we're stringing or finding it
here we can get rid of that we're just
gonna say headers content type is equal
to application not JSON so the reason
why I got rid of it here is we're going
to use this serializable body and if it
doesn't have a file we're gonna add the
content type as JSON otherwise we're not
and re-rate using headers above are we
using headers oh passed in headers
alright let's use my headers my headers
and headers is equal to my headers my
headers and we need to reinforce that
from low - so import has from low -
slash has that and let's see where we
are now we just need to verify this guy
so we're setting the body variable so
instead of that I'm going to say Const
and we don't say Con so we're gonna just
reinitialize our serialize body it's now
equal to form data and when I say she
realized body serialize body there so
instead of it being this JSON body so
we're keeping this error message let's
see if that works
okay cool that it's working for us now
so then if we get a file it's no longer
gonna be JSON it is now gonna be form
data otherwise everything works as usual
so that is it for this video guys sorry
for the complexity but uploading images
and files with graph QL is currently not
super simple so yeah that's it for this
video guys and the next one what we'll
do is set up our back-end and support
sending this file over and changing
stuff in our database saving the file
and all kinds of fun stuff so thank you
for watching and as always I'll push
this code up on github if you want to
check it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
