working in the last video we were able
to send an email and password and get
back a JWT token and in this video what
we're going to do is a couple things the
first is refactor some code it's always
a good idea when you're creating a
project to go back and fix some things
when you realize how they're gonna work
a little differently than you might
think and clean up your codes so it's
easy and it scales well and then we're
also going to handle errors when I put a
bad email and a bad password so let's
get started
the first thing I want to fix is my es
lint so you may have noticed in your
code and in mine where you have I have
an error here that says parsing error
and these aren't real errors right I've
been kind of ignoring them thus far but
it's a good idea to go ahead and cover
these so I'd like to thank some of the
people that have commented on how to fix
this and some of the other areas and
belt to talk about so to fix this guy
what we need to do is use a different
parser so on our yes lint file here we
were using music this is our setting we
can actually specify a different parser
and the parser we want to use is babel
es lint and then we also want to say set
the environment and we're going to use
the browser environment and now because
we're using the babel es lint parser we
need to go ahead and install that don't
miss a yarn ad dev babble es lint and
then I'm gonna give this guy save and
then we should see this ere go away and
see basically our es lint will work with
a higher accuracy now so can you go
ahead and give that a save and now we
can see the errors are in different
places so here are some areas I'm
getting we're just gonna go file by file
real quick and fix these errors so the
first is I'm missing prop types now prop
tights are good to add but personally I
don't like spending the time to create
them so I like to just ignore this rule
so I'm gonna come over here
and this is a rule I'm gonna get rid of
oops come back over here I didn't copy
it oh the little Visual Studio code
window always closes on me okay
so we just turned off this rule and now
we don't see it anymore I'm gonna have
to worry about that here it looks like
we just need to add curly brace and when
I save prettier should fix a lot of
these problems and we notice how it
brings it down a new line and we don't
see any other errors in this file now
I'm gonna head over to log in the same
problem here we just need to add a
parenthesis around here and that's good
our home looks like it's good here
index is good log in register we just
fixed our index here is good and
register service worker this has a lot
of problems what I recommend for this is
just disabling it because we didn't
actually write this code so we saved
this there's a couple values here that
have no idea where they're coming from
so I'm gonna just say you cellent
disabled because I don't really want to
worry about it I don't want to see the
errors now if you want to what you can
do is to your package JSON you can add a
linting script so I can cover here and
say lint and say lint source
so now what I can do is I can say yarn
run lint and what this will do is it'll
lint the code lint command not found
oops yes lint and so we can see any of
the errors we have in our source code so
we have two problems and our only
problems are console log statements so
I'm not gonna worry about them burn a
good place with this now but you can run
it from the command line
or you can just do it as your coding
fixham kind of like how it was doing
okay so that air is all good the next
thing I want to go over is a prop just
not exist air prom but a nice little
optimization we can make on the server
so you guys doing this last time when we
were doing the login or not the login
this is the register page this register
mutation we had to check the password up
front and the reason for that was we're
actually going to we couldn't just add
validation to our password because her
password what we're storing is the hash
so it wouldn't work but there's a way to
get around this so over here sequel eyes
has hooks that can run so really we want
to run after validation and we want to
just set the password to a hash password
or do it after after create or before
create either one
well actually want to do it before
create write because we want it to come
in before we actually create the object
but I'm gonna try this after validate
and see how that works so here I'm gonna
add this to my object and yeah paste it
in there so here we don't have a before
validate just an after validate that
we're going to use and this is going to
be user and we're just gonna set user
duck password and we're gonna hash it
and right here you're gonna call make
this an async function because we need
to await the response and we're just
gonna copy what we did over here so copy
paste and I'm gonna import bcrypt up
here and port bcrypt from bcrypt
and i misspelled it there and this is
gonna be user duck password we're
getting a little insolent warning
because it doesn't want us to reassign
it they're reassigning and there is
example here I'm not sure if they can do
a return value they're doing it here as
well actually I think I'm just gonna use
the before hook because I really want to
just return the object like this well
we're setting in the password here as
well I'm guessing the return value is
going to be the user we're going to do a
little test here I'm just gonna say
return dot dot dot user and then
password is going to be equal to hashed
password
and we're gonna say Const hash password
there you go so we'll hash it and all
that it here so now in our user over
here I don't have to hash it and I don't
have to I can just literally plug in my
args here you can call us args and we
don't have to do this little check right
here so I'm gonna move that error but
not that error but this validation here
so now I'm gonna say type string and I'm
gonna say validate add it in here and
I'm gonna just copy the length one and
we said what we say we want five and a
hundred and we can steal our message the
password needs between five and a
hundred characters long so the password
five and a hundred characters long so
now that we have that there we can get
rid of this so clean up our code a
little bit and we don't have to write as
much and it looks like we forgot to pass
in the secret as well this is something
I didn't notice actually until right now
oops here are this so we are using try
login and we are passing secret to is
undefined so that's that's a pretty bad
error actually so secret to what you're
grabbing here or passing into our
refresh secret so it's good thing we fix
that right there it would still work
because it would just use undefined as
the secret but cool so that's fixed now
let's give this a whirl and see if this
works when creating a user if this
validation works so I'm gonna come over
here just a graphical and I'm gonna call
a mutation create user which is the
register and user name email and a
password and I want to see if it's okay
and what errors we get so ID or path and
message and then we're gonna just check
the database and make sure if this works
okay so this looks like it worked okay
we're gonna check the database and make
sure it actually hashed correctly so I'm
gonna connect to slack and select all
from users and it did not work at all
because password is not hashed so I'm
gonna guess come back up here cord we
said oh we fit right here
I'm guessing we have to actually mutate
this object so I'm gonna say user dot
password is equal to a hash password and
we don't have to worry about a return
state whoops I'm just gonna comment this
out for now now if this works this tells
us we have to mutate this so we can just
ignore this I'm air so I'm gonna create
another guy pass her to worked okay
let's check our database we noticed this
is gets hashed correctly so this is the
correct way to do it and I'm just gonna
say yes lint disabled next line I don't
know if we space or not we can also
specify which which one we want so we
want the nope Ram reassign we're just
going to ignore that
so we're gonna ignore that you slant
rule cuz we need to do it this way for
house equalized works alright and I just
want to make sure our password hook
works or our validation works so if I
you did a too short of a password we
still get an air there so now in my
front end here I just want to make sure
it also works which it should
automatically work for us so our
password is too short here's our email
here's our guy right there invalid email
let's do a column I suppose so good
password we need to have it a good link
and bam now it works alright so that was
the second problem we fixed there's one
other thing on re factor and that's how
I did this form here so with semantic UI
there are form fields that didn't
realize so that just makes it space
really nicely so let's use those so this
is gonna change our login and our
register so all we're gonna do is import
form here and then we're gonna wrap this
whole thing in a form and then we wrap
each input with a form field and it just
spaces it real nicely so I'm going to
say form field and I'm gonna copy that
we're gonna paste it we're gonna paste
it close paste it here close it off
and I don't think we have to do it for
the button but I'll double-check nope
they don't put it around the button so
we save that and we can take a look how
it looks here I'm expecting yep we get
some nice spacing in our form now and
I'm gonna just do the same thing for our
login as well
so login form and form form field and
let's look at that and cool looks nice
so next let's handle the ears so kind of
how we have it here and there's also one
other thing I wanted to actually
refactor real quick as well I forgot
about that so notice how I'm doing that
triple boolean check here to see if
there's any errors but we're actually
already doing that up here and pushing
on to a list so what we can check if
there's any errors in this error list
which is a faster check so errors list
dot length so if the length is not zero
then we display the message otherwise we
display no so just to show this does
work we can come back over here to the
register hit submit and oh errors they
spelled wrong
no I spelled it right okay I was
expecting this to work heirs list dot
length we show the message otherwise we
don't so stuff is read here I wonder if
I got air in the console nope so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna console.log
this console dot log error list to see
what the length of it is I would have
expected this to have a length of three
and therefore evaluate to true and show
the first boolean expression and sure
enough we get three years I can say not
equal to zero to be explicit and I'm on
the register form I have no idea why
this is rendering null or maybe it's cuz
it's I'm maybe it's the form maybe it's
because it's in a form now I'm gonna
take it out it might not be actually
that it's my yeah okay so it's actually
just form field so that was the problem
wasn't with this boolean check here I
was gonna say I was very surprised at
the boolean check resulted to false or
not true and I'm gonna refresh this it
submit we still see it now you notice
these look a little faded here and the
reason for that is we just need to add
air on to the form field itself
so now I believe it should we're gonna
test it on the password see how the
passwords all read we just need to move
the error on to the form field itself so
add up there and also for our guy here
alright so give it a save and now when
we submit we should see triple right
here and we do we see our message
perfect so that's looking nice now we're
going to do the same thing on our login
page so the way we did it is got the
response and just looped over the areas
so I'm gonna copy this and we're gonna
head over to our login so in our submit
here we're already checking we also want
to get the errors object from this guy
so we can delete this so if we're okay
we're going to store this in token and
refresh token and then we're gonna
redirect to the home page otherwise
we'll say there is some kind of error
that occurred so let's bring this the
next line space this out okay so there's
some kind of error occurred so we're
gonna loop through the heirs we're gonna
put the air into an error object and
then instead of setting this dot state
to air I'm just gonna add a errors which
is a just an object of errors that we
have and I'm gonna say this dot errors
is equal to error and maybe we have to
do an object spread so it's not copying
it I'm actually not quite sure but let's
see if this assignment does work so what
we can do is then down here we can say
form filled air
is equal to
this dot airs email right now instead of
putting it here we already have this
getting deconstructed so we can say airs
email password so air is equal to email
ooh email here so really we should call
this email air so I'm gonna do that so
this will be email air and password air
and it was actually already called email
air and password area I'll show you guys
oh this this also has two things right I
forgot how we ever doing this before now
I remember
so air is gonna have two things it's
gonna be like called email air and it's
gonna have a message in it so email air
we have to check so really email air is
an object of its own well no it's not
email air yep is a string so we're going
to convert that to a boolean and we need
to convert it down to a boolean here so
air password air
all right and well it's not console.log
the response twice because I'm ready
doing it here and then just like we were
doing it below let's create a errors
list but actually we don't even need to
make an airless because we can check if
there's an error well no we should still
just create an errors list with the
email and password error so I'm going to
copy this and we don't have a user name
so we can ignore that and then we're
gonna copy this message because it's
gonna be the same thing and we're gonna
put it below our form and we're gonna
import message from semantic UI okay so
now when we submit we're gonna loop
through each err
we're gonna put it in the air object
calling it email air or password air and
we're grabbing the message and storing
that too and then we're setting this tie
airs object to the air so now we're
storing it in there so when we expand
and get the airs here we should actually
get a string instead of undefined and so
we add it to our object and then here we
check whether there's exists to show a
red field or not and then down here
we're checking the length if there's any
errors and we're showing the air is down
below so if I hit submit we should see a
problem we get the wrong email so I put
a blank email so this looks like it
worked correctly now I'm gonna try
putting a correct email which I actually
don't remember what the correct email is
so I'm gonna come open this in our tab
here's the list of all our emails here
so let's try Bob at gmail.com oops
so now we get a wrong password excellent
and we can I actually only remember the
password for this guy so let's use this
thing that we created right here
and okay let's just create a new one
real quick so the week hope username
needs to be unique all right so we
created this random user real and I'm
gonna copy the email and so if I hit
submit we get it wrong password good and
now I pass it the password looks like it
works good and if we come over here we
see the token is still there so
everything works nicely so I think we
are good for our login page right now we
are setting the tokens which we're going
to use and we are covering all our bases
with any kind of air that happens we're
just playing it to the user so they know
what's going on now like I said in the
other video you don't have to tell them
that they put a wrong email you could
just say there was an invalid submission
but either way it works whatever you
prefer kind of how much information you
want to tell your user about what they
did wrong okay so what I'm thinking in
the next video is we can start actually
getting to the fun start the fun stuff
of slack and start building out some of
the features and then once we start
adding the features creating teams being
able to chat that sort of thing we're
gonna have come back to authentication
and these tokens because whenever we
make a request to create a team to
create a channel any of that we're gonna
be passing these tokens to our server to
authenticate so that's coming up in the
future thanks for watching guys and
thank you to everyone who has commented
and seen some improvement that we can
make on the project and I encourage you
if you see anything you think can that
can
improved please leave a comment below
I'd love to fix this guy up refactor
some code and make it better and that
this code will be up on github thanks
for watching guys I'll see you in the
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
