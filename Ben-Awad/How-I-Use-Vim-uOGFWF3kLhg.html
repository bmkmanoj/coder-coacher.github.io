most common keystrokes or shortcuts that
I used and them to help me just kind of
fly around the keyboard and code quickly
and jump to different portions and
whatnot so there's a lot of different
shortcuts and things in them
there's tons so I'm going to show you
basically the most used ones that I use
and I have this screen software
screencasting software right here so as
you can see as I'm typing real big you
can see the letters I'm typing to whip
around so it makes sense so the first
thing that I use that helps a lot is
when you're in insert mode you push I in
insert mode to get out of it
default is xscape but I like to remap
that to JK so if I'm in I'm typing or
whatever I just had JK and I'm back out
and I can undo that with you and real
quick this is how I remap my dak so any
time I hit JK it escapes automatically
for me okay so the next thing is I use a
lot is a this is just to basically pop
you into insert mode and then the next
letter over so let's say I want to also
hey I don't use as much something I use
more is capital a which drops you an
insert mode at the end of the line so
let's say for example I forgot to add a
semicolon I'll do capital a to pop an
insert mode at the end of line I'll type
the semicolon
I'll JK get out of insert mode and then
I'll hit 0 and 0 pops me back to the
beginning of the list that's what you
just saw me do so it real fast I can
show you just doing that so I basically
take all these things and do it really
quickly or like May I want to change
this you know I pop into insert mode
just a letter over so 8th and eyes how
usually get into insert mode there's
also I believe now he is something
different I forgot about what
he does but a and I is kind of hop into
insert mode and then zero is right you
to hop to the front of the line
very handy so if I'm you know in the
middle here also you're seeing me do W a
W and B so to move around the code what
I'll usually do is I'll have zero hit
the front of the word if I want to go
further into the code on the same line
I'll hit W and W skips to the next word
so www I'm skipping words B is to go to
backwards so that's how you see me like
go just like go through the like that
was me spamming W you can see me just
quickly go through a line and that's
doing W and if you do capital W you go a
little faster skipping some of the like
periods and stuff another one I'll use
is o capital o and lowercase O so Oh
drop cyou in a new line in insert mode
kappa drops above so let's say i want to
add a new parameter right here to this
object just do bob a right and then
here's me doing capital o to pop above
iranian insert mode as you can see here
so I can type Bob - I can type whatever
you want there so hopping in and out of
insert mode a line above and below you
just saw me delete those so you undoes
what I just did so I just undid that
delete shift V highlights these all so I
have it highlighted I can highlight as
much as I want taking up and down with
JK it's normal navigation and I'll hit D
to delete that another thing I'll do to
navigate around the page is G so capital
or not capital GG takes you to the top
you see how my cursor is at the top
capital G takes you to the very bottom
of the file so you can see me hop around
that way also see how this is a code
block right here this is another code
block I can do
what is this key curly brace
I hit curly brace to hop so left curly
base heal up right curly brace to go
down a code block so that's me going
around code blocks I can go up down in
the middle to move around and of course
there's also just searching with the
slash um that I use a lot I talked about
W already moving if I want to go to
whine and let's say I want to go to
local storage one way to do it is to
just double you all the way over right
that was me W in I can also just type L
which moves me one at a time another way
is T or F so T stands for 2 and you just
say what you want to move to so if I
want to move to the letter L it'll try
to find the first L in here and go to it
so I type at E and I say which letter
I'd like to go to I'd like to go to the
letter L and you can see my cursor jumps
right before it you notice I just hit 0
and W that's a common one I'll do so if
I want to bring my cursor back to here
I'll hit 0 it come back here W to
reposition so you'll see me do that real
fast
BAM and it'll be at the front but if you
hit F instead of T they'll actually take
you right on it I accidentally hit L or
a hit L and then he saw me hit semicolon
semicolon actually takes you to the next
search so I found the first L I hit it
again that you know go to the next you
find the next L so for example let's see
is there less a couple O's in here yeah
so I'm gonna find an O with pushing yeah
and I do semicolon to find more O's so
it's the fast way to traverse through
the line itself and then of course
there's actually changing stuff so let's
say I don't want to I don't want this to
be rec I wanted to be call it next or
something you can change this with CW
which will change a word so you notice
how we would get rid of the word rec
here up to the period o it so that
changes a word we can type pop-out pack
pop back out with JK of course and a lot
of times
it's not just a word I want to change it
to the rest of the thing so let's say
here I'd like to kill the rest of this
line and pop into insert mode capital C
gets rid of a lot stuff and I could type
hi instead if I want I'm gonna hit you
to undo that because I don't want to do
that if I don't want to go into insert
mode I can do capital D for delete a lot
the thing I'll use a lot is double D so
you so I'm gonna type DD that gets rid
of a whole line also DW is what I use a
lot so that kills a single word so you
might see me just destroy that line but
there that was a combination of
destroying the whole line with D popping
oops let's do it again
so just destroy the whole line put a to
pop over one and then put some icon to
finish it off pasting so after I delete
this I can we need to lead something
it's saved to your clipboard
or the vim clipboard anyway and you can
hit P to paste it in put it back paste
I can also you know copy blocks so you
saw me just hit shift V so I just
escaped out shift V all right hit B but
that doesn't I don't think that does
anything but uppercase v basically
highlights the whole line you see me
highlight the whole line as I go down I
can go up or down then I can hit Y to
copy it and then P to paste it so I use
that a lot and then what else do I use
oh yeah indentions so if I want to
indent this over where I'll usually do
is I'll highlight it and hit the double
greater-than or a little less than so
you saw the left one brings it over to
left right one bring it over to the
right and I can do as many times as I
want back and forth
another one I use this one I use less
often because it's more of it's not
really for editing see how my cursor is
right here and I kind of want to see
more of the screen I'll hit double Z and
I'll reposition my cursor in the middle
of the screen so that's really handy and
that's most everything I use so that you
just saw me tell you like a ton of
commands that I use but this is actually
just scratching the surface of what them
canyou can really do and using all these
in conjunction is how you see me
basically editing code really quickly
but I would say just a recap of the ones
that I use the most
so getting around the screen G G so
capital D and G and double G's to hop
around and then to go up and down I will
use curly braces to easily flip through
the code so that's if I want to go
vertical write a G or lowercase G the
other way to navigate through code is to
do the line usually I'll hit W to go
through the line or I'll hit capital a
to go to the end or I'll hit W or 0 to
come to the front so that combination
and B to go backwards in the line or
I'll use T to hop to that curly brace or
parentheses right here
those are moving in between the line and
then to change stuff of course using C
top into change mode that one's that
kind gives you an idea how I navigate
and how I change stuff so I hope that
helps there's a lot to do with then if
you've never tried them before I would
highly recommend just going to your
terminal and then do vim tutor I believe
is what it's called and I'll take you
through a tutorial to learn the very
basics that's how I started and now I
use it pretty much for everything now
I'm not using them itself I'm using
visible Visual Studio code but I am just
losing the vim key bindings I pretty
much can't use
an editor now I actually can't use the
mouse to code anymore it feels really
bad I'm always just on the keyboard
pressing buttons hopping around changing
stuff renaming that way so it takes a
while to get used to but once you get
used to it you'll notice you'll be a lot
faster of a programmer then if you use
the mouse so personally I think it's
definitely worth the time investment
especially if you're coding a lot so
that's it for this video guys I hope you
found it interesting how I do them let
me know if you have any cool them tricks
below I always love learning about them
or what do you guys use commonly
anything I can you think I can do to
improve my vim workflow I'd love to know
so thanks for watching guys I'll see you
in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
