about in Drock what it is and why you
might want to be using it so I'm on the
home page right here and this little
picture right here is exactly why we
want to use it but this might not make
any sense so I'm going to try to explain
it and I'm going to show you example why
it's super cool because super helpful
it's great for hackathons or quick demos
because what it does is it actually lets
anyone in the world access your local
website basically so what we're going to
do is we're going to just like run a
server and it's going to have for
example be on localhost 3000 or
something
and then let's say we want our mom who's
on the other side of the world she wants
to access it and take a look at the
website you built well you can use in
grok to show her so she could view it
and you could just see what you've been
working on or if you're at a hackathon
you can open up your localhost let
anyone view it so that's what this is
and specifically what Web pokes is going
on and that's why I want to talk about
Angra this can be used to test
ooofff so if you want to do for example
do a facebook login a great tool to help
test with that is in grok so I highly
recommend installing this and
downloading it they have for all systems
get set up because if you're going to do
any type of development it's super
helpful
you can demo this to clients and it's
good for development when we start using
a videos going to be coming out shortly
about doing OAuth with Facebook and
graft you oh and we're going to use Inga
rock and actually use this guy and help
us develop so without further ado let's
just jump into an example so I have my
graph QL server here to turn on NPM
start to boot this guy up now if I want
to like you know run some queries on
this
I could go to localhost 3000 slash grad
school and you know I could run some
stuff right
I could just be like either boards owner
one and again MP erasure now let's say
like I said I want to give I want anyone
to be able to look at this website that
I have and check it out that's what
we're going to use in gerak 4 so in
another tab what I can do is when you
have in grok installed alright when you
have Inga Rock installed so I have the
server up running in one tab and I'm
opening up another tab I can say in grok
HUP and 3000 so 3,000 being the port and
when I run that we get this black little
thing and then we get this forwarding
URL right here and if we clued to this
URL here we might we're not going to see
anything here but if we're to slash
graphical hey this looks a lot like that
website that we have here and if we run
this then we get user boards I mean it
would be cool if this ship's data maybe
if I can get this to its second owner
has something no anyway I don't know I
don't know what why I don't have any
data but anyway
notice how I'm able to access graphical
and actually run stuff and the cool
thing is that if we come over here it's
running it right we're doing select
queries here you can see it being run
even though this is a URL anyone can go
to tell your friend they come check out
this link now you're going to watch this
video after its recorded so this I'm
going to take down and rock so that's
the other cool thing about integral if I
control C it's gone this URL is no
longer public you can't access it but
for as long as this you know I have it
running anyone can come access this link
and you can create a link and have
anyone access it so it's super cool and
this it's not limited to graph QL
servers I could run any server run out
any port and have an grok open up that
port doing HTTP and then the Weber port
number and
have it run that check it out and you'll
notice over here it will additionally
tell you all the connections that are
happening because you can track who is
actually connected to your and rock
because as we connected to graphical and
then we're drains a post request and
stuff yeah that's in grok in action
so just to show you guys the control
seed killed egg rock try to refresh a
tunnel was not found it's gone so I
can't access anymore so it's a nice cool
little short thing it's good for demos
if you have a client that wants to check
out your you know your building on web
at forums is a great way to just put it
out there so your client can test it
it's still private and also it's great
for like I said oh I will be using this
shortly with that and I'll show you how
that works so that's it for this video
guys I just wanted to give an
introduction to Angra and why it's so
cool I actually like using it a lot
because as you saw that was super fast
to get a website like up and running
right like it took me literally one one
command to run this was no configuration
at all I added and set up an email and
set up a password nothing it's really
cool
highly recommend checking out and grok
so yep that's it for this video guys
I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
