quick little video we're going to add a
component to the top here and a little
header that lets us go back after we
have sold out or not fill out our form
but we clicked in here we're like oh I
don't really want to fill out this form
anymore I want to get back to the main
screen
I'd like to click the back button so
let's add that so the way we're going to
do that is by creating a header like
this so we're going to use the header
component from native base and we're
actually just going to straight-up copy
your example like usual and then modify
it to the way we want to do it so we
don't need to look at sagas let me look
at that don't you look at that and let
me look at that so the file that we're
going to be working with today is the
view auctions you should know if you
actions this will be the auction forum
page and it'll go right at the top here
on before our auction forum
you know let's tab it all over want to
have too much and let's get header get
left button icon anything else can port
I guess body and title this is using a
lot of stuff and it's really tabbed over
weird there you know no fun transparent
arrow back is expecting double quotes
for me okay can move that guy over it
was that guy over and actually we don't
need that so we don't need a right side
and okay let's see how that looks
so click on that alright so this is a
nice little button here this header is
not centered I wonder if there's a way
to center title their title here
what doesn't even have a title component
so now to the title work I wonder if I
create a right and don't put anything in
it if that's ok this is not great design
I don't know why native base does it
like that you think would be a better
way to Center the header huh that
actually works to it just need something
on the right side too so I guess oops
for a header you can say yeah sure to
say submit auction create ad auction
your ad auction is what people usually
say and now we come at once to when we
click on the button though we want to
take us back to the this page right here
so we click the ad we'd like to click
have a take us back so to do that I'm
just going to use our router library so
import actions and I click leave of
capital
from react native router books and then
on press for a button here so when it's
pressed we'd like to do change pages
back to the view auctions and there are
so refresh that now when I click here
click back take this back to the home
page all right very nice there are
buttons to filter okay nice the app is
really coming together okay so that's
all we needed for this video I'm
actually not sure what I want to do next
I'm going to look through the app look
at what are all the requirements I set
for this what I wanted to do because
this is getting pretty close to complete
we actually there's actually a crucial
part we haven't done that's bidding it's
actually two crucial parts I'm
forgetting that I just remembered so I
should be able to like click on one of
these cards and should take me to an
individual bid page and then also I
should be able to bid on these series
update real time so we'll do one of
those two things in the next video so
I'll see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
