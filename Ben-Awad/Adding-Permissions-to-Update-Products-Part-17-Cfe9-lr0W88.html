update product mutation so the last
thing we needed to do was make sure only
the seller of the product is updating it
so want to show you guys right now how
this is exploitable because we don't
have this check and then we're going to
add it and show you it's no longer be
able to just edit anyone else's product
so right now let's hop over to the graph
QL playground and first I want to just
fetch the products and I can't right now
that's because I'm not logged in right I
have no HTTP headers so to be able to do
that I need to just add create a user
basically right now fresh user and we're
not checking any fields for email
password names so I can just make it one
character short create this have my
token so now I can be logged in like
this we can say authorization and I can
say Bayer and then put a space and then
paste in the token and then you're good
so now I can access products pass an ID
so and let's also grab the name so I
definitely didn't create this product
right because I just created my user so
let's change the name of this so I'm
gonna type a mutation and we're just
going to say a big product ID and then
the name is now gonna be new sali
and let's say you want to get ID from
this now I noticed a little bug in our
mutation also so when we run this we get
an error and we're not getting the air
because we're not the seller being an
error for a different reason and the
reason is because we're passing null to
the price in the picture URL when you
cannot pass a null to the product we
don't we only want to pass in these guys
if they're not null so the way we're
gonna do this is by creating a object up
here called data and then we're going to
be adding fields to it and passing data
into here now I only want to add the
field if it actually has a value so to
know that I'm just going to check if
name and then add it in so here I'm
gonna say data dot name is equal to name
and we're gonna get a little air because
typescript doesn't like you just adding
properties like that so I'm gonna create
a interface up here so interface product
data and add some optional fields the
name which is a string the price which
is a double or starting out a double
eight number and then finally picture
URL which is the string
so now we can assign this this type here
product data and it's happy with us
again so now we can have this if
statement here so instead of saying just
setting a picture URL we can say data
that picture URL and then we can also
check the price and we can say data
price is equal to price all right so now
we're good and that should get rid of
that initial air alright so we see it's
been updated and let's grab the products
now ID name all right we see new Sally
so I was able to change that which is
bad so I'm gonna bring this back and now
we're gonna call its app new Sally too
but I'm going to wait and run this after
we make this check so this is what's
gonna prevent that from happening so
what was the problem before is we were
not able to get the seller ID with the
product and so we have to tell we have
to tell Prisma that we want the seller
because it doesn't add it automatically
and the way we tell it is through this
info which is this last parameter here
notice how we can either just pass an
info from graph QL which is this graph
kill resolve info which is this thing or
in this case we don't want to resolve
what this is we want a custom thing we
can also pass a string so here I can
actually this is like me querying the
product in graph QL so here I could
specify I would like the ID back or I
would like to picture URL back I can
select whatever fields I want so the
field I want is the seller field and
from that field I want the ID
so it's just like you're selecting a
graph QL field here as you pass in so
that tells it what it wants and now
we're good so now we check whether the
seller ID is equal to the product ID and
if they're not we say not authorized so
no air is here now let's go ahead and
run this and bam we get not authorized
now perfect so we're no longer you're
letting people just change other
people's products on the back end which
is really good so let's make sure it
still works on the front end so let's
just refresh that guy so let's edit a
sure and call him a sure - and cool so I
am the owner of after and I was able to
still update him so we didn't break any
functionality all right so there's two
or three other things I want to add to
this app before finishing and wrapping
it up the first is a search bar and some
filtering options that way we can kind
of see how we can do those things in
Prisma the next thing is being able to
grab all the products so right now our
pocket list is really short but it could
be long in that case I want to add
pagination and infinite loading and then
the last thing is with subscriptions and
being able to like click on the things
and almost like a bidding system so
that's what's coming up what I want to
do in this video or the rest of this
video is just get set up what I want to
do next which is that search bar and
maybe add some buttons so we're gonna
head over here to products and get
started with that so I'm just gonna add
it to the top and we have a button here
and we can just put it right underneath
so I'm going to create a new view for
this and I'm going to create or add a
text field and we may end up moving this
to its own component later but for now
I'm gonna add him here and let's go
ahead and import that from our
components so import text field from dot
dot dot components and unable to resolve
Oh slash text field okay and then
underneath that I'm just going to have
and maybe we add a placeholder search
and under that we're gonna have a view
and this view I guess we can have three
buttons these are gonna be like
filtering buttons so title and so when I
click on these buttons and we can add a
dummy on press maybe I want to search by
alphabetically so by the name or maybe I
want to filter by the price and is there
any other way we want to filter these by
I think those are really the only two
fields here but this will give you an
IDE idea how to do it doesn't really
make sense to filter by these all right
so that's good I'll save and see what
this looks like
I want these two to be okay so we have
our text field I don't see search
showing up I wonder if we are not able
to pass in placeholders I'll double
check and then I want these two to be in
the same column so I'm gonna add a style
here I'm sorry in the same row and I'll
go ahead and up here and create one so
we'll say filter row or this is not
really filtering this is really sorting
I should say sort so sort row and we're
just going to flex it as a row all right
so styles dot sort row okay and I want
to Center those or I really should just
put Flex one on the button
so we'll say sort button flex one
because I want them to just basically
take half the screen each oops I just
messed that up
there we go and then down here let's
have the style so styles dot and then
sort button and then add it here as well
and then I think we'll be good and I
want to check on the text field and make
sure it doesn't look like it's expanding
how I wanted it to
let's double check on the placeholder
real quick too so I think we're just not
passing extra props to this ok the
placeholder is whatever we use as the
name so let's name that to search ok
cool so that pops up there maybe we add
some padding or something to that so it
has some room so the style will say
styles that search bar search bar
and I'm just gonna say padding of I
don't know 10 and that did nothing let's
try margin that did nothing - I don't
know why that didn't work I'm guessing
because we're not passing it in yep
so Stiles thought field all right so
there's some automatic Stiles we're
already passing in so really I want to
join the two together that's one way to
do it I think I'm to simplify this that
way we don't overwrite any and break any
styles we have I'm just gonna wrap it
with a view okay and cool so that
brought the search bar down a little bit
that's better I don't know why these
guys are not just flexing all the way
out
let's check the background colors and
just see so I think sort row just might
not be oh I think actually I just need
to tell this to flex nope that didn't
work so let's set background color to
pink and so we can kind of see where
it's laying out I think it's just not
okay so that's what I wanted it to do so
I want these two to take equal space and
I'm telling them to flex one let's also
say a line item Center and justify I
think it's justify content justify
content
sir there we go that looks better I kind
of led these right here but I'll settle
for this flex didn't seem to do anything
and we can get rid of pink okay so what
we'll do in the next video is get the
name and price button working so it
filters by that and then also we can
search I don't know I want to search for
a sure or whatever else so that's it for
this video guys thanks for watching
