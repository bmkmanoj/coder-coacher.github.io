form in the last video and now the next
step is once we create a user we'd like
to be able to log in so we're gonna be
creating the login form today now we use
just local state and doing set state to
kind of update the state for register we
kept it here and as the user typed and
as we got errors we called set state to
change things and that's how we
basically built this whole component and
now we could do this the exact same way
for our login component as well we could
use it but I thought it'd be more
interesting if we change it up and we
have one component using this and
different command it doing in a
different way so you can kind of compare
we can see performance wise which one is
doing better and kind of just give you
like a little comparison of between the
two so we're gonna be creating a login
component today let's call it login j/s
and for this login component we are
gonna be using mob X so this is a
basically alternative to using redux it
is a state manager and we're gonna use
it to basically store the state of our
login form so we're gonna be using
installing the mob X package and also
mob X react this is what allows us to
actually use react components so I'm
gonna come over here and say yarn AdMob
X and Maul back react and install the
two libraries and then we can dive right
into this so I'm an import react from
react and then we're gonna be importing
observable from oops not observable
observes observer from mob X
who's our mob ex react and then
importing extend observable observable
from mob X so we're going to export
default a class here and the class is
gonna be an observer and we're gonna say
class and we call it login extends react
component and then we create a regular
component here but we're gonna have a
constructor where we kind of just
initialize the state and here instead of
saying for example this dot state we're
gonna say extend observable passing in
this and then whatever state we want to
use so for this we're gonna have not a
username but a email and a password and
the default state for those are just
empty strings so you see me just doing
empty strings there okay so then here
for in a return and we would like to do
a form kind of similar to register so I
can come over here and I can copy this
if I want to and we will change kind of
what the inside of it looks like and I'm
gonna copy this so for now we're not
going to worry about any messages some
beer of that but the rest of it we're
gonna use so don't worry about errors
it's gonna be a login page we don't need
the username value so instead of email
it's gonna be this email and what I can
do is I can say Const email
and password or equal to this so you'll
notice we'll be doing and the other one
we did something that looked like this
instead our state is just stored in the
this object so we can grab it like this
so our input here we're gonna keep the
name email because in our on change
function we're gonna use that still the
value is gonna get email which we get
from here placeholder email is good and
then for our password same business this
is gonna be the password we get here now
we still want the type password and then
for our button worried about creating a
message later and then our on submit so
let's create our on changed in our on
submit so on change is going to be an
event
and what we're gonna do is change the
value in our state right so when on
change is given to us we know that which
one we want to change email or password
based on the name and the cool thing
about mob ex is you pretty much just set
the new value you don't have to do
anything functional or return new value
you can just mutate the state so I can
just say email is equal to Bob and it'll
just work I don't need to do anything
else but we want to make this work for
both inputs so what we're gonna be doing
is grabbing similar to last time the
name and value from e dot target and
then we're gonna set this and we're
going to grab the name is equal to the
value and then for our cement all we
have to do I think I call it on submit
yep on submit and we will just be empty
well console dot log this dot we can
grab the email and password and see what
the values are to make sure they're
actually getting updated so email and
password
all right so okay cool I already have
this up and running the server so I
don't need to start it up we can go
check out our log in component and see
in action so I'm gonna come over here to
this index page and just add a route so
we can actually see the component so I'm
gonna do a slash login
and let's go check this guy out
okay no airs load our login component
and we see email password I type it
letters I can see them take them here
hit submit and we see this here so we
made the exact same form using mob x but
it looks a lot different right or at
least it doesn't look a ton different
but you'll notice there's a few key ones
instead of grabbing from the state this
this thing is acting like our state and
we're able to just change the value we
don't have to set a new value so that's
pretty cool and then here's how we set
our initial state and then we just grab
the values and they're automatically
updated for us which is really cool one
other thing I don't think I've talked
about yet you'll notice I write my
functions like this first on submit and
on change but yet my render function is
like this how come I'm not writing on
change e like that well the reason for
that is render and the constructor
automatically have access to this this
object but if I have a function like
this that are not like react doesn't
know about on submit or on change but it
knows about constructor and render
because every react component is pretty
much gonna have one constructor not so
much like you can have it or you don't
have it but it automatically has this
whereas on change does not so if I write
my function like this on change like
I'll show you real quick if I change
this to
that what we're actually gonna get is an
error and it's gonna tell us this is not
defined so let's just console.log this
and we can see what the value of it is
so type and bam we see this big air
actually we're able to see this I'm
surprised I was thinking that this you
would not even be able to see right here
maybe because it is an observable or an
observer that were able to but either
way we still get an error it doesn't
like it so what we need to do is we need
to basically bind this with this so one
way to do it is to say up here is this
dot on change is equal to this down on
change and then pass in oops and call
bind so it binds it with this and now it
has access to it and now we see no error
all good so we're basically giving this
function access to this but the other
way you can do it which I prefer cuz
it's less typing is just to write it out
like this so now we have our function
and it's just like a little lambda
basically so that is it for this video
guys we set up our login component the
next thing I want to do in the video is
in tommorows we're going to actually
connect to our server and submit a login
and then do some authentication on that
side so check whether the email and the
password is correct so the code for this
is up on github and I'll see you guys
tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
