how to set up a feathers the hello world
application using postgres as the
database because i was getting some
errors i'm doing and i know it could be
kind of tricky to set up so i'm going to
walk you through the process the first
thing is to make sure you have terminal
open and just make a folder or create a
go into a folder you want to so i'm just
going to create my app and go into their
my app and then go ahead and do feathers
generate and go ahead and create your
applications and show mine my app
description that's fine that's fine and
give it a postgres sequel database local
and i'm going to let that run and stall
everything and all that stuff so you
need to make sure you have postgres
installed if you don't go ahead and
install that to install that you're just
going to have to do i used homebrew if
you don't Humber is I'll leave a link in
the description below makes things and
selling things super easy so you're
going to want to use that to install
postgres and then once you have postgres
installed you can start it you can start
it using this command and this is for
mac computers i believe PG control and
then /d and then this path and then this
is just a logging debug and then this
will actually start a postgres so i have
mine started so i'm not going to run
this and once you have it started if you
just type in pc cool if you type p
sequel in the command line and hit enter
it'll actually take you to a prompt kind
of like this if you get there you're
Peeta your postgres sequel is started
and everything is configured correctly
you do /a q that'll take you out and
back to the command line so I'm just
going to make sure all right so normally
once
feathers generate is done you can just
do n p.m. start and I'll run right and
it'll work just fine but here's what
happens we get an unhandled rejection
the secret eyes connection database my
app doesn't exist so we have to actually
create this and so if you do p sequel
this will take you to the command line
for postgres sequel and what we can do
is actually create a database and if we
go back to our air we notice our air
shows when you do not have a database
called my app so we just need to create
that database called my app and it
should work so we're going to create
database my app with owner and this is
important make sure you set postgres as
the owner so we created our database so
I just create a database called it my
app and then make sure you set the owner
as postgres because that's the user that
they use now I'm gonna exhale the prompt
come back over here and just do npm
start all right and now our application
starts up I go to localhost 30 30 it's
looking all nice and handy like it
should and that's how you set up
feathers to use postgres in the back end
it super easy you just start up postgres
you start up feathers and then you
create this database table that they
need and that's all so thanks for
watching guys I hope that helped</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
