going to make this real time for these
things populate so let's jump right into
it Celine component will mount we had
this thing we had commented out but we
basically had the framework of how we
wanted it to go so we're listening for
when an oxygen is created which created
we call in action called auction created
we're getting this available to us
through the proxy with connecting with
the Redux store using this connect
keyword we're getting we're getting the
auction created action from our module
our auction module with actions in it so
now we can go there right now and we can
need to actually create that so trying
to do auction created and make an action
auction created and it takes out the
perimeter also create que passou creator
action and now all we need to do is do a
reducer for this and actually what we
want to do is we want to effect this
auctions object we want to update it so
if we go to Redux actions instead of
handle action we're going to handle
actions and i'll show you how this works
well this allows you to do is to listen
for two actions that modify the same
basically prompt so we're going to do
something like this and not create
actions it looks like that though handle
actions handle actions here they are so
notice how you has increment and
decrement okay so this is what going to
do for ours explore const reducer ours
are going to be called actions handle
actions
um we have two actions here first is
receive auctions the second is auction
created so for receive auctions we're
going to do the same thing that we did
above which is to just return and we can
do BAM which is just a return action
payload and if we wanted to we could
just do like this that'll be really nice
alright and then our second one here
recien for auction created now auction
created is going to be slightly more
complicated and also hear you this is
going to be a array as the default value
okay and we don't need this anymore so
our state in this array and each array
element is an auction and action not
payload right now well expand it like
that is a auction that we need to add to
the state and since it's a new auction
that's just created I think it'd be nice
to add it to the beginning of the list
so why don't we do payload comma dog up
thought and we spread the state and that
should be good watch it in action so
refresh and now i'm going to go over
here in postman i'm going to create an
auction and what should happen is we
should see a card above here up here i'm
going to call this raspberry and it
should say raspberry on it i sent and
bam notice immediately houses raspberry
right there so notice how i made a post
request here with postman and then it
changed the server and then right here
it may be updated in real time so that's
really cool so we have multiple users
can be doing this at the same time
creating auctions from their app
and they'll see this just stream of
auctions right there alright cool so
that's all I wanted to do for this video
let's just get this live streaming so
now we have all these auctions just
flowing in whenever someone makes it and
then the next video what I want to do is
I think I want to create work on this
time so right now it should be like
ticking down or it should say it expired
or the auction is over so we can see how
much time is left on the auction so
thank you guys for watching you know see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
