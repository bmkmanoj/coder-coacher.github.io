the slack layout we're gonna add on to
right now we just kind of wrappers for
divs we're gonna actually add some
contents and props to our components so
here's what the code light looks like
for this and we just have a bunch of
styled components right now teams is
just CSS and so is messages and put all
these are just CSS and really what we
want to do is change these so instead of
channels like this I want to say
channels like this and then I want to
pass in props like the team name the
user name and then other stuff like all
these here so it displays like this
because the way I'm going to be saying
this up is container components and view
components or smart and dumb components
so I want this to be a dumb component
where I pass all the props and it
doesn't do any logic so we're gonna have
a team name a user name then we have our
channels and direct messages
so here channels which we're gonna pass
in an array and when you pass this in
really there's multiple things we want
right let's drop this down to a new line
we're gonna be passing in objects with
actually not even their name but you'll
notice these are links right here so you
can see that at the bottom and we're
going to basically craft the link using
the ID of the channel so we're gonna
pass in an ID so of like zero and then
we're also gonna use we should really
use an ID of one and then the name of
the Cannell so maybe this channel is
called general and then usually there is
a random Channel
so random so there is our two channels
and then we also want to pass in our
users and here we also want to pass in
an ID so I give one name slack bot and
another ID to name user one let's say
also eventually we're going to want to
pass in whether the users online or
offline so we can add these little
bubbles but for now this is a good start
we'll get to that later so now in our
channels we want to take these props and
actually make the view that looks like
this
so channels instead of just having this
we're going to say import react from
react and really we're just going to use
this as a wrapper so let's go ahead and
say Kant's channel wrapper is equal this
and then down here we're gonna say
export defaults and we're gonna take
those props and we're going to display
it here so really this is just our
channel wrapper and this is where all
our stuff is gonna go this is our side
panel and then we're gonna take the team
name and our user name channels and
users so these are named channels and
users and we're gonna display them here
so Farrell we're gonna have like a div
here and this is gonna be our team name
and our user name there's really like
three sections to this so if you could
use three divs here you have channels
and then lastly you have users down
below so channels is a it's not just a
you know a strengths we can't do this it
is an array so we have to map through it
and create an
prefer each so I'm gonna go ahead and
create one up here Const channel and
we're gonna map channel on to this guy
so the channel here is gonna take a ID
and a name and then for now let's say
this just has a list item and the key is
gonna be the ID and we'll say channel so
when you're mapping through you always
have to add a key so we'll just how do
the channel here so this is a channel
and we'll just put the name in for now
but this is something for example we
might want to style later and let's make
this an ordered list
all right and now we pretty much want to
do the same thing for our users so this
is gonna be users and then we have a
user up here so we'll copy this for now
I'm gonna use a list item so ID and name
this is gonna be a user and their name
and eventually we're gonna want to make
these links right that they can click on
and so we have our divs and we also want
to hard-code some list items right
because we always know direct messages
and channels that's gonna be there so it
direct messages and then channels and
then for now I'm just going to get this
gray font that they use for everything
and set that as the color so let's grab
the color picker
and grab that gray and we can see what
this looks like so I'm gonna say color
and when I put the color on the div all
these colors in here are gonna change to
that so here's what it looks like
we can kind of see the gist of the
layout coming together that's awesome
and now it'll actually change based on
the props we pass in which is exactly
what we want so I'm not gonna go too
indepe styling this right now we'll get
into styling it more in the next video I
want to work on each component so I also
want to change up the teams so teams is
gonna be very similar to the channels
where we pass in channels we're gonna
pass in teams that's really all we need
to do right we don't really need to do
anything else so this is gonna be an
array and it's really just gonna have an
ID and a name so a name is gonna be and
the name here is not just okay it
doesn't show it here but with this
little side panel they just do initials
like TA or just a T depending on what
your slack name is so we'll pass in
basically the first initial of your
slack
you're slack ID they're not ID put the
name of the team so the name of the team
was Bob we would want to pass in a
capital B here all right and let's do
two of them so an ID of two and name
this is gonna be a Q why not so now in
our teams we're gonna make a team rapper
or react from react and let's use the
same font for now you're not font color
so it's visible we're gonna probably
change this up to be something different
though so export default teams and we
have our little team rapper right here
so team rapper team rapper
and here we're just gonna have basically
a list of teams for now I'll make it a
list so teams dot map team so Const team
given an ID and really this should be an
initial we should call this yeah we'll
call an initial actually will just say
letter that's a better way cuz it's
really just one letter representing the
team so over here instead of name will
pass in letter and here what we're gonna
do is just put a list item and again
we'll do a team passing in the ID and in
the letter and we can see what that
looks like on the side here we got our
be in queue so we're gonna want to make
these clickable just like in slack let's
grab the header and these inputs now and
fix those up so let's see the header
next so header oops
header is really just gonna have the
team name and we could pass in like that
but I prefer just passing it as a prop
this is just gonna have actually it's
not the team name I believe it's the
channel yep announcements so channel
channel name actually we could just put
you know we're not channel name so they
know we're not passing in an object and
here we'll put announcements you know
what I'll just do general because that's
the usual one and actually before we
continue close this off for channels
here notice how we wanted to do a hash
tag in front so let's add that in to our
channels so every channel has a name and
has a hash tag out in front so I do a
string template in there and do a space
and cyclic that there we go so general
and random it doesn't really add this
space very well I think what we might
have to do is to do an actual hash tag
space here yep that looks like more
space okay so let's continue with header
so header here I'm gonna grab this from
import yak from react I'm gonna hide the
header from semantic UI so import
a header from Samantha Qi
aunts header wrapper and we just said
we're gonna pass in the channel name
here so here we're gonna have a wrapper
and then we'll also just show a header
and we can do an h1
I think that might be the default we'll
just have as that and we'll put the
channel name and we'll put a hashtag out
in front and I think that and it was no
space there okay and I think we can
Center this I believe there's an align
property on this text the line will say
Center if not we can just leave it there
that's fine okay nice so your hashtag
dinner'll there and let's do our input
field for this so instead of calling
this input I think I'm gonna call this
send message or you know what actually
yeah let's call it send message because
that makes more sense than calling it
input send and also inputs gonna clash
so send message and really I just want
to say send message and not pass any
props in it's just gonna handle itself
so in poor react from react
and this we're gonna get from semantic
as well I think it was semantic UI react
and we're gonna say Kant's and message
x4 default and no props keep passive end
we're just gonna say send message
wrapper and then we're gonna put our
input that we get from oops put this in
front or input from semantic UI and
we're gonna make this fluid so it spans
we're gonna have to pass more props into
this guy at a later date so this is
controlled but for now we can have stuff
and we are actually definitely gonna
want to put like oops
message hashtag it in the channel name
so as you switch notice this goes to
help back to random so we want ours to
do that too so you could add pass in the
channel name
so placeholder is equal to and again we
want to add that hashtag in so we'll do
a template here channel name okay and
then I'm just gonna add like a margin of
20 pixels that way it's off the edge
here so we're currently not passing in a
channel name so let's do that channel
name and this is gonna be controlled by
the state later but for now we can just
say general alright so this is coming
together we can see how shock general
and actually I think it we say we say
message hashtag so message hashtag okay
so the next thing what I want to do is
kind of just add two styles to each one
of these so we can match and make them
buttons and add hovers and then we're
going to start creating container
classes where we can start actually
making graph QL requests and then
showing the data live here so that is it
for this video we got this set up a
little bit more of the props and stuff
and we're very close to finishing up the
design actually doing some more graph QL
which will be fun so code on this will
be up on github if you want to check any
of it out thank you for watching stay
tuned
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
