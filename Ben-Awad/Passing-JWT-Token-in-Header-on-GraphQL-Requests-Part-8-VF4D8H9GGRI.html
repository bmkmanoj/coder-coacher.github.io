problems that we were having in the last
video and have a clean upload to the
server for our image so the first
problem we were having was for whatever
isn't sure ID was not being imported
properly at least it was coming in
undefined and I tried some different
things out and it turns out for whatever
reason it works if I use the require
syntax so if I say contour ID is equal
to and then just require it like this
I don't know if it has something to do
with because that we're using typescript
here but quire worked for me and now
it's not undefined and so now we can
actually ID these guys and we can get
rid of just hard coding tests so now we
have a unique ID for every single image
that's coming in next thing was we were
hard coding the user ID of that user so
instead of grabbing a token which is
what we want to do so let's do fix this
and I'm just gonna get rid of some
console logs because we don't need those
so this is what we'd like to happen so
to get this to work we need to change
something on our index I J is over here
so there's multiple ways to pass the
token to the server you guys saw one of
the ways that was with if we take a look
at our schema just passing it and as a
argument right for our refresh token but
this can get pretty annoying if you want
to do it for create product and every
single mutation that we add we also pass
a token so there's an alternate way and
this is how Apollo client recommends
doing it so for authentication you can
either do cookies or with us we're going
to be passing an 8 header and this is
how you do it so we're going to be
adding a module called Apollo link
context and what that allows us to do is
use this function called set context
where we can actually add the
authorization header that we need so I'm
gonna install this guy
so yarn add and this is on the client
side that we're adding this package and
we can go ahead and copy it so now we're
gonna have this off link now for ours
we're gonna make it a little bit
different because and by the way this
function can be asynchronous so we're
gonna make it asynchronous because we
need to access from react native async
storage because that's of our token is
coming from oops
react native not local storage so we can
say a weight async storage get item and
it was something token hip token key was
the name so this will get the token that
we have stored in a sink storage and we
don't need these comments we're gonna
add a header here authorization token
otherwise it's gonna be empty this is
perfect okay we're just getting style
issues so if I do format document cool
and then here I'm just gonna say off
link doc and cat so now we have
basically this is a middleware so every
time a mutation or a query runs off link
will run before it an off link is set in
the context that's what this function
does and what it does is grabs our
tokens adds it to our header so then our
server side over here notice in our
index the typescript not that one right
here that we're getting the request when
we add the request to the context right
so then in our product over here when we
run get user ID the reason we passed the
context in and you see that's what we're
doing and utils is we're getting the
request object right context dot request
and then they're getting this
authorization header right here and then
they're getting the token and now
they're replacing the bear out in front
which I think we're adding yep
interesting they
a capital A we have a lowercase a here
not sure if that's gonna cause a problem
let's see I think it shouldn't but we'll
find out shortly console.log the user ID
that we get all right so I think we've
connected everything I don't see any
errors let's refresh this I don't know
if it did or not let's go ahead and
create a product so this is gonna be
product - it's gonna be 11 dollars and
we can pick an image all right so maybe
this waterfall choose add product and I
don't think we're doing anything on the
client side when we submit so it could
have just happened looks like we got it
back it looks like it was successful no
js' yep so here is the ID which looks
good everything looks like it went
through if we check out our images we
see two of them and test this was me
testing earlier that I created this
other image and then there just how this
sq1 we're sending back that is the image
that we just created so I think we're
good I think all that works and I don't
think there's anything we need to change
with this we need to fix this would
actually redirects back so why don't we
do that real quick so on our new product
page so handling errors right now
there's not really any expected errors
so let's just console.log the errors
that happened and then return but if we
do get a response back there's nothing
we have to do currently what we'll
eventually do is probably update the
cache but we'll talk about that in a
future video no need to set a sink
storage you don't really need to reset
the form because we're going to be
switching to a different page and we're
just gonna switch to slash products when
we're done and set submitting again we
don't need to update the stake so we're
switching pages all right I think we're
good
so let's test this out and we're not
really using the response right now so
we could just get rid of that
so now when we upload the picture it
should take us back all right a product
and we're back here so add the picture
added our product and now we're back to
this page so what we're gonna do the
next video is actually have these show
up here I want to do one thing real
quick to is so you guys saw that we are
passing the token in like this now we no
longer need to do that so if we wanted
to we could actually change this now
I've never made a mutation without
parameters but I think it's possible so
instead of passing like that we can just
all right we'll get rid of that so this
guy has no parameters anymore on the
back end for refresh token so now our
product over here not product and off so
instead of passing the token in like
this we can just grab it from the
context and we can just say args here
and then from our front end and the
check token we're passing in as a
variable a token but we don't really
need to do that anymore right because
our middleware is getting run so let's
refresh and see if this works and it
doesn't so let's see what's going on
with this I imagine there's not an error
so let's see I expect this to work the
same way so on my mutation over here I'm
just going to console dot log contacts
dot request
dot get authorization so now what this
refresh and this the refresh endpoint
doesn't look like it's even being called
at least this console.log is not being
called right cuz I don't see anything in
this here's the front end so let's see
what if something's happening on the
front end we're getting an error I'm
assuming there is hey you're not passing
any parameters to the mutation oh no I
know it is we need to just update here
there we go
oh the reason why we didn't see any
errors is because we're not printing the
error here since we're just debugging
let's go ahead and console.log the air
on our front end so we can see that all
right nice so now you see we're able to
login okay so we can just remove this
console log and we're good and so our
utils function doesn't need that silly
token and we can just change this back
if we wanted to to what we had before
and we could just say Kant's token is
equal to that all right so this is us
changing it back to not needing to pass
in the token to this get user function
because like all our other mutations for
just getting the token from the header
getting passed from Apollo client all
right so that's it for this video guys
the next one like I said we can actually
start viewing the products we have in
our database on this page we'll make a
little list so thanks for watching and
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
