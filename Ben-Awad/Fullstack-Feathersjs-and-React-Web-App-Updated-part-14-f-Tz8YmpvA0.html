the user module now we're going to move
into pretty much doing the exact same
thing for the recipes so I'm actually
just going to copy this paste it in
there
rename because it's going to be very
similar do your recipe so now for the
actions we have here we can actually go
to action creators and just copy those
and let's close these down so you don't
get confused Ariel so these are the
actions that we want here so now I don't
need any of that stuff anymore because
we don't need any of the user stuff and
then I'm just going to start adding
these so recent recipes requested add a
recipe finish recipe fetch requested
oops um and then my recipe fetch
requested alright that looks good so now
we can just do pretty much the same
thing in great functions for these guys
so add recipe finished mmm Andres be
finished recent requests recent recipes
request recent recipes
and that should be using the action here
don't need sign up and then request
recipe we'll call it recipe fetch
requested we have some weird action
names maybe I'll go back and change what
I eat name these four um requests recipe
and then my recipe fetch requested I
guess we can create a separate one I
actually want to look at what how the
API is handling it okay so notice how
these two are basically the same thing
but the inside of find query is
different so we can actually pass the
find query end as a parameter and then
now we can just like basically pass that
in so that's what I'm going to do so I
guess we still need two actions now we
don't because we just request recipe
actually we should we should do to just
be safe request my recipe we'll call it
number now we don't need any of this
drunk anymore okay so we have our
actions that we're going to be using for
a recipes now we can go to sagas next
and we're going to do the same thing
that we did last time so i'll goes just
like that oh yeah so i just paste it in
the saga this folder here from our sagas
file that we had and saw goes here and
i'm just going to go through and trim
out the stuff that we don't need and fix
everything
so take every again as from here we're
not going to be needing fork we're not
going to be needing logout sign up or
login
and that's good so now keep that try
sign and we don't need try login we
don't need login we don't need to sign
up we don't need recent recipes is good
at recipes good call logout no these are
all good and then we don't need the root
so each one of my sagas here we can
export out export export so it's the
sagas we export and then the call
functions we don't so here you export
okay
my name is a little off here it's not
consistent I'm just going to go from the
bottom and make sure everything is good
and actually actually before I do do
that though I want to import my actions
and again it looks like this is the case
where I have some actions here that
we're not into action creators should
make sense so I'm just going to copy
actually this paste in my actions that
we can see which actions we need okay so
I need a recent recipe succeeded recent
recipe is not requested succeeded recent
recipe is succeeded and that's actually
going to need a function down here it
needs a function if we call it like this
for just listening like that it doesn't
so here we're going to say recent
recipes six
needed recent recipes exceeded okay go
this one is good and we have recent
recipes requested recent recipes
requested we have there so we have the
action for that one this one we need add
recipe succeeded so we have add recipe
finish but not addressee succeeded and
recipe succeeded alrighty so good here
and actually notice how that needs to be
a function to so add recipe succeeded
cool and address if you requested we
should have at recipe finished actually
no we don't have an address P requested
recipe requested and that doesn't need a
function recipe fetch done needs a
function press P fetch done press P
fetch done fetch done a recipe fetch
requested recipe fetch requested is
there my recipe fetch done my recipe
fetch nope don't have it so my recipe
fetch done and then that needs to be a
function to IRS P fetch done
I'm adding all these we might actually
not need all these in actuality and then
we have a my Fett requested okay um I'm
just going off of what the app is using
right now we might be refactoring that
later but it's good to add that in now
okay so now here we can import those all
in so from actions we can get recent
recipes succeeded recent recipe is
requested we're going to need add recipe
succeeded add recipe requested recipe
fetch done recipe fetch requested three
fetch requested my recipe fetch done my
fetch recipe requested so my recipe my
recipe fetch done I fetch recipe
requested okay okay so those are all the
things that we need I'm just going to
move this up here so we have all I'm
sort a little bit on the red right now
because they're not being used so let's
change that so here we'll call recent
recipe succeeded pass in the recipes
here we'll put recent recipes quested
here will do address P succeeded and
don't need to pass anything in there
what's going on there
oh I don't expect the dangling it
doesn't like that property okay add
recipe requested
recipe fetch done passing in recipe
recipe fetch requested and here recipe
my recipe
fetch done passing in my recipes oops my
recipes and then last 1i recipes posted
alright that took a lot of actions to
refactor there now let's do some more
refactoring we're going to reviewing
removing the feathers app here which we
do not need any this and here we'll do
payload and then we don't actually need
to pass all those in just pass in
payload looks good here don't need app
don't need feathers out
same thing here don't need feathers app
and we can get the payload and all we do
is pass the payload in
haloed oops
payload all right so we're we removed
all the feathers class up and this looks
good now so our saw go through the
recipe module is good that's it for this
video and the next one what we're going
to do is we're going to continue with
the recipe module and we'll implement
the API and the reducers for it so thank
you guys for watching I'll see in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
