of quick layout changes and then we're
gonna be setting up subscriptions on our
server and our front end so right now
you notice here are a list of messages
but if you've seen slack before they
kind of start at the bottom and they go
up whereas right now we're starting at
the top and going down and then also if
I were to like make this screen a little
bit smaller and there's not enough room
there's a lot of messages I have to
scroll with the whole pane
so you notice how I lose right here my
side panel so the first thing we're
gonna do to fix this is wrapping this
whole component this is a message
container for wrapping it and the
messages component so in our messages
component here we're gonna just say oops
flex or display flex and then what this
allows us to do is control the Flex
direction and we can say column reverse
and now what will happen is instead of
flowing from top to bottom it'll go from
bottom to top
see you soon notice have you have extra
space here now and then the next thing
we wanted to change is in our inspect at
the window the other window we still
have to go up now what we're gonna do is
just say overflow and the y in the
y-direction and we're gonna say Auto and
what that does is it will automatically
add a scrollbar to this little component
right here so now if this gets a little
bit smaller there just how we still see
the input bar here and what we're
scrolling is we're scrolling up and only
the messages are moving not the whole
panel so cool so those are the two
layout changes that wanted to make now
let's start setting up subscriptions so
we're gonna be starting on the server
first now they have a nice example of
how to do this with Express which is the
exact server we're already using so I'm
gonna copy this paste it in and then
change it for how we have stuff set up
so let's jump into this and get started
so I'm gonna paste this down here below
now I'm just going to get rid of some of
the imports we already have so we have
Express and body parts already imported
we have a pollo server we don't have
HTTP we don't have graph QL we don't
have subscriptions or transport and we
have a schema so we already have these
two installed ACP comes by default with
no js' graph QL we have installed but we
don't have graph QL subscriptions and
subscriptions to transport WebSockets so
let's install those real quick so I'm in
the directory of my server and I'm gonna
say yarn add graph QL subscriptions and
then what was the name of the other one
subscriptions - transport /
subscriptions
- transport and then WebSocket we're
already creating we already have a port
and app weari have our graph QL in point
I'm just gonna like move the imports up
to the top with my other ones and we
come back down here yeah so I rehab
we're not creating pub/sub right now but
we don't actually need pub/sub to be
created here we're gonna be dealing with
pub/sub in a little bit we do need to
create our server though by doing it in
this manner
so I'm gonna create my server right here
notice how they do server dot listen and
then they put all their stuff so our
server is doing stuff here so I'm just
gonna believe what we have and add this
and there we go and so we were on port
8081 and here we have execute subscribed
and then in my schema the schema that I
have I believe I just called schema yep
so we can just get rid of that and
grab it and servers our server here and
then path that looks fun and yes Lent
all it doesn't like is we're using it
says no new here I'm just gonna disable
that so easily disabled next line given
that rule alright so that is all we have
to do on the backend to now have a
server setup let's see if we get any
errors no errors looks like it's up and
running okay
let's make sure our front-end can still
fetch data give us a refresh and cool
enough it was able to so we didn't break
anything
and now our server can do subscriptions
all we really did was we don't need
pub/sub right now we'll be using pub/sub
I'll leave it here for now cuz we're
gonna use it in a little bit but we
added this create server execute
subscribe and subscription server in
which we're using down here to basically
just setup our server so were using our
existing Express server to create the
server and we're just doing server dot
listen and this is gonna take our
previous routes and use those while also
using setting up a subscription server
and the path is slash subscription so
we're gonna have to keep that in mind
when we set up our front-end whatever
path is ok cool
so now let's set up the front end so for
the front end they have a nice little
walkthrough as well that we're gonna
follow so we need to first set up a
WebSocket link and then just kind of
walk through splitting up the connection
and I'll show you that so we're gonna
copy this and come over here to our
front end now
this is gonna be in our index we have
our Apollo stuff but there's a lot going
on here so what I'm going to do is
actually create a new folder or not a
new folder but a new file called Apollo
and just kind of create this stuff there
and I want to move up move over my
existing Apollo things over there as
well
so Apollo link we need to keep the
Apollo provider here some up at the
bottom but we don't need all these
Apollo things here I'm gonna move them
over here so then in my index where
we're creating a link setting the
context creating after link all this
junk I want to move over to Apollo and
then some of my index here all I really
want is to import the client so say
import client from Apollo so now we're
just gonna take that Apollo client and
then pass it to the Apollo provider so
now this Apollo file is responsible for
configuring everything so let's do that
so we have duplicates right here so
Apollo link can also grab the split we
can get rid of that and now we're also
missing a couple d's and our
package.json and apollo link create hv
link and hv link so we have two of those
we only need one there yeah so the
apollo link WebSockets and apollo
utilities we don't need or we do need to
install with yarn so I'm gonna come over
here to my console and I'm gonna CD into
the folder should do it clear new yarn
add Apollo link and then graph QL or was
it I think it was Apollo utilities yep
utilities
utilities so those will be added so
first thing we're creating our links
still middleware we're creating that
looks all good they're creating a link
like this okay so here's how they're
doing theirs so they're creating a link
using the new link wall as we're doing
the create HTTP link I don't really know
the difference between the two they look
exactly the same except we're using a
different function basically so I'm just
gonna get rid of that and we don't need
to import if we're not using it using
the ability to split links you can send
data so okay so we were basically
splitting up our link here and we're
creating our WebSocket link alright so
here's the link that we created before
and that's what we have we passed to our
client so I'm gonna put that down here
and this is what we're gonna export
default is this a new new Apollo client
so now this WebSocket link now this guy
right here is gonna be our HTTP link and
this is gonna be our WebSocket link and
do we have a name
oh yeah we're ready using HP link so
it's AP link with middleware we'll call
it and so we'll use that down here so HV
with link middleware
okay so we're creating our WebSocket
link here and then the URL localhost now
for us we said 8081 and if we head over
to our server see how we did
- subscriptions we want to do that here
as well and then we're gonna say
reconnect that's just a good option and
then here's this little split link
what's going on here well now we have
two kind of operations that are
happening in our graph QL up to here all
the stuff here is what we use before
right
this is just creating our regular HTTP
link which makes requests to our server
I just renamed the stage P link with
middleware but we're concatenating our
after we're in a middleware which we're
using on every request so now we also
wanted to make WebSocket requests or
with subscriptions so we're creating
this link which doesn't need to run
through all this middleware so we have
two of them now and we need to know when
to run our our WebSocket one and when to
run our link or our hgp link that has
the middleware so to do this we're
basically we're basically creating a
split fork in the road where it just
like an if statement choose which one
and I actually don't even know what this
get main definition is I'm assuming all
it is is just looking at the query and
seeing if it's a subscription query or
if it's a mutation or a regular query
and then checking so if it is a web
socket or a subscription it comes to
this w.s link otherwise it goes HTTP
so I assume that's what this is dear and
then you've seen this before we're just
exploring the link so looks like no airs
happening over here
refresh make sure everything loads okay
everything loads good
so we successfully added WebSockets to
our or not web sockets but subscriptions
which use WebSockets to our back-end
server and our front-end so then we're
now capable of adding subscriptions to
our schema so in the next video that's
what we will be doing is so now when I
make a little message here and I say
hello it should instantly pop up here
because we're subscribed to all new
messages so that's it for this video
guys I'll be pushing all this code up to
github so you can check it out and I'll
see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
