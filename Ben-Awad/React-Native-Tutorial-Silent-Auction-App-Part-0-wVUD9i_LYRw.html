through creating a silent auction app
using react native in this video we're
gonna go over an overview of how it's
going to work so here I have like a
little just readme file and I have the
pages that I want in my application so
there's going to be a login page a
sign-up page there's gonna be a view
where you can see all the different
auctions you can see which ones are
current that you could still you know
bid on are the ones that have already
passed me should be able to filter and
sort these and then you should be able
to create new auctions and you should be
able to click on an auction and bid or
edit an auction or that sort of thing
down here I just set up what I'm gonna
be using for the database schema it's
super basic we're gonna have a user
table where we can basically create
users that's what we're going to do when
we sign up and then we're gonna create
auctions and then you can see the
attributes I have here for the auction
you're gonna have a name of whatever the
item is you can't have a current price
so that's the current price that's going
at and then when expiration date is when
the auction is over and then I also have
a foreign key back to users so you can
see who is selling the auctions and this
is actually a mini to one relationship
users can create mini auctions so that's
how the database is going to look for
this application so we're gonna be
having a react native application and
then there's going to be a back-end with
this database schema so to get this
working I'm gonna be using a create rack
native app this is a kind of a tool
Facebook came out with that just makes
it easier to start making a react native
app so we're gonna be using this to
start the application and go from there
and then for the UI we're gonna be using
native base this is some really nice
pretty looking components for reactant
native and the cool thing is is it's
basically changes the style between iOS
and Android so you get a native
for both of them so like for example
this is what a signup page might look up
look like in our app and then here's for
example a card view and this for example
could be an auction so we could put the
auction name here and how much time is
left and was the current price of it so
that's something that's going to be for
the UI and then for the backend I'm
going to be using feathers J s to set
that up so if you're interested in
learning how I'm going to be creating
this silent auction app stay tuned I'm
going to be just walking through the
whole process that's saying up the app
in the backend and connecting it to so
thank you guys and I'll see in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
