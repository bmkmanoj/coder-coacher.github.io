little bit of a speedrun so I'm going to
see the fastest I can code a create
react app up and it's going to do a
couple things I have a login page it's
going to have a register page and it's
going to show some data on the screen
we're going to be using react router
we're using Apollo client and some other
cool stuff so I already have a graphic
yo server up and running if you want to
grab that so you can follow along link
is going to be inscription below and
let's just jump right into this I'm
going to start totally from scratch just
going to chug through this fast Co fast
it takes to get that set up I was tired
of using next year so I'm just going to
go back to the bread and butter of
create react app I love it it's just so
nice so I already have this guy
installed I'm just going to run them so
create react app let's see what we want
to name the sky let's say let's say
jello world for that ql hello world and
when that is done we'll open it up and
start coding that i'm going to be doing
it i think i want to create the stuff
with using ant design like i did next to
us and just see if it's a little bit
easier i don't add a head every page
that's a nice thing and we're going to
be using react router for our routing
and we're going to use version 4 and
we're also going to need apollo client
all these are and here's the order we're
going to do things i think we're a sub
react router first and ant design then
lastly apollo client and paulo client go
to a documentation site sweet we got
react we're going to do the get started
and react router i an't design i think
and design should be fairly easy to
install for create react app yep it even
has a thing in it perfect so we just i
think i just have to import this CSS or
create
a CSS sheet oh wow this thing is
chugging along for a little bit what we
can do is actually open up a new tab and
since it's going to pin cheese and stuff
but if I can still see B in there so and
I can open up visual studio code and let
that get started all right I like to put
my we just see your code in the middle
crow on the left and now the right all
right source code is up app CSS here
actually before I even do anything
yarn add OCD make sure this is done okay
it is done so here I'm going to CD just
do NPM start start the server alright so
now we're start adding dependencies I
actually want to get this set up before
react app on the see if I can just
import this directly from the JavaScript
so we're going to install Aunt Bea and
yeah so it tells you to import it from
JavaScript I don't know if we're going
to need that ah it's registering
serviceworker I don't think we need that
that's for you know what are they called
I figure what they're called it's for
offline applications or web apps there's
a there's a thing called lighthouse that
they use to check whether how good your
app is lighthouse Google here it is so
this tool is what you can hear there it
is - this tool called lighthouse can be
used to check how well your application
is doing and I don't know what this is
for but this is a tangent I figure what
these things are called there's a
special name given to these type of
websites I want to see we're going to
see the name real quick all right
whatever we'll worry about that later it
doesn't matter okay
but anyway I want to see if this will we
can see something here so coming into
apt Jas here and I'm just going to try
this and see if it shows up don't care
about you
alright give up cool button grab the
button for me at design assuming this
shows up we're going to just wreak havoc
on all the stuff they have there I'm
just going to cut down all the stuff he
gives me and it should have opened up a
tab assuming it started up okay would
you like to start up on another Ford yes
please because we have our server
running on localhost 3000 I'm really
hoping this button shows up because then
I don't put the important CSS so I can
just cure that CSS file and it does cool
beans
so we imported everything just from the
JavaScript so I'm going to go ahead and
delete index CSS app CSS I don't care
about logo I'm actually curious what
this register serviceworker is and
there's a lot of junk in here but anyway
we're not doing this type of application
so we don't need to worry about it it
I'm actually serviceworker might help
you even if you're not doing that type
of application so maybe this is bad that
I'm deleting it
it doesn't shouldn't change your code at
all so you can leave it in if you like
shouldn't change really anything we need
to import oops we're importing app
you'll notice so I don't have yes lint
setup that's you know that's okay a lot
setup I'll take extra time maybe a
different video setup yes lint logo we
don't need applet of those we don't need
good this is good make sure let's make
sure everything's still rendering okay
it does awesome
all right let's get into react router
guys yarn add react router and let's
just grab Paulo client while we're here
and is there any other library I need I
think for this there an installation
talk about you know it doesn't talk
about what we need you want to just do
sure simple example so gonna take us to
github no we just want to see this setup
I don't want to see all this stuff
general here we go here actually this is
what the page I want to see queries ok
react Apollo it's called not Apollo
client and Apollo alright cool so I add
those what I like to do is create a
routes folder and store all my routes in
there and we'll have an index route and
for this app KS apt is an index J Eskin
be the same thing we don't need two
separate ones two separate pages because
this is basically just that care to you
get rid of you put react here and really
this should be a just a function write a
pure function and really we should just
say export we don't even need to export
default cons app is equal to and we're
going to do this and we don't need any
of this so only thing we need on this
page is this and now we can eat delete
app TF cool so here we're going to
import import routes from route and
we're going to render routes here
and in route we're going to export
defaults and when I have all around here
so we're going to have two two routes
really three routes we're going to have
off jf we're going to have login not yes
that should be uppercase and we should
have registered ah yes all right
Bam Bam Bam so we're going to import Oh
guys to think about react routers yet
you don't install react router anymore
from react router for and you should
just beyond remove the act router what
you actually install now is react router
Dom I forgot about that
as you'll see when we go here should
have basic they have installation click
start I mean I already se how it says
react router Dom that's what you need
the yarn add react router Dom and then
we're just going to create a basic route
you can just copy this and we're going
to get rid of all pretty much all that
stuff and we're going to import react
from react I just want to get rid of nth
I just want to really just want this
import right
alright save me a little bit code
writing okay so we have our base router
here and we're going to do a switch so
we need to import switch switch just
means one of these is going to be
rendered at a time so route exact we're
now have login all these should be exact
we're going to log in register and we're
off and here we're going to import our
three guys so off from
ah and login here register all right
their component yeah ah and we want to
actually use the render function because
it's going to give us some props so we
can do off and we can pass the props and
you'll see why this is useful we're
going to get like some things to be able
to redirect from different pages and
stuff which you would not get if you use
the component all right and this guy is
well render crops and I was not paying
attention
I'm not matching these up at all we'll
do that in a second my bed so register
props so don't fall along this part
we're not doing it right so here this
one should go with register this one
should go with login they should match
up guys which was what makes sense but
for whatever reason my brain died for a
few seconds and I switch them up okay
and we should be good now all right cool
so those are all good to go so we're
done with react router now we just need
to import I like so that guy at the
bottom let's give them like a separate
line because he's not really kind of an
import Apollo provider we're actually
not using Redux and I think doing Edie's
redux
I think Apollo provider uses Redux
internally and a much I can't remember
if we need to also install Redux I don't
think so I think it comes with its own
thing it'll be fine
ok so so it's going to react Apollo and
you just wrap your whole component in
this Apollo provider
you know and so and oh we need to
actually set up the client here so we're
done with you pretty much we'll come
back in a second
queries we need to set up this guy so
setup in options we need to set up an
Apollo client which is this so which is
these two lines so you're going to copy
a you Pam copy you to and again we're
going to like trim some of this code out
you don't eat you you can put you here
you don't eat that oh and this stuff
should go after imports well guys we're
creating a clients that's good to create
a network interface mine is localhost
3000 slash graph QL you want to point
that to where your servers at that's
where mine is
look like we're carrying another client
which would be this and we just pass the
client here I will come back and do the
middleware I was talking about in the
previous video equals that that's okay
that's setup so really let's start with
the register page I suppose so import
react from react now register class it's
gonna be a react component and this is
going to extend so in a render and I
just want to test make sure everything's
all good so we're just going to say
register and make sure this guy actually
shows stuff on the screen cuz we're
making lots of changes could easily do
something wrong react tom is not defined
okay that's always fun so yarn usually I
just run the yarn to fix that thing it's
when you're
our neccessity and also yet nevermind
yarn did not mess up anything we just
need to do actually import react on
throw and react Dom I think sorry we
don't need to run that alright cool so
we're going to go to splash register we
don't have anything to put on that page
that's why cannot read properly location
of undefined so it could be a react
router thing let's make sure we're doing
switch right I think I'm doing switch
right 3rx custom links I believe route
config maybe codes quick switch switch
and you put routes in it
briefs leaves a router with switch maybe
yeah you do I don't know what this area
is type a read property location of
undefined it looks like a react router
thing I kind of want to comment these
out to see if it yeah okay what we're
going to do is we're going to say h1 hi
if hi shows up that means that the
reactor outer thing okay yep so our
react router is messed up in some way
let's fix it
react router dumb router switch sick
because I need I'm passing props I think
oh login and register we're actually
rendering those I think kind of what we
are rendering them so we actually need
to put stuff here and off to I can't
just leave them blank and we'll come and
fill those out later
okay looks like we're still getting that
same thing and if I go to say login I
assume it's still there location
property so well will these kind of
problems pop up what I like to do is
just copy the basic example and make
sure the basic example actually works so
we're going to comment out oops this and
we're going to export default right here
and we don't need all this jazz we
really only want some routes and I
believe I have to wrap this with a div
just because react route is kind of
picky now path we're going to call this
ABC and this will be log in register and
off and oh thanks same thing so our
component is somehow messed up so we're
actually copying the react router
example we're passing our own component
in I wonder so our component Shh
it's not the component that's messed up
right so to make sure it's not our
component which I don't think it is what
you can do is just render the component
so login and now see if that does
anything okay okay so
we're doing a really silly error here
I've used react router just like this
before so there's something really silly
that we're doing that's slightly
different router you idiot
so where this should be browser router
he they changed the name of it I didn't
change the name to do the ads because I
didn't want to do as now we're going to
be good to go yep okay now with register
here let's just bust this guy out real
quick so state username email password
is admin this is going to look all
familiar solve on change this just going
to take an event and we are just going
to say Const value is equal to e target
checked if
target checked is a thing so we're
checking if it is equal to undefined if
it is we say e that target dot value
otherwise it's checked and then we're
going to set this set state and we're
going to say II that target dot name is
equal to value if you don't know what
this on change function is doing you'll
see soon enough we're going to create
some input field so let's go to our ant
design here and put and grab you
whoa we don't need so we are going to
use input here so put this inactive and
put name and the name here is going to
match up with what we want the state to
be then we're going to pass the on
changed input and it's going to know
which one to update and our set state
based on the name we passed here UART
name matches up here so username
username on change is equal to that and
create that couple one of these email
password we don't need any more than
that and the type of this guy is
password let's make sure through your
rendering we go to register variable
type stuff okay that's good we want to
set the value is equal to this state dot
username and the value of this is equal
to this thoughts state dot email
okay we're typing out the edge of the
screen here to pull it back in it's not
getting auto format quite as nicely
because you don't have es one set up one
throw a snowball okay should we have
value here and we want to set okay that
email and then with our input here you
want to grab and say value is passing
refresh and now when I'm okay we're
doesn't even last click here let see
what's going on um something do not work
okay see me clicking here straight
nothing hope the heck just happened okay
I think I broke things with have this
plug-in called see them disable it for
this domain refresh I think that
possibly broken yeah what that is has
been for false false it's been for
Chrome okay so we're getting false for
the value so II thought target is equal
to undefined do this so console dot log
you got target dot checked so check is
actually defined here that's fine
oh I suppose target on
the reason we're doing that we're going
to check boxes later so either target
checked is just fall you know what we're
just going to do this slightly
differently I thought I did exactly like
this on the other one screw this we're
going to say if we got target dot name
is equal to is advant we're just going
to handle that differently so this is
for check boxes this is for non check
boxes for non check part boxes just
these out tired up on you keep
forgetting they are alright that works
we have an error here we target or the
value of undefined password email name
password you know just how these are all
the same so why would one break okay see
that types just fine a time or how do I
break things before okay don't know why
I was getting air I didn't change any
code all right so that's good good check
box so and pull radio sit or actually do
they get their own I know we just did
this but I camera where the check boxes
check rocks
and we can clump give alright so on
change will say going to say admin
question mark you know fine okay so on
change is going to call this on change
the same as before and it's going to
pick up on the name that we have which
is admin and then when I say checked
because this thought state that is admin
all right and like it so let's make sure
oh we actually have set the state here
you know target that name you that
target dot checked that's what it is for
checkboxes refreshes and we're good
and then button be our last thing just
just button and port it grab it here
type primary and on click we're going to
say we don't care about the event so
we're just going to actually yes we do
we do curve now we don't because not in
a form we care about on the form sweetie
prevent redirection so we can do eat up
prevent default but here we don't care
could define inside a full form so on
submit so on submit here on submit here
we're going to put in nothing and we're
just going to do console.log this stuff
state
all right she develop that to another
lined cool do a br here so you guys well
in the console is good we're going to
get rid of you here and we're going to
say Const mutation I'm just going to
call it and we're going to put our graph
QL notation there I'm going to say cons
we're going to say explore default graph
QL Afghan our mutation and then calling
register and that's going to import
graph QL tag and graph QL from react
Apollo here we're going to do our
register mutation if I come over here as
a register actually any doesn't have
yeah that's fine will jury right real
quick doesn't take long user name so
we're going to create variables here for
a soft username which is an optional
string email which is a card we need to
put dollar signs which is non-noble same
with password and then there's a boolean
which doesn't actually matter
and when I say doesn't matter doesn't
matter if it is true or false or if they
specify it Knoller not and now register
username passing that username
and now is admin and we just going to
grab the ID same as last time we don't
care if we don't need a return value
which one know if it succeeds or not so
that adds a mutation to our props so we
can say right here this spot props dot
mutate not mutation mutate pass in pass
in our variables which is the state
variables which we get from what we
submit the form and we can we can just
get the response back and show you guys
that we actually get something so the
way it's a response and we make this an
async function and console.log response
okey okey so my favorite user his name
is Bob he was by ball at Bob calm and
his password is that he is not going to
be an admin all right username of string
and position expected string gang sign
oh we're enforcing string and our schema
so we just need to make this mandatory
so we're gonna have three hundred ball
ball ball ball ball ball Bob Bob of what
validation error that's new I actually
have no idea what this validation errors
let's come back to her back-end see
what's going on insert into user oh he
he I recreated Bob in our database
let's do Tim Tim at Tim calm Tim and bam
at the return object we created Bob I
mean Tim okay you guys I will turn just
like code out everything to login and
the other stuff but I'm actually getting
exhausted so I'm just going to pause
here and split up into two videos so we
did register we did a lot of stuff here
I'm going to put this code on github the
next pages are going to be super quick
because it's basically a copy and paste
from this register stuff so thanks for
watching guys stay tuned for that next
video
