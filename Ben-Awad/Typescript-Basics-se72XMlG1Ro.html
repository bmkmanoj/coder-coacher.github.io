basics of typescript and kind of the
things that I use the features I use on
a daily basis so the first thing you
want to do is go ahead and install
typescript on your computer and to do
this you can just do NPM and just
globally install it like this and spell
typescript like that make sure you spell
it right and so I already have this on
my computer so I don't need to run this
but after you do that you now have
typescript and what you do is you can
code in files and for example the
extension is different than J's files so
its dot ts for typescript
and what you do is you write code
typescript code and then you're gonna
compile it to JavaScript code so for
example let's say I want to create a
variable called Bob and just a string
hey I'm Bob so this is actually a
typescript variable right here and it
infers the type based on what's over
here so this is a string right now I was
gonna see if it gives us any kind of
like type annotations or whatnot but
doesn't look like visuals to code it's
gonna show that but it is a typescript
variable now and what we're gonna do is
I'll show you how to compile this so if
you use TSC this will be the typescript
compiler and I'm just gonna feed in main
typescript and so let's say I wanted to
add a console dot log so we can see Bob
let's say I wanted to run this code I
would first compile it and what's gonna
happen is it's gonna turn this into a
JavaScript file and we can come over
here and we can look at mage is and this
is what it created so right here we can
see it looks almost identical but it
changed it to a var and that's because
and this is a setting that you can tweak
with which we'll talk about later but by
default it does not do the latest
JavaScript features for example Const
and whatnot and so for example if I have
like maybe comments Bob - so here I have
like a little bit of a function and now
we're gonna compile it if we come over
here you'll notice how it changes that
arrow function to a function like this
okay so let's come back and go over some
other things I'm not sure why this is
read it says cannot read a clear block
scope variable I don't know that it's
talking about there I think we can just
ignore that so that is how you compile
it and then to actually run this what
you would do is it's converted to
JavaScript code so you can do whatever
you like with the JavaScript code for
example you could run it with node and
we could see it console.log hey I'm Bob
so as we're coding any of this stuff at
any time you could compile it and then
run it with node if you wanted to all
right so let's dig into some more stuff
so let's get rid of this stuff so
variables you just saw me declare a
string you can also have other things
right you can have numbers and you can
have decimals if you want to and you'll
notice that this type is as I said it's
inferred so we can also infer objects so
I might have a variable in here X Y
right and it automatically knows the
type of this object and here here's what
I was talking about so we can see the
type of this thing so this is an object
which has an X which is a number and Y
which is a number so notice how you
don't call these ents and this also
means if I do decimals like that this is
also a number so we can see x and y are
both numbers still so a number is
represent to both integers and doubles
or floats if you will so that's how you
do variables the other thing with this
is sometimes you can you can also like
explicitly set it so here's how you
would define a variable and typescript
explicitly so here's the type so you do
a colon after the name and then the type
of your variable in this case it's a
number so we set it like that and you
can do the same thing with an object so
here's how you would do an object you
could say X which is a number and Y
which is a number like that now
sometimes we need to clear an object
like this you don't always and let me
show you guys actually before I talk
about that how you can do other the
other way to define an object like this
is to create an interface so my
interface could be my object and inside
of that I would like to have these
fields
and I can set it like this so I have
what looks like an object and it's an
interface so we have the type and you'll
see this is the name inside of here and
then this is the value or the type of it
and you'll match up so then this is nice
because then I could create a second
object and then I could have it as that
same type and maybe the X is a different
value and Y is a different value so I
can reuse this interface across multiple
objects and so this ensures that this
type is a number so if I were to try
redefining this I could redefine it to
one I could do it to a float if I wanted
to but it's gonna cause a give us a
little error here and tell us hey you
can't do that because it's of type
number I don't know let's see if I do
true yeah same thing and false because
these are boolean so if I were to say
let and of course for example we said a
is a number up here we can't redefine
that to a string and that's for two
reasons one it's Const so we can't
redefine it in the type is a number but
if I were to say let this to be for
example true
we have inferred this is a boolean even
though we have not explicitly said it it
even tells us right here so if I were to
say is dog is now 1 again we're gonna
get problems with all this so what if I
want to add a lot of times when you're
creating an object you might add a field
later
so object dot I don't know Z is equal to
this number here and your notice it
doesn't like it very much um and the
reason for that is because we didn't
specify in this interface that this is
the that this object could possibly have
a Z so what you need to do
is add z to the number like that right
but then we're gonna get a new problem
up here we didn't define this object
with Z in it so we need to have Z be
optional because this object might not
want to have a Z property but this one
might so to make optional you add a
question mark so now everything is happy
so we can optionally have a property
called 2z and you know notice also
checks against for example well I
actually don't know buy to fall if it'll
check against no but if we look at my
object to so it knows that object 2 does
not have a Z so if I were to add five
okay so it's not checking nulls so if
that was checking nulls this is a
setting that you can add it would be
able to detect that object 2 does not
have AZ in it right now and you can do
something like this but anyway that's
the setting that you could turn on and
off that's pretty nice and you'll notice
by a default I think it's whatever
global typescript settings you have
since we're using the global typescript
but you can create a little kind of like
configuration kind of like es lint or
whatnot alright so that's how objects
work in adding properties this is the
optional and you can have as many
optionals as you want let's go over how
functions work so I can create a
function I'll call up my function let's
call add and it takes X&amp;amp;Y and it adds
them together
now we need to specify the types of x
and y so this is going to be a number
and this is going to be a number now
it's going to infer what the return type
of this is so you can see it takes a
number and a number and returns a number
so if we wanted to we could specify the
type of this so x takes two parameters x
which is a number Y is the number and
then what does it return well a number
it infers it automatically for us in
this case so we don't have to add it
also you might not really like adding
let's delete that real quick and we need
to leave back okay so you might not like
just like cramming that definition here
so what you could do also is make a
separate type called
maybe add function and so this is a type
so this is good for reusing things and
also just for space and I could specify
the type of this and also notice if I
change what this returns here it's gonna
tell me hey I'm not expecting a string
to be given back I'm expecting a number
so it'll catch these things for you
which is really nice you know leave that
in for now and this is a number and also
now when I add number I call add for
example I have to pass in numbers and it
enforces this and again we know this has
or two floats but if I were to add I
don't know my object
I just call it object whoops
there you go it's not gonna like it
and we can read the error argument of
type my object is not a sign of altered
parameter type number so basically what
typescript is doing in all these cases
is just making sure all the types match
with what it's expecting the type to be
and we could get fancy if we wanted to
and we could have a function as a
parameter or an object as a parameter so
a lot of times I like to destructure
things so let's say add two and we're
gonna take an object as a parameter and
let's say we have a and B and then we're
gonna add a and B together so again
here's how you can specify the sky right
here so we're D structuring this but it
doesn't matter it's still an object so a
which is a number and B which is the
number and we could also you know if we
didn't want to de structure it we could
just say this is the nums object and say
num zai a number stop B so both of those
work and that's how it works with D
structuring and the types and whatnot
and typescript will handle and supports
all of these things that basically
anything you can do in like the newest
JavaScript so you can basically do in
typescript as well like the spread or D
structuring or console at these
functions I haven't had any problems
where there's features in typescript
which are not working you can even do
the at these are the decorators like
so decorate those thingies
you can also their experiment tool say
have to turn a certain flag on but
pretty much everything you can do in
JavaScript you can do in typescript as
well but basically it's basically
JavaScript it feels very similar I
picked it up very fast because you're
basically just adding types so
everywhere you have variables now and
whatnot you just like so safai the type
alright so the other thing I wanted to
go over is we saw how to add function
that create functions a lot of things I
use require unions so for example I can
have one of two types so let's say I
have I'll call it maybe number so it's
it's five here but maybe down the line I
want this to be a string so I can say
number or string so this pipe operator
will allow you to connect concat either
so it's either a number or a string so
in this case I could now set this to be
hello and it's not gonna be mad at me
but it will be mad if I for example it
false because we know it can never be a
boolean and I can do this as many times
as I want though I can add boolean as
one of the types
so maybe num can now be false and you
can union types as well so it could also
be an odd function
so maybe nom can now be equal to add and
it's not gonna be mad at me because this
is an odd function and I set it equal to
that but if I got rid of that type and
now it be mad at me because I can't set
this so unions are really nice the other
thing that goes with unions are with
objects so I have my object here I could
create another interface called will
just create two new interfaces so I'm
gonna call this dog and I'll say the dog
parks and it's gonna be a string and I'm
okay interface cat and it's gonna purr
and that's the string if I wanted to I
could concoct ease into one type and the
way you do that is I'm gonna create a
dog cat which is equal to dog and cat so
what this type is and we can look at it
it's not going to show us that's a shame
so let's create a dog cat it's gonna be
a type dog cat and it's gonna be a bark
and and it can have a purr so that's
what it did exactly what you think it
did
so it took this object and this object
and kind of just smash them together so
now I can have a bark and a purr and if
I ever change this so for example I just
got rid of it no longer has a property
called / it just you know goes down the
line and it says all right so dog cat
can no longer have / this object is of
the type dog cat so it cannot have a
property called / so that's pretty nice
so you can smash those interfaces
together and you can either you know you
can get crazy if you want to I can say
it can be of this type or it could just
be a number or whatnot
so here I can say what and I could have
dog cat is equal to five I don't know
something crazy right so I can set this
to a number or I can set it to an object
that equals this and then basically to
know what value that these things take
you just have to add you if statements
so a lot of times I'll do dog cat and
I'll get the type of it you'd be like
all right is that equal to and whatever
and check what the quality of it I
actually don't know if this is called
number or integer or what to put here
but for Strings
I know you just do string so for example
if it's a string also dot log your
strength
so with the unions what you'll end up
doing is have to do this to be able to
make sure the type is right okay another
thing is sometimes you have to cast the
types of variables or whatnot so take
this weird dog cat thing I want to pass
it to my add function dog cat and dog
cat will allow it okay so it it allows
it alright no problem but sometimes you
have and JavaScript where it doesn't
like it or I don't know if we change
this to not be able to accept a number
well actually so here's how you cast
things you use I like there's multiple
ways but the way I like to do is with AZ
and it doesn't like as so another way I
can do is add me so obviously I
shouldn't be able to pass the ad or dog
cat to ad because it's not a number but
if I wanted to I could force typescript
to let me so as lets me redefine or cast
things so it wouldn't let me cast it to
a number which makes sense because this
should never ever be a number according
to this but it will allow let me cast it
if I have this cannot be heard a type
number okay it still doesn't like it for
some reason I was expecting this to let
me maybe if I do that
okay so interestingly enough it's so
look what it did there is actually
detecting that I have not made this into
a number yet but as soon as I do that it
allows me to cast it to a number here
that's kind of interesting anyway that's
how you cast things so this comes in
handy once in a while when your types
aren't doing what they wanted to do and
you can cast into things and at any time
if you want to just force things to work
you can use this keyword called any and
that means it's of type anything so I
can create like a function
it does anything and one of its
parameters is gonna be just X and it's
gonna do anything with it mostly I just
console dot log X that's all it does so
does anything can now take as a
parameter
any number of things so it can be a
number it can be false it could be a
string it could be an object it could be
another function doesn't matter so we
could do that there's five you can pass
it anything and it handles it so that
comes in handy when like typescript
doesn't always behave and gets in places
where you're like hey that should not be
giving me a tie bear or something I just
use the keyword any or sometimes it's
really hard to try to get the types
right and I just use that yeah this is a
little bit of an introduction to
typescript that's pretty much all I
wanted to go over in this video and the
next one I want to go over how you can
like setup type script with a typescript
configuration file that way you can get
it to compile things in different
formats we're going to compile in
different ways and different es6 es7
sort of way and then also go over how to
use this with react but before I end
let's just convert this over and see
what happens I want to just like see
what it does to this stuff so we can see
it changed everything
- just like functions and VARs because
that's what it's set to do and let's see
if this runs I guess it just console
logs because this thing at the very
bottom but yep this is it for this video
