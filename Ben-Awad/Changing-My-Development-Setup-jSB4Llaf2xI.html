development workflow now I spend a lot
of my time coding react and so I just
want to basically optimize my workflow
for coding with react and so what I have
been doing before is I'll be using
Visual Studio code that's what I have
right here and I'll code stuff here and
then I'll just like switch over and I'll
have a chrome of and I'll switch between
that and chrome like this and maybe I'll
have terminal up and I'll switch between
those like that but what I really would
like my workflow to be is more of like
stay in one place like I'd like to have
like a terminal right here and maybe
some more windows to do have multiple
files open at once I know you can split
screen with this here too and do the
console but it's a little bit jank here
I like having it all in the terminal and
having multiple screens that's what I
like my workflow to be so I'm trying to
get get to that point and this is what I
want is something kind of like this this
is what I have set up right now and
there's three things that just changed
it up
one the shell that I'm using the themes
that I'm using so the colors are
different
I also did a rework of my vem settings
so them is more enjoyable and like
ramped it up to use react because it was
not set up to do react pretty much
before so I'm not there yet but I want
to show you guys what I've done what I
don't like so far and like what I need
to do so so far as you can see I have
one color scheme here for actually
before we get to color schemes you'll
notice here's what my terminal looks
like a regular terminal screen looks
like you'll see I have a little bit
different theme for that and also it
looks different and the reason for that
is I switch from z shell to fish and so
the main reason for this is just to try
a different shell
this is not like to optimize for react
or anything or
I think this better free Act I just have
heard really good things about shale or
about fish and I wanted to give it a try
I thought I'm changing up some other
stuff why not change for fish now and
see if I like it and I'm actually really
enjoying it I really like the
autocomplete feature I know you could
probably hit this setup for a Z shell
too but I set up like fish came out of
the box set up and I just been using
it's been really nice so for example
here's me seeding
and hey look it pops me in a couple
folders deep already I can just
autocomplete that and that was just like
the last folder I went to or something
and then you can see it also like
shorthand so you don't this long path so
DP and then live coding really like that
a bunch of cool little things that it
gives you so switch the fish shell that
was really nice weirdly enjoying that so
I'm definitely gonna keep that and
continue using fish shell over Z shell
right now because I'm liking the
differences it is a little bit weird
because sometimes it's not compliant
with just bash I don't know the
technical details of what's different
but all I know is sometimes stuff does
not work the same for example setting
variables so this is how they set
environment variables whereas I think
it's like export I did in Z shell
something like that it could be set to
but the difference is like the equal
sign here you do space but like little
things like that are different in fish
shell but it's not too big of a deal and
then I'm also with that using this
framework called oh my fish just to make
it easy to set things up and keep stuff
updated and download packages and themes
with that so using this and I'll put all
these links to what I'm using in the
description below so now with that I
also have the Dhruv Box theme and that's
what you see like this little brown I
was using before solar eyes for a while
and I just thought let's give it a
little change I've been using it for a
while
so this is the new one that I'm using
for my term I'll really like it and this
terminal is AI term too by the way if
you're wondering you can see that here
and so this is the theme it's really
nice they also have a light version that
I like the dark themes better and then
that's pretty much all there is to this
to the terminal in the shell itself so
what I'd like to do is have you know so
this is using team-ups right now to
split the screen that's nothing new I've
used team-ups before but I changed up my
vim and I've also I had actually a very
hard time finding like getting my them
set up for react that was actually a big
struggle I'm pretty happy with like
splitting the panes and like what it
looks like like this is you know I can
do different stuff split how I'm
splitting and stuff but that's not too
big of a deal but right now I like I
like ever the only thing them I'm not
liking right now is how them is set up
so I want to show you guys that the
first thing I don't like is my color
scheme this is like the best color
scheme I could find let me know if you
guys what you guys use for them that
looks good and react I don't think this
looks very good maybe it's because I'm
not saying it up right I spent a ton of
time trying to set all this stuff up it
took a really long time so I'm gonna
show you guys some of the things that I
did too like in case you have this
struggle with setting up the theme with
T MUX and then just get the colors right
so right now that theme that you see
that's kind of like faded it's called
Nova but like look they have import
salutation and salutations blue mine's
not blue import that's not blue there
but I would like it to be blue I think
it looks nice with blue but then if I
come down to there vim
see see how that kind of looks whitish
so matches there but I'm not in love
with this color theme so let me know if
there's a theme II use that works really
well with react notice I actually don't
even have a react project up let me pull
up a react project so you guys can see
what react looks like with this go up
one yeah this will be source not publics
source index so here's some react notice
how all the tags are just that yellow
not don't care for this I don't like how
this looks
personally it's not terrible um I just
really enjoy this theme huh that comes
with this I guess all the tags for this
might be all so let's see what this
looks like for react well actually I'm
gonna take a second pull up worried
about it but I really like what the
theme looks like for Visual Studio code
and I actually like try to look up if
they had some preferences color theme I
try to look up if they have this dark
plus theme for what's it called bin but
I couldn't find it I just can't find a
nice a spying theme for them that I like
I don't like how the text is very white
here I like how there's a lot of
contrast I really like this theme
basically so it seemed kind of like this
where there's lots of colors nothing's
just white like I like how these are
white but like the words themselves and
stuff I like how this looks so that was
one thing that I was like I wish my ven
look like that and I couldn't find one
another thing that I considered was one
dark that looked decent but honestly a
ton of themes look terrible
just with react and with JavaScript that
es6 that just doesn't mesh nicely so
that was a big struggle trying to get
the theme that look nice now I want to
show you guys some of the configuration
I changed with react not react for for
react and for JavaScript
with my vim file so here on my left side
I have then the vehm are seen on the
right I have the T MUX RC and it really
changed MOX much with my team ox except
for the stuff at the bottom to get the
color themes working so if you have a
problem with the themes looking
different for T MUX versus not T MUX
this is something to try out make sure
you do these two lines here has to do
with true colors another thing is in my
vim over here you have to set GUI set
term GUI colors I was also doing this
let and them to be enabled true color
this thing was messing things up so I
had to comment out but there's lots of
different vise lots of different places
to get this to work and I was trying all
kinds of stuff and finally got to work
after a really long time you need these
these two thingies but okay so I
stripped a lot two plugins out that I
just wasn't using and so I just wanted
to go down to the basics that I needed
want so I just want to go over real
quick what I have left um so two
essentials vim JavaScript than JSX this
is for syntax highlighting and
JavaScript and spacing and just making
sure stuff looks nice and JavaScript and
when doing react so this one's for
JavaScript the gsx of course for react
so those are really nice do pleat is for
auto completing so pretty
straightforward do pleat Jedi's for
Python completing I actually am NOT
doing a lot of Python these days so I
could probably delete this plugin by
kept it in because why not then T MUX
you see how I can hop my cursors between
these two screens easily and Wolman them
and T MUX
that's what that does nerd commenter
just allows me to easily comment stuff
so those are the same nerd tree I can
pull up okay so I can pull up a
directory if I want to and
mr. Nate Nova theme is my no event is
the theme and then ale this is for doing
es Lent so that's what I have and I'm
pretty happy with the plugins right now
this stuff's the same I'll show you guys
what changed in my MRC setting the theme
this stuff right here I actually wonder
if I change to give her the background
I don't think Nova wanted me to set the
background to dark I wonder what that
will change anyway another day yes at
the bottom here that was the one other
thing I had trouble getting to work was
prettier es Lent
so that was the one thing I really liked
about visual see of code it made it
really easier you just set up prettier
you select which formats your JavaScript
code and makes it look nice and formats
it correctly with es lint so I'll you
can set it up with fixers and they'll
fix it we'll run it for you but there's
actually it looks like there's a problem
with it right now here's an issue that
was 11 days ago so we have this guy
who's trying to set pretty rias lint and
basically so I can get es lint to work
or prettiest limp to work fine but what
the problem is is it's not using the es
lint RC file that's in the like
directory of my project so it's doing
the wrong es lint rules and bit this is
the dude that runs the project warp and
he just says I don't think there's
anything we can do at the moment
so basically previous length I can't get
set up to read the is let our C file
correctly and do it right so that's the
other thing I couldn't get the set up
and that was super annoying so right now
I actually don't really want to use vim
to code because I can't one I don't like
my theme as much - I can't get pretty
rias lint to work when it when it does
like when it runs it does not do the
read the es lint violent RC file in my
project so it's not help be helpful just
formatting it randomly so if I can get
those things set up
I'd love to code like this and give this
something like this
where I have I'm basically coding in BIM
and CAD my terminals set up over here
terminal set up over there ZZ with T MUX
but I'd really like to have them set up
nicely so the only thing pretty much the
laid I'm annoyed at right now with them
is the color scheme and he has pretty
aureus lint can get those working I'll
start using it until then I think I'm
just gonna continue using just Visual
Studio code because it just works that's
the other thing I'm kind of annoyed at
with them is I have to keep coming in
and editing stuff and fixing stuff
whereas their CEO code just works and
like I was fiddling with all this stuff
to get this work for a really long time
like almost two days like the whole days
dedicated to getting like just setting
up my environment which is super
annoying and setting up the environment
what I mean by that is literally just
getting the color themes to load
correctly the colors the load to get
plugins installed configure the plugins
all that jazz was super annoying this
problem took me a long time to figure
out to get don't use this use the term
GUI and then have both of those hoops
and my team ox RC or team X calm
took me a while but yeah that's kind of
where I'm at let me know if you guys are
able to get pretty tedious lint to work
nicely in them I'd love to use it
I'd really like to use vim with this and
let me know what theme you're using and
if you like in it if it looks nice with
react because I really want to use this
in code in here but I don't like it at
the moment so I'll probably pretty much
just like use this as a split terminals
and then code in this but what I will be
keeping really enjoying fish shell that
was a puzzle surprise and I do like my
theme right now for the terminal it's
pretty good let me know if this is easy
to read to I can definitely switch it if
it's hard for you guys to see this
compared to solarized I don't know what
computer so lies how this looks for
videos
yeah this like I can live with the theme
being slightly bad but the prettiest
lint thing too is just annoying so yeah
I'm gonna try a debug those try get
those abhart probably some tomorrow and
see if I can but I'll put my I'll update
my these two files on my configure files
on github so you guys can check it out
if you want to follow what I have here
but I do recommend definitely if you're
doing react and then Gale JSX JavaScript
and what's it called do pleaders nice as
well just with some nice auto completion
I think do I guess lint anywhere No
so I think I'll just does es lint by
default let me show you guys what a al
looks like so let's close its close okay
so i've MPM up there i wonder show okay
so this is what L looks like this is es
lint errors right here
so pretty nice I think that that was
nice to get the esn't warnings have been
I think this is a pretty good so yeah
I'll be experimenting with that I'd like
to just kind of like live over here in
terminal and not have to switch between
terminal and my code editor over here as
much it's not too bad because I'm you
know not switching too often that'd be
just a nice little optimization but they
don't say Oh codes working pretty nice
for me so I'll probably just continue
using that for the time being until I
give them where I like it and I'll
switch back over to them and yeah so all
these guys here I'll put up on oops I'll
put up on the description below so you
guys can check it out if you wanted to
do any of these themes or set up this
shell which I would recommend fish shell
it's pretty nice you know and that's it
I'll see you guys in the next video
