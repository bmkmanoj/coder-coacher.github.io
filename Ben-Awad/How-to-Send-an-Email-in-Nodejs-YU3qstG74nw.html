emails with nodejs now we're gonna be
using this nice library called node
mailer that makes it super easy
now we're gonna follow the instructions
right here for just sending some test
emails and then after that we're
actually gonna send emails using a gmail
account so we actually send real ones so
the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna come to their home page node
Miller comm and I'm gonna copy this code
right here and what this code is is just
to create a test account and then to
send a test email to see if everything
works so I'm gonna go ahead and hop to
the command line this is the folder I
want to do the project in and I'm just
gonna say NPM in it and I'm gonna keep
all the defaults and then I'm just gonna
say yarn add node mailer to install that
and then I'm gonna come over here this
is it opened up in Visual Studio code
and I'm gonna say index touch yes and
this is where I'm gonna put my code so
I'm gonna paste it in here cool have
this here and now what this code is
doing right here is it's creating a test
account it's telling us what the account
details are and then we're just using
the username and password that come with
this account to authenticate with this
ethereal email server and then we're
gonna send an email we're gonna say
hello hello world and then we're gonna
see some output and the logs weather
went through or not so let's give this a
try so I'm gonna say clear this out node
index touch a s and go ahead and run it
and when that's done running we should
see a little link and we do so if I
click on this you can see our email
actually sent and it says hello world
here so it's super easy and fast to get
this set up now this is a nice little
like playground or sandbox where you can
test out your emails once you have this
ready and you change this to what you
like so maybe
and here you can do HTML you should be
used to the from to subject that's all
looks normal
the text here you can either do plain
text or it can use an HTML body so I can
do in HTML
hello header and then I can have a body
where I say hello world and we can bold
it or actually I don't even know what
the be tag is for an HTML but we can
write what do you know
hello well as much as we can then we can
come over here we can run it again and
then when we're happy with this when we
like what're how our message looks we
can just continue coming over here we
get a new URL we can look at it we see
our hello header let's say we're happy
with this and we want to send this to a
real email so to do this I'm going to do
10-minute email 10 minute you know so I
want to send an email to this guy right
here so to do this what I'm going to do
is instead of using ethereal which is
just for testing I'm now I'm done
testing and I'd like to send a real
email using Gmail that's how they get it
to work so to do this I am going to get
rid of this and I'm gonna say service
and here I'm gonna put Gmail and then
off I put my username and password for
Gmail now I'm storing mine environment
variables so I'm gonna say process M
Gmail underscore user and process dot
and Gmail pass now if you want to and we
just need a comma here if you want to
you can just put the strings here to get
the environment variables I'm gonna say
yarn
add dot in and then I'm at the top here
I'm just gonna say Const and I mean I
say Const I'm just gonna require and
then say dot and dot require oops not
require config
all right and then we're good so this
will get the environment variables for
me I put my username and password in the
taught in here so now I can send an
email using my Gmail so I'm gonna say
from the from this is Ben Awad and I'm
gonna save in a lot apps at gmail.com
and then in the to field I'm gonna put
this email right here cuz that's who I'd
like to send it to so paste that it was
didn't copy it right okay it's not
copying for some reason see if that'll
grab it
okay it's not copying for whatever
reason so we'll just type it out mmm 50
and 50 3665 at in the h r HT dotnet okay
so that's who I want to send it to
subject hello from nodejs and we'll keep
the holo world here so now to give this
a try and try sending this so I'm gonna
say node index dot yes and you'll notice
how here what we'll get is instead of
getting a preview URL it will just say
message sent and the reason for that is
that for the preview our l that's only
for testing okay so we send email and
bam it shows up here and it says it's
from bin Awad Apps at gmail.com and it
says hello from node nage it nodejs and
we see the hello header here so this is
pretty cool this will allow us to send
emails from no GS which is really nice
and a big use case for this is if you
want to send confirmation emails maybe
after someone signs up for your account
or service so I'm gonna put this code on
github if you want to check it out but
actually I'm gonna bother putting this
on github because I basically just copy
and paste
the example here but you'll notice I
just did change my I put my gmail
username and password now note if you
get a problem authenticating with Gmail
um you do have to change a setting in
your gmail account to make it less
secure basically to do authentication
this way I'll send a link on how you do
that basically you have to say allow and
secure apps to access your Gmail and
that that's what allows this guy to
access your Gmail and then send the
email for you so I'll put a link in
description below for you to if you want
to try this out and see if you can get
it to work if you don't want to use your
Gmail you might want to use other things
like AWS SendGrid and there's some other
api's that let you use just a regular a
different email the nice thing about
this node mailer it lets you use your
Gmail which is easy and look how fast we
were able to send an email with so
pretty nice in the next video I'm going
to be doing is actually taking this and
adding it in with a node server and so
we're actually going to accept a
confirmation or when someone signs up
we're gonna send them a confirmation
email and they're gonna click on a link
and confirm their account so that's
what's coming next thank you guys for
watching and I'll see in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
