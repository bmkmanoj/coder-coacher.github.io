video showing you how to use Redux
observable and I'm just setting up that
video right now a little project I'm a
used to demo it with Redux form and I
thought why not I'll show you guys how I
go about making this video so if you're
not interested this is not going to
really be a tutorial but more of how do
I create tutorials I'm so if you're
interested in that so right now I just
have my terminal up the first thing I
like to do is just launched Emacs it's
what I use to create multiple terminal
windows so you see over here and now I
have a new one open I can hop back to
this or I can move back here okay so
gonna go to the folder where I was gonna
make the project and I think it was a
redux form set up I'm guessing and right
now the project side react template and
I server so I'm just gonna open another
tab when I go ahead and start up the
server if I remember correctly leading
just look at this real quick
I think this server is just a blank
server with one
one drought yep me a validation and the
only validation we're doing is making
sure the first name and the last name
are different and this was just this
show an example of how it worked with
redux form okay so that's good new NPM
start and let that run in the background
now I'm gonna go into my trionic
template I'm gonna open that in a new
tab I'm just gonna start it and I'm
gonna hop back to my original tab and
I'm just gonna come back to you to
kernel and see what it's looking like
and I believe it works using redux saga
right now so what I'm going to do is
with my strip out Redux saga and replace
it with Redux observable stuff so first
name and cool it looks like it's
submitted if we come here to a console
submit function done awesome so that
works so now we want to do the same
thing but with what's it called we'll
keep these with epics I think I'm gonna
keep this code in here because I can
pretty much copy and paste this for the
epics because they're very similar I'm
gonna make a separate video about this
but I'm just trying to get async
functions to work with redux saga and
excuse me to work with react saga and I
couldn't get to work you have to either
put this like if this was an ASIC
function you have to put it below I'm
gonna make one down here or I can import
them and then I'll actually get to work
so like you have an async async function
and it does whatever
and I can call Bob here that works but
if I move Bob up here and try calling it
doesn't so if for a reason I was having
trouble with that that's what was wrong
with it
so I'm gonna go to this store and now we
can strip out your duck saga get rid of
all the middleware stuff you know we can
keep this for now cuz we're gonna do all
that jazz with Redux observable so it's
gonna open this in a new tab again so we
can install Redux observable so yarn add
this the project you're not over we're
how yarn works with like NPM but it
feels a heck of a lot faster Facebook
created I recommend using it if you
haven't tried it okay so we just want to
set this up pick Mill where
and we need to create this route epic on
the dot slash ibex
so we can create a new folder and source
called epics and then we can pass this
epic middleware and instead of the saga
middleware pool I think that's it for
epics don't think we need anything else
now we just need to actually write these
epics copy and paste theft actually no
we're not gonna copy and paste that
we're gonna use what I've used before so
I made I used Redux observable for this
to-do list I made using react native so
if I go into the source I pick index you
can copy this and use that index ijs
paste that all in there we'll come back
and fix that stuff later for now I just
want to look at the sagas so request
submit so what we are looking for over
handling so I can come back
oops to my epic can get rid of that I
don't need this stuff ready to use it
Redux form we're gonna use Redux
observable
I think this long out epic is kind of
how we want to do it so I'm gonna call
this register epic and then basically
we're going to put in that's the same
code that we're gonna that we're using
for a reducer so saw goes so we request
submit we're going to take that and
we're going to basically submit to the
server so we can copy this stuff and
make it a sync
so you're gonna say wait and actually if
I come back over to my components my
form right did I keep it no I didn't
that's fine I thought I kept my submit
to server that I was using that one was
a sink so that's fine so we're gonna
await fetch you can put try-catch air so
we're gonna try to just fetch you if we
get an air then we can return air wait
we don't know wait this this is gonna be
conscious response
I'm gonna turn response that JSON and a
wait I believe I don't space that out
all right
you remove this now and that looks okay
so our register epic the first thing you
want to do you're gonna do and we're
gonna start submit on our contact form
then we're gonna go to our merge map
that sounds good
and then from promise we're just gonna
call submit the server I see in our
action dot data and then the return
value stop map or that's gonna be our
response so it's a function we can say
if X errors else do something else so if
there is errors copy this
we're going to return so after we make
this call to send that server we want to
then get the return value from it and if
there's any errors from submitting we're
going to dispatch this action
and then if there's not we just want to
return request successful okay okay
request successful alternatively we can
also pass in the response ensure that it
worked here we can console dot log the X
so we can see it working and then we
also want to say stop submit oh you know
what I need you to dispatch this as an
action so I need to do top to stop
submit contact and then we need to pass
in the Aires
so if there's Aires we pass those in and
then this is saying or there's no errors
we just pass an empty object okay that
looks pretty good actually let's give
that a run module not found so this is
sometimes happens this is when you add
new files and you just need to restart
the server oops not like that's or the
client or it could mean that we just
imported it incorrectly one of the two
it looks like it's gonna be living okay
not find module so when using rxjs you
have to go into your project and
actually just import it here
and that means we have to do yarn at
rxjs so we need install that package so
because Redux observable uses rxjs under
the hood so we need to install that as
well and import that in and see when
that's done that we can refresh cool and
I can come back here go to my epic we
don't need to do we might need
observable observable I use like if we
get an error by returning this type we
I'm pretty sure we can just return in
action but we might need to return an
observable actually well find out result
by this result
Oh zbx there we go okay looks like it's
rendering okay so bob bob bob throw
an air bad request to 400 good spits out
this object but for whatever reason it
did not stop the submit so what I mean
I'm curious about if we come here you
can console.log also that log X oh you
know what
uh-huh I know it is oh yeah we should be
passing the errors in right here consult
block X okay let's see what that's out
putting all that Bob okay errors oh
that's actually working
stop submit so do we want our are we
wanting to do - I did this before I
can't I can't remember if I just like
put it up here because basically we want
to return to actions oh okay I didn't
work either
all right so I did I got this working
with react native app before not this
one a different actually come over here
call log in epics you can see how I did
it
okay i dispatched it okay I remember
that so I need to do do it like that so
notice how got it get state dispatch so
we need to grab two functions here get
state and dispatch instead of doing this
do thing we're going to dispatch this
action
I'm just making sure my stuff is
matching up what doesn't it like
unexpected token just need to add a
parenthesis there Bob Bob okay so that
seemed to it work nicely you know what
happens if I would do it correctly and I
still want a console.log so we can see
what the response from the server is all
that refresh and lucky there I created
our user so that's how you get to work
with epics so now that I have this
working example I can tear out the stuff
over there
you don't need sagas elite thank you
okay so now I have this working epic I I
kind of know how to code it up so what
I'm going to do is I think for the
tutorial I'll do is I'll do like a side
by side going through and setting up
rxjs and Redux observable with this and
then when doing this part how do I want
to show them I walk through and explain
this because
am I gonna try to memorize this I kind
of know how it works because I'm just
doing register epic and then you're
doing action it's maybe a lot to
remember this is from the last video
that I did this is just a generic
function async function that makes a
call to an API that's simple and then I
can start back over here that's kind of
funny how it goes from was the URI that
cuz I was noticing the this should be
happening async only called a server but
then that console.log was happening
afterwards just kind of interesting okay
so got submit action here that looks
good
and that's pretty much it so now I'm
just gonna decide how I want to go about
memorizing this slash presenting it now
that I got this working I'm gonna just
basically go through and explain how
this all worked and a walk through of if
you have a redux form how you can set
this up for Rio kept ik air with Redux
observable using epics and rxjs so I
guess that's it for this video if you
liked this behind-the-scenes let me know
I might do more of them where I'm just
kind of basically relaxed coding I don't
explain as much but just see me how I do
the setup of everything I set my
environment and that sort of thing I
might continue doing these you know so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
