to finally get started on the react
native app and start making it we have
the back end all done pretty much and
now we're going to get started I told
you we'd get started with this using
create react me of that what I was
trying to get to work and I was able to
build an app I was not able to get
native base to work which are really
wanting to add from you I so some really
nice components I wanted to use and the
Creator react native app doesn't really
do much extra on top of the CLI at least
for this project we wouldn't be using as
many of the features that come with this
so I went ahead and just said forget
about it let's just use the regular
react native CLI so that's what we're
going to do because I really wanted to
get native base incorporated in this
video ok so with that said let's go
ahead and jump right into this so in
terminal go ahead and install react
native CLI using this command I already
did that I have that set up and then you
run react native run not run Amit and
then the name of your project I called
mine silent auction and whenever you're
ready ran that because that takes a
little time to install the libraries and
then I just see bead into that folder
and now here I am here the files that I
have and then I did em pm-9 p.m. oops
react native run iOS to start the
emulator now if you don't have an iOS
simulator if you want about be on Mac
you can also do run Android and do this
with androids the same thing and you
should see a screen like this that just
says welcome to react native awesome so
if you have that you're all caught up
and both in the same place now what I
want to do is start with native base and
get that installed we're just going to
copy this so r install native base and
after that's done installing we're going
to link it with react native and then
after that's linked up we're going to
going to copy that
after we're done linking that we're
going to go over here and we're going to
just show a button I think just show
this button layout and see make sure it
is correctly installed and correctly
working okay so we have that and run
react native link and we may need to
restart the packager sometimes you do
when you we just went this so you might
have to recompile we'll see if we get an
error or not so I'm going to copy this
and before I actually pay seven what I
like to do when doing apps is actually
just refresh into fruit crashing no
crashing okay sometimes when you add
libraries with powers your open it will
crash so I'm just going to clean this up
a little bit we don't need any of this
stuff except for appt registry don't
even need that and we're just going to
basically so right now we have two
separate files for iOS Android I'm just
splitting them instead of splitting them
up turning them into one so I'm an
importing app from the source so I'm
going to create a source file with
basically the main app and then I'm
going to have the iOS Android be the
same thing so now when I create this
source index a tree is import react from
react export default and then we can say
import text from react native
and once you refresh that so now any
changes we make to this file we should
show up here we go it says hi there it's
behind carriers it's a little hard to
read but any changes we make to this
will now render on both Android and iOS
at the same time okay so now i'm going
to copy this and paste us in here and i
can get rid of this and hear that okay
now refresh that and see if we see the
native base buttons and if that renders
nicely then we have we can just keep
adding these UI components now sometimes
you do in air and you do need to restart
the packager up just have a comment here
refresh that and cool we have the button
so nice we were able to successfully add
native base and now we have these really
nice style that work on both Android and
iOS so I'm going to leave it here for
now and in the next video we're going to
set up Redux agha and Redux itself so
thanks for watching and see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
