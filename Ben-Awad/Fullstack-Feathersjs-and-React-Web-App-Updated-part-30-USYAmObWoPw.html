would change these guys to pure
functions our components but before I do
that what I want to do real quick is I
said I in the last one we removed
pagination and we just have not done
that in this one so I'm just going to
open up the server go to recipes and
then recipes service and then there's
this nice paginate thing here we're
going to set our own and you're going to
set default of 500 and a max of a
thousand that just makes pagination not
a problem for application you can make
it bigger if you want to well that way
we don't have a problem with things
getting cut off because notice how we're
only getting a couple we're not getting
all the recipes right now so now we're
getting more cool okay
so now we're going to go to the meat of
this video and we're going to go just
component through component and make
them into pure function as if we can so
navbar already is a pure function so
we're good to go
if you don't know what a pure function
is notice how we're not using class
we're just using functions here so that
is what we're going to be doing this one
we can't again because we're using
component we'll mount
main here you are we using create class
okay so for example this is one o we're
not even using main huh we can delete it
sure please
nevermind this one's good this one's
good and actually do we have any pure
functions
I'm sorry any pure unique lot things
that need to be made into pure ones okay
yeah we do here we go add recipe is
going to be our first one so notice how
there's a lot of junk in this but
nowhere do you see
nowhere do you see the need for like any
of the components Oh
JK we're using this state so who are
using this state we can make this into a
pure function but because it is we can't
so we weren't using component will mount
or any of the other ones so that's a
giveaway that you can make into a pure
function but because we're using state
we can but one thing we can do to clean
this up is we don't have to do these
this binding is kind of gross so another
way instead of binding this is you can
do something like this and that will
automatically bind this to it so you
don't have to so let's do that to all
our functions that just makes it a lot
prettier now these are all anonymous
functions or lambda functions
cool and I'm going to bring the export
to the top and we can remove that import
statement home we're using component
will mount login page again we're using
a constructor but we can remove this
through our console log so now handles
submit you do an arrow function like
that my rest piece getting some data
with the mounting we can do this again
here alright and then just last one is a
single recipe and that one's good so
okay so we converted all the things that
could be converted to pure functions
that we could of what it was basically
just this one so this video is going to
end quick in the next video I'm just
going to basically grind it through es
Lent and remove every single you slip
error that I can I'm going to try to get
down to zero to save willing things
where I can
and whatnot and then that's it
yes Lintz the last thing we're gonna do
and we're going to be done cleaning up
this project so again that's it for this
video and I'll see you guys in the next
video we're doing es lint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
