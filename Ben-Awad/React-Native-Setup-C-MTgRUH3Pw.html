we're going to be setting up a react
native app so let's get right into it so
the first thing you're going to need to
set up the react native app is the CLI
to do this you can install using NPM and
you would make it install it globally
the react native CLI I'm not gonna write
because I already have it but if you
just run that command in terminal it'll
go ahead and download it for you and
then after that you can run react native
in it and then your project name I'm
gonna call mine HelloWorld
I already ran this amok around this but
this does is it sets up your project and
installs all the dependencies so run
that can take a few minutes and then
just CD into your project then you see
you have all these files right here and
you'll see an index to iOS and Android
iOS these are your app this is your app
so if you go into index to iOS you can
see this is the code for the basic
beginner app that they give you have
some basic styling it registers the
component down here and if we just open
this up the Android one as well you can
see it's the exact same they change the
text a little bit so whenever I run this
on Android it will run indexed Android
is whenever I run on iOS or on this file
but how do we run a wrap if you do react
native run Android this assumes you have
I have we have Android emulator running
right now so when I run this it'll go
ahead and compile the application and
install it on there so if you run that
on it'll boot up over here it'll open up
a dependency manager or they call
packager or downloads everything for you
and package it onto here I'm using
genymotion
do you get this Android emulator but you
can also use Android Studios virtual
machine then it comes with so I have
Dream ocean up running over here and
when I did react native run Android it
goes ahead and builds it over here now
let's say I wanted to run this
i OS you do run - iOS and that would
start up emulator for you for Android
you have to start the emulator yourself
okay cool so I have this beginner app
right here now what well the cool thing
about react native is you don't have to
keep recompiling unless you break
everything so if I just come into
indexed Android j/s I can come as try
editing some code so instead of welcome
to react native I'll say welcome to
react native I am editing and I just
save this file I can't come back over
here you notice it still says welcome to
react native but if I hit R twice it
refreshes and it says it takes my change
so anytime you edit your app in the
editor you're using you can come back to
the app and double tap are in our
refresh and our cool thing you can do is
do command M and what this will do is
bring up basically a developer menu and
they have lots of different options to
run and test your app so refresh you
want to do any time you make changes now
if you're doing react native a lot of
time you're going to want to have
Android and iOS go to the same
application I don't want to build two
applications and that's why I'm using
react native and right now as you can
see if I run index iOS and index that
Android basically have the same thing in
it so I'll show you how you can create
one source folder that stores everything
so I'm gonna make it a directory called
source and I'm just gonna go into
Android KS and I'm just gonna rip out
everything so all this stuff you do not
need so all I have left is this and then
we're going to import our and we can
bring this to one line and then we're
going to import our app from source
and then what we're going to do is we
can actually do the same thing in iOS
index the iOS get rid of all that code
and just have this now what I can do is
I can go into my source folder and I'm
going to create index yes and I'm just
going to create you act from react a
little dummy project so we'll save you
will just have a text for now actually
go on react native and then export
default so you can just in react you can
just return a function and have the
return value be displayed instead if you
don't want to make a class so for
example here I just want to say hello
world and now this will both go to iOS
and Android so this index file here I
can go ahead and basically expand my
whole project in the source directory
and both the Android and the iOS project
will grab it and it will render when I
run those apps so right here I just
basically have a super simple version of
an app and if I hit double are can
refresh and I can see hello world here
in my Android app now if I was to run
the iOS version it would go ahead and it
would say hello world there too I'm not
gonna run it because it takes a little
while to run but that's how you set up a
basic iOS and Android app there's one
extra thing I really like to do that is
kind of confusing to set up so I want to
show you how to do logging real quick so
a lot of time what I like to do is I
like to put my emulator over here and
then just open up a terminal over here
and what you can do is you can type
react native run and not run log Android
or log I Oh s depending on what you want
to log and this is notice I'm in my
hello world directory here so you want
to run this in the same directory as
your project
I can log Android and now if I do
console.log in my project I can see it
right here so right now we're not
logging anything but we can change that
so instead of returning it like this
what I can do so we can say return and
now here I can say console out log
hello I am logging now I can come back
over here I can tap double R and notice
it says right here hello I'm logging and
so you can now use this to a console log
and get output from your app when you're
running it so this is a basic setup for
a react native app you just have it
running I'm going to be making some more
videos so stay tuned on how to add more
things to react native app so thank you
