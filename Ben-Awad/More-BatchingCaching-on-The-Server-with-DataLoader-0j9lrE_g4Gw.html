gianormous so I want to put it to a stop
and that is our message query right now
we fetch the username you can see the
username right here for each message we
fetch the username for every single
message so it's super inefficient and
we're not batching it together so we're
gonna fix that with data loader right
now so let's show you guys the query
that's getting run I'm just gonna
refresh this page load all these
messages here is the select statements
that are getting run you can notice we
were just selecting the user a bunch of
times and you know look at this we're
selecting user one multiple times user
three multiple times - super sloppy
query so let's fix that so we're gonna
be using day loader for this and we're
literally gonna copy the same template
of how we did it for Channel loader so
first thing we're gonna create a new
data loader so how they later works is
you don't want to share this across
multiple guys or queries so I'm gonna
create a separate for a user loader and
it's gonna be a new data loader and it's
gonna take IDs and I want to create a
new batch function for it so user badge
function and we can just call it batch
or - we'll use the same naming
convention and then like we have this
I'm gonna pass in IDs and I don't think
we need the user for this I'm just gonna
pass in IDs and models and we can pass
in the user later if we need to okay so
give that a save and I don't know why we
ain't unexpected token I think it just
hasn't loaded yet okay so we're gonna
import this and create this user bash
batch or function so
oops area user batcher and so in my
message over here this is where we are
loading the user so we're now going to
use our user loader and we're just going
to say user loader dot load and we're
gonna load user ID and so we don't need
the models here anymore so now instead
of actually fetching the query for each
user for each message we're going to
pass it to our load function and it's
gonna batch those all together cache
them so if we're requesting user one
multiple times we won't fetch it
multiple times
so in our user loader function over here
so I'm in batch functions now I'm just
gonna copy this function here our
channel batcher cause it's gonna be very
similar and we're gonna say use their
batcher and now for us we don't need a
user ok so again here is where we are
gonna have multiple IDs each is an ID
for a user and now what we're gonna be
returning is each array and each one is
gonna map to a user and it's gonna have
an user name like Bob or whatever so
first thing we can do a query and so
here we're gonna just to select we're
gonna select everything from users as
you and then we don't need to do any of
this nonsense we're just gonna say UID
is in and we'll just say IDs say user
IDs
okay so we're just selecting all from
users where user ID is in user IDs and
then we're just gonna replace user IDs
with the IDS that we have there that
we're getting passed in and then the
model that's gonna be returned
it's going to be a user and we're gonna
do Brawl to get all stuff back and now
we're gonna group everything together so
here instead of grouping my team we're
in a group by user basically so for us
we're gonna results for each are now
it's just gonna be hard to ID and we're
gonna push our and yeah so instead of
using basically the team ID or grouping
by the users ID and then we're just
going to map and each ID that we were
trying to load or this is gonna grab
from the group and paste it in there now
for us we should only really be fetching
one user for each one so instead of
pushing what we can do it's just this so
the one before we were fetching multiple
but users is not going to be an array
well the result here is gonna be a row
we're gonna get rows of users but for
example one ID is going to map to one
user so it might be ID one we'll have
one user and so we want to return an
object of each one so here we're in a
group by user ID and then here we're
gonna have for example instead of an
array of an array of a race we're just
kind of array of objects and each object
is a user
so for example ID of one and then user
name could be Bob or whatever so I think
this is good now and we can get rid of
our dummy function that we had here so
I'm gonna give this a save and I want to
open up the logs and we can see our
query getting run and see if it's better
and actually before we do there's one
syntax error I have my query oops
user IDs is gonna be an array so we just
need to wrap it like that similar to how
we did up here like that okay so now I'm
gonna refresh the page and we're gonna
load each message and now instead of
loading each time per message we should
see one select statement and let's see
here we go select all from users and now
you can see we're fetching user one two
and three so this is much better so
instead of possibly hundreds of queries
depending on the number of messages in a
channel we're only doing one so it's a
giant improvement we just made on
efficiency and it would will help the
number of concurrent users we can have
using our website at once so that's it
for this video guys I just want to get
that fix cuz it could cause a huge
slowdown in the server so thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
