code and doing a little example of an
authentication strategy that I quite
like I'm gonna go through some of the
benefits and the disadvantages this
method and kind of how it all works now
the code is in the link in the
description below on github if you want
to check it out and see this and run
this for yourself now here's the code
right here you'll notice this looks very
similar to a server that I've written
before because it's almost exactly
similar I did a few tweaks so the first
thing that's happening here is add user
now this looks exactly the same but I've
changed it one way I'm now doing two
secrets you'll notice how I have a
secret here in a secret - these are for
JWT tokens so I'm using secret for a all
regular tokens and secret - for refresh
tokens so the way my authentication
setup works is I have a short-lived
tokens so if we come over here to off
this is where I create the tokens I have
a token that lasts one minute and a
refresh token which lasts seven days and
you'll notice how when I create the
regular token we're storing whether the
person is an admin so this information
can change right they can get demoted
from being an admin they can be created
as an admin so that's why we have such a
short expiration time and I really like
this dual setup of having a refresh
token and a non refresh token because
this eliminates a lot of problems you
have because if something gets messed up
which it shouldn't
after a minute everything is corrected
and you're all in line because after the
minute you're gonna recreate the token
and get the data fresh data so nothing
you know should go bad in that one
minute and really it should never happen
where you have it where the data gets
messed up but just in case it'll only
last for a minute but the nice thing
about having this is a minute is you're
not querying the database every request
you're only querying the database every
minute and now this could even be five
minutes maybe 10 minutes
your application I think one minutes
pretty good short amount of time leaves
the window open for things to happen
very small but anyway let's continue on
with this how this is working so ad user
is just basically at the front of all my
routes so I'm using a graph QL server
here and as you can see here we go
I'm saying add user to run before all
the requests so what's happening here is
I'm expecting a token and a refresh
token to be passed on each request I'm
first checking the token this is very
basic just checking against the secret
whether it's valid and well there has it
expired if it hasn't the minute is still
good then we just we have the user from
that token we but we trust it because
we're checking every minute and we just
go along and we pass that user on and we
use that user to make requests later but
we catch this error let's say our token
expires it's been more than a minute
what we want to do then is refresh the
token assuming our refresh token is
still valid so what we'll do is then our
refresh tokens function I'll check
whether the token is valid and if the
refresh token is valid I'll create new
tokens and I'll pass that back to the
user and now the user has these new
tokens and they're refreshed and as you
can see in my resolvers over here I have
for example get book which requires auth
requires off create resolver this is how
I do permissions if I come over here
basically requires auth runs before the
resolver does and it checks whether
there is a user and whether there's a
user ID if there is I say the user is
logged in good you could also check to
see whether they're an admin if I wanted
using requires admin so different types
of check but anyway that's how I'm
checking and I'm getting that because
right here I'm adding the user and so I
use that later as I was talking
so anyway here we have the Refresh token
or Refresh token and then it lasts for
another minute and we just keep doing
this over and over and over as they keep
making requests but one thing I kind of
changed up about Refresh tokens is I
wanted a way to revoke Refresh tokens
and I was kind of thinking so let's go
into this function real quick here is
Refresh tokens I was kind of thinking
about some different ways to do it and I
was thinking when would I want to revoke
a refresh token and there could there
really only was like one scenario that
came to mind that when I would want to
revoke Refresh tokens and that's if
someone says hey my account got hacked
or hey I don't know you know I want to
like that's honestly just your account
got hacked or something this is the only
thing I can think of is where you need
to invalidate all your tokens for that
account in that case I just kind of want
I said all right if that's the only case
I can think of where I want a basically
blacklist or revoke the token when
someone says their account is hacked
then I want to just say why don't I just
you know revoke access to tokens when
they do forget password so I'll say if
someone's account gets hacked I'll tell
them to forget their password or reset
their password and then when they do
that then automatically changes and
validates all other tokens that's what I
wanted to happen and so with that in
mind that's how I kind of set this up
and the reason for that is I didn't want
to check a table and keep a list of the
ones that I blacklisted if I'm only now
I'm fine checking against a table if
there's more reasons but my only reason
is when someone attacked that's not
gonna happen that often and I'd rather
just handle that by having the user
reset their password and so to like you
know automatically invalidate all the
tokens I want to tie the secret to the
password so as you can see here is the
refreshed secret I'm using I'm using the
secret
underscore to which we're getting from
over here which is just a string and
then we're also using the user's hashed
password this is the hash password right
here and so when the user changes their
password this will be different so then
the secret well the whole secret will
change so when they reset the password
all prior tokens they made are basically
invalidated and that's just a nice
little quick way but this has its
disadvantages the advantages I'm not
doing a separate request every time to a
different table but the disadvantage is
is and also real quick before I talk
about the disadvantages the reason i
mapy a pending secret too is if i need
to invalidate all these I can change
what secret the value of secret two is
over here so it's not just depended on
the password too but the disadvantages
is if I want to basically stop all
tokens working for a particular user I
actually can't so if like I can't think
of a scenario where I really want to do
that I'd probably just like delete their
account or something if I wanted them to
stop using my software or my application
I can't think of a scenario where I'd
want to just like revoke their tokens
once but I don't I can don't have that
ability I can't say I want this users
tokens to stop working I can reset their
password for them that would work but I
can't just like say all your tokens
can't work so that's the disadvantage of
using this but let's just walk through
the flow of how this is working all
right so we have refresh tokens we have
the token we have the Refresh token
models is just my sequel eyes instance
so I can query the database and then our
two secrets so first what I'm going to
do is I'm going to decode the Refresh
token if for whatever reason the token
is does not have an ID the user ID which
is how I have how I what I expect it
it's not there I just return an empty
object if not we now know the ID of the
user for the
the refresh token is associated to so
we'll go down here we'll make sure the
ID is not friggin ole or something else
will return and then we'll do is will
actually try fetching the user with that
ID if we don't get a user back what
we'll do is we'll return and D object
again and once we have the use it now we
know their hash password so we create
the secret that we're gonna that we
expect that refresh token to be signed
with so we check we verify that the
token is good it's signed with the
correct secret if it is we continue
going if not we again return and then
here we just create new tokens for them
and that's it so that is kind of how
this is working so the new edition I'm
really adding to this is having the user
password attached with the secret here
for the Refresh token which is really
cool and so I'll I'll show you this in
action how this works but before we do
we can just go over how the login is
working very similar I'm just first I'm
fetching the user where they're passing
me the email and password and then I'm
comparing that against the hash password
and then I'm creating tokens and again
as you can see I'm doing secret to plus
the password and this is the hash
password again so that's pretty basic
now if I come over here to resolvers the
example I'm about to show you users get
booked as you can see this get booked I
require them to be authenticated to
access this and I'm actually checking
that in the backend here and then down
here I have a forget password now this
obviously you would like send an email
to them and have them change stuff but
since I don't have that set up I'm just
basically gonna show you with how forget
password would work with this as just a
graph QL mutation so here all I'm doing
is I accept a new password and the user
ID of what user and we're changing the
password for I just hash the password
and I update and that's it all right so
let's show you guys this in action so
here is a little react
and I also have this code on github too
if I'm gonna check this out so here I'm
going to create a user I'm gonna create
a bob user I'm using Bob Bob Bob I'm
gonna say register our registration
worked if I come over here to data I can
see I have an ID of one and that's
important so I'm gonna come over here
and I'm gonna login I'm gonna say Bob
and then Bob now I'm gonna click login
login worked now for this I'm storing
the refresh token and the regular token
in local storage but that doesn't really
matter for this example we could be
storing in cookies or storing it in both
that'll be separate videos where I show
you guys that stuff and now I'm gonna go
to book slash one now before I go here I
kind of want to show you what the code
looks like for that so here is my comer
here to book so this is this route all
I'm doing here is when the page loads
I'm making this graph QL query right
here to get the book and then if I can't
get the data I redirect to 4 or 4 and I
show a loading and then I show the title
of the book alright so let's go over
here and we get loading and it says I am
a book title so that worked nicely and I
want to come over here and actually
shorten the lifespan of this token to
show you guys so right now the token
lasts a minute but I don't want to wait
a minute
just to show you guys so let's wait 20
seconds so I'm gonna real augie in that
way I get one of those tokens so I'm
gonna say Bob Bob alright got my new
token so I'm gonna come over here I'm
gonna go to book 1 and I get my new I'm
a book title cool now I'm gonna come
over here and forget the password for
Bob so he has a user ID of 1 a new
password like that so I'm gonna go ahead
run this it works so we got true back
and now
to refresh this and what you'll notice
is page not found so the user is not
authenticated and the reason for that is
we just changed the password for Bob so
that changed how the secret worked
because this has such a short lifespan
we again refresh the token and next time
we refreshed the token we actually
checked the database and checked the
Refresh token we came over here and we
checked the password and the passwords
changed so we say hey you need to go we
log in now if I make this a little bit
longer let's say 40 seconds I can come
over here and log in and we'll say Bob
Bob - we log in there we go book 1 all
right so that works now if I come over
here
and I'm gonna change this back to Bob
run that so the password has changed so
this shouldn't work right but wait it
does so what went wrong
well our token is still valid because we
said 40 seconds here so as soon as the
40 seconds expire we'll then check the
Refresh token but until then you know we
can still use it so that's why you can
kind of play with this number here and
get the how fast you want it to expire
so each one of these requests is not
hitting the database but BAM you'll now
notice we hit the database and it says
you're not authenticated and it doesn't
work now ideally how this would work is
whenever you make changes or for example
invalidate the Refresh token is you just
give the user a new token so they're
automatically updated you just go ahead
and make this change in case for some
reason a token got messed up or they
didn't receive the token or the user
tries to mess with their own token we
just know after 40 seconds it's back and
it's good again so we'll change this
back to a minute because that's what I
think is like a good time you could play
around with your application
but this is an authentication strategy I
really like and I think it kind of
balances security plus also not wasting
a lot of time making extra requests to
the database we're still requesting
stuff to the database but we're not
doing it in every request which is
really nice so this is what I want to be
using for future applications and really
like this authentication that's the
method so I recommend you guys trying
this out and again the code is in the
description below on github if you want
to check any of this out and thank you
guys for watching
