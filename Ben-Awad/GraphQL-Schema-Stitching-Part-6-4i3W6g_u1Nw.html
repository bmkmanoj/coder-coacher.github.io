do on our register mutation but before
we go too much farther playing with it I
want to set up kind of like a module
system or break out our code into what
people refer as as features so right now
we have a file called resolvers in a
file called schema and this is nice it's
simple but the problem gets when you
have a lot of resolvers and your schema
grows it gets really big in this one
file so a nice way to do it is to break
it up between basically the different
resolvers so for example I have a
register resolver so I want to split
this into basically its own little
folder where I have a register folder
where I have the tests for the register
I have the resolvers really register and
I have the schema for the register and
to help us out with this we are gonna be
doing some schema stitching so this is
something from graph QL tools and it
works really nice so here's like a
little demo of it you'll basically have
a schema that looks like that and a
schema that looks like that and then you
can call merge schemas and combine them
into one thing so that's what we're
gonna be doing let's go ahead and get
started so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to create a folder called modules
and basically all my modules are gonna
go in there so the first one is I'm
going to create a register module and
also going to create a tip module on the
temp module was just so we can make sure
this works and I'm gonna put the hello
query in there so okay let's start off
with register I can go ahead and I'm
going to create a file called resolvers
TS and inside of that I am going to copy
all the code we have here paste it into
resolvers and now I'm gonna get rid of
the query
because we only want to have the
register mutation and now we change the
path of those things so we're gonna have
to reinforce them and rien port user
okay so that's our resolver we're also
gonna create a schema graph QL for it
and I'm gonna just copy and just
register alright perfect so we were
pretty much done for this register file
now I'm gonna create the one for temp so
resolvers TS and again we can just copy
what we have here and then here we're
just going to get rid of the mutation
and only keep the query and we have to
reinforce stuff and then also add a
schema graph to off and then for this
we're just going to copy just the query
alright so we now just basically cut
everything in half right so we've put
the resolvers the mutation resolvers
over here and the query resolvers over
here
that's not necessarily the way we split
it we might have also some mutations
over here and some queries over here it
just so happened that we had hello and
register or really just splitting that
sort of thing but you can really split
this up however you'd want to right but
this makes sense and then we have what's
gonna happen is it's gonna push these
all together or merge them all together
so let's let's do that so in our start
server now instead of just like
importing a single schema graph QL what
we want to do is basically grabbed it
from modules now there's a couple
different ways we could do this one of
them involves just like importing for
each module but what I want to kind of
set up is kind of like an automated way
so for each folder might automatically
import it
that'd be pretty nice so that's what
we're gonna do so I'm just going to
import a file system from node and the
first thing that we're going to do so we
need to create a array of schemas and
the way we're gonna do that is by
looping through the modules so I'm gonna
get all the folders so constant folders
is equal to FS dot reads sync and we are
going to say here path join pass in our
directory name and then modules so what
that will do will give us all the folder
names so it'll say register and temp so
after that we are just gonna say folders
dot for each so we're going to loop
through each folder and here we're going
to basically get the resolvers which
we're gonna require and so many dot
slash modules and we can make this a
template slash our folder slash
resolvers so that I'll import our
resolvers and then we also want to
import our types all right
and our type deaths is just the schema
in that folder and we can use import
schema again from graph QL import and
we're going to get the path and then
we're gonna say dot slash modules slash
the folder again and I'm going to make
this a string template again okay so now
I have the resolvers and the type deaths
for this folder or this module if you
will and what we're going to do is we're
going to push this onto schemas so I'm
going to say schemas dot push and here's
where we need to actually add a library
so we need to add graphic UL tools oh
yarn add graph QL tools and then after
that is done you can import from you
know tools and what we want here is two
things the merged schemas and they
create for me it's called make yep make
executable schema so we're gonna call
make executable schema passing in the
resolvers and the type def s-- so
basically what we're doing is we're
creating a schema for each folder for
each module using its resolvers and its
type def and we're gonna basically have
all our schemas right here and so it's
getting mad at us because we don't have
the type of this so let's what I like to
do is to figure out these liked sort of
types is I hover over make X cutable
schema and I'll just like peek the
definition and when I look at this guy I
can scroll to the very end and see that
it outputs a type of graph QL schema so
really what I want right here is an
array of graph QL schemas
graph QL schema and an array of it and
this is madness probably because we have
not actually installed graph QL so it's
not as a dependency we can just add that
so yarn add graph QL and that air should
go away all right let's see what it's
mad about here so it's cuz we have some
shadow names so we can get rid of
resolvers and type deaths there cuz
we're not doing that anymore so then
when we pass to our graph QL server now
instead of passing type deaths and
resolver we can actually return a schema
and the schema we're gonna pass it is
the merged schema so merged schemas
passing in all of our schemas like that
and cool and that's it so just let's go
through the code one more time on we're
basically keeping a list of all of the
schemas that exist we're looping through
the modules folder we're getting here
all the folders and we're looping
through each folder so starting with
register we are importing the resolvers
so we're importing these guys right here
and then we also import the graph QL
right here and then after that we make
it a executable schema by merging those
two together are not really merging but
using the resolvers and the type def
creating a schema and then we do that
for each folder so temp as well and then
we add it to our schemas and then at the
very end we just merge them all together
ok cool and also the idea with this so
we have that merge and all that let's
run the code real quick and then I'll
talk about tests so yarn start and we'll
see if all this code works
and cool looks like it did start up
let's go over to playground over here
I'm just gonna refresh and if I click on
schema over here I see hello and I see
register so I can say hello and it does
go ahead and recognize it we can also
run register if you want to mutation
register and we'll see if that works
password and okay root query query root
type must be provided okay so I did some
research on this
err and it doesn't seem like it's
something we messed up
but looks like there's just a bug in
graphical tools so here's the pull
request and basically it just has
trouble merging the schema whenever
there's not a query specified now this
pull request is closed and should be
fixed but a dude at the very bottom is
having the last or the very same problem
we're having even after this pull
request and this was four days ago where
it says query root must be provided and
he's doing the exact same thing we're
doing where we didn't add a query so I
think what we can do for now to get this
to work is we could specify just a dummy
query so type query and we could say by
which is a string and we could pass a
query in here
and we can say bye so we could do that
and all this restart and hopefully it
should work now but hopefully the bug
should be fixed soon if you guys know
any other workarounds or ever
experienced this please leave a comment
below and we can fix this but for now I
think I guess that's what we'll do we
can go ahead and run this and it goes
ahead and register stuff perfectly so it
doesn't look like we like mess stuff up
at least with our logic over here just
something with that okay so lastly I
want to talk about testing so I had like
this folder over here called tests now
that I have basically set up a folder
for register I can just remove my tests
into register
I might have to yeah get rid of both
those guys here and we'll go ahead and
really fix that fix that and so we're
gonna basically keep the tests in the
same folder as the feature or the module
so now I don't need this constants can
just kill it
and I think we're good to go so as we
expand in this project what we're gonna
do is in modules we'll create a new
folder for each basically new feature or
new chunk of code that we want to write
and then we'll write a resolvers a
schema and then also test it as well and
then this will scale well as we have a
lot of different things that we add on
so now we can delete resolvers and we
can delete this outer schema as well
because we won't be needing that now
this does provide a small problem in get
rid of yarn err it does add a small
problem with our dude over here let me
see if I can find him here is our
generate schema types where we just ran
GQ 2's source schema we now don't have a
central schema so before we can generate
the types we're gonna have to basically
kind of copy some of the code over here
to merge the schemas and then run the
type on that or about that in a future
video though and I want to just run
tests real quick and make sure there's
the work though so I'm just a newbie on
tests and hopefully it should be able to
find and yep it did find the register
test and should run and should still
work and perfect it does so that's it
for this video guys thanks for watching
