about processes now we're going to just
dive right into this the first thing i
want to show you is the sleep command
which is not related processes but just
going to help me demonstrate how
processes were so you type sleep and
then you type a number and then it
sleeps her I think it's in mill sex mate
milliseconds maybe it seconds I don't
know but basically it just stops your
computer it sits there and does nothing
for that many milliseconds / seconds
okay so processes there's a process
running right now I can pause this I can
also cancel it I can cancel this process
by doing control C I should get up
before it just kills the program right
like run this again I can also pause it
the control Z gives me this little thing
here and then it does it stops it it's
just sitting waiting for me to restart
it now I have two choices right now I
can either kill it it's it's paused
right now I can kill it I can resume it
or i can continue running it in the
background i'm going to go through each
one the first thing I can do is what's
known as for grounding and that brings
it back and in start running it again
now to see what processes your head like
have started you want to do job oops
jobs and you can see we have one stopped
job sleep and it has this one right here
to start things up again you would do
foreground and this starts at it and
then you give it which job you'd like to
start up so the first one and this will
continue if we hit enter and this will
continue sleeping and I'll just go on
and on or I can control Z pause it again
look at my jobs I can kill it % one and
it's dead I just killed that guy another
way to kill this if I do sleep and just
to show you its terminated if we do jobs
real quick it's
all empty if I sleep again I pause it
I'm notice I can see now I have a stop
job and pause you can also kill
processes that you see doing in PS so I
cps here I have this little pit so i can
do kill 655 71 and it kills the sleep no
jobs running and so remember how I was
telling you how in other videos I did PS
aux and I gripped for say for example
postgres process I then we get this
process ID in for example I could just
kill 6 5 580 and it would kill the
database server and sometimes you want
to do that to turn things off so that's
one way of doing it so now you know how
to resume you know how to pause a
process so sleep one two three controls
you pauses it I can then resume it using
foreground doing % 1 getting that first
one with jobs I can also kill it by
doing % 1 and it'll just died and will
be gone forever the third thing is
background and this turns it on in the
background so if i do be g % 1 notice it
says it's sleeping and wow look notice
how you do LS I can clear this I can
click jobs i can see it's running it's
running in the background asynchronously
it's just going on and doing its thing
now if i wanted to i could foreground
this what this does is it brings it to
the front same thing as resume i hit
enter and notice it's now sleeping my
computer right here i can pause it again
and i can go through that process again
and just kill it if i want but notice
with this background i just have it
running and i don't have to worry about
it it's just doing its thing what's
really cool about that is you can do
that with any program you don't have to
pause it first so for example I could do
sleep on two three four and I can do an
ampersand at the end and hit enter
notice i'm good i do LS i do jobs i can
see it running and
can do my thing I can do whatever I want
now and this is just running in the
background and now I can foreground if I
want doing % 1 I can pause it with ctrl
z I could now background it let's
continue running again and doing
different stuff or I just want to get
rid of it kill it but notice and when I
type the command sleep on to all I had
to do is to start running in the
background was this ampersand doing the
ampersand at an end of the command runs
it in the background that is an
important one I use that quite a bit I
don't use foreground and background too
much most of the time what I'll do is
I'll start something in the background
and then I'll kill it later or maybe
I'll foreground it to see it and jobs is
pretty important to be able to see what
you have going on there so for the most
part what I'll do is for example maybe
I'll start a Python program or a server
of some sort and then I'll do like for
example if you're familiar with NPM
doing an p.m. start a lot of times when
you're working with web development
you'll start a server and I'll start in
the background and then whenever i'm
done i will then just go kill that this
allows me to keep this here or sometimes
i'll just open a new terminal tap let it
run but basically this is very nice to
have multiple processes like I can do
sleep one two three and I can do sleep
12 for who whatever and you can just
kick off a bunch of these things and we
can see the jobs and we can just kill
them if we want and that's pretty nice
get the first one jobs and now you can
kill the second one and the third one no
processes good jobs those are all dead
so that's how processes work in jobs you
can kill them foreground background them
and let them just run and they're really
nice so I hope that helps and you start
running stuff in the background because
it really does help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
