styling library called styled components
now this is a react library that helps
you write CSS on your components and
styling them and make it easier to build
style components and use them throughout
your application so normally how you
would add CSS or style a for example
some components is maybe something like
this we have a div here and then you
have the class name and you import a CSS
file so right here we just have regular
CSS we can see everything that's going
on is regular and then we import that
and then we use the class names that we
write in our CSS and then that gets that
style or sometimes you might see
insuline styles using the style property
and here like oops I can say like the
color I want so I can say color is red
so that's another way you can do it or
you can use there's a number of
different libraries that help with
styling and one of them is called styled
components and here's what that looks
like
so here's what an example of easing or
that there's no styled components on
this page all there is is me using
styled components so you can see well
you can see I'm using a theme provider
here but I have a button wrapper and
header text which are all components
they're all styled components and I'm
using them right here now these are
really nice and you'll notice how I'm
actually there's no HTML code here
that's very important and I'll explain
why a little bit later but what this
library really promotes is keeping your
components separate from basically your
logic which I really like so the idea is
to create what's called basically
container classes where you do your data
fetching or your putting together
different components and basically
separating your presentational view from
your logic so all these are
presentational components and I'm using
them in this little app to jsk
and so let's look at what these actually
look like so we're gonna start with the
rap component so this is a styled
component component so you'll notice how
I'm doing style dot div and I have these
back tics and this is actually CSS so
what this does is it creates a div
object and it applies this CSS to it and
it returns it so we don't need that
anymore but for app two when I am using
it here this is actually you can think
of as a div with the styles that are
right here so that's really cool and now
you'll notice if you have tried to out
components before I have this color
coded so that might throw you off
there's an extension you can use called
C Visual Studio styled components and
you get syntax highlighting if you're
wondering why this is highlighted here
because usually this is not cuz it's a
string anyway you can now write CSS for
your component which is really cool for
your components which is really cool
because now you can do some things if
you have users react a lot and have used
the inline Styles you might have noticed
how hey they don't have like for example
media queries you can't do like in my
app over here I cannot do style and pass
in like a media query and to that so I
have to actually write it in CSS so
instead of for example doing div and
giving a class name and like sharing
styles like that now what you would do
is you would use this wrapper component
all over the place instead of saying div
class name wrapper so that's what you're
doing instead and I'll explain in a
second why I really like that so that's
what this looks like
and I want to show a little bit more
what else you can do with this library
this is a basic example with only CSS
and nothing funky is going on with the
CSS and we are just creating a div now
the cool thing about the
you're pretty much replacing if you ever
use sass before anything that gives you
CSS power you're using basically
JavaScript instead so you'll notice in
my app - I have header text right here
and I have a button and in my button
here I have the primary prop on this and
let me just show you what this looks
like real quick so my primary here is a
green button and my other one my regular
without primary is blue and if we come
over here to the button component you'll
notice how I'm changing that is with
this string template right here so I'm
grabbing the props so you'll notice
anywhere that you want to do basically a
variable and your CSS with the style
component you'll notice I'm using style
dot button so the way you actually use
this library is you say style dot
whatever component you want anchor tag
image div h2 any of that stuff and
that's how you do it and then you pass
it a string like this backticks you have
to add and then right here you'll notice
how I'm doing a string template alright
basically adding a Java strick logic in
here so I'm grabbing the props and the
take a function you know always do it
like this so the props are getting
passed in I'm grabbing the props primary
if it's true I show this color otherwise
I showed this color so super simple and
that's how you see it works over here
and that's why this one is one color and
this is another color but you notice the
rest of it nothing special going on
regular CSS but now I can do this for
anything right if I want to maybe change
how the text is aligned maybe I don't
want text-align:center I could then put
another one right here and I could say
props and I say props primary
and then I can say whatever I want here
Center or otherwise it could be
something else I don't know it's the top
the other one I don't know what the
other things you can actually plug into
this are but you can add these anywhere
in the CSS which is really cool so
Center okay
so that is how you add basically based
on the props how you can pass in and
change how the style is looking so
that's pretty cool and that gives you an
edge right you can't do that with your
class name if I was doing this with the
class I would probably have to do like
class name you've probably have seen
this before like button button primary
is like how you would do this in
bootstrap so now I'm just able to say
button and then primary on it last thing
I want to show you theming so this is
something you can do with header I'm
doing with header text you'll notice I
have a theme and I have the font so I
have a theme provider here that's
wrapping and when you have a theme
provider that you have on the outer
layer any compiled component inside of
this knows about the theme so in my
styled components I can then see what
the theme is and grab the value so
here's my theme or I have a font so my
header text here my font family you'll
notice this is an h1 HTML tag my family
I'm grabbing and notice how I'm doing
props Dauphine so that's how you grab
the theme and then you can get any of
the things from the theme so I have
fought here so I want to grab the font
and that's how you pass in this so you
notice how I have two header text and
they are both getting this font here but
I could easily change this and then they
both change to that to Arial a different
font so that's pretty cool and this is
basically local and what I mean by that
is I can take this theme provider and I
could just wrap
one header tax and I could put another
header text down here so right now these
would both be the same right because I'm
using the same theme for both and this
works we can see it working right here
what I can do is I can create two themes
so this is theme two and we're gonna use
Arial for this font and I can pass the
theme too into this theme provider so
now this is the same header text
component right but now it's gonna be
two different fonts depending on the
theme provider that's around it so
that's pretty cool and you can see
there's plenty of implicit implement
implications with this I sorry about
that that you can do so I can't I know
it's not just fun I can pass in color
this can be anything by the way this is
any arbitrary key so I could call this
Bob if I wanted to but then in my header
text over here I would do theme that Bob
what matters is what you're passing this
string into here so we can see it still
works but of course you want to get it
use good naming but now I can have multi
to multiple different themes or replace
everything and you know all the styling
in the application at once by changing
this so you can see how this is can it
kind of be like sass where if you've
used sass or any like CSS preprocessor
where you can kind of globally have
settings that you can alter so I want to
change the font across my application I
can or across part of it so that's
really nice and they're powerful thing
about styled components is if grabbing
these props and I can mash this right
I can use theme in here I could also say
like overwrite this I could check if
like props dot font is supplied and if
it is that's what we do otherwise we
show that and in my app over here I
could just say font is equal to Arial
and so this should resolved it true and
then we're gonna show props font so we
are overriding the font right there so
there's all kinds of things that you can
do with this it's super powerful so I'm
really liking this I'm actually
converting an application I'm using
right now to using style of components
because I'm really enjoying it and the
thing that I like most about them is
you'll notice how there's no HTML here
so this is not HTML specific so what I'm
gonna start doing is have my create my
whole application like this and have
only my HTML and basically like a
components folder like this where I
create a bunch of different components
and then I use them in these class and
you know these components which I call
them basically calling container
components and this is where I'm gonna
do my data fetching and all my logic and
what this will allow me to do is I
create on react on the web once and then
what I want to do is have it for use
this same logic for react native so I
can also use it on the basically create
the same version of my website on an app
so what I would do is I would just
reimplemented our text looks on the
phone how the wrapper it looks on the
phone so I only implement these
components because they're different on
the phone but I keep all the logic the
same I still want my page to look like
this on the phone maybe you want to
change this up on the phone of course
but your logic what you're fetching that
won't that might be the same so you want
to share that so that's what I'm gonna
be experimenting with is using style cuz
styled components can work for a react
native as well so using that with the
style both web and react native and then
using Krane these components that now
work like this will work for react
native and for react so that's really
exciting and like being able to share
code between those would be amazing so
that's when we testing out in the near
future and I'll let you know how that
if it goes well and I'm able to share a
lot of the code or if there's some
things that I'm missing that I don't
know about but whether or not that works
it's great just using styled components
for the web too so if you haven't tried
out this library I highly recommend it
that's it for this video guys thanks for
watching the code is up on github
