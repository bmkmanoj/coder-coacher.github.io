is about from the title some shoulda
jump right into how this is going to
work so I want to make a mobile app or
web app for one of you guys now if
you're interested in getting a idea or
project made put a comment on this video
below and what I'll do is I'll pick the
top rated comment basically the idea
that people want to see the most that
are excited about and build that from
scratch now it doesn't really matter how
many votes if there's one comment that's
what I'm going to be building and a live
stream the whole process on youtube and
then i'll also save it to my channel if
you want to watch it later or you can't
be there life i'm also going to open
source the code on github so if you want
to see the project in its progress you
can see it being built in the commits
and all black stuff on github also i
just want to mention that it doesn't
really matter the size of the project
that you want or the idea you want to
see it can be really small really easy
or it can be really complicated i'm open
to all ideas whichever you guys want to
see i just want to show you how I'm
going go through development process
with you guys and build something that
you want to see built and that maybe
I'll be useful to tell me you guys so
any ideas are welcome and then if this
is helpful if you guys enjoy it if
there's a lot of ideas I will do more of
them I won't just do the first one I'll
continue doing them so feel free to put
multiple ideas if you want and then if
you're into interesting what type of
technology i'm going to use if it's a
nap i'm going to use react native it's a
webapp amis react and then if a back end
is necessary i may use feathers chasse
or flask now if you don't know any of
those are don't worry about it that's
just the technology i'll be using if
you're if that changes what your idea or
if you want to see an idea built in one
of these languages you can put that
below
or framework and lastly if you want to
keep up to date subscribe to this video
and you'll get an alert when I like
streaming and be able to see the videos
once they're up on my channel and if
you're interested in seeing the code
make sure to watch or star the github
repo I'll put the link in the
description below and you stay up to
date on the project I can see what's
