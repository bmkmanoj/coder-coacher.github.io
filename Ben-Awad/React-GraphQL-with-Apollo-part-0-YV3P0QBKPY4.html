going to show you how to create a
front-end for a graph QL back-end and
this tutorial we're going to be using
react and this is just the finished
product right here I'll be demonstrating
so you can create tacos this little
button and this makes a request to the
server using graph QL and adds the tacos
I can also log in through the website so
I can first sign up and call myself Bob
1 then I can log in I'll notice these
are still here and I can create secret
burritos so notice this is these are
correlated to your account so if I sign
in with a different account can create
FOB - I'm all gamers Bob - I'm you'll no
secret burritos are gone and often
that's how the talk is are there the
whole time because these are public so
you can see I have some authentication
going on here so you can see whose
secret videos belong to who also this is
implemented with apollo fronting library
apollo client allows us to make the
requests and this is just like going
into the servers interactive kree thing
that grass queue out what you do and
then creating objects so notice how
they're going to have to right now I can
create one right here as well
and create a tofu taco with parmesan and
mild salsa and so I should update the
client here and we see we have three
tacos and we can see Parmesan now my
quick curry talk that's just hard coded
what the talk is going to create the
purpose of this is to show you how to
interact with the graph QL backend using
a react front-end and how it interacts
with redux and storing it in your state
and that sort of thing so if you want to
take it we'll take a quick peek at the
code real quick as you'll see here's a
mutation so when we cook a button this
is what being run and you can see this
is just like how it is in the
interactive editor you literally just
put it here and then you run this
command you wire it up to this button
here so when I click this button that
mutation is run and update the state
when it's finished and it comes here so
if you're interested to see how graph QL
can be implemented in the front end
stay tuned in the next video we'll get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
