you how to create a flat list like so
and now I want to show you how to style
this and make it look pretty and to do
this we are going to be using react
native elements this is a really nice
library that makes it super easy to just
add styling to our applications kinda
like bootstrap for react native and now
the specific component we're going to
use we're going to download this we're
going to use the list element so we're
using the random user API which actually
gives us some images so I'm thinking
it'd be kind of cool to make a list like
this where we have the name of the users
and then we have a little picture that
they give so this is the API response
that we get and you can just see we get
the picture and we can get a thumbnail
of them if we click on that we can
actually just see it up up here we can
use this little thumbnail and render
that inter-app so that's what we're
going to do so let's go ahead and
download this I'm going to copy the URL
here it's called react native elements
and that is what we're going to type in
to our terminal so to say yarn
add react native elements and if we go
ahead and install the package and add it
to the project so I can go ahead and use
it and now it's a really simple step
here all we're going to do is we're
going to import list and list item and
this is from react native elements and
then coming back to the chrome for a
second we scroll down they have an
example of how it works so we just
imported and now what we want to do is
create a list item like so so we're
going to have a round avatar we're going
to rehab a key already but we put pass
in the title in the Avatar and we
already getting the first name and last
name we can also pass in the picture and
then thumbnail so come back over here
come in to render items and I'm going to
paste in this list item so instead of
you doing text
we're going to use that and then in the
title and key we don't need to pass key
because we're using key extractor and
then here we can copy this because we
want to grab the first name last name
and put that for the title and then in
the avatar here we're going to say item
dot picture thumbnail and now this
picture and that's it so we have our
list item here we're saving on a round
picture we're telling it which URL put
the picture and then the title and then
we just need to wrap this in a list now
you'll notice how we're wrapping the
flat list inside of a list and the list
component here is purely for style so
this actually doesn't do anything so
it's completely fine to do it like this
we're not bad performance wise it's just
for styling so let's go ahead and see
what this looks like
and let this finish building and I think
we did include our package so we mask
okay so if you got that air also which
you should be game there as because I
forgot we have to install one extra
thing that this uses and this is the way
you should see when you install it but
we're going to fix in a second so go
over to the command line and run this
command npm install react native vector
icons and we want to call react native
link so this library is used inside of
the other library but i forgot about
that
so just real quick you can also replace
this if you wanted to with yarn doing a
yarn ad instead of save and also if
you've never seen the and sign like this
used in command line this just means run
this command and then when that's done
run this command if we were to get rid
of it we could run this command and then
right after that we
kids say react native link react native
vector icons so run both of those
commands and then make sure you go ahead
and restart your terminal not your
terminal these guys so both this thing
and this go back and turn them off and
do react native for an iOS and then you
should see something like this and this
is a very quick fix we just need to get
rid of we're done using this styles the
default styles that come with react
native we can remove those and then we
should see our beautiful list just leave
that and now you see our beautiful is
pop-up so cool so that is how you can
style a flat list and react native and
in the next video what I want to do is
show you guys how to if we scroll past
you know the length of the screen you
know I want to load more icon so I'm
going to show you how basically
dynamically while scrolling load more
some people called lazy loading some
call it infinite scroll that is coming
up in the next video so I'll see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
