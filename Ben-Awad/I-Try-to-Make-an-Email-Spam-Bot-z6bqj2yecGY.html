gonna work on graph QL subscriptions but
something important came up so we're
gonna be diverging from that just for
today we'll come back to it tomorrow
what I need to do is make a email bot
that basically spam emails so do this
we're gonna be using Jaap mail here
basically gives us a random email we can
refresh here and you'll see how you get
a different email and I can just keep
doing this right and I'll get a new
email so my plan is to make a bot what
it does is a ghostess web page right
gets this email clicks check mails and I
can come here and I can write an email
back story of why I need this is
basically parking got really bad at my
apartments and so I was basically told I
can email this one guy and if enough
people email him parking should get
better so and it's okay to make a bot
they said the spam email them so that's
what we're going to do to help us with
this we're gonna be using nightmare this
is something like phantoms yes if you've
heard of it basically it lets you
control the browser so I can go to what
we're gonna do is actually go to this
site and navigate using nightmare which
is pretty cool so let's get started
let's try this guy out so I'm just gonna
get started with nightmare I have just a
blank project here random folder and I'm
just gonna say NPM an it to start off
the project we're gonna keep the
defaults
and then I want to install this I
believe it's just called nightmare okay
yeah so I'm gonna say yarn a yarn so MPM
yarn at nightmare and if you'll notice
they're using yield
we're gonna need babble node for this so
I'm gonna go ahead and install this and
then to use this yield syntax I can't
just use node I need to use a babble
node allow us to access that so and this
is done what I'm gonna do is as a dev
dependency I'm gonna install babble CLI
which allow us run babble node and then
we can get the specific stage two and
the latest of babble to help us with
this so and I can open in a new browser
a new tab and I believe I can do this at
the same time since one's a dev
dependency and shouldn't be a problem
I'm not sure what this is doing but I'll
show you what I'm doing with babble so
here is um if you didn't want to use the
yield syntax you could just use node and
I'm gonna go ahead and copy this and
create over here a indexed is file and
we'll paste this in and we're gonna run
the hello world and get that working
I don't be a sling setup for this
project yeah I kind of want to set up a
lint so it's nicely formatted so I'm
using the babel CLI so we just need to
run this to get that so I'm going to say
yarn add
dev Babel CLI and then also babble stage
latest and Babel stage gets to actually
it's I think it's called the preset I
actually don't remember what it's called
but if you go to Babel latest preset
it'll tell us what you type I can't
quite remember what it is
the package that we need there we go
and I dunno the other one is called
stage 2 so babble preset stage 2 so now
what was the warning we're really
excited that you're trying to use yes
into expensive making more usually
Pierce's babble is a preset that we
recommend instead npm install preset F
oh I actually have never tried this
before I'm gonna give that a try later
and see what that's about but anyway so
now I need to create a babel RC doable
RC
and I must say latest which is what we
just installed and also stage 2 and now
I'm gonna save this doesn't like the
yield syntax oak is prettier so we just
need to set up es Lent um so when this
is done installing what I can do so I
can say yes Lent an it and then we can
set up and actually we can go through
the options so I'm gonna use a popular
one cuz I really like Airbnb
um not using react I don't want to wait
to say that before this is done cuz I
want them to install at the same time
you know it is done I just didn't scroll
to the bottom okay JavaScript I want
that install so when this is done what
we're gonna do is actually instead of
Yahoo we're gonna put the OP meal and
actually you haven't tried sending
anything from this to make sure it works
so I really hope it works or else that
would suck
there's one other thing that I wanted to
do oh yes it was with nightmare so by
default I believe it doesn't show the
browser they should have a documentation
here area so when you're a nightmare you
don't see anything but there's a way to
actually turn that on so you can see the
browser so doc we don't want that
it's like show or something yeah show is
true so I'm gonna add that just as one
of the options here and alright so this
was done and now as always when you do
air B&amp;amp;B
yes lint for whatever reason the I guess
the latest version of es lint doesn't
work with the air B&amp;amp;B is lunch or
something so you have to just all older
dependencies using this so go ahead and
run that and this yvs lens setup and
then we can go ahead and run this and
actually we don't even need to have es
lint finish here before you run it cuz
that's just gonna check our code so I'm
coming here to not use lint but to our
package of JSON and here I'm going to
put a start
and then I'm gonna say delete this and
I'm gonna say Babel node and index not
gesture on our application so and I come
over here and p.m. start and okay didn't
work let's see what it's supposed to do
it goes to Yahoo gets the title
oh it's typing it's doing a search all
right so let's see what's happened I'm
assuming yield Oh couldn't find the
latest preset all right let's look at
our package of JSON we definitely
installed it so something weird happened
relative to director email are okay
somebody didn't try installing it again
so yarn dove okay so the yes let's done
actually before I do actually have this
install while we're doing it say babble
pretty set latest I've done this before
so I'm not sure exactly what is same
tasks as babble person please install it
with NPM preset saved
okay if this doesn't work what I'll do
is we'll just try Babel preset in
because that looks like it's what they
recommend using now all right so we have
maybe it's yeah I think that's it and if
I can't get Babel to work we'll just use
Dobbins syntax but yield is so much
nicer and hopefully we should be able to
see it so if we go to yahoo.com we can
actually see what this is doing so
you'll notice the syntax right here this
is selecting an HTML tag so input title
search so if we inspect this we can see
the search bar probably has a title that
matches up with that I'm guessing so
input type text and what was a title is
equal to search I don't see a title
equal to search on this which is what I
would have thought they were selecting
and I don't even know if their example
is gonna work then because the way
they're selecting it is they're looking
for an input bar that has a title of
search maybe there's a different one
that's hidden or something or maybe I'm
just missing it in these I think there's
a way to search for it I just say search
maybe yeah oh I think I just saw it oh
no it's something else
this is in the CSS
I'll see any titles so we'll run this
this might not work so we'll try
something else
all right that's done I'm gonna say NPM
start again and give that a try all
right still doesn't work I'm assuming
the same problem
oh no yield yield is a reserved word
that is very odd I'm trying this with
babble node I have a battle no global
yeah we should get the same error still
okay it's not liking yield for whatever
reason there oh because I need to have
this in like an async function that's
why so I'm gonna say Const mein is equal
to async actually we can just call this
make this an actual function so function
I think you need to put a sink in front
of it I actually can't remember function
main and I'll put this in there
have it over and then we're just gonna
call Maine and if I come over here I can
see if the ESL and server started up all
right looks like you'll enter messed up
so whenever it crashes you just have to
restart this and it'll come back up all
right now we should be able to run this
okay so it's not a problem with Babel
anymore looks like it installed now I
just needed to put in an async function
and we actually an area let's see what
we get
same thing maybe I'm you doing async
wrong I definitely have done this before
Kant's the main is equal to an async
function see if that works really still
the same thing Oh what am I talking
about
yield is different than I wait I was
reading this as a weight which is
different they're using yield
I don't know how yield works let's see
if a weight works oh and we need to
import import nightmare
from nightmare I actually don't know how
yield works with this I'm not sure
actually how to set up my environment to
get yield to work okay looks like we're
working okay so notice how we went to
yahoo.com this is pretty cool right so
it starts up a browser goes to Yahoo
looks like it's trying to type but
notice how we're getting a rejection
here that's because I think it's having
trouble finding this to type it in so
I'm gonna close this
so let's actually find what the ID of
this is and try it that way so it's
called a search bar so I'm gonna say ID
is equal to a search bar and now let's
rerun this and see if it actually types
it in so NPM start
don't only leaves we're on I'm embryo
it's just a little bit slow so cool see
how it typed it in same thing
notice how it's trying to click but then
this probably isn't working so let's see
if we can get this stuff finish notice
like you can just like complete the
whole transaction so button with an ID
like this so we can select this guy in a
similar type of manner so a button with
ID equal to this all right now do NPM
start and so we should type it and after
we run typing we should go ahead and
click this nice so we were able to type
and then search alright so we're done
with Yahoo let's do our real example of
what we want to do so I want to come to
this Jaap mail generator so we're gonna
go here looks like by the way await is
working ok that's good so after we await
what we're gonna or a cannot or we wait
after we go to this website we want to
click on check mails so we're gonna
inspect and see how to select this guy
so it's an input oh wow that's gonna be
hopefully there's no more buttons that
need a submit so we're gonna have to
submit okay good there's only one submit
so we can check by type see how generic
this is it doesn't have an idea class or
anything I can sometimes make it
difficult and what you have to do is
have to like search for the parent when
you're kind of like scraping like this
so we're gonna say
button and it's gonna have a type of
submit and I'm gonna get rid of this
stuff all right let's give it a try so
it should just go to the next page now
and it broke so it was not able to find
a but oh it's an input not a button my
bad
let's try that again so you know this is
pretty much the if you see this
unhandled promise and didn't work that's
like your only indicator and the error
message is not great either cool what
worked so next thing I want to click is
this right button right and actually
type the email address in so check mails
and then we can see what this is
so alright this is an anchor tag you
want to kick on with the ID of mail here
no spelling me select it come on all
right
WR mail all right so we click on that
then we're gonna come to an anchor tag
with an ID of WR email actually it was
an email just mail all right
I'll run this guy again then after we
get that to work we want to type into
here the subject so mail to and let's
watch it real quick
see if it worked click on right looks
like it pause looks like something might
have broke yeah
see what we did wrong
WR mail write WR mail what could have
happened is rocking it right yeah what
could have happened is the page to not
load fast enough we're gonna run this
one more time so basically unable to
find that they like we see it there
right so one reason why is because the
page took longer to load see how it
takes a second to load it maybe just a
little slow to load nope
straight does not work all right so it's
possible the ID might be different here
that is uncrown so you can actually do
inspect here I know there's a hotkey for
it but I can't remember it so electron
pull up inspect element inspect element
say eyebrow this is exactly what we want
there should be some kind of I believe
it there's a hockey - bring it up I
can't remember hit escape and then type
open dev tools if you've got the main
dev tools open what are you talking
about how do I open the main web tools
yeah
electrons a built-in feature called
inspect element electron hot key to open
inspect element enable with keyboard
shortcut no we don't come
it's this one
I don't want to type an app like this
there should be a way to just open it
all right I'm gonna wait I don't even
think that's the problem it should be
the same so a ID is WR mail WR mail is
the ID target is if mail so WR mail
there's only one of them if mail target
there's multiple targets with if mail
but this one okay notice also we don't
have to click on this right we could
just click on the href here but notice
how it says login this might be a unique
key that changes every time so what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna copy you
and we're in a refresh
and see what the value of it is so
if the value didn't change we can go
directly to the URL we don't have to
click on this link right so five five
seven eight act and yep same thing Oh
notice how the URL doesn't change here
that means we have to click this button
for it to work
huh get element style.display okay so
something interesting is happening here
the clique is not working right we're
not actually going to this URL I think
what happens if we do this oh that seems
to work huh notice how the from address
is up here what if I just like change
this to a Q instead of a u well notice
how it changes here we don't even have
to go through the process we can just
randomly put a URL here maybe guys I
just realized something that ruins my
whole plan they have a CAPTCHA right
here that's no good that ruins
everything actually now it doesn't work
at all
well let's see if I can get this part to
work typing these in and then I can it
try entering it this myself
this is this is terrible actually I
didn't even realize the capture I should
have done that all right let's just go
ahead and finish this so cuz I can just
type in the capture myself and I can get
this kind of working dang that's super
sad I should have looked for that first
but anyway so we're gonna grab this URL
so after we click on this we have our
random actually we could just go
straight here right
and then here you put in with the random
your our random email address you want
is so you go to that and then we're
basically want to type into these fields
so input ID email to type input ID equal
mail to
and what we're gonna type is my email at
email calm you know whoever wants to
send it to and then we can add a subject
if you want this is gonna be mail su so
input ID equal al su and we're gonna
type my subject and same thing for the
last one ID is mail txt all right let's
try it running that so NPM start we go
directly here type in our email type in
our subject looks like we're breaking on
the message it might be a text area yeah
it's a text area non input
okay it's pretty cool to watch though
just like filling out forms for you
and there's actually a way to make it
faster you see how it's like kind of
typing slow um it gives a speed type
type interval so the defaults 100
milliseconds which is really slow but
note when you do this I have tried this
before when you increase the type
interval or when you lower it so it
types faster it can get to a point where
it's way too slow or sorry way too fast
it actually doesn't type it fast or it
skips letters basically but let's watch
it type fast now so BAM and also if you
don't want to see it pop up you can get
rid of show and it'll just run without
popping this up this is just cool to see
right so let's try sending this to an
actual email so 10-minute email I'll see
if we can get this to work so basically
I need to find a place that generates
random email addresses that doesn't need
CAPTCHAs if I can find that then we're
good so change this email to that and
we'll do MPM start and let's try
emailing to this see if this works so GA
- incorrect email - oh you can only send
the OP email addresses oh it doesn't
even matter
that's kind of sad
well there goes that I guess let's we
can grab a op email address check inbox
I can send it to myself yeah it's the
same email let's call this let's do is
59 or 79 we don't even need this you
just at y'all mail calm sea Amen
send match it's and okay and now I'm
sure it was sent up here
okay so send email generate random email
address this is just a list random email
addresses
Freed's see we want something like this
that gives us like a free temporary one
and that way I could just have it just
like basically you was to doing so I was
looking at these and a lot of them just
like it's like for example this one you
can't send you can only receive I think
that's a lot of them so that's a bummer
all right I don't think this is gonna
work but at least you can kind of get to
see the power of nightmare and how
there's a lot of potential things you
can do with it right because I'm able to
just control my browser and do anything
so I can actually log into websites and
do whole things now take the nice use if
you want to do this besides just like
automating your browser something you
can use this for is actually logging in
to your own website testing out your own
browser and your own website and that
sort of thing you know
okay this was kind of sad decision work
I was really excited to get this working
I'll try to find a different one maybe
there's another email place I can use
they'll let me see it spammy what I'm
doing so it may not be a lot of places
might not allow this so I think I'm just
gonna end the stream here then
unfortunately we just kind of failed
this video it was just like I think you
got to see a little bit of nightmare the
like I really wanted a that would've
been cool for you to email working I
like making little box like this and
automating things I might do more of
this in the future hopefully it's I get
them working though but you know with
programming it doesn't always work out
as nicely I should check you just like a
vet the email next time to see if it's
even feasible so roblox come up like
this with dots because people kind of
like try to stop you but yeah tomorrow
we'll go back to graph QL sorry for the
little detour and
to see if I could get this to work so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
