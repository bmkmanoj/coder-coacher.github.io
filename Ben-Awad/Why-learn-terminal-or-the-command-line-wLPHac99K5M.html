why I like using the command line or
terminal and the things that it's good
it's useful for so the first thing I
like to use it for is instead of using
finder or on Windows Windows Explorer
the GUI applications to kind of move
around files that sort of thing I can do
all that in the command line so I can do
I can look at the files that are in any
folder on my computer I can move them I
can copy them I can you know look at
their contents and and also those are
just like the basic operations that you
can do on files you can extend it a lot
more and I'll do a lot more powerful
things with the terminal so for example
let's say I wanted to move all the C++
files off my desktop so just do like
that and then move them for example to
my downloads folder so as you notice I
did a start command right there so that
just grabs all the you know files that
end in the dot c++ so that's a pretty
short command and it moves a ton
possibly a ton of files now take that
compared to if I just click through my
C++ and then move them over manually
like this or something so this works I
only have four files here so it's not
too bad let's say I had 10 files 20 30
40 you don't want to be manually moving
them over it's a lot faster just type of
command like this to do you know just
move a couple files over and then you
can also extend this it's very flexible
so for example maybe I want to do Python
files instead I don't want to just do
C++ there's many different ways to
customize and do different things
another cool command I like to do is the
find command which allows you to look in
any folder so right now I just want to
check my desktop and I'm gonna be
looking for all files that have the word
hello in them and I could change this to
any word I want and I can just do it
like this this will go through every
file on my desktop and look for a file
has the word hollow in it and showed me
the why where the contents of that file
where it says hello and you could change
this to anything it doesn't have to be
hello and you can look anywhere you
don't have to look just in your desktop
so I kind all the type of searching you
know moving deleting files I now like to
do in Linux or in command line so the
other thing is using git so I find it
really easy just to do version control
through the command line
now there's gooeys you can use if you
like using the gooeys that's fine I find
it a lot easier and a lot faster just
doing it from the command line just do a
git add and then I just do a git commit
and I'm done you know and I can also
just pick the specific files that I'm
looking for um you saw I did dots start
at CPP to target just C plus five files
would somewhere doing that for other
commands as well so it's very helpful
the last thing I like to use the command
line for that I found extremely helpful
is for installing different software
following tutorials for learning new
frameworks or libraries a lot of them
use the command line to do that sort of
thing so for example take the create
create react app so this is for a
popular JavaScript library called react
that Facebook made and this is a tool
that you can use now let's say I wanted
to use this tool well I come to the
readme on github and I scroll down and I
see right here how you use it it
basically just gives me these four
commands to type into my terminal and to
run so if I didn't know how to use
terminal this would look very cryptic
and I'd have no idea how this works but
if it was familiar with terminal I'd be
able to understand it and this would
make sense and this is it's not just
this one library lots of things I'm sure
you've seen on github or other places on
where people just do the some give you
some commands that they want you to type
in so having an understanding of the
command line really helps for doing
different programming tasks like this so
and just another example that is
for example if you wanted to do the
Django tutorial this is for this is a
Python web framework that's pretty
popular um right here gives you a
command this is the first this is part
one very beginning first thing after you
get Django installed it wants you to you
know type Python in the command line and
then once you create a project using
this command line tool so and there's
many others I'm sure you've seen NPM pip
and many other things that have been
used to say install different software
or whatnot so those are kind of the
reasons why I like using the terminal
and the command line and found it super
useful in you know learning programming
and has helped in a lot of areas and I'm
really glad I spent the time to learn it
and I find the best way to actually
learn it is to just you know instead
every just go straight into it if I want
to move some files around I go and try
the command line and I try to move them
around do it like this and just see if I
can get it to work and I might be it's a
little bit slower doing it this way but
you know the second time you do it you
know you might have to Google how it
works third time you google it but then
eventually you just keep doing that
eventually you remember it and then
you'll be very happy once you have it
memorized you can just whip around the
command line doing different commands
with different flags and different
options and it'll be very speedy and it
will be very helpful so if you're
interested and learning the command line
and becoming more proficient at it and
so you can be a better programmer and do
all the things that I described before
I'm going to be doing a tutorial series
on how to use it so just go to the next
video and I'll show you everything you
need to know to become a wizard at the
command line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
