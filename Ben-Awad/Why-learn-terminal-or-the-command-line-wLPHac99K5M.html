why i like using the command line or
terminal and the things that it's good
it's useful for so the first thing i
like to use it for is instead of using
finder or on Windows Windows Explorer
the GUI applications to kind of move
around files that sort of thing I can do
all that in the command line so i can do
i can look at the files that are in any
folder on my computer I can move them I
can copy them I can you know look at
their contents and also those are just
like the basic operations that you can
do on files you can extend it a lot more
I'll do a lot more powerful things with
the terminal so for example let's say I
wanted to move all the C++ files off my
desktop so just do like that and then
move them for example to my downloads
folder so as you notice i did a start
command right there so that just grabs
all be you know files that end in the
dot c plus plus that's a pretty short
command and it moves a ton possibly a
ton of files now take that compared to
if I just click through my c++ and then
move them over manually like this or
something so this works I only have four
files here so it's not too bad let's say
i had 10 files 20 30 40 you don't want
to be manually moving them over it's a
lot faster just type a command like this
to do you know just move a couple files
over and then you can also extend this
it's very flexible so for example maybe
i want to python files instead i don't
want to just do c++ there's many
different ways to customize and do
different things another cool command i
like to do is the find command which
allows you to look in any folder so
right now i just want to check my
desktop and i'm going to be looking for
all files that have the word hello in
them and i could change this to anywhere
I want and I can just do it like this
this will go through every file on my
desktop and look for a file
has the word hello in it and showed me
the wat aware the contents of that file
where it says hello and you could change
this to anything it doesn't have to be
hello and you can look anywhere you know
if you look just in your desktop so I
kind all the type of searching you know
moving deleting files I now like to do
in Linux or in command line so the other
thing is using it so I find it really
easy just to do version control through
the command line now there's gooeys you
can use if you like using the GUI that's
fine I find it a lot easier and a lot
faster just doing it from the command
line so do get ad and then I just do a
git commit and I'm done you know and I
can also just pick the specific files
that I'm looking for I'm you saw lighted
dots start at cpp the target just c plus
five files would somewhere doing that
for other commands as well so it's very
helpful the last thing I like to use the
command line for that I found extremely
helpful is for installing different
software following tutorials for
learning new frameworks or libraries a
lot of them use the command line to do
that sort of thing so for example take
the create create react app so this is
for a popular JavaScript library called
react that Facebook made and this is a
tool that you can use now let's say I
wanted to use this tool well I come to
the readme on github and I scroll down
and I see right here how you use it it
basically just gives me these four
commands to type into my terminal and to
run so if I didn't know how to use
terminal this would look very cryptic
and I'd have no idea how this works but
if it was familiar with terminal I'd be
able to understand it and this would
make sense and this is it's not just
this one library lots of things I've
sure you've seen on github or other
places where people just do the some
give you some commands that they want
you to type in so having an
understanding of the command line really
helps for doing different programming
tasks like this so in just another
example that is
for example if you wanted to do the
Django tutorial this is for this is a
Python web framework that's pretty
popular um right here gives you a
command this is the first this is part
one very beginning first thing after you
get Django installed and once you to you
know type Python in the command line and
then once you create a project using
this command line tool so and there's
many others i'm sure you've seen em p.m.
pip and many other things that have been
used to say install different software
or whatnot so those are kind of the
reasons why i like using the terminal
and the command line and found it super
useful in you know learning programming
and has helped in a lot of areas and i'm
really glad i spent the time to learn it
and i find the best way to actually
learn it is to just you know instead
every just go straight into it if i want
to move some files around i go and try
the command line i try to move them
around do it like this and just see if i
can get it to work and MIP it's a little
bit slower doing it this way um but you
know the second time you do it you know
you might have to google how it works
third time you google it but then
eventually you just keep doing that
eventually you remember it and then
you'll be very happy once you haven't
memorized you can just whip around the
command line doing different commands
with different flags and different
options and it'll be very a speedy and
it will be very helpful so if you're
interested and learning the command line
becoming more proficient at it and so
you can be a better programmer and do
all the things that I described before
I'm going to be doing a tutorial series
on how to use it so just go to the next
video and I'll show you everything you
need to know to become a wizard at the
command line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
