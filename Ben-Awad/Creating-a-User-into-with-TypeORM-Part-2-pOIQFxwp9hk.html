register mutation today now before we
actually go in and fill in the logic for
register we need to make sure our
database looks like how it should so we
have not basically changed the tables so
they match what our entity looks like
over here and now I mentioned something
about type warm and it's synchronizing
it if we look at our arm config we have
synchronized turned on to true and what
that means is type warm is gonna
automatically change the database so it
looks like our what our entity looks
like but what I want to do is show you
how you can see what your database looks
like now and then how we're gonna change
it and you can see the difference
afterwards so I like to use this on the
command line but you can do this there's
multiple gooeys you can install that
allow you to access and see Postgres but
if we type piece equal here I now have
this little prompt and this basically
gives me access to Postgres so if I come
over here don't want config I I have
this database and this is the name of it
and I noticed that just misspelled it
but that's okay I do backslash see this
is for connecting to it and I put too
many I'm now connected to this database
and if I do backsplash to key it will
describe all the tables that my database
has so you'll notice it has a user and a
user ID sequence this ID this user ID
sequence is for creating IDs I'm gonna
have to worry about that
but if we do backslash D on user we can
actually see has an ID first name last
name and age and these are basically the
columns and stuff that it used to be in
the database before basically the
initial boilerplate type arm had and if
I want to I could select the columns
from this table
so select all from the user but we're
gonna see it doesn't give us what we'd
expect IV first-name lastname age right
when we select from this table it gives
us the current user as me so what's
going on with that well
user actually is a table there's
multiple tables called user what it
thinks it wants is to get like Postgres
users and not the users for this table
so we're having like a naming conflict
and we can get around that but the
easiest thing I like to do is just name
my table something different so if I go
into entity over here I can actually
change the name of my table and I'm just
gonna call it users so now when we
synchronize this we should see these
columns email and password and then we
should also see this table called users
instead of just user alright so how do
we synchronize well what we're gonna do
is in our index type script we are going
to create a connection and this is
coming from not net but from this from
type one and you can pass like all your
information of how to connect in here
like we could say our username and
whatnot but we already have our arm
config so it's going to read from there
all the configuration things and we're
gonna say dot then because this is an
asynchronous function and it's going to
give us a connection
so with this connection we can run
migrations and whatnot but we're gonna
worry about that later for now we can
just like ignore that as if it was there
so after we create a connection we're
gonna start a server so this is how
we're going to basically connect to the
database and whenever type arm connects
to the database it's gonna synchronize
it for us because we set it to do that
in arm config right here so now if I
were to yarn start to just start up my
server it's gonna go ahead and
synchronize the tables as well and we
can see that okay we have some problems
and that's in our resolvers so email and
password are not being used so it
doesn't like that
so I'm going to go ahead and say
comments we're gonna return email plus
password just so we use these variables
okay so we're restarting and we cannot
open schema to graph QL and let's check
out our index and I think I just need to
do maybe a dot slash here this has a
problem this has to do with like
relative pathing and typescript I can't
remember what I did to get this working
let me check a project I'll be right
back okay so I looked up what we need to
do and so the problem was with
typescript and for whatever reason the
path gets messed up so we have to use
the path module
so an import path from path and this is
a module coming just from node and we
need to import it like this I believe
and we're just gonna say path dot join
and winter pass in our directory name so
I think we just need to do an absolute
path thing which that should go ahead
and do for us and this will fix the
problem or it's unable to find the
schema it's not that the scheme is not
there it's just having trouble with
typescript okay so we now see server is
running on localhost 4000 so perfect so
it I think it should have ran and
updated stuff now we have logging false
I like to turn this on so I'm gonna turn
this to true and we'll actually see some
stuff of all right look at all this
drunk this is what type warm runs and
you can kind of see all the sequel that
runs so you can turn that on and off and
the arm config alright so let's check
out our new database so here I'm just
gonna go into P sequel and I'm just
gonna run the command I had up here and
I'm gonna describe so now we have a
user's user and user ID sequence so we
do have a new table so let's first look
at users and this looks perfect this
looks exactly like our entity should be
it's called users we have an ID which is
a u UID emails varchar' and password is
text we we noticed that user is still a
thing though it didn't get rid of that
so that's something I guess we're gonna
have to clean up ourselves if we want
you but I think we're gonna be doing
lots of different changes to this so
we'll be cleaning this up in a future
video because it's very easy with
migration so when we do migrations also
clean up like these extra tables we've
left behind
but okay so we have our database table
in order now we can actually create
stuff so in our resolver over here we're
gonna actually put the logic for
registering a user so first things first
is I want to take this password and hash
it because I don't want to store the
password as just text in the database
because if we get hacked then everyone
knows all these the hacker knows
everyone's password which is not good so
to hash this we're gonna be using bcrypt
and we're gonna be using the JavaScript
version because this seems to just
install and run better on everyone's
computer so we're just going to copy
this and then we're gonna be doing the
async version so if we come over here we
can see the different ways of how we can
use this we're gonna be checking the
password when we log in but we're
currently just needing to hash it so
we're gonna be using bcrypt hash this is
the async version we can either use a
callback like this with function or
it'll return a promise if we don't pass
a callback and so we're gonna use the
promise and use async and wait and it'll
go ahead and hash it for us so to make
this function asynchronous I just say
async in front of it and now I can
basically await any asynchronous code so
I'm going to say Const hash password is
going to be a weight
and I'm going to import beaker and now
you'll notice we have a little red line
and it's usual we've just installed a
JavaScript library we're gonna have to
install the type for it so yarn add app
type slash bcrypt J s and then dash D at
the end for dev dependency alright so
and it looks like it doesn't have a
default import so let's just add the
star cool so now I'm gonna do bcrypt dot
hash and the first thing is the thing I
want to hash which is the password
second thing is the salt and from what I
heard I think you want this 10 or
greater so we'll put that 10 and that's
enough we all now get the hash password
here or this is asynchronous but we're
waiting it so that means we're gonna
wait until it's done and then when it's
done what we want to do is just create
our user so we're going to grab our
entity so if I just type user I can auto
import it so we're getting this user
from entity user and I'm gonna say
create and now I'm gonna pass in
basically the things I need to create it
which is the email and the password
which is going to be the hash password
and then here at the end we're just
going to return true now the other thing
is this is also asynchronous or at least
it returns a promise so I'm gonna wait
this until it's finished and now we can
also grab the return value of this which
should be a user but we're not actually
doing anything with the user right now
so we don't worry about that ok so I'm
gonna save this
and I'm going to start up my server and
the next thing I'm going to do is go
over to the graph QL playground and try
this out so we're going to go look host
4,000 so here we can try all the graph
QL queries and the one you want to try
out is that register command that we
just did and I'm going to create a new
tab here I want to connect to my
database and show you guys we currently
have no users so select all from users
and we can see the ID email password
there's nothing zero rows but when I run
a register mutation email is going to be
Bob all calm and password it's going to
be Bob all right let's run this we get
registration was true if I come over
here I select we have still no users so
this is odd let's come back over here
and see if something crashed or whatnot
and it doesn't look like it just like
straight did not oh I'll tell you why I
forgot
that's how type Oram works so this does
not actually create the user in the
database so I make this mistake all the
time I'm coming from sequel eyes which
when you run create it actually runs it
it basically just creates an object
which then you can do stuff with but it
is not in the database and I actually
think does this even return a promise it
does not return a promise and the way I
knew this didn't return a promise is I
just hovered over here and I see this
colon here it says it returns a user and
not a promise so after that to actually
save this in the database I have to call
save like this and if I hover we can see
this does return a promise so I can just
await that
okay so we're gonna try this again I
don't have to restart my server because
we're II have it automatically
restarting but now we are creating the
user and then we are actually saving in
the database so no database calls are
made until we get here and that's
verified as you can look at over here
all the code that's getting around and
no sequel was run
okay well top back over here and we'll
run this select query after every
register this guy again all right so
we're just gonna run the exact same
mutation and we get true and we select
all and now we can see Bob we can see
the UUID added and we can also see
here's the hash two password so perfect
so it was successfully added so yeah I
don't forget to actually save it when
you're doing things and type warm but
that is it for this video guys we are
now able to create users now we're not
quite done with register so there's some
things I want to add off the top of my
head there's three things I can think of
first I want to send confirmation emails
so when we create a user it just send
them an email and be like hey do you
exist is this legitimate email secondly
we should be able to handle duplicate
emails so right now you'll notice I gave
no constraints on this being unique or
whatnot which is gonna cause a problem
so we're gonna fix that because we
should have unique emails across like I
shouldn't be able to create Bob at Bob
calm twice and then lastly right now to
test this I just went over to graph QL
playground but what I wanted to do
instead is set up just and so we can
just automatically test this and I think
that's what we're gonna do in the next
video and set that up so we can actually
test the mutation and see the value
getting in the database you do it that
way so let's sit for this video guys
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
