have some really cool things i want to
show you and terminal we're going to
learn about redirecting and that's super
duper cool but before I do that I want
to show you how to use the Korean echo
so that way piping will make sense okay
so if you do echo and then you just type
things it'll just print it to the what's
called this is called standard output or
as you can see it's just a little you
know to your console or to the screen
underneath terminal underneath your
prompt if I can echo different things
you know I can echo been I can echo
whatever text I want to basically it's
super simple I just put the word echo
and I put the what I want to echo and it
prints it out right well let's say I
would like to change this for example I
would like to echo then to a file
instead of that going to hear i would
like the text been to be sent somewhere
else you can do that piping so i could
redirect been to a file called abc.txt
so what this is about to do is it's
about to create a file called abc.txt
and it's going to store the texts pin in
it so if i hit enter and do an LS we see
we have two things infinity Y and ABC up
txt this is what we just made and then
if we do cat abc.txt we'll see Ben is
there sure enough if we echo been a wad
now week at ABC we'll see been a wat is
there so what this does is it takes
whatever output that would be sent to
standard output in the command before it
and instead since at the ABC and it's
not at all limited to just echo command
any command whatsoever so for example I
could cat ABC normally when I Duke at
ABC it would send the Texas standard
output writer to the console or two
terminal right there right well I could
cat ABC and I can send it to
dog and if i do LS I now have a dog file
and if I cat dog now this has been a one
in it cool so you can do this with any
file whatsoever and now what else you
can do is let's say instead of creating
the file like this notice how this
overrides the file for example let's say
I create another one called catwalk Oh
cat will put it in cat so if we see LS
week at cat we see cat cool so inside a
file called cat is cat now if I echo or
if I cat cat we should see cat and we do
if I cat cat and redirect that dog and I
cat dog you now see the word cat but
let's say I want to instead of replacing
the file i would like to append so I'm
sure to include this real quick let's
say I would like echo been Awad and I
want to pin that to dog so instead of
doing this I would do double saw what
was it called arrow if we just do cat on
dog will now sleep in a walk and we can
do this again and we see dog it's added
on there again very cool is looking nice
so we use the single to make a new file
and send to a file we use double for a
pending now the next thing I want to try
to show you is this is now this is you
can do this on any command that you want
any command ike i do before i could do
LS LS and stuff right here well I could
do LS and pipe that to a file called Q
and now if I cat q it shows all the
output right there like any command you
want instead of sending it to the screen
you can send it to a file it's super
cool so I have this program called
infinite this is a Python program if we
come over here all it does is it goes to
a thousand and prints the numbers so if
we run this real quick python infinite
you see it just prints a bunch of crap
to the screen now what this pipe is good
for is a lot of times when you're
running programs you'll have output or
something and maybe you want to capture
that and save that to a file
so infinite does all this crap I want to
save it to a file let's call it let's
call it big numbs and we'll just let
that run for a little bit and it's going
to save all the numbers to the file
called big nuts now what I'd like to do
i'm just going to clear this off is if i
do a count on big numbs man it just
spits out a ton of numbers that's
disgusting it's going to run for a while
I just want to like start looking at the
file right what you can do is you can
use a command called les in the name of
the file so I think where do we put a
big numbs and you'll notice it'll just
show us the top of the file and similar
to the man files we can use J and K to
move around so j to go down k to move up
if you hit the spacebar it'll page down
and if you hit Q you'll get out if we go
back in we can just go through and see
the output of this file we can see the
contents of this file and this lets us
look through a file rather than just
being dumped to a screen instead of
catting big number and look inside of it
like that so that's pretty handy ok so
these are pretty important commands they
just showed you pipe or not pipe excuse
me this is a redirection this is to
append and then less will let you then
look at things and of course echo as
well just put stuff to the screen if you
have any questions about how the pipes
are not pipes sorry I keep saying pipes
you learn pipes very soon those are very
cool and important as well too but
redirection if you're in question on
redirection let me know what give me and
confusing topic leave me a comment below
and I will be happy to answer your
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
