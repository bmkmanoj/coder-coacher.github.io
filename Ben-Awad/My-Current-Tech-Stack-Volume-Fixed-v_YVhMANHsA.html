application where it's basically kind of
like a troll clone um but not really I'm
going to be doing other stuff later this
is the progress on it and I can't talk
about what I'm using to build this the
tech stack for it and also what I'd be
using if I start a new application today
what do I pick the back in front end and
kind of all the layers now of course you
want to pick you know the right tools
for the right child but this is just
basic you know fits a lot of
applications this is what I use for most
things so right here I have the readme
for the project and then I have the
stack that I'm currently using so the
stack is here on the front end the UI
all that is done with react jf and then
all the other stuff that you know that
happens in the back all the
functionality of the site is done and
expressed and to help things out I use
something called graph QL which is not
necessary you can make it without graph
QL but it in my opinion is very helpful
and can expedite coding and improve
performance and lots of good things that
I really enjoy and then using post for a
sequel as the database now in this video
I want to talk about what I wire and
pick each one of these and then if I
didn't pick these what I would use
instead and why I'd picked something
else so for the front-end I'm currently
using react now why I picked reactions
basically that's the first one I learned
and I liked it a lot like one it's
really popular I'm really enjoying using
it I really like coding in it so I'm
super productive in it because I'm
enjoying myself and I want to code in it
more and the code is super fast the
applications are super performant when
I'm creating it I've had a good
experience using it so I want to
continue using it because I'm happy to
switch if it's something's not working
so the all these pieces are working
really well for me right now so that's
why they're here
they weren't working really well for me
I'd switch them out I'm not afraid to
switch stuff out and I don't like just
using something that doesn't work I
definitely won't do that so if I wasn't
using react though the next thing I
would look at was reason and this is
kind of basically react because with
reason you can do react and this is if
you haven't heard of it it's kind of
like a Oh camel like language and you
can do react with it so I would check
out that and then I would check out Elm
these two guys is what I would check out
next if I didn't do react they just seem
really interesting to me what you'll
notice is like pick languages that are
fun and also work well so I enjoy
programming I want enjoy the language
I'm using so if I don't like the
language I'm going to get rid of it I
know a lot of people crap on JavaScript
I actually like es6 the features that
come with that so that's enjoyable and
what's nice about javascript is you can
code stuff really fast but again there's
lots of problems javascript of course
but I like to enjoy the language so I'm
doing reusing react right now and elm
looks really fun to play with in code
with so I would check this out I felt
what I'm doing react but really enjoying
react right now so sticking with that
now we'll skip this because this all
comes at the end database I really
wanted to use a sequel database I want a
relation relational database basically
the two other options I see are graph
databases and no sequel databases graph
databases I mean I haven't actually ever
tried one but I figured you'd really the
reason you'd use a graph database is if
you want to represent your data as a
graph if you want to represent your data
some like something else it doesn't make
sense to use a graph I don't think all I
think that's a very specific sub domain
of databases that is not general and
you'd have a specific you know maybe a
specific niche website you'd use that
with
but the other option is no sequel but I
actually haven't spent on time with no
sequel I fiddle around with MongoDB a
little bit but that's about it
I've mostly used sequel all the time and
I really like post for a sequel it just
seems to be working the best for me and
it seems to be the most performant has
the most features and it works really
well I'm very happy with how Postgres
has been performing so very happy with
that but if I wasn't using Postgres
sequel I probably check out MongoDB
would probably be my second thing to
check out but I'm really happy it's
closed grass I don't know what other
sequel I'd use I don't think I'd use my
sequel it didn't seem that good I don't
think I'd use the Microsoft server I
know that I figure what they call but I
know they have a sequel version I don't
know what it's called though but I
wouldn't use that probably just I
haven't heard good things about I've
just heard tons of good things about
Postgres that's why I picked it in the
first place and it's working really well
for me so I wouldn't want to switch it
out right now really enjoying it I like
using relational databases they seem to
work really well really performant so so
far with everything that I'm building
I've enjoyed that so that's why I have
using that right now and then this part
this part is interesting because it's
really a package because the server I'm
using is Express but I'm really only
using Express because I want to use
graph QL so first I want to talk about
why I'm using graph QL and that's just
because there's so many great things
about I actually don't want to talk a
ton about why graphic you look so great
because there's a lots of other videos
about that but once you make the
decision that you want graph QL I might
think it makes a lot of sense to use
Express because the libraries that are
graph field libraries a lot of them are
in JavaScript so it makes sense to pair
with an express server because it's
super easy and fast States and they set
up I'm using Apollo data there is a
third consider company I think yours the
company behind it but
Paulo data makes a server that I use
with it that's very very nice really
enjoy it makes it super fast to set
stuff up so I really enjoy that so
that's why I'm using Express
I wouldn't use Express if I wasn't using
graph QL I want to check out Phoenix
this is an elixir back-end server I
would probably be using this I would
definitely try it out and see how good
it is because I haven't been oh I've
actually carried a little bit I haven't
done too much Oh
so I would definitely check out that and
what something I have used that I have
enjoyed is Django very nice framework to
use I haven't ever tried Ruby on Rails
I don't know Ruby but I have tried
Django enjoyed that would use that would
you try out elixir and Phoenix but if
I'm using graph QL I'm picking Express
it's so simple super it's just so nice
to set a third row that's so fast like I
spend like no time on the backend I feel
like I'm adored my times on the front
end and that's a nice place to be when
you can just set stuff up in the backend
really fast and that's what it feels
like with graphic you own express is
just really nice I spend very little
time working with the framework so
really enjoying that so far and that's
the stack I'm using that's the stack
that's going to be used to build this
Trello clone here and would I be using
if I was to build a production web app
today and I'm actually using the stack
for a web app that I'm building right
now so more news about that when that
comes out later but this is what I would
be using and am using and I'm really
enjoying it I recommend you guys
checking this out but honestly useful
works for you and if something's not
working switch it out of my
recommendation that's what I like to do
just tinker stuff
fine-tune the process that you like and
I think all of this is very personal to
what you enjoy doing what you enjoy
using at each level of the stack some
people might not enjoy using graph kill
that's okay I think it's fine to use
something else so that's it for this
video guys thanks for watching in the
next video we're digging but more into
the software architecture of this
application
so I'll see you guys then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
