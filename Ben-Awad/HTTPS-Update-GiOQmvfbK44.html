on the ACPs situation
I am super close to getting it up and
running I think but I'm not quite there
yet so I'm gonna give you an update out
where I am and how I got here so last
time I was stuck with not letting an ec2
instance we were using let's encrypt and
they were blacklisting ec2 instances so
to get around that what you have to do
is create a custom domain now I already
had a custom domain from awhile ago that
was just singing around it was an old
one that's gonna expire soon called not
real chefs so I used that as my let
script encrypt host and this bypassed
this the first air and let me just tell
you guys I have been running into all
kinds of errors and this is way more
convoluted and complex than I ever
thought it would be to try saying this
up and I'm thinking it's because we're
using let's encrypt I was thinking to be
easier than it was but I think it
actually might be easier to do it in a
different way
but anyway this bypassed the first air
so now we were able to at least attempt
for let's encrypt to try to connect to
our server and do the authentication
exchange thing to create the
certificates and all that jazz because
we had a legitimate domain so I then had
to set up this domain with ec2 and have
not real chefs point to that to so that
was error number one we got past but
then I was having trouble having let's
encrypt connect to my ec2 instance for
some reason and I wasn't sure quite why
and the first reason why I couldn't
connect is because I was running just a
regular engine X all right this is the
nginx that we were using for our website
to redirect traffic to our Express
server and what I needed to do was have
a different engine X Server sit in front
of it so we create a specific engine X
server to handle HTTP in HTTP that
basically sits in front of our other
nginx server so we're actually running
two engine X instances and if you
remember docker gin
that is the thing that had to do with
engine X proxy and basically writes
configuration file based on docker
containers and all that stuff I'm using
the engine X template from this copy and
pasted it you'll notice over here I have
that installed on my computer and so in
my docker compose file engine x-gen
instead of pointing at my site template
I'm pointing at engine X template so I
can't I need to have this intermediate
engine X that's specifically just for
HTTP and now this guy's gonna sit in
front of this engine X instance and so
this guy is still using the my site
template but now we have broke out the
HTTP part for this engine X instance to
handle it so hopefully it should take
this and route it here now I'm not quite
sure how to tell this HTTP engine X
service to route it over here
I believe you can use virtual and even
virtual port these are special
environment variables to have this guy
over here route traffic over here and so
I believe I'll route the traffic to
localhost 8001 so I binded in the next
8001 and of course it's expecting to be
open up on 80 so we find from 80 to 8000
and 1 this number I picked arbitrarily
it could be anything pretty much but
they just need to match up here anyway
so we have this guy sitting out in front
and originally I just had this the
port's here open up at 80 80 and 443 443
not have this IP address out in front so
that caused another problem we were
having basically having trouble
connecting again even though I set up
this nginx in front of it that was
supposed to be able to get the requests
from let's encrypt and handle the
handshake that needed to be done so next
thing I had to do was add this IP in
front and then once I added this IP in
front and this is my ec2 IP address the
one IP address I used SSH and not this
one but I I tried that first and then I
had trouble binding to port 443 when I
run docker compose up I'd have trouble
binding to this port so what I did what
what I thought is we were having a
problem maybe with this ec2 instance the
IP address so I made an elastic IP
address if you just come over here
elastic IP address you can create a new
one
and bind it to your ec2 instance and so
now you use this IP address instead of
this and I also thought maybe this is
security groups so in my security groups
over here I created HTTPS and allows 443
and we still had trouble the trouble we
had was binding the port for whatever
reason it still combined it I thought
those things would fix it turns out
there's a hold another thing you have to
do over here I just found on Stack
Overflow you have to add this line into
your sis control conf not really sure
what it does I guess it lets us bind to
that address I'm not really sure quite
sure how it works but it did work for me
I was now able to bind onto 443 which
was perfect which is what I wanted so
I'm not sure if I actually had to create
an elastic IP I'm assuming I had changed
the security group to open it up for a
GPS but again not quite sure you
but yes so now this is where I'm at it's
finally able to let's encrypt is finally
able to connect but take a look we have
reached
I was trying this a bunch too many
authorizations recently with let's
encrypt so basically they blocked me for
a little bit
I've been rate limited so I need to wait
for that to wear off and I'll try again
tomorrow but it's good that let's
encrypt can at least connect to the
Machine now correctly and I'm able to
bind to the port I think I'm really
close with this configuration but as you
can see this is pretty convoluted just
to get HTTPS working also you notice I
have a two networks that was another
thing I was just trying to get at
working to have let's encrypt connect
it's for a while I had trouble getting
it to connect not sure if this is
actually needed or not you might just be
fine with the single network and I have
this guy on web net and I yep I have
this kind of web net too so this is
where my config file is that right now I
will upload it to github if you want to
check it out I might change when I
actually am able to connect to let's
encrypt and see if it works
but hopefully by tomorrow I'll have su
PS up and running I'm thinking I should
just have you know run this again it
should connect and go through and be
configured my next concern is once I get
HTTP working is I need to make sure
traffic is correctly being routed from
this nginx server to this nginx server
and then he redirects it to Express je s
over so not sure if that's all gonna
work flawlessly if it gets too complex I
might just drop this all together
because on this is way too complicated
than it needs to be but I'm so close to
finishing and I think so we'll see how
it goes tomorrow and next time when I
try this out I think I'm not gonna use
let's encrypt at least and with docker
it's making it too complex I think we
can basically sign our own our own
certificates and get that working easier
but that's it for this video guys I just
want to give you an update of where I
was at with this and yeah what's going
on with it and I'll link this stack
overflow in the description below if
anyone's trying this and having troubles
with it
like I am that's it for this video guys
