to be going over my vim configuration
now I don't actually use them I use neo
of em which is actually very similar to
them but there is it they cleaned up the
codebase a little bit and tried to make
it basically a better vent so there's
some slight differences and I'll show
you why I use this so normally and if
your event user you would be used to
configuring them with the EMR C which is
in your home directory I have it in a
little different place because I use
neogan and first off before I begin if
you have no idea what vim is this video
might be a little confusing but them is
for basically a text editor for your
terminal so I can just like type text my
terminal right I have them open you can
close it I open it okay um and if your
of them new and you don't know how to
get out of them really quick hit colon
and then hit Q and then Q and maybe it's
a bang sign if you need to be wrote
stuff okay so that that's what it is for
beginners that's how you exit out um if
you want to learn more do BEM tutor
it'll teach you everything and you know
if you're interested in doing them one
reason why I should use them if you're
interested in ever tried it is there's a
bunch of cool hotkeys okay now let's get
into the demo RC so for me I think I had
yep it's in my home folder duh config
dot neo of em or not dot slash me of em
and then an it and here's what it looks
like so I'm just going to walk through
what plugins I have and what I'm using
so I'm using I think it's just called
plug plug me or something which is the
bit what I use to install plugins very
easy I just type plug install to install
new plugins as you see I put a little
comment to myself so let's just go
through these guys so this is actually
the main reason why I'm using neova for
a plea deal plea is a four
auto-completion and a few other kind of
cool things and it actually runs
asynchronous so it's really fast you can
do you complete me for them and there's
some other ones but I like them as much
they're kind of slow and I had a really
time hard time configuring them or just
getting them to work in general we're
deeply just plugged in it work pretty
well sometimes it gets kind of gross to
configure as well and set up but for the
most part I really like it in one
feature I really enjoy is when you're
typing like a string and you're doing a
file path it'll actually pop up the
files so it knows I'm in my home
directory so my new dot slash it shows
me all the stuff in my home directory I
can go in to see my documents to a slash
and I can see all the stuff there in my
documents so very nice
so it autocompletes basically your path
on your computer and then of course
other Auto completions for just Python
and other things so I can do pop out
basically little compan here that's what
nerd tree is usually there I'm sure
there's a hotkey for it I just type
nurture usually because I don't have it
memorized I really should have memorized
though
but basically pops up over here a nice
little sidebar that most ideas have or
webbed not what's called text editors
then go here click you know go down the
file path tree that I want to if I want
to okay next one is sin tastic this guy
is used for syntax checking I'm in
Python I'm trying to print something and
maybe I do this it'll pop up hey you
meant to do print and just puts a red
line that just you know basic stuff here
normal used to Anna IDE or a text editor
then surround this is kind of an
interesting one let's say I have the
word I have a word here and I'm like hey
I need to surround
with quotes so with one little swoop I
can hotkey I can wrap it around so
that's what them surrounded is and
there's actually a ton of other ways you
can surround things this is basically
the only use I use I was surrounding a
word mostly because a lot of times I'll
have like call a function maybe print
something something this is not a great
example um but sometimes you need to
wrap stuff in by way it's not just
quotes so like let's say we wrap that
head parenthesis for some reason I could
do that
most time I say use it for importing or
like something like expanding a
JavaScript so prop maybe that's a
property and I can wrap it like that so
that's what them surround us there's
much other things um then airline adds
this little guy right here you'll notice
it's gives me some and some information
you can see it better here nor tells me
if I'm in a normal load can type in here
and also shows weather shows get stuff
and that's pretty much all I use it for
I don't even know what some of these
other things are pretty much I just use
it to know whether I'm an insert or
normal mode and what branch I'm on and
that sort of thing and get them colors
solarized if you notice I have like this
dark Solarize this theme is called
Solarize of this dark thing is doing and
just like that plugin or like this color
scheme and that's what that does nerd
commenter so this one I might actually
have to create a file so for example if
I'm in Sam dot py and let's say I have a
bunch of code here and I just want to
comment this out I can basically do a
hotkey and comment all those guys out in
one swoop and it also works that all
the direction to uncomment yeah do more
than one basically I do a visual select
and then I just comment what I want Auto
pairs um this guy notice how it adds a
another parenthesis right there I only
did one type or I'll i just opened the
parenthesis open the curly and it
automatically closes it for you
um and also I think maybe when you're
typing print yeah so it doesn't add it
like like I keep click here I keep it
just like hops over this is kind of hard
to see but basically if I push the right
parenthesis it hops over the other
pregnancy but basically uh completes it
the MT mocks navigator this is for when
I'm split screening and T MUX you don't
really have to worry about this notice
this little line in the middle there's
another panel over here and if I just
want to hop between these two basically
it sets up a hotkey for me to do that
and let's close that let's close that
that's what that does um pretty much he
used T MUX it's it's okay I I don't tend
to do that as much with T MUX anymore
probably could get rid of this because
net I'll just usually split the pain and
then and also I don't really need to be
using team luxe as much anymore because
neo them lets you actually use a
terminal inside of them but I also just
haven't learned how to do that yet so I
need to learn that do pleat go and Jedi
this is for Python Auto completion this
is for go I used to do go a little bit
that's why I go here omit actually this
is something installed but I haven't
actually used yet one of those things
I've been meaning to learn but haven't
Amit is a language that lets you
basically do JavaScript things I don't
even know what my thing is maybe it's I
think it's something like this okay I
hear you
so like basically lets you do in that
commands so M it is a language for HTML
it basically makes it faster so it's
like if I want to make ten list items
you can just do that and it creates them
for you so it's for HTML I actually
haven't used this yet because I don't
know in it well but it's kind of like
one of those things I have there that I
want to use because it's way better than
typing out HTML then Paul polyglot this
is something actually these two I just
installed to try out indent line
basically adds this little line I
actually don't even see it I wonder if
I'm comparing it wrong let's see if it
shows up hi oh all right yeah it doesn't
I think it pops up a nerd tree let me
see if I go to an actual file no okay so
it's not even configured right right now
what it's supposed to do is create like
little indention line so like there
should be like a little line right here
and maybe yeah there should be a little
wine right here saying how far this is
it dented over but it's configured wrong
or something and I just haven't bothered
to fix it then polyglot is for basically
language support for a bunch of
programming languages so it's syntax
highlighting that sort of thing okay so
that's into my plugins now I'm going to
get into some of the hotkeys and just
kind of the things that I set I'm just
going to kind of go vaguely over these
guys and the rest of this real quick and
just mention the important stuff these
are kind of basic the incremented search
or some point out some the ones I can
specifically talk about cuz I might also
you don't remember what exactly they do
and I just kind of put through there a
while ago in there kind of nice so
incremental search once you start typing
it starts searching so if I'm looking
for I don't know call notice how them as
I'm typing it's getting highlighted I'm
jumping to different things
whereas it doesn't wait till I'm done
searching no highlight obviously that's
not working
getting highlight oh you know actually
it is working once I hit enter it does
not highlight it anymore
whereas normally would I'm just setting
up tabs
I don't like swap files this is an
important one
so I remap xscape so an insert mode get
out escape I like to click JK to get out
of there
these aren't that important these aren't
that important this guy I use a lot so -
for example to delete a whole line
oops to delete a whole line you do an
uppercase D right so you would think we
do an uppercase Y it would copy the
whole line but it doesn't for some
reason so this is just the default this
just basically says adds that
functionality when I do uppercase Y it
copies the whole line the rest of this
stuff is some basic saying thing
this is just some junk when I run into
problems that I've put in it's not
really that interesting that's pretty
much it for the setup I'm going to put
this on github if you'd like to use my
setup honestly I'm not super happy with
my setup right now I'm actually using
vim not big often right now and I'm kind
of actually exploring different options
of IDs and text editors I'm liking what
is that Visual Studio code actually I
don't like that it's made with electron
it feels kind of janky and slow
sometimes but it works really well for
react and really well for linting
formatting syntax highlighting all
itself well syntax highlighting works
finding them too but very easy to get
stuff set up like look how long my vim
art my the stuff that had to change
configure very easy to setup with
everything and I liked that
I'm kind of committing a sin too and
trying Emacs not sure if I'm going to
like those or not but we'll see what I
end up sticking with I also want to
recommend if if you also are looking for
making a vehm are see to check out this
site this this is decent if you just you
don't want to spend time making one you
can kind of select what language is use
so I've been using JavaScript and Python
a lot and then you can select neova more
of them depending what you use and then
it generates an automatic one for you
that's really nice
and get you set up so if I click that
I'll show you just gives you a RC file
you can just plug right in and that's
very nice
sets a lot of good defaults so I
recommend trying that out or you could
try mine out if you want I don't think
it's that great and I'm honestly if you
have suggestions also by the way there's
any probe end users let me know what
what do you guys use um am I missing a
plug-in I should be using what do you
guys what is your guys's VMRC look like
let me know in the comments below I'm
very curious what everyone else is
what's like a must-have I should be
using that I'm not so yeah that's it for
this video guys thanks for watching if
you have suggestions for all the videos
you'd like to see I'm thinking of doing
a video showing you how I set up my
visual studio code cuz I'm going to work
quite nicely for react and doing some of
the es7 stuff so yeah well let go saying
if you're interested if yours anything
you'd like to see I'm gonna put a link
in the tradition below you can comment
on my Trello and what out to make new
videos I'm taking the top voted on
Trello and making a video about that so
that's it for this video and I'll see
you guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
