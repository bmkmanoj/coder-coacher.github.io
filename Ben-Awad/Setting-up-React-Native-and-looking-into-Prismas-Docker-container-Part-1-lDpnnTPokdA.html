react native application today and then
at the end of video we're gonna be going
over my sequel and how you can see what
your database looks like with Prisma
this was a suggestion by one of you guys
that I thought was a great idea so
that's what we doing at the end so I
skipped a few steps here I already set
up create react native app and I set up
yes lint and I'm not gonna show how I
set up the emulator but if you're
interested in any of those things and
you don't know how to do them I'll put a
link in the description below so when
you've done that so make sure you go
ahead and run the create react native a
boilerplate to get to this point and you
can optionally set up es lint you should
see your files looking like so on the
left and then you should have an app
guess with this stuff here so first
things first we're gonna add Apollo
client to this which is gonna allow us
to make graph QL requests to the Prisma
server and I'm gonna create a source
folder where we're gonna keep all of our
code because we don't want to put it all
in just a pas so I'm gonna create an
index dot JSP L which is gonna be
basically our home and then I'm gonna
create a routes folder which is gonna
store all our components are all our
pages and maybe a better name instead of
routes you could call this pages since
we are creating a react native app not a
website but it'll be okay so now in my
app dot GS I'm actually just gonna
delete oops
and my app dog is I don't even know what
I just clicked
but we're gonna delete all this stuff
and you notice how we just need export
defaults something so I'm going to
just import app from the source and then
we're gonna export default it export
defaults so we're not actually gonna put
any code in the app guess everything's
gonna live in source we're just gonna
keep this here to have it that's how
create react native app gets your
application it looks for this app dot
J's file ok so then in our index IJ s
over here is we're gonna set things up
so an import react from react and then
we could do react native stuff here
whatnot but really we're just gonna
setup Apollo so we need to run this over
here so this is the setup guide for
Apollo and react so we're gonna copy
these these are the things we need to
install if you want install things
independently like they said you can do
that too I'll put a link to this in
description if you're going to
copy/paste this as well alright so we're
gonna say yarn add and run this make
sure you're running this on the client
and not the Prisma server and then we're
going to just set up so I'm going to
export to default here we're gonna have
a little function and
we're gonna import routes from dot slash
routes and we're gonna have render our
routes tagged here we're gonna set that
up in a second but here we need to set
up our Apollo client okay so we did that
the next thing we do is point our HD
view link to the server and then we
create a provider like so so notice how
they do new ACP link and then they put a
URI inside of it we're gonna just need
to remember that and we can copy this
stuff here now ours is slightly
different because we're doing this with
react native and not react so we won't
be using this react to Dom stuff but we
will be creating a provider like this
and we can get rid of that okay so here
we just provide the URL which for us is
gonna be localhost 4000 and I don't this
we might need to change this I don't
know for sure if this is endpoint I
don't know like usually when I create
the server I have it on like / graphic
UL I think how Prisma does it is it's
running here and now make sure you don't
have this running on the Prisma server
but then this is this guy right source
index this one so we're running on
localhost 4000 make sure you point at
this server not the Prisma one that gets
set up okay so that's good we have it
pointing at the right location here
we're creating an in-memory things and
it doesn't like it
I'm assuming it's because we used this
one where we did the Apollo client
preset I've actually never used this
preset before so I'm wondering whether I
want to check out the package.json I'm
assuming Apollo client reset I'm
assuming it just has Paulo client reset
you said I'm guessing it has like Apollo
client HP link and in-memory cache yep
looks like it's the case are all inside
of this package instead of installing
them individually
okay so we're setting up our client here
and then we are passing a provider so
now we're good to go so now whenever we
want to we can make graph QL requests
and our components because we have
Apollo client setup and now in our
routes and next is over here I want to
set up react routers so this is what
we're gonna use for routing feel free to
change this out with a different
solution if you prefer with react native
but this is my favorite because I worked
for web and native and it's almost the
exact same thing so we're gonna install
this library react router native and I'm
just gonna be taking the code from the
basic example that's a good start so
yarn add paste that in and then we're
gonna copy that here and we're gonna
import react from react and then we're
going to set this up so we're gonna
export default this and we're gonna set
up a native router on the outside and I
like to only render one route so if the
only one over under one route you can
have a switch switch which is gonna be
outside because with react you can only
have one child at least how native
router works is you can't have for
example this and then
basically there's no dibs in react
native but they don't like this cuz
native router needs to have a single
child in here and this has two children
right one two so if we want to put all
our routes we can put all of our routes
inside of switch but we can't do it well
we sawed off the wrap switch but we'll
do that in a second so now we're gonna
have our routes and we can see how they
do it here so they have our routes
the reason we're using switches only one
route gets rendered and they have a lot
of other junk mixed in we're not gonna
worry about this stuff until later cuz
this is them actually rendering
components and whatnot but we're gonna
be doing this and notice how this looks
exactly like the web version if you used
it no let me copy it well that's okay
where you have a path and you actually
set a URL path and we're gonna push to
that but they just have a container
which they call view so we're gonna get
the view from import view from react
native okay so we have our switch which
selects only one route and then we're
gonna just have a view which is now
gonna have all the routes and I think I
think I can have I don't know if switch
can have multiple routes in it
automatically I think it can if we in
air what we'll do is we'll come back and
a lot of you tag around things so
actually I'm gonna move that for now we
might come back to this I forget how it
works but anyway we're gonna have
multiple routes here so one of them is
gonna be sign up and we can import that
from dot slash sign up
and the other one could be import login
now we haven't created these kids yet
but we could add them under our out here
so sign up yes and blogging yes and
we'll fill those in later here I'm gonna
be using exact and then we can set the
path and so we're gonna say now normally
you would put like so I'm gonna make set
the component is equal to sign up now
normally you would do like slash sign up
as the homepage I'm sorry you wouldn't
have this as a homepage normally I would
have like a path slash sign up right but
I'm actually gonna make sign up the home
page because that's the first route that
I would like our app to go to and
initially we're gonna render on the
slash okay and then I'm saying exact
because if we get a path like ABC if you
get rid of exact it'll also render this
guy because it's there's a slash and
there's a slash here so exact is
important to add and then we're gonna
have a login in one of our lawyer
okay this is all I wanted to set up for
this video
we have routing and Apollo client all
set up what we're gonna be doing in the
next video at least with react native is
us filling out signup and maybe we'll
get to log into and we'll actually make
a mutation now I want to go over with
you guys the docker stuff so first off
Harry have stuff running so if I do dr.
LS you can see this is the docker
container that's running so when we told
Prisma to deploy our application locally
to docker we see this is what it creates
so this is the service Prisma sets up
and this is a server that takes our
requests now they also need a my sequel
database so they spin up a my sequel
container now we might be interested in
hey what is going on with this my sequel
database we want to go might want to go
check it out and there's actually a way
for us to do that so we can run docker
exec and then we do pass dot IT and this
is we pass the ID and then we can
specify a command that we want to run on
this container so what I want to run is
bash and the reason why I want to run
that is it allows me to run bash
commands inside of that container now so
now I am inside of the my sequel
container right here and I can run
command so I can do an LS I can see some
stuff and now what I want to do is
connect to the my sequel database and
check it out so there is a my sequel
command line which is already installed
in the docker container so if I run my
sequel but bummer its installed but we
had access denied we don't have a
password so we need a password to get it
in so I found the password and the
password is a graph cool
so that allows us to get in and notice
how I specified the password with - P
and then I said Graff cool like that and
yeah so there's no space and - P
specifies the password so make sure you
used to do it like that and you should
be able to log in I'm sure sometimes
some of you are wondering how did I
figure out that the password was Graff
cool and I believe this is what your
password should be as well in yours so
this is something I actually had to go
look at the github code for Prisma now I
knew when setting up a my sequel docker
container the password you set in the
docker file so I took a look at their
server code and I noticed that there was
a doctor and docker compose I first
checked out docker and looked at the
docker file but there wasn't really
anything helpful here this is where they
were setting up but looked like
something with Scala which is what they
use so I went back and I checked out
their docker compose and salt looked at
their dev die amel and I noticed BAM
there's their my sequel root password
it's this sequel internal password thing
but I had no idea what that was so I
searched this repo see if I could find
what the value of that was and here we
are
voila it had exports equal internal
password graph cool so I gave that a try
and it worked so that's how I actually
discovered how to get into this guy next
we can do show databases and we can see
all the different databases that this my
sequel instance has inside of it so I've
created a couple different Prisma things
so you see there's more than just one
and the one we care about is this guy
right here so we can copy him and now I
can say use to connect to it like that
and now I can say show tables
and now we can see all of our tables and
this is the product table that we
created in the last video and I thought
this was kind of interesting you can
select all from user for example there's
actually a user inside of here named
Sara this is not something I created
this is just came with it by default I
was just kind of funny but anyway we can
say describe product and product as
capital P so this is the table that we
created right so we see everything here
and what I can do is I can come over
here to my client and e-commerce
database so whenever we make changes
here and deploy it it changes stuff over
here
so for example if I were to delete price
and then if I want to see the change
over there and I'm currently in client
so I'm gonna go up a folder and then go
into e-commerce and I'm gonna say
prisoner I deploy and if I do once this
finishes running we're gonna have a
price dropped from her database right
deleted a field price so now we see
price here I were to describe again we
noticed how the price is gone so it did
indeed affect the database and change
the schema for product and of course we
want to keep price there so I'm gonna
add it back and run Prisma deploy again
and it'll affect the database so pretty
cool so you can actually access the
database in this way to come check it
out and query it if you wanted to so you
just need to connect to your docker
container grab the ID and then get into
the my sequel database like so so now we
can do describe the product and we
notice how price is back so perfect so
we were able to affect our database and
it did indeed affect the docker
container in my sequel that's it for
this video guys I hope that was helpful
and you can kind of see it actually does
do things and in the next video we'll
continue on with our react native
application and creating the signup page
