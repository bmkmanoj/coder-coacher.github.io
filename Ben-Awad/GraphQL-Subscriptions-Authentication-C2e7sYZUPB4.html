graph QL subscriptions working and all
the bugs fix and now we're able to say
hello and we see it pop up here and we
can switch channels and everything works
nicely now I'm going to go back and
fine-tune this and secure it because
right now anyone can subscribe to our
new messages subscription and we really
want to lock that down and only let
authenticated users and users that are
part of the channel or the team access
it so I'll show you this vulnerability
right now
so we are able to subscribe to it using
subscribe to more here but you can also
subscribe to things and graphical but to
be able to subscribe to them you have to
make a quick change to our server so the
graphical endpoint we just have to point
to where our subscription endpoint is
kind of like how we give an endpoint for
the graphical endpoint our subscription
endpoint is a separate one and here we
prefix it with WebSocket and it is at
localhost 8080 one similar to right here
and then we do slash subscriptions
because that's our path their
subscriptions and this basically just
tells graphical where to subscribe so
now over here if I give this a refresh I
can subscribe to the new the new channel
messages so I want to subscribe to
channel one
and because we're not stopping anyone
from subscribing we're able to subscribe
okay so we get this little message let's
say your data will appear here and if I
type stuff like this is a private
message it pops up here so we're leaking
these message to anyone who subscribes
so we want to make sure and lock it down
and say only people with JWT tokens and
people that are part of the team can
access this so how do we do that
well here's how Apollo suggests doing
that you can actually pass a token as a
connection parameter kind of how we're
doing it with our queries and mutations
so that's what we're gonna do so I'm
gonna grab this connection params and
this is where we create our WebSocket so
this is an our apollo guess where we're
all basically setting up our apollo
stuff and here's our WebSocket links
we're gonna add that as an option so on
our connection pram we're gonna have a
token which we get from local storage
storage get item and we're gonna pass it
into token and then we're also going to
do our refresh token refresh - all right
so then we need to be able to handle
these guys these tokens on the server
and the way it suggests doing that is
with a on connect function so we're
gonna copy this on connect function and
we put this where we initiate our
subscription server so here's my
subscription server and to paste this in
here we can get rid of all this stuff
I'm just gonna say return true and right
now I'm gonna comment everything out and
then just console dot log the connection
params so you can see what's happening
alright so here's the logs now watch me
as I subscribe to this we just subscribe
to it here is what that looks like so
here is an empty one here's where the
tokens at this token is coming from our
front-end over here and if I just
refresh this again will subscribe again
and we see the tokens are here and if I
subscribe again from graphical we get no
tokens
I didn't didn't know your refresh there
you go subscribe again we get no tokens
all right
so we can basically make a decision oops
we want to do this on the server side we
can make a decision here destructuring
to get the token and the Refresh token
so basically what we want to check here
is first whether we get a token and a
refresh token token and refreshed token
if not we'll throw an air missing auth
tokens and then here we want to verify
both of these tokens and this is gonna
be the same procedure that we do up here
with our add user middleware so I'm
going to copy that and paste that in
here so first we're gonna verify the
token and we have a user now I'm gonna
create the user up here so I'm gonna say
let user is equal to null and then
I'm also going to make this an async
function and I'm going to call this
payload and I'm gonna say user is equal
to payload user I'm in here we're
getting the Refresh token from the
header but we already have it from here
so we can delete that here by refreshing
the tokens that's good because we go to
this catch block if our regular token is
invalid and then here so here we're
actually returning the tokens to the
user to refresh them I'm not sure how to
actually do that from WebSockets I don't
know if you can just send tokens back in
the request you might be able to but I'm
not sure as of now so we're just just
not gonna refresh it when you do
WebSocket connections all we're gonna do
is say user is equal to new tokens dot
user so there's two ways to get this
user
we either verify the token and we get
the user or we get the user based on
refreshing the token so here we're gonna
check if user we're gonna say if not
user we're gonna throw new air missing
off or we're not missing invalid auth
tokens right okay so here we know the
user is authenticated at least so let's
give this a try and see if we're able to
subscribe okay so ideally we should get
an error here let's see and we don't so
let's see what's happening with that I'm
guessing the tokens are getting passed
in so console dot log token
we saw it being passed in as empty so
I'm not sure why this is not throwing an
air it's even undefined here it's just
not throwing I guess maybe let's see if
we throw in here so console dot log
throw err maybe graphical just doesn't
show the errors oops so on that yep
we're supposed to be throwing in air and
even says unhandled promise rejection
missing off tokens okay so that is
working correctly it just didn't show it
here throw everything let's make sure
we're not actually able to still
subscribe so a good a does not show up
here so it did block it and I'll make
sure it look like the subscription for
this is still working yep we're able to
connect okay because we do have a token
and a refresh token alright so the next
thing we want to verify is that the user
is actually in our team whether they're
a member or they're the owner and it'd
be very so right now the way we have it
set up is kind of annoying to be able to
make that check because right now we
don't we kind of have it split up
between two things our team so let's go
to the malas real quick
our team has an owner field with a
foreign key owner and then we also have
a members table which has the members so
I would first have to check whether the
team owner and then check if they're not
a team Omer whether the member of the
team and I don't want to do two checks
like that that's kind of annoying so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
refactor how we're doing this instead of
having an owner on the team we're only
gonna have team members and then a
member it's gonna have a property of
whether they're the owner or not whether
they're an admin which however you want
to say that so that's we're going to be
doing in the next video is change
this up so that we're able to handle our
use case over here better because really
what I want to do next is really
something like this
so models dot member and then just find
one and say where and we're gonna say
constant is equal to a weight and we
want to just check right here so we
don't care whether the owner or not we
just care if there exists so we need to
pass in a team ID which I don't know
where we're getting that we'll say one
for now and also we have this user so
we're gonna say user ID is it just equal
to user to ID and so we need to be able
to pass the team ID in as well so that's
something we'll be doing in the next
video as well so and then we'll just say
if member or if not member so we didn't
find a member that was part of the team
that they're trying to subscribe to and
this actually could be a channel too
when we go to private channels but we
didn't find a user or a member of the
team and with this user ID so we're
gonna throw a new air they shouldn't be
able to subscribe so in our next video
we're gonna finish this up and get this
working we're gonna be putting a dynamic
team ID here and we're also gonna change
this our member table over so it's more
generic so that is it for this video
guys
thanks for watching and as always the
code will be up on github
