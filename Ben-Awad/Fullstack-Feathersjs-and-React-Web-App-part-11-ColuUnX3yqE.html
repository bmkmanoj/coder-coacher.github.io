want to wrap this thing up and make one
last page right here
I'd like to click on my username and I'd
like it to take me to all the recipes
that I personally have had to website
because I can also log out log in as
their user and add different ones I want
to see which ones I added myself so this
is gonna be very similar to the
preferred this this component itself
we're just gonna filter by recipes that
the owner it's himself made so let's go
over to the react client so I'm just
gonna make a new component called my
recipes and I'm just going to import
react on it from react report card
semantic UI import recipe card this is
the custom component that we made so
we're going to be using that extends
component and then in the constructor
we're just going to call an action to
download the recipes so this prop stop
fetch my recipes this props user data
and get the idea so this is the ID of
the user we're gonna pass it in to this
function and this is gonna help this is
what we're going to use to search for
that users recipe this is a a function
that we're about to make interactions so
and then render is very simple we're
just gonna return the cards that are
being displayed so it took me a card
like group and we'll just do four per
row excuse me five per row and close up
for a card boob and then here this stop
props whenever we save our recipes we'll
all call it my recipes and then we're
going to map each one to a card so we'll
get the recipe each recipe and for each
recipe very a recipe card passing in the
props and then a key to make it unique
and then the recipe is equal to recipe
and just close that and we're all done
we just need to export default my
recipes so okay so let's go to our
action and let's create that action
export function
fetch my recipes passing in the ID of
the user and we'll return type our
action will be called my recipe fetch
requested and we're just passing in the
ID now let's go into the saga
now here Wayne two similarly oh I have a
call my fetch SP and we'll have a bitch
my it's called my fetch recipe saga and
then we need to make sure to fork it
so my fetch recipe saga and then we're
gonna be looking for the action my
recipe fetch requested and when that
happens we're gonna call my fetch that
doesn't make sense
fetch my recipe sounds better and say
call fetch my recipe call touch my
recipe that makes more sense so fetch my
recipes saga nice and then right here
all we're gonna do we're gonna get my
recipes
once we call fetch my recipes and that's
a function we're gonna have to add to
the API passing the feathers app and
just the ID of the user
um and then after we do that we're not
gonna change the page at all we're just
gonna say my recipe fetch done passing
in my recipes so we're gonna have to
create a reducer for this and add this
to the state and then we also need to
make this function right here let's come
up here save fetch my recipe recipes
let's add that to our services API go
down there to the bottom it's gonna be
similar to our find right here
except it's gonna be called such liars
fees take an ID we're gonna be using the
same service instead of looking at the
ID though we're gonna be looking at
owner ID and we're not gonna limit it
and then we pass back the data perfect
now let's go add the reducer so that's
going to be in reducers and then we're
create a new one called my recipes so
the function minus P the state it begins
with no recipes just an empty array and
then we're gonna be looking for the
action type my recipe veg done in return
action dot my recipes and then of course
have a default state or we just return
the state and then just export default
my recipes now let's add this to the
route reducer which is our index so that
was my RS piece my recipes now this will
stick us the ad to the state now we need
to map it to our props which we can do
that in our components app right here so
my recipe is equal to state my recipes
so comma there okay so our component is
all set up
now we just need to link it and give it
a router so we're gonna go to index now
for this all we're going to do is create
a new route
okay so if we go to it's called profile
slash recipes and we'll do the my recipe
my recipes yeah Zenoss and let's require
authentication because you can't look at
your own recipes if you're not logged in
now let's go back over here let's see if
that works so yeah refresh the page and
go to what we call it profile special
recipes and we can see the one recipe
that I've added as test at test com
super cool the rest of them do not have
the user because we added them before we
are adding users to the database but
what we can do is we can just log out
let's make a new user test 3 test com
just login with them let's create a new
recipe test 3 our team oh um let's do
carrots carrots are good and then our
description will be broccoli submit that
we see that there and if we go to
profile recipes we see your test 3 and
only test 3 very nice so I just want to
link up this right here so if we go to
now what that'll be our navbar styles
and components and then navbar
so components AB bar and then you come
down here it would be in the logged end
State right here we want to add a new
way
we could add a new link or we can on
click why don't we do at on click let's
do what we did below where we did the
browser history dot push and let's just
go to profile slash recipes so now I can
just click here and go to the recipes
that I've made so we have a working
recipe box website now we can log in log
out we can add recipes view the newest
recipes here see the recipes that we
added
we're authenticating users and
validating the JSON and we have a
working application and react that's
talking to our own Feathers server that
we set up so this is looking this is a
great start for an application and I
think I'm going to leave this here if
you guys have any other features you'd
like to see or any other questions or
comments about this please leave a
comment below and I be interested in
continuing this further if there's any
on our features you'd like to see added
so thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
