the smart way comm and today in this
video tutorial I'd like to give you a
short introduction to the angular 2
forms features so we are going to build
a new application of starting from
scratch introducing a simple data entry
form and then I'm going to show you how
to use angular 2 two-way data-binding
to access the values which are entered
in the form by the user at the same time
this tutorial is the beginning of a new
angular 2 series where we are going to
focus on angular 2 forms so stay tuned
so to get started with a new project the
easiest thing is to simply use the
angular 2 command line interface to
initiate a new angular 2 project and the
angular command line interface comes
bundled as an NPM package so first we
need to make sure that angular command
interface is installed on our system and
to do so you can simply use the NPM
command like I show you in the following
so we need to say execute it as a super
user and then we say npm install - g and
then we are giving the name of the
package and that is angular - CLI so
executing this command will download the
package and install angular client on
your computer I have already completed
the herbs installation so I do not need
to execute this command right now but if
you have finished the installation
successfully you should check if you
have a new command available and the
angular command-line interface is caught
by using the ng command so if I say here
ng and hit return you can say that
angular command interface is printing
out all of the options we have here and
that is that are quite a lot as you can
see here and now we can use the ng
command to initiate our new project so
that we can start building a sample and
implementing an angular 2
form so we say here ng and we give the
new option and the new option is telling
that we want to initiate a new project
and the third thing we need to give here
is the name of the new project and we
call it the angular - promise - app ok
now I executed the command and the as
you can see here it's saying that it's
creating a bunch of files here in the
new project folder and after having
created those files it's running NPM so
it's saying installing packages for
tooling via NPM and now at the
background it's done downloading all the
NPM packages all the dependencies we
need and installing those dependencies
in the node modules folder within our
project ok now you can see the
installation of dependencies has been
completed successfully so the command is
saying that all the packages have been
installed and now we can switch into the
new project folder and the project
folder is named as project so it's
angular - forms - app and here you can
see that we have an initial project
structure here included and now we can
use the ng command again and say ng and
give the option
serve to start up the web server which
is hosting our angular 2 application so
by using the command in that way we can
check if everything is installed
correctly and the application is already
running here you can see it's starting
up and it's running a web server on
localhost port
4200 and if when I'll switch over to the
browser and open localhost for 2200 you
can see it's saying app works so we are
sure that the installation was executed
successfully and the application is
ready to be extended with our forms
implementation okay in the next steps we
are going to implement a simple angular
form which allows us to enter book data
consisting basically of three properties
we will have a title input field an
answer input field and an input field
for an optional ul which allows us to
enter a link which points to the website
of that book and to do so I've already
opened up atom and the first thing we
are going to implement is a model class
for books and we do that by creating
first a new file here within our project
structure and we do it inside the source
folder and inside the app folder and
here I played a new file and I named
that file book Model Ts and start
implementing by saying export because
later on we want to import that book
class
glass book and I include a constructor
and then declare the properties we want
to have as public constructor parameters
and the first thing we want to have is
an ID because it's always good to have
an ID and that is of type number then we
do need the title information and title
of course is of type string then we need
the author of the book that's also
string and finally the UL as a string
and I can say okay URL maybe as optional
here and then it's finally implemented
so that is our model class and we will
use the book datatype later on in the
next steps when we are going to
implement the form okay the next step
which is needed to prepare our
application for containing an angular
form is that we need to import the
angular 2 forms module in our
application and the place where we do so
is in app module and app module
implementation by default is available
in the file app module dot TS and here
we can see it's already prepared so we
do not need to edit manually it's
already prepared here we have an import
statement which is saying ok forms
module please import forms module from
the angular forms package and then the
second thing which is which is important
for our application is that we
make sure that forms module is also
added to the imports array of the ng
module decorator which is applied here
to Z AB module class and as I can see it
here forms module is already part of the
imports array so it's the same here we
do not need to add it manually the
reason is we have been using angular
command line interface to generate the
skeleton of our application and this is
the default implementation of F module
it contains farms module here is an
import statement and then adds it to the
app module scope and by adding adhere to
the input arrays it simply means that
the features which are packed into forms
module are available to all the
components belonging to F module and at
the moment as it's only one component
sets AB component but in the next step
we are going to add a second component
which will contain our form
implementation and then and then we have
to make sure that this component is also
added here to the declaration array and
0s becomes part of AB module and then it
can fully make use of the EF forms
module features here I am back at the
command line and now we can continue
with the second step next we will
generate a new component which then
includes the template code for our form
we want to display in our application
and we can easily complete that step by
again using angular command line
interface and using scaffolding to
generate our components so we do not
need to add the files manually and
implement a DM the skeleton code which
is needed for the component manually we
are just using scaffolding and again I'm
here in the project directory and then I
use the ng command in the following way
I am using the opportunity G stands for
generate and then I'm saying component
because I wanted to generate a new
component for our application and then I
needed to give the name for the
component and I simply called a book -
form and then hit return and now the
scaffolding process is taking place and
it took a second and then we get the
information back from the command that
in total four files have been added to
the project here in the source app book
form folder and as you can see here this
new subfolder book - form has been
created within the upper folder and this
this folder is containing all files
belonging to that new component and we
have a CSS file an HTML file and testing
spec file here and the main
implementation of the typescript file
and that is all we need and now we can
switch back to the editor and start
implementing our form so back in our
editor you can notice first that here
the new subfolder book - form is
available with an app and here at the
four new files and then another thing
which is important is that we can now
open a module again and now you can see
that - adaptions were made to choose
this file automatically so book form
component here is this import statement
is imported from the book form
implementation in book - form component
dot ts and this makes book form
component available here in that file
and as this is a prerequisite for
heading book form component here to the
declarations array and this step is
although done automatically
without needing to add anything manually
it's a label here and that is important
because with book form component being
added to the declaration array it
becomes part of app module and this is
the reason why we can now make use in
the book form component implementation
make use of the form features because
forms module is imported here in app
module and as book form component is
also part of app module it can make use
of the forms module features so next we
can come to the step of implementing the
template code for our HTML form and the
template code is in asserted in the file
book - form component of HTML because it
is the external file where the template
code for the book form component is
stored and as you can see here it's a
very simple default template and the
first step is to delete that content and
then start right away with implementing
a new form so first let's bring in a div
element and give it the class container
and was in that development let's say at
headline saying okay here is our book
form and then in the following let that
the form tag so we are leaving action
empty for the moment and within the form
tag we bring in another development for
the first input group or the first form
group and we need a label here and the
label should be for the element title
and the label should be title as well
okay and then we need to of course
put element and the input element should
be of type text so it's okay we give it
the class of a form control and an ID
the ID for the first input element
should be title because we are
implementing the input element for the
book property title here and this field
should be required so we give the
required attribute here we do not need
to assign a value so that's the first
form group so we can copy that block for
the second group and we have to adapt
the label here it for the field author
the label should be also as well so it's
again type text and the IDE it's also
and then we have a third element okay so
we give it the ID well the label as well
and then we say okay here are d for the
input field as you are and finally our
form should have a submit button so
let's implement the button
okay and the button should be of type
submit' and we are using some bootstrap
classes here again to bring in a nice
formatting its button and button default
which we want to use and the button
should here from the text submit on it
so that's finally our form okay now that
the template code for book form
component is ready let's switch to the
implementation of book form component in
the typescript file here you can see we
have the component and decorator
attached to the book form component
class and we are changing one bit here
in that file and it's a selector it's a
per default it's set to a / - book -
form and we just wanted to have book -
forums that's sufficient for the moment
and to make sure on that the book form
is in is displayed basically we need to
do in Clute at the book form by using
that selector in the template of the of
app component because that is a main
component which is loaded first in our
application so let's switch to app dot
component on HTML and as you can see
here is the default implementation of
the template and we can delete all of
that code and just include one element
and let its book form because now the
name of the element is corresponding to
the name of the selector we just
specified in book form component and so
by using that element here in app
component minute components template we
are including the content of book form
right here
okay now we need to remember that if we
go back to our book form template
implementation here we have used some
CSS classes from the bootstrap framework
and bootstrap as a dependency is not yet
available to the project so we need to
install it too to make the form work and
we do that again we are here in the
project directory and we installed
bootstrap by using the NPM command NPM
install boot strap and then you need to
say safe because with the safe option
included here in the command we make
sure that the bootstrap dependency is
also added to the list of dependencies
which is available in the package.json
file was in our project so let's install
bootstrap here it takes a second to
download and added to the node modules
folder within our project okay you can
see installation has been completed
successfully bootstrap in version 3.3.4
certain C to our project and downloaded
and installed and if we now go back here
and to our project structure within the
node modules folder you can see that the
bootstrap folder was added and that's a
place where on the download goes into
and here you can see within but this
subfolder was in CSS we have the
bootstrap dot Mendota CSS file and that
is the file which needs to be included
now in our project so that we can make
use of bootstrap classes so to add the
bootstrap CSS file to our project we
need to open the file angular - Eli dot
Jason in the top-level folder of the
project
and search for a property which is
called Styles here and this property
gets assigned an array of CSS files and
here we can add at the second element
the bootstrap dot min dot CSS file from
our node modules folder and was it with
that entry the CSS file is added to the
project and we can use the bootstrap CSS
classes within our template code
so with that inclusion weibo we can now
start up the project again by using ng
surf and then the web server again is
starting on local host port 4200 the
modules are being built here and it just
takes a moment okay we are ready to go
the web server is running the web pack
bundle is valid and now we can go and
access a local host port 4200 and you
can see our book form was on a three
input fields included and finally the
submit button included is displayed and
Weibull now our form template is ready
and displayed in the browser but this
one piece still missing currently we
have no possibility of accessing the
values which are entered in the form
within our program and to make values
accessible in our program we need to
introduce something which is called data
binding and in the next step we extended
the form template with a few elements to
enable angular 2 two-way data binding
and we do that by using another
attribute another directive which is
called ng model and we
in the following form in the input
elements we say ng-model
and we assign model dot title so this
assumes that we do have an object in our
class which is called model and that
object has a property which is called
title and by using as a spining syntax
in in this form we are establishing a
binding between the value which is an
entity on the input field and the type
of property of the model object so you
can see here with ng model a Weibull
it's some kind of special syntax we are
using here we are using square brackets
and to parantesis at the same time and
this simply tells angular that we would
like to use two-way data-binding so the
square brackets stand for property
binding so we are binding the ng model
property to the value of model dot title
and the parent eases we are using here
together with the square brackets are
combining property binding with event
binding and this ensures that's a value
flow the binding between the value which
is displayed in the input field and the
value which is available in the title
property of the model object is
synchronized or flows in both directions
so when a user enters a new value in the
form model of title gets updated and if
in our program we update model dot title
we are updating the value which is
displayed in the form the same is needed
for the other two input elements
can simply copy the ng-model syntax here
insert it in the next input element and
in the assert input element over there
and just update the target of the
binding it's here not modeled title
instead we're using motor
author and in the third input element we
are using model dot URL so this is
describing here how a model object the
model object is consisting of three
properties title author and URL and all
of these three properties are updated
with the values entered here in our form
okay then another attribute is needed
for the input elements and the attribute
what is needed in addition is called
name and name gets assigned string which
is basically the name of the input field
here so the name of the first element is
title the name of the second element is
of course author and the name attribute
of a third element gets assigned a
string which is which is containing the
text URL okay so the question now is why
do we need another name attribute here
in our input elements and the reason is
it's not so easy to understand because
this is due to the fact that angular 2
internally creates a form control for
each of the input elements here in our
form so each input element is
represented by an object of type form
control internally and to do so angular
needs the name attribute here because a
name attribute is triggering the
creation of a form control and the form
control of course gets a name internally
and that name is corresponding to the
string which is assigned here to the
name attribute
and the farm control needs to be created
so that we can later on deal with a farm
apply validation logic and so on so
introducing here's a name attribute is
required to to make the farm working
with all of the angular to form
features basically okay now I'm back in
the book form component implementation
in book - form dot component or TS and
now that the two-way binding syntax is
included in our farm template we can
make use of the binding and access form
values within our program and to do
those the first thing we need here is to
add another import statement and we need
access to our model class which was
created in the beginning and it's this
class is called book and we import it
from the model file which is available
here in book dot model dot t-- s and
then we can make use of book within our
book form component class and now we
need a few things here first of all we
need a property here on on the class
level and the property is called model
because that is the object where our
budding target is and this model is
initialized with a new book object with
a d1 with an empty title with an empty
author and with an empty URL okay so was
that a way we'll we can now define a
getter property here by using get to get
keyword and say
we call it get booked and we define this
get a property to simply return um or
Jason
string of our model okay so now we can
make use of the current book getter
within our template so I switch back to
book - form dot component on HTML we are
the form template distort and extend it
a little bit by including another
another deflection here okay maybe we
should define another headline which is
saying model so we are going to print
out at the model information here and we
do that by using an the expression
subtext and saying current book okay and
that is all what is needed to print out
the model object with all its properties
so basically with title author and URL
in JSON format in the output of our
application and if I now switch over to
the browser you can see that the output
is enhanced view with including the
model section here and that is in JSON
representation of the model and you can
already see that as we have defined here
for the URL property a string which is
starting with HTTP this spring is
already available here in this field so
two-way data-binding is already working
the value which is assigned here to the
URL property
in our model object is synchronized with
the value which is displayed here in the
form and if I now start to enter
information here for example angular 2
my name is no sir
and then give an ul here you can see
that without hitting return or anything
else the binding is working every time I
change the value here the JSON a string
representation of the model object is
updated simultaneously here and so you
can see we have full access to all the
values of the form in our program thanks
very much for watching is this one

please don't forget to subscribe to my
channel also check out the other
tutorials available on coding the smart
way comm and in the next time we are
going to focus again on angular 2 forms
and diving a little bit deeper into the
topic and extend our example by
introducing form validation so if you
