again from coating the smart Wacom and
this is the beginning of my new free
pison learn Pisan for beginners serious
and in this first part in this first
video we'll cover variables we will
cover strings lists dictionaries and
sets so you will get a basic
understanding of all the basic data
structures in person so if you have no
experience with PI's and programming
language so far that's a perfect start
so let's get started so for this parsing
tutorial I'm going to use Jupiter
notebook which is a web application and
which enables us to write Python code
directly here into the web application
and execute this code and see the result
immediately and Jupiter not notebook is
organized as you can see here in
so-called notebooks you can create a new
notebook file and then was in that file
include your code include descriptive
text if you would like to do that and
then execute this code in the notebook
and of course I'm writing all the code
into one notebook which belongs to this
tutorial and then I will include this
note for download so you can set up
Jupiter notebook on your system download
my notebook file and then yeah open it
up in Jupiter notebook and execute the
code and make adaptations by yourself if
you would like to have a general
introduction to you to peter notebook
and see how you can download it install
it on your system and how you work with
notebooks and so on please take a look
at my video tutorials getting started
with jupiter notebook for Pisan
including a link here in the video
description and for now I assume you
already have set up Jupiter notebook on
your system and we
can directly start creating a new
notebook file and that is exactly what
I'm doing now so here in the pilot step
just click on new and then select
notebook pass and three and this is
creating a new notebook file as you can
see here and the first step we will do
here is to name the notebook
so it's pison put one okay and then we
are ready to go let's say fat one time a
first cell here is created and that's a
code cell so we can directly start to
write passing code into that cell and
then execute it and what we'll do first
is to start with a very simple statement
a print statement so you can say print
and then parenthesis and then include a
string here maybe have a world okay
that's all and then you can execute that
line of parsing code by hitting shift
and return and you will see the result
here immediately it's printing out how
well so the print statement you can
print out things on the console and here
in tribute a notebook the resulting text
is printed out immediately here
underneath the executed code cell
another cell is correct here
automatically so we can directly move on
okay so first of all let me change all
the second cell here to a mark down
cells so that I can include a hemline
here for the next part so in use the
hash sign here to write a headline in
markdown code so the next section is
about comments so shift and return
compose my markdown so now we have the
headline here and let's talk about
commands in pison including commands in
your code is easy you can use the hash
sign here as you can see
to include a complete line of commands
so one-line amounts starts with hash
okay what you can also do is to first of
all include a Python command let's use a
print function here again and print out
hello world again and then at the end of
the line include a hash sign and then
write a command for that line so command
at the end of line
so let's compound that code hitting
shift and return you will see okay it's
outputting hello world so that is proof
the call of the print function is not
included in the commands all other text
here except the print statement are
commands and do not influence the output
here of that cell so next let's move on
to variables so let's include another
headline here variables can be used in
Parden without any special keyword so
you can start to write the name of the
variable you want to use so for example
var1 and assigned the value so in this
case we are assigning an integer value
just to let's execute that cell and then
use the print function again to print
out the value of y1 so let's execute it
again and you can see it's printing out
to as the result so that is what I was
expecting to get here so let's try out
to use another variable so it's var to
let's assign 3 here okay let's use our
three here and var 3 b VAR a 1
which is 2 of course
Plus party which is three so we should
get back the value of five and the value
of five should be assigned to our three
and now let's see is a print statement
here to print out all of our values so
let's say print the sum of war one and
of our to is and then we are including
here curly braces just indicate that as
this is a placeholder and we would like
to insert a value of a variable and then
use dot format for that string here and
use parentheses again and include the
variant variable so it was free for
which the value should be inserted here
it is a placeholder of the string so
let's execute that cell again hitting
shift and return and you can see we are
getting back as a sum of 1 and V 2 is 5
and that is true so next and let's talk
about strengths so you can define
strengths and Partin by either using the
single quote syntax so just in the
following way this is a string with
single quotes at the beginning and at
the end so and you will get back this
spring here you can also use on double
quotes to define a string
so the same result here you will get
back of that string you can assign a
string of course to a variable so let's
say my name of the variable is spring
one and then we are assigning this is a
string so let's check all the value of
string one by using the print statement
again so you can see here is my string
value and now we can select just parts
of that spring and the easiest way to do
so is if you would like to select single
characters by using the brackets
selectors of the index selector which is
applied by using brackets in the
following way so string one and include
brackets here and let's say we would
like to select maybe the second
character here then I'm handing over the
index of one because it starts counting
at zero so the T would be 0 then we have
index 1 2 3 and so on so let's execute
this and we are getting back here is the
second character from our string now the
bracket syntax is very powerful you can
also write something like the following
so 1 and then a colon and the result we
are getting back it looks like the
following so the first character is not
included because we are telling a person
to only selects a substring which starts
at index 1 so the second character is
index 1 until the end we can also say
something like that
so let's start selecting it index five
until by using the count again and then
handing over another index and that is
seven so selecting from index 5 until
index 7 but not including 7 so and this
is returning the substring is so the
second word here from the string so next
let's move on and talk about parsing
lists so lists are another important
basic data structure of the past and
programming language and you can define
a list by using the following syntax so
let's first use a variable name here
list 1 and then assign list which is
defined by using brackets and then
including the value separated by commas
so 1 2 3 if you like so let's check it
by using the print statement again so
this is our list which is a Weibull now
so we can define a second list which is
again including 3 values but this time
we are using our strengths here with
just one character so a B and C let's
see how this looks like so print list
- here's list again so now we can use
functions here and to call for example
the append method so list 2 dot and to
append the list with another element
here and let's append it with a spring d
ok check it again by using the print
statement list 2 you can see now we have
four elements included a b c and d
because we have a pen as the list was
the d element here so that's the result
now we can use the
index selector syntax again with lists
here so for example we can say places
select the element of list - which is at
index 0 so we're using brackets can here
and you see ok we are getting back the
first element because indexing starts
always with 0 so a is 0 B as 1 CS 2 D is
3 and by using an 0 here in the index
selector we are getting back the first
element a of course okay so now we can
use this index selector also to read
assign yeah the element was another
value so for example let's use to again
select the first element at index 0 and
then assign a string which is ABC ok
check how the list now looks like print
list - you can see we have replaced the
a string with a string ABC ok so it's
all the possible in passing to define
nested list so a list was in a list and
for example we can do something like
that again we are selecting the first
element of list - by using the index
selector here and then we are assigning
to this element so we are only talking
about the first element in the list
right now we are assigning another list
so using the brackets a syntax here
again a b c so 3 elements in that list
ok and now let's check again how all
this to looks like and here you can see
now we have a nested list the first
element of list 2 is the list we
assigned so ABCs and the second element
of list USB and then
third element C the fourth element D so
now we have a list with an list okay so
next let's move on and talk about
dictionaries another person data
structure so dictionaries and you can
define a dictionary by using curly
braces so let's assign the dictionary we
are going to define to you a variable
which is called the deep one and then
use curly braces and in dictionary
always consists of not only values as
for example a list instead a dictionary
consists of key value pairs so you
always have a key which gets assigned a
value and each dictionary can have
multiple of that key value combinations
so let's start let's say we have key one
which gets assigned by using a colon
here a value of value one so a string
next we will include another key which
is key to and key to gets assigned a
value which is another string value two
okay here we are let's check it print
out the one here it is now you can apply
the index selector syntax here again but
this time we are not passing in just a
number the number of the index instead
we can work with the keys assigned here
and we can select a value by using the
key as an index selector so d1 again we
need to bring in brackets here and then
within the brackets include the key
which we want to select the value of
okay here you can see we are selecting
the value from key to key to gets
assigned the value of value to here and
we are gay
back value - so it has expected okay we
can also have something like lists
within a dictionary so lists in
dictionaries and to do that let's use
another variable here d2 and assign the
following dictionary with one key value
combination inside so the keys as time
as list one and list one gets assigned a
list so one two three that's our list
execute it and print out d2 you can see
that our dictionary and if we are now
going to select from d2 by using the
index selector again list one else okey
we are getting back our list because
that is as a value so of course we were
able to as we get back that list here we
are able to assign that list to a new
variable if you like so list one and
then selecting the list again from the
dictionary here it was key list one and
now we can print out a list one you can
see it here this one now is containing
the list
so another thing which can be done else
too as we now have included a list
within our dictionary to you apply the
index selector two times so for example
from D tube we can first select list by
saying let's get back the value for key
list 1 and then from that list which has
three elements let's assign let's select
element at index two which is the third
element here so it's three
so now we are applying as a index
selector syntax here with brackets two
times let's execute it and we are
getting back three okay so as seen
before for lists you can all also have
nested dictionaries and to define a
nested dictionary let's define another
variable here these three and let's
assign the following dictionary here
starting with key one and assigning the
value and now the very is another
dictionary here which has key to with a
value of value tube inside
okay now let's execute it so d3 is
defined now we can check it by selecting
first of all selecting just the value of
key one and you can see it here we are
getting back as the value of key one we
are getting back a dictionary because
that is what we have assigned here we
are getting back is the master
dictionary here the inside dictionary
and now we can apply two selectors of
course
so d3 again starting with selecting key
one here and then using brackets a
second time here to select from the
inside dictionary now the value of key
to okay so and we are getting back the
string and value two
so the last data structure I'd like to
introduce you two sets and let's include
another headline here so set a set is
just a list of this thing to Alice and
you can define a step by using curly
braces but in comparison to dictionaries
those curly braces as you can see here
only include a list of eliecer No
value combination that is a set here so
you can see it here we are getting back
the set of this values 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so as
mentioned a set can only contain
distinct values which means that only
unique values are inside a set and if
I'm now going to define a set for
example in the following way so you can
see it here we have the value to 2 times
and we have the value 3 3 times here in
the set and if I'm now going to execute
that line of code you can see we are
getting back the same result as before
because person is removing from the set
we are defining here removing the
duplicates and makes sure that we only
have distinct and unique values within
that set so ok we can also assign a set
to a variable of course as 1 for example
let's define a set here with 2 elements
inside you can see it here and now we
can use the dot add method call here
again and for example at an element 3
and then check it again now our set
contains 3 elements of course so thanks
