the smart way to come again and this is
the first part of my new angular
material design series and in that first
part we will be focusing on the angular
material design library which is
provided by the angular core team and
can be used to bring ready-made material
design components into your angular
project and we will see how to install
that library and how to make use of some
of those components by implementing a
very simple sample application which
consists of of a data entry form
basically and in the next part of my
angular material design series we will
be focusing on on the other components
of the library of providing so stay
tuned and the let's get started so the
first thing we need to do is to initiate
a new angular for project and the way we
are doing that is by using the angular
command-line interface and the project
website can be found here at CLI dot
angular oh and here you can see how to
install on the command line interface
you can install it by using NPM install
- key for installing it globally on your
system at angular slash CLI if you
haven't installed it before you can now
do so I have already installed all the
latest version of the quondam interface
so we can directly move on with
switching to the command line and now to
initiate a new project to make use of
anglo command line interface we need to
type in ng that are the
and then say new for initiating new
project and then giving the name of the
project so let's call it MGM the a1 for
example and hit return now you can see
it's a downloading project template and
installing all the dependencies by using
the node package manager again and this
takes a second to complete okay here we
are
the project has been initiated
successfully as you can read here and
now we can change into the newly created
project folder and just to check out if
everything is working correctly we can
start up the development web server here
by using the ng command and using the
auction serve this time and Mexican
seeds of starting up the web server and
it's running the web server on port 4200
and we have to wait here just a moment
so that everything is packed and
compiled okay here we are and now we can
go back to the browser and see that on
port 4200 the application is responding
and that's the result we are getting
back from the standard angular template
which was downloaded so next we can
install the angular material design
package for our project and again the
project website can be found at material
angry
oh and you can see here you can access
an overview of the components the
library is providing you can also access
the guides here with further
instructions so let's install it go back
to the command line and I'm stopping the
development web server process which is
still running here okay and to install
the library we can use the node package
manager again and we need to say NPM
install - safe because I'd like to add
this dependencies to my package dot
adjacent file within my project as well
and now I need to give to package names
here on the first is a library itself or
what she fills weibo with the package
name at angular slash material and a
second package needs to be installed and
that's angular / CD k CD k in this case
stands for component development kit and
is just comprising some general purpose
tools that are used used for building
components and which are not directly
related to a material design itself but
the used bounder material design library
so we need to install both okay hitting
return to initiate the installation
process here now again downloading the
packages and installing both packages
and and dependencies into the node
modules folder of our angular project
okay here we are you can see
installation has been completed
successfully and now we can move on to
the next step okay on some of the
angular design component
our making use of advanced transition
effects and those transition effects are
using another library which is called
angular animations library and to enable
those transition effects in our
application we need to install that
library and I'm going back here to the
command line tends to install the
angular animations library it's again an
NPM install call and again I'm using the
safe option to start to the package.json
file and the package name here is AB
angular slash animations okay so it's
downloading the animations library and
installing it into the node modules
folder of our project again ok now we
need to make sure that the animations
library is activated within our project
and let the reason why I'm not opening
up the code editor and in this case I'm
using my favorite code editor Adam okay
here we are now to activate the
animations library I need to open up my
F dot module dot ts file this is the
main the main module of our application
and first of all I need to add an import
statement here and that import statement
is importing browser animations module
from the angular slash platform browser
slash emissions library and I need to
make sure that the browser the
animations module is added here to the
array which is assigned to from the
imports property here so I'm adding it
here browser animations module ok like
so
okay next time let's talk about the
seams angular material is supporting C's
and the seam is basically a set of
curves which are applied to the material
design components we are using and there
you can see it here on the project's
website here in the upper right corner
you can select one of the four pre-built
seams for example I can change the seam
here and you can see the color is
changing as well and they're using a
theme is mandatory so we do need to
include seam in our project we can use
custom seams of course but to make
things easier at first let's use one of
the pre-built seams and to do so we
simply need to go to Stan's dot of CSS
here in the SRC folder and add the
following import statement in here which
is including VL standard indigo pink
theme so let's save it okay so the next
thing we need to do is to add gesture
support because some of the material
design components for example the MD or
slide toggle component or the MD slider
and tooltip and so on are supporting
gestures and for supporting gestures say
making use of a library which is called
hammer a yet and we need to install the
library as well so back here on the
command line I need to say NPM install -
safe hammer KS okay like so
okay here we are it's installed and now
I can go back to my code editor in my
app dot module dot TS file and they're
simply imported here okay like so so
finally there's one last thing we need
to include the material the angular
material design library is though
containing material icons and if you
want to make use of material items you
need to include the corresponding font
and to do so let's switch back to the
web site here to the getting started
page and you can see it here it's an
optional step in step six we can simply
copy that link element here and insert
it in index.html within our project so
here is index.html and within the head
section we need to insert that link
element which is including the material
icons font okay so let's save it now the
project setup is already we have
installed everything what immediately
make use of material design components
within our angular application next we
can go on with our sample application
and now continue to implement a simple
form and making use of material design
components okay so to implement the form
in our application I'd like to add a new
component and so that we can implement
that form within that new component and
then later include that component in our
apps main component which is that
component and to add a new component
here in our project we can again make
use of angular command line interface by
using the
G command here at the terminal and to
generate a new component I need to use
the option G for generate and then say
okay I would like to generate a
component so I need to say component
here and the component should be named
my - form okay so you can see it's
creating various new files on our
application here within the SRC app my -
form folder you can see it here that the
newly created folder we have a TS file
here which is containing the component
class with the annotation part here then
we have the spec PS file which is for
testing which we can ignore for the
moment then we have the corresponding
HTML file which is containing the HTML
code the template code for of that
component and cascading style sheet file
here which is empty and there is
switchback you can see there is another
file and that file was updated it's our
app dot module dot psi which is
containing the implementation of our
application module so it has been
updated some another import statement
here for my form component has been
added automatically and my form
component is also added to the array to
the array which is some assigned here to
the declarations property so that my
form component is now part of our app
module so to be able to use some of the
material design components in our
application we first need to import the
corresponding modules here again in
act out Model Ts and as we would like to
implement a simple data entry form
we basically need two modules from the
angular material design library and the
import is added right here so import and
then I'm important MD input module and
MD button module from add angular slash
material okay and then to activate those
modules for our application of course me
to add MD input module and MD button
module here TOC import array as well
okay now we are ready to make use of the
components bling belonging to M V input
module and MD button module okay
furthermore I need to import the angular
forms module here as well because we
would like to implement an angular form
of course and so I'm adding the import
statement here so it's import a forms
module from add angular forms and of
course don't forget to add the forms
module here in the import the writing as
well okay so the angular form should be
implemented as in template driven form
and to be able to use data binding we
first need to implement data model class
so we can bind again against the firm
the properties of that class and to do
so for implementing that data model
class I'm adding here within the app
folder a new file and our form should
offer input element for entering address
data so I'm naming the data model class
address and the file name is address dot
TS okay and implementing a data model
class is easy we are using the export
keyword here and then the class keyword
and the name of the class okay and then
using the constructors syntax to defined
properties as constructor parameters and
I can use the public key word here to
define those constructor parameters at
the same time as class members so we
will have a first name I'm using the
question mark here to define that this
is optional of type string then we do
need last name optional string then we
need the address information third
string again then I do you need a city
and the state finally the postal code
optional and again of type screen so
that's our data model class so as you
can see I've already placed my editor
here right beside that the browser
window so I can see all the changes we
will be implementing in the next steps
within my form component and to make the
output of my phone component with Abel I
need to change a few things here
first of all I'm changing the selector
here just remove the app - so that is
the selector will only be my - form and
then I'm opening up at component dot
HTML and I'm removing the content which
is inside a bad file here and let's say
we will have a ch3 here in that case and
the headline is headers form and then
I'm including my form here as an element
okay you know I'm saving that file and
you can see it immediately updating the
output here in the browser and now I'm
getting back a headline here from that
file and the HTML output which is
produced by my form component okay so
next we can implement the HTML code for
the form and therefore I'm switching
over to my - form component dot HTML and
remove the content which is a Weibull
here in that file and then I'm starting
out with a new form tag okay let's say
we are assigning a class here from West
so I've already defined I can show you
quickly here in my form that component
of the CSS two classes form with which
is defining this property of 500 pixels
and later on we will be using the full
width class which is defining with was
value 100% okay here I'm using the form
with class and I'm binding the ng submit
event here to a method we will be
implementing later on which is called on
submit and this method will be called
each time the user is submitting this
form and then I will create a template
with arrival here my farm and Devon okay
so within that form first we do need to
input elements for first name and for
last name because we would like to
create an address form and that are the
first two properties we would like to
receive an user input for and their
first name and last name should be
displayed one on the left side and one
on the right side so in one line and
therefore I'm using a table here to get
to this layout okay
table
okay the table element I'm assigning the
class for with this time and cell
spacing of zero okay let's use a TR
element here and a TD and within the
first column let's use the mb - input
- container because that's one of the
components of the angular material
design library which is used to wrap our
input element in okay and again we are
assigning class here for with - to
assign width of hundred percent and
within that MD input container element
I'm using the input element of type text
and I am using the directive MD input
from the material design library and
defining placeholder text let's say
first name assigning an ID first name
then using the two-way binding syntax of
engine angular and binding the value of
this input element to address dot first
name so address will be a object of our
class address we have defined earlier we
will create address later on when we are
continuing with the implementation of
the typescript code for that component
and finally I'm using the name property
here to assign a name and that's again
first name okay next um
I said we can copy it for last name text
okay this time should be a last name a D
so the last name combining a to dress
dot last name name equals last next okay
okay so now you can see how the browser
output arm has already been updated and
now I can click here on tip input fields
and you see both input fields are
available and displayed in material
design I can already enter text but one
thing is missing here as you can see the
placeholder text is not there so and do
not know if I need to enter the first
name here or the last name and the
reason the placeholder text is not shown
here is because our website and you can
see it here in the console is reporting
errors because first name property it's
saying cannot read property first name
of undefined and that's clear because we
try to bind to address first name and
author last name and the address object
is not yet defined and not yet created
so in order to get rid of those errors
here let's quickly switch over to my -
form dot component dot TS that's the
file where the my form component class
is created and what we need to do here
is to create that address object we are
binding to and first of all I need to
import of course address
and I'm importing it from our address
class okay and then I can create a new
object here let's say address new
address okay now you can see how the
parents are done and the output here now
is containing both text fields with the
corresponding placeholder text displayed
so now I can enter my name here and a
last name and you can see now both input
elements are working with material
design applied as expected okay let's
switch back to our HTML file and we need
to of course to continue our
implementation here because we do need a
few more input elements for our form so
right here after the table element I'm
using a paragraph P element for my next
input element and I'm starting out again
by using the MD - import - container
element once again let's assign the
class full width here again okay like so
and now I need a text area I don't need
to those attributes here instead I'm
using and the input again a placeholder
text which is address in that case I'm
assigning the ID of address binding it
to my model this time it's
address dot address and assigning a name
okay so let's save it here we are now I
can see I have a text area element
displayed in material design I can
resize it here to extend it from
multiple lines okay it's working so next
I need three more input elements I do
need an input element for city state and
postal code and for a layout reasons I'm
using a table again okay let's use
itself a spacing of 0 TR TD in the first
column again so let's maybe copying it
from here so now it's a city element and
I'm changing the placeholder text CEO to
city idea city as well I'm binding to
address dot city property and the
nameless city as well so that one the
first one then let's bring in a second
one which is state
okay binding it to address dot state and
finally the last input element
I do need here as for the postal code
okay we will have a place over the text
here as well
it's postal code ID is postal code the
property of our address object US postal
code as well and the name again postal
code so now we need a few more
properties here I'd like to define a max
length of let's say five n I would like
to define a template variable so I can
access the word value view postal code
and now I can use here inside my MV
input container I'm able to use another
element to give further guidance for the
user I'm using MD - hint element okay
like so let's use a lime and design end
to align it at the end of the input
element and with an ambient I'm using
the expression syntax here - you accept
the postal code template variable and
using the value property to access the
value which was entered by the user and
reading out the line
then it is claim of five so that the
user is informed how many characters are
are currently entered and what's the
maximum length here so now you can see
it here we have city New York for
example we can put in a state here and
now if I go to postal code if I'm
starting to type in the code here you
can see it's updating the counter and
it's displaying the maximum lengths here
if I reach five and try to enter more
digits here it's not allowing me to
enter more it's limiting the input to
five digits okay so finally we do need
to bring in the submit button for our
form and again here under the last table
element I'm starting out with a
paragraph and bringing in a button which
is of type submit and I would like to
display that button a material design
too so I'm using the MD raised button
directive here and the text on the
button is simply submit okay here we are
now we have a submit button in our form
element here if I scroll up again we
have to find that the submit event
should be handled by a method which is
called an submit and now of course we do
need to implement that submit button to
make the submit functionality work let's
switch over to my - form component dot
TS again and here in the component class
I can add the implementation of on Smith
and to keep things very simple are just
using the alert function to bring - to
show a pop-up to the user which is
saying thanks for submitting and maybe
printing out the data of the form in a
JSON format so i'm using json stringify
this address because the address object
is containing the current values of the
form so okay let's save it now let's
wait okay it's updated here and now I
can input just some information here and
then hit button submit and you can see
the problem is coming up saying thanks
for submitting the data and here you can
see Jason a string as displaying the
properties with the current values
assigned okay this one's about them from
coding this Matt Wacom thanks very much
for watching I hope now you have better
understanding of the angular material
design library and if you do like my
videos here don't forget to subscribe to
my channel on YouTube also don't forget
to visit my blog at coding the smart
Wacom and I hope to see you back in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
