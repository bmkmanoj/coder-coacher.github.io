coating the smart way comm and today I'd
like to make just a quick announcement
because my first udemy online course is
out and it's on the udemy website and
it's a course about graph QL and
implementing a full stack application
with graph QL so in this course you will
learn how to use graph QL on both the
backend the server side and the front
and side and I will show you how to set
it up but we will be using the Apollo
library to set up a server Versa note
Ria's and Express create a graph QL
endpoint and then connect with an
angular application on the front and
side again by using the Apollo client
library teaser server and then I will
show you in that course how to implement
a real full stack application from
scratch based on graph QL so let's take
a look at the courses website so here we
are on the website you can see that's
the title of the course graph QL was
angular and Apollo the full stack guide
and let me quickly go through the
learning path of that course so you can
see we have several sections included
here in the first section you will get a
quick introduction to you the topics and
in the second section we will be setting
up the development environment bringing
everything in place installing visuals
to your code to setting up nodejs and
npm on your system so that you can get
going with the next steps here then in
the next section here we will be
implementing a graph QL so with no GS
Express and Apollo that's the part where
we will be setting up the server side
was the Apollo server library connecting
our graph QL endpoints connecting the
schema implementing the resolvers so
everything what's needed to get the
backend going and then finally we will
put all the pieces together and then you
will have
a working server in the next section we
will be testing that server you will
learn all the basics you need to know
about the graph QL query language we
will be using a tool which is called
graphical which gives us in the browser
an IDE which then can be used to try out
the course to try out queries and
mutations and send those requests to the
server back-end and to check if
everything is working then after having
tested our server we will be adding the
MongoDB database in the backend so that
our data which is provided by the server
and provided by our graph QL API is
stored in a MongoDB database and by
using the MongoDB database we will need
to add one more library here that's a
mongoose library you will get a short
introduction into mongoose and how to
connect to MongoDB in a node.js server
so after that in the next section we
will then move on with the front and
part of our application here we will be
setting up an angular project with
Apollo client to then connect to our
server and in the next section we will
be adding bootstrap because we wanted to
implement a real word application so I'm
using bootstraps CSS classes to
implement a nice-looking layout here for
our application and then we will be
adding data service to an angular
application and data service is used to
contain all the logic which is needed to
use Apollo client to communicate with
our back-end server and then having a
data service implemented we can make use
of that data service in various
components of our application and we
will be billing on angular front and
application which consists of multiple
components so in the last two parts we
will be Xen adding a list component and
an item component that's needed because
in our application we are managing
online causes data so that's the use
case here and to show it to the user we
do need two components and that's
exactly what we are doing here in the
last section so to summarize what we
will building throughout that course
let's take a look at the following
diagram here that's a full-stack
application we will build on the basis
of graph QL as mentioned we will have a
MongoDB database in the back in the
background and then our back-end which
is implemented by using node.js and
Express is implemented here in the back
end and this server is providing a graph
QL end point and an end point for the
graphical IDE which is both connected to
the node tree and Express server by
using a policy server and then our
front-end angular application which is
making use of the Apollo client library
will then connect to the server via a
graph QL based interface and then be
able to retrieve data and update data by
by communicating with graphic ulo to the
backend and then displaying everything
to the user by using the bootstrap
framework for layout so just a quick
glimpse at the final application you
will have implemented by going through
the lessons of that course and that's
our web development courses web
application giving you a list of web
development courses and then you can use
the search feature here to filter for
specific courses it's a full-text search
which is working for all the information
which are displayed here so a for
example can filter for term nutrients as
you can see here because no chance is
mentioned in the title but I can also
filter for something like the name of
the author let's put an Andrew and you
can see I'm getting the causes beckoned
from Andrew here and all the data is of
course coming from back-end requested by
a traffic you are query and then the
user have the option to vote for those
causes by
hitting the plus button or the minus
button and the data has always updated
in real time in the MongoDB database of
our our back-end and here you can see as
I'm increasing the voted count here the
sorting is applied and always across
with the highest points as displayed at
the top position so here you can see I
have two instance of my application
running side by side and here you can
see if I'm now changing the data here
you can see if I'm changing the data in
the first window it's automatically
reflected in the second window all the
data is sent to the backend and then
provided to all the instances of the
application immediately you do not need
to update anything manually here for
example reloading the page everything is
updated automatically so that's the
application we are going to build with a
full graph QL based backend in that
course so as you can see here is a
course else on sale right now it's
available for $9.99 that's the lowest
price which will be the way before that
cause it's limited so users opportunity
to get this great cost for just $9.99 to
get this price just use the link from
the description below or just enter the
coupon code start underscore graph QL
then the price reduction will be applied
so hope to see you in the course bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
