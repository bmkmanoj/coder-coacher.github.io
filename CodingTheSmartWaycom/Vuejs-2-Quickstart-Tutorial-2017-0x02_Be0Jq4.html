smart way comm and today in this video
I'd like to give you a short
introduction into the view js2 front-end
framework and view is a very new
framework which gains a lot of traction
at the moment and in this introduction
I'll guide you through the first steps
you need to know to get started with a
framework and initiate a virus project
so stay tuned okay first it's always a
good idea to take a look at the project
website and the view J's website can be
found at view JSO arc and you can see it
here so what exactly is view arm view is
a progressive you have a script
framework that focuses on building user
interfaces so it only works in the view
layer of your application and it makes
no assumptions of middleware and
back-end technologies you are using so
in fact you can work together with all
of the common back-end technologies
which are available for web development
at the moment and can be easily
integrated into your existing projects
of course and that makes it very easy to
to integrate view in your existing
projects another main advantage of a
view Jas is that it is very performant
so as you can read it here it's only 17
kilobyte and size and that means the
core library and that makes you
application blazing fast so the overhead
you are adding by including view layers
in your project is very small and that
makes sure that your application is
performant ok if you want to integrate
view layers into your project there are
different ways of doing
so let's click here on the guide to get
an overview of the different options and
you can click on installation here on
the left side menu and here you can see
there are different options so for
example you can include it directly by
using a script tag in your HTML page
that's basically all what is needed to
get going with view and you can
integrate it directly by using a script
tag and use the resource from a content
delivery network for example here
unpackage is one of the content delivery
networks which makes viewer j/s Weibull
and that's the easiest option another
option is to use the NPM package manager
to install view by or simply typing in
NPM install view that is it downloading
the library and adding it to the notes
modules folder of your project and there
is another version and that is the other
version which will which we will be
using in this video and that's a view
Jes CLI is a command-line interface and
with a command-line interface you are
getting another commander that's the
view command and by using that command
you can initiate a new project which is
based on a template and is already
including the view library so you do not
need to download it in a separate step
ok so let's switch to the command line
and start installing the view command
line interface so that we can use it to
initiate our first project and to do so
we need to say npm install and i do it
as a root user - g because we want to
install the view command-line interface
as a global command so we need to give
that option
g for global and the package name is
view - on CLI so execute that command
and the installation is taking a second
okay here we are you can see the
installation has been completed
successfully and now the new view
command is available you can see it here
it has different options and in order to
generate a new project we are using the
first option here the in adoption and we
do it in the following way
let's say view in it webpack because we
want to get the project template which
is using the web pack module loader and
bundler
and then at the last parameter give the
name of the project and we simply call
it view app oh one and now it's
initiating the project you can see it's
downloading the template and then it's
asking some questions first we need to
give a project name here and we can
leave it at the default here view app a
one a project description although if
the default here the author and now it's
asking how the view build should be done
we are choosing a run time and compile
that's a recommended way the years
limited feature for the moment I'm
saying no and here regarding the test
setup was karma and mocker although no
and end-to-end tests was Nightwatch
again no so that's all what's needed now
a new project folder was created view
app a1 and you can see it here the next
step is to change into that folder and
then complete the installation by
installing all the end
M packages needed for our project by
using the NPM install command okay so
let's do so switch into that new project
directory and then executing NPM install
in that directory and now it's fetching
downloading all the packages defined in
the package dot JSON file which was
added to the project that file is
containing all the dependencies and it's
downloading all the dependencies and
installing the node modules into the
node modules folder of the project and
this again takes a second to complete ok
here we are it's completed and now we
can do a first test and we can start on
the web server the development web
server to run the project and that is
again done by using the NPM command and
let's say NPM run Def here ok you can
see the browser is opened automatically
and it's loading on the project here at
localhost port 8080 and you can see the
app which was initialized with a view
command is already running and showing
this output here in the browser and if I
switch back to the terminal you can see
it's saying okay it was compiled
successfully and now what the server is
listening at localhost 8080 and it's a
live reload server so if we are
implementing now any changes the website
is loading automatically without any
manual steps required okay so let's keep
our project running here and I have
opened another tab here at the command
line and I'm in the same project
directory here and now let's start my
code editor and let's Adam
so that we can take a look at the
initial project structure okay here it
is so let's close it and see what's
inside out of our project folder and
here you can see we have various files
included here you can see the
package.json file that is the file where
all the dependencies are listed and
before we have made sure that the
dependencies have been downloaded and
installed into the node modules folder
by executing the NPM in store command in
the project folder and then the next
file which is important is the
index.html file because in that file you
find the starting point of the
application and you can see it's a plain
simple ha HTML file and in the body
section of that HTML file a div section
is included and that a deflection arm
has one attribute here the ID attribute
and the ID ID attribute gets assigned a
string in our case that's the app string
and Z ills arm the place holder so that
the view framework knows where to insert
the content which is generated by the
view application okay next let's open
the source folder because so that is a
place in our project structure where the
vue.js application is implemented and
let's open within that folder the file
main dot GS and that's the place where
the view application is initialized and
you can see here we are importing two
things here first we need to import a
view from view and that this is the main
application class and you can see it
here it's used to create a new instance
of
framework and together with a view we
are importing a second thing and that is
app from the app file and that is a
component we are implementing here in
our project which is available here in
app dot view we will take a look in
aside of that implementation in a second
but first let's focus on the part here
and the new view framework instance is
created by calling them the constructor
by using the new keyword and the
constructor gets one parameter and
that's the object here with the three
configuration properties and the first
property here you can see it's called
el4 element and that gets assigned the
string here and that is mainly saying or
defining that the output of the view
application should be inverted into the
element which is the ID app and we saw
it before in the index.html file we
assigned the string app to Z ID property
and now we are connecting our view
application with that div element so the
output which is generated the HTML
output which is generated by our view
application is replacing that div
element within our index.html file so
here's the template of our application
and the template here is very simple
because it's only containing one element
and that is the app element which is
referring to the app component and by
using that element here in our template
we are defining that the HTML output
which is generated by the app component
should be placed here inside of our view
template so it's part of the output
which our view application generates and
to be able to use the app element here
and including the output of the app
component
we do not only need to import up here we
also need to declare up here within the
object we are assigning to the
components property in the view
configuration object so that the view
application knows that we want to make
use of app component within our template
okay so let's switch over to the
implementation of the app component and
the implementation is available in app
dot view so here you can see our sets of
the complete implementation end as in
every view J as single file component
implementations as file is split up into
three sections on top you can see here
is the template section of the app
component then we have a script section
over here and finally we have here the
Style section containing them CSS
styling code for of the component
template and you can see that makes it
very easy to keep the overview because
everything belonging to one component is
here within that one file and so let's
first take a look at the script section
you can see here the script section is
making a default export of a and
component configuration object for view
and that configuration object is
containing two properties name assigning
a name to the component in our case it's
app and again a components property
taking an object containing all of the
subsequent components which are used
here in app component and we have one
component included here and that's the
hello component it's listed here because
if we take a look at the template you
can see the hello component is included
in the template by using the hello LM
and here and now you can see the
template is not so long with only one
differ section here and the DIF section
consists of two elements one image
element this image element is including
the logo dot PNG file and the output and
it's including the output which is
generated by the sub component hello and
if we now compare that template to the
output which was a label here in the
browser you can see its label here
that's the logo file and all the other
output which is generated here the
welcome message the essential links the
ecosystem links and so on is coming from
the content or the output which is
produced by Z hello component and is
included here in the template so let's
take a look at the last part of on the
initial project structure and that's the
implementation of the hello component
the implementation as a Weibull here in
the subfolder components and file hello
dot view and or open that file and here
you can see again we have the template
section available then we have the krupa
script section and finally user style
section and as you can see if we start
by taking a look at the script section
again a default export is made defining
a component configuration object the
name in this case is hello because we
are defining the hell component and then
there is something new it's a data
function returning an object with one
property included and that's a Z MSG
stands for message property and MSG gets
assigned the welcome string and you can
see it's welcome to your view
guess app that's exactly the string
which is outputted here mass the
headline under the logo file and now if
you take a look at the template code
which is defined here you can see on the
property MSG is used here in the
template in the h1 element by using the
interpolation syntax which requires to
use open and closing double curly braces
and by using zetas syntax we are able to
include properties from the object which
is returned from the data function of
the component in our template and that's
the reason why the text from the MSG
property is printed out here and the the
rest of the template you can see it's
about printing out those links here we
have the essential link section included
in an h2 element and then as a list all
the links are printed out and we have
the ecosystem here it's that part with
fallings pointing to view router views
view loader and awesome view so on the
next step I'd like to make some changes
to the initial implementation and just
to give you an impression of how easy it
is to use the view framework and to give
you a little introduction to some of the
standard view JR directives and I start
with with the changes by deleting some
of the content here in the template of
the hello component and I'm going to
remove everything which is related to
the two linked sections here so let's
delete this so that we only are printing
out the welcome message and you can see
I'm saving the file
and instantly it gets reloaded in the
browser without needing me to do
anything manually here and now we can go
on with implementing for example list
print out and I'm defining another data
property here in the object which is
returned by the data measured and I'm
naming that array I would like to have
users and then define it as an array and
within that array let's say we have
objects included in that array which
consists of two properties let's use a
first name property and assign first
name string and a last name okay that's
it so let's maybe add two more elements
here okay
assign a different first name and last
name for the second user object and for
the SIRT user object let's use John as a
first name and maybe Porter as a last
name so now we have three users defined
here in the users array and now we are
able to use or to make use of that users
array with the content included in our
template and I'd like to print out those
users as a list so under the h1 element
let's include another div section here
and this should be an unordered list and
I saying
list item and now I'm using a view Jas
standard directive which is called V
minus four and I'm saying it equals the
spring user in users and by applying
that syntax here the view J's framework
is iterating over that array and
including one list item element per
object defined in our array in the
generated output and now we can use the
interpolation syntax once again to print
out the values first print out the user
first name and then print out the user
last name okay let's save it and you can
see on the output is generated and I am
getting back the names of the users okay
so next thing I'd like to include is an
input element and use two-way
data-binding
to sync the value of the input element
which a property which is defined in our
data model
okay let's first define a new property
here in the return object of the data
function and let's name that property
input well and just assign an empty
string here okay and within our template
here under the diff section of the list
of users I'm defining another div
section and within that diff section I'm
including an input element and let's use
the type text and we don't need name and
value here instead I'm using another a
view J as standard directive which is
called V Model View
- model and I'm assigning the string
input vowel which corresponds to the
name of our property we have defined
here and let's output on that property
here under the input element and let's
say or let's say our spawn and I'm using
the V - text directive and again I'm
assigning input Val okay so let's see
here is our input element and now I can
start typing something into the element
and you can see here that's the output
of our spawn element which is bound to
the input well element by using the V -
text directive the output of Z and the
input here is directly reflected here as
an output on the same page okay the last
thing I'd like to demonstrate is how you
can use on events with view drug trials
and going to include another diff
section here so the use case I'd like to
implement is a very easy one just let us
implement a button which
is going to increment a counter by one
each time the user clicks on the button
so let's first define the counter data
property here in our data object I am
going to call a counter and set it
initially to zero and within that new
detection I'm implementing a button and
this button should include an beauteous
event handler and I'm using the
directive V dash on followed by the
event I would like to respond to and
that is a click event and each time the
user clicks on the button the counter
property should be incremented so I'm
using plus plus here and the content of
the button should reflect the value of
the counter so I'm including a little
bit of text information here you have
clicked this button and now I'm going to
use interpolation syntax again to
include the value of the counter times
okay let's save it and see how the
output looks like so now here is a
button and I can click on the button and
each time I click you can see is the
counter value which is printed out on
the button here is incremented by one
