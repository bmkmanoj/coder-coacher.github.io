coatings of smart Wacom and they in this
new tutorial we are going to take a look
at contentful and how you can use
contentful in your angular application
so what is contentful contentful is a
generic approach to content management
and it's a cloud service you can use to
structure and manage and create your
content and then it's possible to use
the content full service across
different front-end presentation
technologies so you can use contentful
as your content management system for
your mobile application for your website
for your SmartWatch application and so
on and in this tutorial today we are
going to focus on how to use content for
as your back-end content management
system together with angular at the
front end so although this video today
else sponsored by udemy and udemy is a
really great platform for learning new
skills online and if you take a look at
the udemy's website you can find a bunch
of really cool online courses so for
example if you take a look here at the
web site in the web development section
you can find the great course
angular 5 the complete guide this course
teaches you how to develop modern
responsive and scalable single page web
applications always with the latest
version of angular and angular as you
know is one of the top frameworks in
2018 and its popularity is constantly
growing so it's worth investing your
time in that course so with a total
content of 27 hours of video inside that
course it takes you really from complete
beginner to having a solid and profound
understanding of the framework it's made
by Maximilian Schwarz Miller who has
lots of experiences in teaching web
development and teaching all sorts of
front and JavaScript frameworks with
this course you will be able to
understand the fundamentals of angular
and at the same time gain really deep
insights into the architecture behind
that platform so if you haven't already
definitely check out you to me today and
choose from the top online courses for
web developers to get started just click
on the link in the video description
below and he will get a sidewinder
discount which is a well it for all the
online courses you can find on the
platform and with that let's get started
with today's tutorial so the first thing
we will be doing in this tutorial is to
setup content fool and then later on we
will create the angular application and
implement all the stuff which is needed
to access content full and the content
which is managed by content for for
example we will create a service in our
angular application which is containing
the code and the logic which is needed
to retrieve the data here from the
platform and we will create components
and at bootstrap and so on
so that we have a fully functional
application at the end of that tutorial
and I can quickly show you what the
final result will look like so this will
be our application and you can see here
was a list of online courses and all the
data which is presented here and that
list is retrieved from the content full
content management back-end and that's
the list here so you can change anything
you are seeing here on the website for
example the headline and the author
information the description text you can
change everything in the content for
back end and the website is always
up-to-date we can yeah go to the course
details page here and again you can see
you will get even more information of a
specific course here and again all that
content and all
formattings here in the content are
written and managed in contentful
and so this is the way we are getting
the dynamic content here in our angular
application so this is what we are going
to build I can go back here to the list
so let's get started and let me return
to you the content full website here
which is a Weibull @ww content for calm
and the first thing now to get started
is we need to configure our back-end
and to be able to do so of course we
need to create an account here you can
create an account for free or just log
in if you have already signed up and I
have done so already so I can directly
log in here into content for and access
my back-end here and now the first thing
we need to do here in the backend we
need to create a new space and you can
access the list of spaces which are away
but so far by clicking here on the left
side menu you can see it here and a
space else something like a container
where all the content types
and the content belonging to one project
is Weibull and because we are now
starting out from scratch let me create
a new container here and you can see it
here it takes me to a new pop-up window
here and it's asking now for a space
name and for example it's the name that
space energy content for and what's
important here is to select create an
empty space the other option here is
create an example space this is adding
already some content types and content
is it space but we are going to start
from scratch so I'd like to have an
empty space where we can then start
creating a content type next so let's
hit the button correct space so that is
creating the space and now you can see
we are already located in the ng-content
full space which has been newly created
and from the top level navigation menu
you can see we have different options
here we can go to content model content
media and so on and at the moment we are
seeing of the space home side and the
first step now before we are actually
adding content here we need to have a
Content model in place which is
describing the structure of our content
and this is what we are going to create
first so I need to click here on content
model and you can see okay at the moment
we have no content model associated with
our newly created space so let me start
right away click here on the button add
content type which is taking me to you
the pop-up window create new content
type and this now is requiring some
information here so I need to assign a
name to my content type and because we
would like to manage online course data
here in our back-end let me choose a
name from a content type just cause you
know the description online course
content type okay and then hit create so
on the course content type as you can
see here it's crated and now it's
telling me okay it's time to add some
fields because of the content type at
the moment is still empty and now we
need to add fields and by adding fields
we are defining the structure of the
course content type and telling content
for what kind of data we would like to
manage for each course so let's click on
add field and first of all I'd like to
add a text field which should contain
the title of the course so I'm clicking
text here and then I'm naming it with
title like so and it gets an idea of
title in lowercase as you can see here
it should be a short text so that we can
store a maximum of 255 characters in
that title field and then I have the
button create and configure so by
hitting create and configure it takes me
to the following pop-up screen here
where I have three tabs available so
first on the settings tab I can again
enter the name and the field ID and then
we have the validation step here for
example I can say ok this is a quiet
field because every online course needs
to have a title I can also choose to
select unique field or limit character
count or to match a specific pattern if
you would like for example if you are
creating a field for entering an email
address or something like that and we
have the appearance here which gives you
control over the appearance of that
field in the editor we will see later on
and for the title information here we
will leave it on the default option with
a single line and this is displaying it
in the editor as a single line data
entry field and yeah that's pretty much
what we need here let's save it so we
have the title field in here let's click
on edit here and rename our content type
to start with an uppercase letter so
that it always starts was not a case
letter so the content type itself and
the name of the fields so on the next
field
I'd like to create is a media field
because I'd like to create a field which
the user can use to upload the croisÃ©
image to
I'm selecting media here and the name is
cause image the idea is proposed here
it's for one file so the user will be
able to select one file and upload that
file
hitting create and configure again this
time I'm not choosing a required field
because it's up to the user to decide if
if an image should be uploaded and yeah
there is nothing to select on the
appearance step so I can click on save
and you can see it here it it it is
added to the course content tab
okay so let's quickly complete our
content type with the fields needed
again a text field for the answer
information okay should be all okay
single line then I'm adding another text
field which contains the short
description show so this field is named
description and this time I'm choosing
long text here hitting create and
configure and now the default option for
the appearance setting here is markdown
and this is what I would like to have
because was that setting the user in the
editor will then be able to include a
multi-line string and use markdown
syntax to include formattings for the
text so let's save it okay another text
field then we have the long description
again I'm choosing long text here with
markdown appearance selected and finally
we do need the cost ul and for entering
the UL I'm choosing a text field again
was named ul great and configure so the
IDS URL and that's now off type URL here
in the appearance tab because was that
setting here it gives you a preview of
the website which is entered in the
field yeah so that is what we need here
so this is our content type it's
completed now with the information
always the fields type of course image
also description long description URL so
now I can hit save to save the course
content type it's saying okay content
type saved successfully and now we are
ready to add some content based on that
content type here in the content for
back-end so to add content based on the
course content type you simply need to
click on the content link here in the
top menu and it takes you directly to
the overview you can see at the moment
is no content based on the content type
and now we can use that button here at
course to open up the editor view you
can see it here and the editor lets you
enter all the information which are
relevant for a course of the title the
image the author the description you can
see it here it's presented with the
editor here because of our appearance
settings and once you have entered all
the information here you can hit publish
and the content is then available
so Ethel a shortcut here I've already
prepared a second space that is
ng-content 4:01 so let me quickly switch
over to that space you can see it has
the same content type defined course and
I have already added some content here
you can see it here I've already added
some data so that we can now directly
move on create our angular application
and make use of those data but of course
feel free to enter your own data if you
would like and yeah let's get to the
next step and the next step is creating
the angular application so to create the
angular application let's switch to the
terminal and to initiate a new angular
project I'm using angular command-line
interface so if you have not installed
the angular CLI on your system yet you
of course first need to do so you can
find more information about angular CLI
on CLI dot angular dot IO it's available
as an NPM package so installation can be
done by of a node package manager
I have already installed angular CLI so
I can use the ng command now to initiate
a new angular project and to do so I'm
using the option new and need to specify
the name of my new project let's say the
name should be ng content for like so
hit return and now angular command line
interface is downloading the default
angular project in the newly created
energy content for directory and then in
the next step and that is what is going
on right now here in the terminal is
downloading and installing all the
dependencies into
no to underscore modules folder and this
takes a moment to complete so here we
are you can see installation has been
completed successfully the new project
energy content full has been created so
now we can switch into the newly created
project folder and the first thing we
can check here is if the development web
server is starting up and if we can
access the default angular application
in the browser and the starting up the
development web server is done which
with anji surf like so so this is
running and it's compiling everything
what's needed here for the project and
then bundling it into a few bundles so
that everything is away but we are
getting back the mashup message compared
successfully and from here you can see
that our application should now be a
Weibull on local host port 4200 so let's
let's get back to the browser and check
here on part 4200 what's a Weibull and
as you can see here is the output of the
default angular application so
everything else up and running and our
project is ready now to be enhanced or
let's say extended with our
implementation to access the content in
the content full back-end so let's get
back to the terminal here but before
actually starting with the
implementation part we need to add a few
more dependencies to our project because
we do need yeah let's say three
libraries here and we do that by using
NPM install and then followed by the
name of those three libraries and the
first library has
content full that of the JavaScript SDK
for content of false content delivery
API so of course if we want to like want
to access data from content full we need
that library that JavaScript library for
our angular application and we will make
use of it
so another library we need to answer the
project is called marked and that's a
library for transferring markdown code
to HTML code that will be used to
transfer the value which is for example
stored in the description and the long
description field of a course which is
an away Balazs markdown text into heart
ml HTML so that the output is then a
Weibull to be sent to the browser so and
finally we needed the bootstrap
framework here because I'd like to use
bootstraps CSS classes to style our
application UI so let's hit return and
make sure that those three libraries are
added to the project so again you can
see the installation process is running
those three libraries are being
downloaded right now installed into the
node underscore modules folder again and
we have just to wait for this process to
complete now so ok here we are let's
open up the code editor and I'm using
Visual Studio code so I can simply say
code dot to open the current folder
within Visual Studio code so here we are
that's our project and two the first
thing I need to do now is to make sure
that
we have access to the bootstraps CSS
file and therefore I need to include the
bootstrap CSS file into my project and
the easiest way to do so is to open up
the file starts dot CSS and at an import
statement here which is the following
okay like so let's pipe past it in here
okay that import statement is needed and
by adding that import statement here
into stars dot CSS we are making sure
that from the node underscore modules
folder within bootstrap dist
CSS the far bootstrap main dot CSS is
included and all the CSS classes which
are defined in that file are available
and can be used in our components
template code we are going to implement
later on okay so okay now that the
project setup is ready we are able to
start with the implementation of the
application and the first thing we are
going to add and yeah add to our
application here is a new service and
this service then should contain the
logic were just needed to retrieve data
from content full and the service will
be consumed by other components we will
be adding later on and to add a new
service you to you the project again we
are using the angular command-line
interface and I can do it here from
right inside my editor I can select view
integrated terminal and then an
integrated terminal is opening up here
at the bottom and now I can use as the
ng command and then option D for
generate service and the service name
should be content full of course and
then I'm using the dash dash module
command and parameter here to tell
ignacio artie at that
service to the app module the default
the default angular module which is
Waverly R in the project setup okay
hitting return now you can see it's
running and once the services added we
are getting back this message here two
files have been attitudes a project in
the app folder so let's opening up a P
you can see it here its content food
service dot TS and content food dot
service dot speck dot TS for our test
cases so to implement the service we
will cause use content folder service
dot TS and although the update is done
here in app dot module dot TS as
specified so let's take a look at that
file you can see it here is a
corresponding import statement for
content full service has been added
automatically and then content full
service has been added to the array
which is a scientific providers property
here of the @anjghie module decorator so
that the services and Weibull in in app
module and we can make use of that
service in all the components we are
adding later on here to add module as
well ok to implement the service I'm
opening up content folder service dot
atieast once again and the first thing I
need to do here is to add import
statements on top let's import the
following first of all we need something
which is called great kohl-lined and
entry both from the content folder our
script libraries we are importing it
from contentful like so ok and then in
the class implementation here I'm adding
first of all the
variable which stores the connection to
content fold so I'm creating a new
member here with the private key word
and the member is called client and I'm
using the great client method here to
initiate that new connection and Craig
kind is expecting to get passed in an
configuration object here and that
configuration object needs to contain
two properties the space ID which is
assigned to user space property in next
the access token both both values which
needs to be assigned to you the
properties here can be can be accessed
in the back at Google do that on the
next step but I will not put in the
values of the space at the MC access
token right here inside my service class
I will put both values in my environment
file so that I can then access it by
using by first importing environment TS
which is a Weibull here in the
environments folder and at the moment
you can see it's empty with only one
property year production it equals false
and I'm adding properties here for the
space ID and for the token so let's do
it let's say we would like to have a
property which is called content 4 and
this is an object containing the space
ID as a spring and of course C token as
a string so mana can import let's say
fat first Xena can import environment TS
here
came in vironment from inside my project
so one level a person it's in
environments environment like so okay
and now it's a Weibull and now i can
assign it here via an environment dot
content full dot space ID and the access
token is available in environment
content full dot token okay Maxo so of
course now i need to go back to
environment dot TS and make sure that
the actual values for my specific
content full space are inserted here so
let's get into the browser again and
here we are back in the content for back
end and to access both settings i can
now click on space settings and opening
up the link api keys so here can use the
button and api key to add a specific key
combination for your application
so it's possible to create a multiple
key combination so that each of your
applications access in the same space
has its own combination of keys i've
already done so so i have my key
combination here with ng content for 0 1
1 a waiver so i can click on that and
then it's opening up the following
screen here you can see here is my space
ID which i can copy and then go back to
visual studio code and insert that space
ID right here so back in the browser you
can see right underneath space ID
you will find the access token so
clicking on that button here is copying
it to the clipboard and then I can go
again to visual studio code and insert
the token here and that make sure that
the settings are in place so I can now
close environment TS and that should be
working here so now we have the
connection to content full established
here in our arm content for service
class and now we can continue to
implement our service methods and I'd
like to add two methods here so one
method to get all the courses and one
method to get a specific course by ID so
let's start was the first one that
should be called get courses it takes as
a parameter as an optional parameter we
can pass in query object here if you
would like to make it usable in a
generic way so that's of type object and
then it's returning a promise and the
promise is typed so we're using the
entry type here which is coming from the
content full library and saying entry is
of type ami and we are expecting to get
back an array here because we are
expecting to get a list of entries okay
so let's continue with the
implementation of the method body so
what we need to do here to retrieve that
list else to return following this dot
client so we are making use of that
active connection here to content for
and calling the service method from the
content full SDK which is called get
entries and then we're using object dot
sign here to create a new configuration
object which is
turning a property which is called
content type and we are setting it to
course because we would like to request
only entries of content type course that
the content type we have been creating
at the beginning of course and then
passing here as the second parameter is
a query object which is passed into the
method okay and then as we are getting
back a promise here we can then connect
with them and make sure that the
response object is not returned in the
way it is at a setup we only wanted to
have the items property to be returned
so I'm using an error function here to
make sure that only items yes returned
like so so okay let's add the second
service method which is called get cost
to only return a specific cost and here
we need as a parameters across ID of
course so let's say cause ID and the
return type here is again a promise
typed with entry of type any no of
course not as an array just as one entry
okay and then the implementation of the
method body is very similar to what
we've seen before it's returning what
we're getting back from the call of this
client get entries again I'm using
object sign here in the following way
I'm setting the content type property
here to calls from a configuration
object which is path to the
entries method call like so and then I
need to pass in a query object here and
the query is containing the following we
would like to have that entry which has
which equals or the property is this
this dot ID equals cause ID because in
this dot ID we are we are able to access
the cause ID of that specific object
okay then of course connecting the same
method here and making sure that again
we are returning not the full response
object but only what's available in in
the response object in items property
and here we need to access because that
is an array by default and we are
expecting to get only one result back we
need to access by using the brackets
index syntax here is e first element in
that array which should be the only
element available here okay
so the content full service now is ready
and can be used in all of our components
and at the moment of course we have not
been adding new components to our
project and that's exactly what we are
going to do in the next step the
application should comprise basically
two views one view is the list of
courses and the other view else of the
course details page and for both views
for the list view and course details
page we will have two components and in
the next step now we will start with the
component for
the cause list and that component is
additive to the project by using angular
command-line interface again here from
within my code editor in the integrated
terminal I'm typing in an GG for
generate and then C for component and
the name should be cause - list so
return now you can see the command is
again running and adding in total four
new files to the project all files
located in the cause - list subfolder of
the app folder you can see the new files
here and those files are containing just
if you take a look here inside a default
implementation of an empty component and
it's although making sure here that this
new component is added to a module so if
I take a look here in inside of app
module you can see the cause list
component import statement has been
added and Casa list component has been
added automatically to Z array which is
assigned to user declarations property
so con celeste component is now a
Weibull within our project and the next
step now is to implement that new
component and we will start the
implementation here right in file cost -
list component TS right here so first of
all i need to add a few input statements
here so let me import a router from the
at angular slash rota package next i
need to import the content full service
we have been implemented before also
import content for service and as a
service is imported from the file which
is here located in my project structure
so one level up and then its content
folder service and finally we do need
the entry class from the content for
library okay
like so so now in the cost list
component class I first of all need a
new class member here which is called
courses and the courses variable is used
then to store the list of the list of
course entries we are getting back from
our service and therefore is of type
entry any and of course is array and we
are initializing that was an empty array
so like so okay and then we are using
dependency injection here in angular to
inject
services into our component and the
first service we do need here is the
router service and this is being done by
using the private key word and declaring
constructor parameters here so I'm
saying private router of type router and
the next service we would like to inject
here is of course our own content full
service and again I'm using the private
key word here to declare that variable
here content for
service of type content for service like
so okay so next in the lifecycle method
entry on in it which is called once the
component is initialized we will add a
line of code here which is then used to
request the data from the content for
service and making sure that the data
which is coming back from the service is
stored in courses and this is being done
by using this content for service and
then we are calling the service method
we have been implemented before which is
called get courses and as we are getting
back a promise we can then connect
what's up with the end method and pass
in an error function here which is
making sure that we are taking what we
are getting back and assigning this to
system to cause us ok like so so finally
I'm going to add another method here
this method is go it's name due to
caused details page and a surname
already tells you this method will be
used to invoke the router service to
navigate to the corresponding cost
details page every time the user clicks
on a corresponding button button will be
implemented on the template and the next
step and then this method will be
connected with a click event of that
button so we are implementing it here
and of course it takes or it needs to be
supplied with one parameter and that's
the cause Rd because it needs to know
because a deeper cause the cause ID will
be part of the URL we are navigating to
you for the details page because the
details page gets passed
the cause Rd via a URL parameter so we
need to have the cause idea Wavell here
and so the routing is done very easily
by calling this dot router dot navigate
and navigate method here is expecting to
get one rate and the first element of
that array is of type string and is just
the the URL we would like to navigate to
and that is cause so later on we will be
configuring our our routing setup here
in our application and that will be one
route we are adding to the configuration
and we need to ask as a second element
here in that array we need to pass and
cause ID so that quads ideas being added
as a you our parameter here to that
route okay so next let's switch over to
you on the components template code
which is located in course - list
component dot HTML and that's the
default code we are getting rid of that
code to start over with an empty file
here and now the first thing I'm going
to add is a div element here on top and
then we will use some of boot straps CSS
classes to to style our application so
let me start with another div element
here and I'm assigning the class of
alert alert
- info pay like so then let me add the
role attribute here as well the very
gear is alert
and then I'm using the ng4 directive
here to iterate over the elements in the
causes array and that is done by using
the following syntax here and the value
or the string value which needs to be
assigned to ng4 is the let course so the
current course object as a label and
course of courses so that's the array we
defined in the class and now is this
diff section and the content of that
diff section is repeated for everything
across element we are getting back from
our service call from content full and
output it then generated here in the
same way for every single entry so
within that a large section let's use
another div element here and again I am
assigning some of bootstraps classes
first deep - flex flex - wrap flex -
excel no trap
and finally the Flex - LG - no wrap
class okay one class is missing flex -
MD - you know wrap so like so and wasn't
that if element which is now outputted
with flex layout capabilities I'm using
another div element here now I'm
assigning the class P - - for assigning
padding and within that first div
element let me first print out or output
the causes image and the causes image
should be outputted as a URL so that the
user can click on that image and then
has taken to the
cause ul so let's start with a H ref
element and set up the value of the ATF
attribute here to you what's available
in course don't fields dot you are so
you are you remember was just one of our
properties with this we defined for the
cause
type in content fall and all the fields
we defined for that content type are now
available here in fields properties so
we can access those the values of those
fields by saying course dot fields dot
and then the name of the field so that
is you are in that case ok so that is of
the value I need to put it as a string
here of course and then I set target to
underscore blank so that it has opened
up in another tab and then closing the
edge tech here and inside of that link
I'm outputting the image by using the
IMG tag here and I'm setting the SSE
attribute to the following string again
we are using the double curly braces
syntax here and now we can access cause
again the fields property and in fields
we have defined a field which is called
cause image and to read up the URL of
that image which has been uploaded we
need to access fields again for this
cause image because it is a separate
entry so again it has the fields
property here and then file dot URL ok
so that is the way here ok let's add
some classes here to the IMG tag or just
say one class rounded to make sure that
it has round borders here and I'm
defining a ways of
let's say a hundred 96 pixels okay and
closing the tech here okay
okay sanrak underneath that div element
let's define another div element again
with a class of P P - - like so and
within that div element now let's start
with some was a headline which is an age
five and this gets assigned that the
bootstrap classes are learned - heading
so now we need to print out the title
information but the title should be
again outputted as a link so starting
again was a H ref and to know it's again
the same I'm putting that expression
here in the spring watches assigned to
you the attribute here again like so and
the target property again should be
blank to make sure that it is opened up
in a new tab always the user clicks on
that link and okay and now the text is
or the text of the link should be the
title of the course again I'm using the
angular expression syntax here and now I
can find the title in course dot fields
dot title okay
like so so having outputted the courses
headline we now need to include the
other cause information we do have for
example the answer next so let's start
with a paragraph element here and I'm
printing it out in italics so I'm using
the attack and
again I can find the information in
course dot fields dot answer then I need
to output the description here I'm using
a development and the description is
available and course dot fields dot
description then I'd like to include a
button so that the user can click on the
button and it again takes takes the user
to the courses website
so again ay-ay-ay element H ref
attribute is again set to the courses
you have a Weibull and course dot fields
dot ul
target should again be blank I'm
assigning a class here BTN and BTN -
success - output of the button in a
green color closing the element here and
the text on the button should be go to
course ok so then we have another button
which is needed because user has two
options the user can click on the first
button and go to the courses website and
that the user have the option to you
click on the second button and go to the
courses details page and that is done by
using the button element here and again
we're using the BTW and clouds and now
the BTN - info class - to print out or
to output the button and a blue color so
like so the text on the button should be
cause details and now of course so that
the action is actually happening which
the user Associates was that button we
need to bind the click event
of that button to event handler method
and the event handler method has already
implemented because that is go to cause
details page so the mess that we
implemented earlier in the course first
component class and you may remember
this method is expecting to get one
parameter and that parameter should be Z
cos ID and the course ID is label in
course dot dot ID so so this is a
template code now the first template is
ready and of course the application is
if I go to the browser not loading the
output of that template already if we
first need to configure the the router
in our application and make sure the
cause list component is connected to
around and we can access that route here
in the browser and that is what we are
going to do in the next step
so to include the route a router
configuration
let's open up app dot module dot TS and
first of all I'm adding an import
statement here and we need two things
here we need access to router module and
we need access to routes and both as a
Weibull was in a package which is called
an angular slash rota okay so that's it
and now we can include the route
configuration in that file the right and
easy important's here I'm adding a Const
account variable which is called routes
and is of type routes which is defined
by an array and the array contains
objects containing properties which are
needed to describe a route for our
application so let's start we always
need the past property here and the
first is the default route
so we leave that string which is
assigned to pass empty and for the
default route we want to like to
establish a redirect so redirect to and
this property redirect to gets assigned
the route to which other user should be
redirected and in our cases that's
caused us because that will be the next
one we are going to configure and edit
the route which will be connected to
cause list component and therefore is
printing out the list of components
another attribute should be added here
and other properties that else pass
match and that should be set to full
okay
so next line here is again starting with
an object containing the property pass
this time the pass is cautious so
exactly that route to which the redirect
in the first case should go and now we
use a property which is called component
here in that configuration and we are
pointing that route to our course list
component which is already imported so
it's a Weibull who is in that file okay
like so okay and now to make or to
include in the output what is coming
from the component which is connected to
the route we need to do one further
thing we need to add an element which is
called router
- outlet to the template code to the
main component template code which is
available in app component dot HTML and
here you can see that the default code
which is included here and now we can
get rid of that default code here in and
include instead the code which is needed
to and which makes sure that the output
from our route component is added here
so deleting that code here and then
starting over again with a div element
and which gets assigned the class of
container another bootstrap class and
within that div element we can now
include the router - outlet element ok
like so let's save it so and to finally
activate the routing configuration for
our application we need to do one final
step here in app dot module dot yes
because now we have included here our
routes object or array which is
containing the objects which contain the
configuration now we need to attach that
configuration to our application and
that is being done by adding here to the
array which is assigned to the imports
property by adding router module dot for
a route and then passing in a
routes array here ok and before moving
on and checking if everything is working
I noticed here we have one little type
we need to correct so the leading slash
is not needed here in the spring which
is society the past property so it's in
this case it's only causes in the
redirect to case it needs to be slash
causes so this is correct let's save it
see is that everything is compiling and
bundled successfully and now we can go
to the browser and you can already see
the result here and if I now remove
course and try to access the default URL
you can see we are being the redirected
automatically to slash classes and the
output now is Weibull you can see that
is pretty much what it should look like
so we now have a list of a list of
courses here a Weibull and the complete
content is retrieved from content full
and you can now go to the content full
editor and change the content here for
exam
we'll change the author information
change the headline and so on safe and
publishes in content full and then
reload the page and you can see that the
content is actually coming from content
full because then it's updated here as
well so if I now click on go to course
you can see it's already working what's
not working so far is of course a cost
details page that is not working so we
need to now in the next step add the
component for course details add another
router or routing configuration and then
close that gap here so to add the new
component again we are making use of
angular CLI and here in the integrated
terminal I'm typing an mg g CD for
generate c for component and then the
name of the component which shipped
because - details ok now again for new
files are added to the project and your
subdirectory is added here in the app
folder you can see it right here cause
details again you will find four files
containing the default implementation of
new angular component and again you can
see app module has been updated to also
include that new component so that we
are ready to use that component in our
project since before adding the
implementation for the course details
component let me first completely
complete the router configuration
because now the component of the
component skeleton is Weibull so and
it's imported here in app module cost
details component here yes the
corresponding import statement with that
in place I'm now able to add another
configuration here to our routes array
so
starting was passed again and to excess
one single cause we will use the
following URL course slash and then in
parameter and the parameter is included
in that at URL or the pass here by using
the following syntax so this is the ID
so cause slash followed by the ID of the
specific class which should be displayed
here and now we need to connect Abed
pass with component caused details
component of course so that the routing
configuration is no complete and with
that configuration in place we can now
go back to you cause - details component
dot TS and here you can see that's the
default implementation nothing in so far
so just an empty class here basically
and now we can start again adding the
code which is needed for cost details so
again the first thing I need to add here
are a few import statements so first I
need to import router activated route
and param met from the angular outer
package which is named add angular slash
router okay then of course I need the
content full-service content for service
and again it's imported from within my
project structure here one level up and
then it's a Weibull and content folder
service dot yes so that's the import
statement and then I'd like to have an
trio able which is coming from the
content for SDK so just content full ok
like so now on
class level we need again a member
variable here which is called course and
is of type entry any like so and then we
are using dependency injection once
again this time we need to inject sweet
services here into our constructor so
private route is of type activated route
then private router of type router and
finally of course our content for
service like so okay so next we
implement the energy on init method here
and what needs to be done here is to
first of all retrieve the ID routing
parameter so that we have the ID
available forth which the cost details
page is requested and then with that
idea waiver we use on the content for
service again and the service method get
cost to get to get back all the
information for that specific course and
stored in course so let's get started
here so the first thing is to retrieve
CID and therefore I'm storing the ID in
cause ID and this is equal to this third
route dot snapshot param map and then
get and ways get we can access any ul
parameter and we know from our routing
definition that a parameter for that URL
is a Weibull and that parameter is ID so
we can get Rd here
okay now with the course ID Weibull from
the UL we can now call our service so
content full service and the service
method I'd like to use here and we have
implemented that method earlier is get
cause and this method is expecting to
get a cause ID so we have that cause ID
so I can directly pass it no not as this
cause can directly pass it in cause ID
okay then we're getting back to the
promise so I can attach them and within
then I need to pass in a function and
again I'm using an error function here
so with the parameter of course and this
function is making sure that this course
is set to cause so that it's available
in in our class member okay
I need to add a semicolon here so this
should be complete now we need another
method here the rest of this called go
to your list
that's simply a navigation method to
which is connected to the click event of
a button which the user can then use to
go back to the ListView
so leaving the details view and go back
to the ListView
so again we're using this dot router dot
navigate and then s seen before we need
to pass in an array here is this time it
needs only to have one element because
we do not need to supply the course
route with any parameters so we have
only that string included here and
that's pretty much all we need so next
let's continue with the template of
course details component in file course
- details component dot HTML I'm
deleting the default content here we do
not need that and start with an empty
file again I'm starting with a div
element here and again using an angular
directive which is called ng-if so that
this page is only outputting the content
if course dot fields is a Weibull so
that a cause for a specific ID has been
retrieved from content for successfully
only in that case this is included in
the output what's now coming here was in
the div section okay first of all again
I'd like to output the image again as
link so starting was a H ref element
again
and here including double curly braces
in that string and setting it to you the
following expression course dot fields
dot URL okay as seen before target needs
to be must go blank to open it in a new
new browser tab and then within that
anchor element here I'm including an IMG
element to display the image let's say
it should be with let's say of 40% and
we include some inline styling here just
to set a margin of 10 pixels maybe okay
this should be working and then I'm
adding classes here we do need load -
right and around it okay and finally the
source most important for the image
again double curly braces here for
including an angular expression and the
source for that image is again a Weibull
and course dot fields dot cause image
dot fields dot v dot URL okay
and then we can just close the image tag
here
okay so next we are printing out the
title again as a link therefore I am
using h2 tag the link so we can reuse it
here again target blank like so okay and
the text for the link should be what we
get back from course dot fields dot
title of course okay so next in italics
the author name so we are saying bye and
then including the author name so it's
cause dot fields dot also next some line
breaks and then we continue with the
description and the description should
be embedded in a div element so diff
like so and the description is a Weibull
in course dot field dot description and
finally in a new div element the long
description as well because we are on
the course details page and that page
should contain the long description as
well this correction okay okay and
having included those description fields
here now finally we need a link to the
course UL as a button and then a button
for going back so first again
the link so let me copy just that link
element here okay like so now I'm adding
the class attribute here and we are
assigning the class as BTN BTN - success
and the button should contain the text
go to cause okay and then finally we do
need to include the button with class
BTN BTN - danger for displaying it in a
red color back to list and now very
important we do not need to forget to
connect the click event of that button
with the method we have implemented
before which is called go to list okay
so let's check the result in the browser
you can see we are still here in the
ListView now for any of those courses
I'm able to click on cross details as
you can see here and it takes me to you
the cost details page which looks like
the following and you may notice here is
something which is not as it is expected
because you know the description field
and the long description field in
content foe has been defined as a
markdown field
so markdown is used for for including
formattings like bold text text in
italics and you can see here our
underscores included which is markdown
syntax but that is not what we want to
have as an output we do not want to see
the markdown text instead we would like
to see the output will see formattings
applied and so we need in the next step
now make sure that before outputting
that text for description and for long
description that the markdown code is
transferred to HTML code and for that
purpose we have been installing the
marked you have a script library at the
beginning and to apply that library to
you what we are outputting here
the easiest way we can do it an angular
is to implement a custom pipe and then
apply the pipe and our template code and
that is what we're going to do now to
complete the project
so back in Visual Studio code I'm using
the integrated terminal again to
generate a pipe ng G pipe and the name
should be MD to HTML
and is generating two files as you can
see here adding the part to app dot
module dot TS so that the pipe can then
be used in all the components templates
belonging to ab module and we start the
implementation here in the file MD - - -
HTML dot v dot TS that's the default
implementation as you can see here and
because we would like to use the marked
library we need to import it so import
Asterix as marked from marked ok and
then the pipe includes the
transformation logic which is applied
when applying the pipe to a certain
expression of the template here in the
transform method and at the moment it's
returning non sono transformation is
happening and what we need to replace
you to make the transformation happening
from mark down code to HTML is simply
called
and pass in the original markdown text
which is a Weibull here in value and
what is returned by marked is the HTML
output so as simple as that okay so our
part is in place and now of course we
need to adapt the template so let's
start with the course list components
template in course - list component HTML
and what we now need to do here is to
apply the pipe when outputting the
description information and the way we
do that is by using the attribute inner
HTML of that element here and bind it to
the following first let's use an
attribute here and now we bind it to
cause dot fields dot this script and of
course apply the pipe MD - html5 is
making sure that we are actually getting
back HTML code and that HTML code is set
as the inner HTML code of that div
element and what now can be removed as
the expression which is included here
because we are setting the content of
that div element by simply using inner
HTML so let's copy that line of code
because that is not the only template
which needs to be adapted the other
template is of course the course details
components template and here we need to
replace the output of description of
course and the output of long
description so
long description yes well so back into
browser you can now see ok the output
looks much better
with the pipe applied and let's take
let's go back to the list let's go to
cost details of another course ok
everything seems to be looking right so
this is exactly what we want to get back
as an output here so no everything is in
place our application is running we have
set up our angular 5 front-end
application and the content we are seen
here in our single page web application
is served from content full and now with
that in place we can use content full as
our content management system in the
backend and for example let's say here
for the first course go to cost details
and maybe would now update the content
which is being served from content full
and say you want to include further
paragraph or refers a headline here in
the long description text and now that
is easy because the user can go to the
content full back-end go here to the
content tab in the backend and selects a
course here for example this was the
first one in our list and then opening
up the content full editor here and
scroll down to the long description and
maybe we can then add text here another
headline and let's say we would like to
display it as heading 1 so that's the
markdown editor and of course we can
switch to the preview to see how this is
being formatted in the output so go back
to the editor and then hit publish
changes here and all the changes are
published here in the backend and now we
can check again in our angular
application so here back and the
let's click again on the cost details
link for that course and you can see
here the changed content is displayed
another headline as a text is included
here and that I think is showing that it
is a really powerful combination
combining your single page web
application written in angular with a
content management system in the back
end so this is content full and of
course it's not limited as mentioned in
the beginning to just serve the content
for an angular application you can use
the same content in any other
application so one central central
service where you are maintaining your
content and then supplied to all your
application in that generic approach so
