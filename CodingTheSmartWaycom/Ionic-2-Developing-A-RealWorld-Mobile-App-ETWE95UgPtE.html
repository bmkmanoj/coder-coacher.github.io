smart Wacom and today in this video
tutorial I'd like to show you how to
build a real-world ionic 2 application
with external API access so ionic 2 is
the latest version of the great mobile
framework which is based on angular 2 so
ionic is great for building applications
for being used on multiple mobile
platforms and making use of your
existing web development skills in this
case its angular 2 and javascript and
typescript of course and in the sample
application we are going to build in
this tutorial I will show you step by
step how to build an application from
scratch and guide you through all the
steps which are needed to get going with
ionic 2 fast ok so let's see what we are
going to build in this tutorial here is
the sample application so you can see we
have a simple ionic 2 application with a
tap navigation here on the bottom area
and you can see here's the home page
then we have a link to the profiles page
and a contact page and if I now click on
profiles here you see here I'm on the
profile page and what you can do here is
to type in a github username for example
it's use my username here and then hit
the search button and you can see
another area is shown here giving me
basic information about my my profile
you can see here it's my name it's a
short description which is available on
github you
see the number of followers and the
number of public ripples here in my
github account and I can reserve it of
course when it's done okay let's do it
again okay and if I now click I click
here on the 27 public repos you can see
oath of Whipple's is shown and I can
scroll here all the way down and for
example click on one of the repos let's
use this one and then I'm taken to
another page and that's the repo details
page showing me some more more
information about this repo I have
selected you can see I have the
description here the language I'm using
watches count of watches count of stars
and the count of forks and from this
page here I can use a better on button
to directly go to that armed repository
page on github
okay that's basically the sample
application and now let's start with the
first implementation step ok the first
step is to initiate a new empty io-
project and you can do this very easily
by using the ionic command-line
interface and the command-line interface
is a Weibull after having installed at
the corresponding NPM package so if you
have not installed yet on your system
you can do it by simply typing in NPM
install - g4 installing it globally on
your system and then Aiona come at the
first package you need and you should
also install the code dov'è package as
well so this is a command which
which makes the ione command line
interface away belong a system I have
already installed ionic so I do not need
to execute this command right now so
let's start right away with the
initialization of the MIT project and we
can do so by using the ionic command now
in the following way we do need to say
start because we want to initiate a new
project and then I need to pass over the
project name I would like to have and in
that case I am choosing as a project
name I own github and the last thing I
need to pass over is the flag - - LVT
because I would like to use ionic - so
let's execute it and after having hit
enter you can see it's downloading or
the starter template which is I will
start at apps template you will see it
in a moment when we are running the
implication so it has a basic caps
navigation included so exactly what we
want to have for our sample application
and now it's installing all all the NPM
dependencies here so this takes a second
to complete okay here we are you can see
installation and downloading of all
dependencies has been performed
successfully and now I can enter the new
project directory
let's switch into it I own github and
now I can make first test to see that
everything has been initialized as
expected and the application is already
running so I only need to talk in ionic
surf ok that is starting up the web
server and running the application on
part eight eight thousand one hundred
takes a second
okay
so you can see the browser is opening up
and loading our application and you can
see it's already containing some content
here on the home page it has a tab
navigation included we can switch to the
about page here the page is empty we can
switch to the contact page that's the
default content of the contact page and
that's the basic setup of the
application so that we can now use with
this application with some initial
project to to implement our sample
application okay so let's enter this
webserver here okay and I'm starting up
my editor as Adam I'm using okay here we
are you can see that the initial project
structure within my project directory I
on github and the main implementation
stuff goes right here into the soul
folder you can see on the source folder
is containing a subfolder which is
called app and here you can find for
example the the main dot TS and the
implementation of app module and of
course the implementation of app
component which is the root component of
our application so here in the app
folder you can find all the basic stuff
and a second sub folder you will find
here is the pages folder that folder is
containing again a set of sub folders
one sub folder for each of the pages in
our application and right now the sample
application is consisting of four pages
in total we have the about page we have
the contact page with the home page and
we have another page that the taps page
which is contained
the code which is needed to show the
attacks navigation and if I now take a
look in one of the top folders here you
can see it's each of the pages is
converting off of multiple files you
will find here a file with the expansion
TS let's see our main implementation
here of the a page class and then we
have the corresponding HTML file which
is containing the template code for that
page and of course and a CSS file if you
want to bring in some styling you can do
it here in that file okay that's the
basic structure and now we can extend
this initial structure by bringing in
our first component we do need and as we
would like to retrieve data from the
github API for example the data of a
user profile and the data of
repositories of a profile we do need our
some code which is accessing an external
API and returning the data which we do
need for displaying in the application
and the best idea here is to bringing a
service class which is doing the
communication with the external API and
that is the first thing we are now
adding to the project so adding a
service to our project is very easy by
using the ionic command interface once
again and now we are executing that
command in the following way again a
start with the ione command then I need
a G this stands for generate and then I
do specify what I want to generate and
in that case I would like to generate a
provider and finally I need a name for
my new provider and Lettuce github -
service
okay so now you can see as the command
is finished we have now here a new
subfolder within the source folder and
that sub folder is called providers and
if I take a look inside that folder you
will find our new service implementation
here in the file github - servers PS so
let's open that file and here you can
see it's a very simple service class you
can see it has only a constructor so far
and the constructor has one parameter
and that is the HTTP service which is
injected here into our component by
default and of course for our
requirements we want to access the
external API of github we will make use
of that of that HTTP angular 2 service
so we do not need to change anything
here it's already prepared so we can
start directly with implementation the
service methods we would like to have
basically I need to add two service
methods because the first the first type
of information we would like to retrieve
on is the profile for a given user name
so let's name this method get profile
and we will pass in the music name and
expect that all this method is returning
the profile information ok the second is
service method we would like to have is
the getter
repos method because we would like to
have a service method which is
retrieving all the repositories for a
given user and name from the github API
so we need to pass in the user name here
as well okay like so and now let's
define a class member which is called
base URL and this this member should be
of type string and let's set this base
URL here is the constructor to a string
and that string is the base URL of the
github API for retrieving profile
information and repository information
and that is HTTP API dot github.com
users okay like so and now we can
implement get profile which is very easy
we only need to return return this HTTP
GET we are using the get method here
from the HTTP service to you initiate a
HTTP GET request and then we need to
pass in the URL and the you are the
first part of the URL is of course this
base URL and now we can concatenate the
username to retrieve the set of profile
information for that specific username
and now this get method is returning and
observable so we can use the map
operator from the rxjs library here to
transfer the result to education format
and we do that by using the map function
in the following way we are passing in
the function and the fat arrow notation
so we are putting in the response object
which is right here and then
using a set arrow sign and returning
rest dot Jason which gives us back a
string which is adjacent representation
of the response object okay semicolon
and we do the same here for get repose
so return this HTTP GET again we are
using this dot base URL and then
concatenating that URL was first the
username again and then with third part
here with the string slash we chose a
place so we can get the repost for a
given user profile and then of course
using again the map operator here and
doing the same transformation step to
receive the response data in JSON format
okay like so okay so now that the
service implementation is ready we need
to make our application aware of that
service and we need to configure the
injector so that when we later on want
to inject that service into certain
pages where we want to make use of that
service and retrieve data by using that
service we need to configure the
injector so that we can now pass in the
service injected into the constructor of
a page and the injection knows that that
it needs to resolve that github service
by using that exact class here and we do
that injector configuration on the level
of app component and the app component
implementation can be found here in app
F dot component PS so let's open that
file and the first thing we need to do
here is to add another import statement
and I'm adding it here I'm saying import
and of course we want to import git and
github service at the name of our class
and we are importing that from providers
github service so that's it good T as
extension is added automatically here so
we need not to say here yes that's
sufficient to do it in that way and now
to make the injector here on the level
of app component aware of the service
class we need to add one more property
here to you the add component decorator
which is attached to that class so the
name of that property has providers and
providers gets assigned an array and the
first element of that array is now get
out service so by passing in github
service as an element to that array the
injector then knows if we later on
inject something into a page into a page
constructor which is called github
service the injector knows okay github
service needs to be resolved with a
class which is also called github
service and that class can be found here
in the providers directory and the file
github - service doc PS that's basically
the configuration we are doing here ok
so the next thing we do need to else the
profiles page because that is a place
where we wanted to give out the option
to the user of entering a github
username and retrieving detailed
information about the profile itself and
retrieving a list of assigned
repositories and in order to bring in
that new page into our project we are
switching over to the command line again
and using ionic command-line interface
once again to generate that new page for
us and that is done in the following way
so again ionic G at this time we want to
generate a page and the page should be
named profiles okay it returned and then
you see the profiles pages of being and
generated and now we can switch back to
the project structure here in the pages
of folder you will find new subfolder
which is called profiles and in that
folder you can have with three files the
HTML file with the template of the page
CSS CSS file where you have the option
to store some styling for the page and
the transcript file which contains the
profile page class okay but let's switch
over to profiles dot HTML and implement
the template code for the profile page
first and you can see the default
implementation just contains one a
section with that I own header element
and the second section was the iron
content element so here within the iron
elements of which or change the iron
title information to github profile
profile some that's the headline and
then within the iron content section
let's include three times the iron card
element okay like so one two three so
the first iron card section will contain
the code which is needed to display the
the input form so that the user has the
option of entering give up a user
profile name the second section here
will include on the profile information
which are out coded after
having submitted the username and the
search section will include the list of
repositories okay
let's implement another form here in the
first iron current element first and we
do so by first starting out with a form
element okay
and the prom element itself should get
the ng submit attribute that's the event
type and we would like to respond to
that a submit event of the form with the
following event handler method on submit
on submit will be implemented later on
in the profile page class and within the
form we need the one I on item and
within that are an item we will need an
ion label okay and the label is just get
up user and then we need the input
element of course and the input element
is an ion dalish input element and the
input element should be of type text
because the user wants to input a
profile username okay and we will use on
the binding syntax the two-way binding
syntax and bind ng model here to a
property or a class member which is
called github user and we need to add
the name attribute as well a name is
equal the string github underscore user
again okay so let's include a line break
here
and then we do the submit button
so let's include a button element and
let's assign I on button and attribute
here and the button should be of type
submit' okay and it should be a clear
button and it should be a small button
and the button should have the label
search okay and we need another button
here outside of the form element and
that button should be again I am -
button clear and small and we are
connecting the click event to the reset
method system for using the with that
method - to reset the form to MTU the
input element here and so the label of
the body needs to be reserved as well
okay like so
okay now let's switch back to profiles
on TS and implement both event handler
methods on submit and we set and to do
so we will first add we will add some
properties here some class members and
what we need is profiles let's type any
then we need to do the repo we post from
member again of type any and we need to
pay your github underscore user which is
initially just empty okay
and now we can implement the first event
handler that see you on submit method so
let's say on submit
okay and what on submit now is doing is
to to take the github user which is
entered in the form and initiate a get
request to the github API by using our
github service and pass in the github
username and then request the detailed
information of the user profile okay the
first step of course is to include a
github service here on top with another
import statement so let's say import
github service and we are importing it
from the folder providers and the file
name is git hub this service again we do
not need to include the file extension
PS here that's done automatically okay
so now the service is available and to
be able to use that as service here
within our profiles page we need to
inject it here in our constructor and
you can see there are already two
injections in places enough controller
and enough parents objects and we are
doing a third injection here and that is
the github service where were like so by
using the private key word here we are
at the same time not only injecting
github service here we are creating that
class member github service so that we
can by using the github service instance
here within our class methods we can
interact with our github service
instance okay and now we will do the
following we will include another method
here before
before bringing in the implementation of
unsubmitted that is a helper method is
to get the profile information from the
github service and that method is named
get profile it takes a username okay and
then we can say this github service
calling the service method get profile
passing in the username and then
connecting with the magic subscribe and
then we are assigning if we get in
response here we are assigning that
response to profiles so let's again use
a method by using the fat arrow syntax
of egg mascot sexy okay like so and then
we are assigning this profiles is equal
to response because the response object
we are getting back from the get AB
service call is already in JSON format
and now we can directly assign the
response object to the stock profiles
and just to check if everything is
working correctly we can do a console
log and print out this profiles ok like
so and now with that get profile helper
method here in place in class profile
page we can finish the implementation of
on submit and then on submit we are
calling that out a method ok we are
passing in this github user because in
github user you can find the value which
has been entered by the user in the form
input element paying like so and then
resetting the
github user to an empty string and by
doing that we are initiating or
initializing the form once again because
github underscore user was bound to the
ngmodel property by using the two-way
binding syntax and if we now our
assigning an empty string here we are
emptying the value which is displayed in
the form as well okay and okay that's it
and now we need to implement the reset
method as well and reset is very easy we
need to do this profiles in empty string
and we need to assign an empty string to
github user as well okay okay now it
would be good to trial the application
and see of the github service and the
profile page is working already as
expected but before doing so we need to
include the profile page in the tab
navigation so that we are able to access
the page and it will try the form out
and to do so we need to open up the taps
folder here and first let's open taps
table PS here and though here you can
see on the navigation at the moment that
this is a default setting here of a
project come with over navigation to to
home page about page and contact page
and now let's switch and change the link
for the about page here let's remove it
and include the import statement for the
profiles page so that we can change that
link on to take us through the profile
page okay so let's implement it
first profiles page and we are importing
it from profiles profiles okay and here
in the test page class let's assign to
you the class member tap to root not the
about page but instead to sign the
profiles page okay when we open taps dot
HTML here and here you can see on the
navigation on the tech navigation we
earlier so at the bottom of our app is
consisting of one iron - taps element
and that element includes three times of
the iron - tap element and now here in
the second element that's assigned to
tap - root we need to change the tab
title it's not growth it's not about any
longer is instead it's profiles and the
tap icon here for our second element can
be changed as well let's say we do not
want to use information circle and said
well it's used on a github icon and
there is a github icon of able is that
agonist called gift and - network for
example you can look up all the icons
which are included in the ionic -
framework on the ionic website and that
is one of the icons which is available
here okay okay now we also need to add
the profile page to our application to
our app module and you can find the
implementation of app module here in the
app folder in app dot module PS and if I
open up the file you can see it's
already containing import statements for
the various pages we have no application
so we do not want to use the about page
any longer
changes that here as well instead I
would like to have an import statement
for the profiles page
okay its profiles profiles okay and now
I can add with that import statement
label I can add of the profiles page to
you on the array here which is assigned
to the declarations property of the ng
module decorator so let's do it
profiles page and here in the array
which is assigned to the property entry
components I change that as well so
let's change about page to profile page
so now we're ready to try everything out
so change back to the command line and
I'm starting the server once again by
using ionic serve okay
so you can see the web server again
starting up at port 8100 it's
transpiling everything and then starting
up the application and loading the first
page in the browser okay here we are and
now you can see in my tab navigation
here I have now the profiles link
included and if I now click on profiles
it takes me to the profiles page and you
can see here that our first I own card
element and the input element is
available here so that I can enter a
user name here for example then hit
search and you can see nothing happens
um so far and the clear of course
because we have not included the output
of the profile information here in our
template yet but if I now switch over to
the console you can see it's printed out
here you can see if you are web service
the github web service is returning one
object and that object is containing a
list of properties with information
about my github user profile okay now
I'm Megan profiles got HTML and now as
we have seen that our application is
running and the service is working and
requesting data from the github API we
can extend our template here by
implementing the second eye on - card
section here and that should be the
section has already mentioned which
should contain the output of the
profiles information so let's start here
on the first thing I would like to add
is the directive ng is because I would
only like to include that iron - card
element in the output is the profiles in
information is a Weibull within profiles
so I'm saying ng F equals profiles and
then I'm starting out by including an
iron - item okay and the first thing we
would like to do is to display the user
avatar and we can do that very easily by
using an ionic element again and that
element is called iron - avatar okay
and I'm assigning the property item -
less because we want to display the
avatar image on the left side and then
I'm including an image element and I am
assigning the following expression to
the source attribute so it's profiles
and profiles has a property which is
called avatar underscore URL okay let's
save it okay so the next thing on here
read the right under iron avatar I would
like to print out or beyond name of TM
of the profile user and I would like to
print out the location and we do that by
including an h2 tag here first and I'm
using the expression syntax here again
and saying profiles dot name and then
I'm using a paragraph here and including
profiles dot location okay
so let's quickly check if this is
working let's again go to profiles and
turn Molly github user profile name hit
on search and you can see here it's
included another iron card section my
avatar image my name and tell the
location
okay let's include some more information
here let's continue with an element
which is called iron - card - content
okay let's include the paragraph here
and then let's include the information
which is available in profiles bio okay
then include iron - row and two times
with the iron - : element 1 2 and maybe
maybe 3 okay and in the first column
let's include the buttons again we need
to assign the attribute iron - button I
can left clear and small and the content
of the button is at first and iron - the
name of the darkness person and and then
in this section and the diff section is
including the information of how many
followers I currently have on my profile
and the follow-up count information is
available in profiles
dot followers
then I say follow us I'll play I'll
follow play like so and in the second
iron - color section I do include
another button this time of the icon of
the button should be get - branch and I
would like to include the information of
how many public repos are currently
assigned to my profile and that
information is available here in
profiles dot public underscore repos and
I'm changing followers Q public repos so
later on we'll use that button so that
the user can click on that button and
then gets another output with a list of
those repositories okay and then the
last iron column element I do include
iron - note and within that element I'm
printing out the profound of company
information okay so check it out once
again go to profiles page and a github
users and hit Search and you can see we
are getting back an arrow so here you
can see cause but cannot read property
company of undefined so okay I forgot
the S here let's clear profile is
undefined but profiles is defined so
let's try it again another time profile
it have username hit on search and now
you can see here the information I I
included here in the template are now
available here in the output and you can
see here it's showing the number of
followers I have and here it's showing
the number of public repos I have and if
I now click on that button nothing is
happening right now but in a moment we
are going to change that so that the
user is able to click here on public
repos and then get back a list of those
public repos here underneath
okay so let's attach an event handler
for the click event here - on that
button and we are using the event
binding syntax here and then click
equals to and we are defining new event
handler method which is called in that
case so read close and we are passing in
profile log in that's the profile
username so that the show repos method
knows for which user profile we would
like to show all the public repositories
so let's get back to profile ts and
implement that event handler method and
here we are and we will implement the
event handler here and so we need to say
share ripples okay we are expecting to
get the github user here okay and then
we make use of another helper method we
are implementing later on and that
helper method is get repos and we are
passing in the github
Buhler here okay
so let's implement get ripples right
here okay now the implementation is is
again making use of github service so we
need to say this github service and now
we are using the service method we have
already implemented which is called get
repos we are passing in the username and
then saying subscribe and we are taking
the response and the styling the
response to the repos a class member we
have defined earlier and so we need to
say this repos equals should term should
be response ok and finally we can print
it out to the control so let's do a
console door block and then say this
repos ok ok so let's check if everything
is working again I'm opening up the
profile page and make the console with a
bull ok now I can again enter my github
user profile name hit on search and you
can see okay we are getting like the
profile information and now if I click
on the public repos button here you can
see it's returning all the repos all 27
repos and for each of the repos I have
an object here available with multiple
properties giving me all the details I
need to know
about one of my repos and now we can use
those properties those property values
to extend our template for the profiles
page to print out a list of repos as
well okay so let's go back into our
template implementation here in profiles
dot HTML and in the last and third iron
- code section we now want to include on
the template code which is needed to
output a list of repos and the first
thing I'm doing here is to include the
ng-if directive again here and I set it
to repose so I'll simply telling telling
ionic or to only include data section
and the resulting HTML output if the
repos object is set and repost
information is available if nothing is
in and the user has not are hit that
button that section is not included in
the output ok let's start with the iron
- list element and then include iron -
item which correspond to one list item
and now we can use another directive
here is the ng for directive to iterate
over the repos object and the syntax is
as follows let repo off repos and now we
can access each of the repos here with
the repo variable and print out the
required information and the first thing
I would like to print out and I included
that information here in an h2 tag is
repo dot name to print out the name of
the repo and
and I include a paragraph and I'm
printing out the repo dot description as
well okay okay
let's see how it how it looks like okay
I'm opening up profiles again enter my
github username here hit search hit that
button and now you can see here I get
back a list of repos with the repo name
and the description if the label and so
now I have all the repo information
available here on my profile page so the
next thing we will not create our
application is the ability so that the
user can click on one repo here on the
list and then another page opens up the
repo details page showing some more
detailed information about that specific
repository and to do so we need to add
that new page first to our project so
let's change again to the command line
and use the ionic command a second time
to generate a new page in our
application so let's say I only key page
and the name of that uphs repo - details
and okay so let's generate a system
image so now you can see we have a new
folder here available within the pages
folder and again we have the three files
on the HTML file which contains a
template and es CSS file and the TS file
which contains the implementation of the
repo details page class like you can see
here okay so before implementing the
repo details page and the Year
corresponding template we need to go
back to profiles dot HTML and here in
the last
iron can't perfection where all the
repos are printed out as a list I would
like to connect the click event handler
to another event handler method so I do
it here on the level of the iron item
element and use the event binding syntax
again to connect to the click event tag
to a method which is called repo tapped
and I'm passing in the event object
itself and the current repo okay here we
are and now I need to implement the repo
tapped method here in profile ts of
course and I do it right here so let's
say repoed tapped event repo and now I
would like to use the navigation
controller which is available here and
enough control class member to navigate
to the repo details page and Z else done
in the following way
I'm saying this not controller and then
using the method push and pass in the
page I would like to navigate to repo
details page and pass in a navigation
parameter and let it repo and then I'm
assigning of the value which is
available here in the repo the repo
parameter of this firm event handler
method ok so now I need to add a repo
details page here as an input statement
as well so let's say the import repo
details page from repos details repo
details okay okay so now - I'll be able
to use the repo details page and that
way we need to go back to F dot module
TS and add the repo details page to our
application module as well so let's
include it down here with another
important report details page repo -
details to repo - details okay and now I
need to edit here - the declarations
array repo details page and - on the
Android components array as well
repo details page okay okay so we forget
to include the pages subfolder here like
so
this should be okay now okay so now I
can try it out once again click on
profiles enter on my user profile name
again hit on search hit on public
ripples select one of the ripples here
and now I can see I'm taken to the repo
eatables page the page at the moment
it's empty of course we have not
implemented anything yet and let us know
the next step to implement the repo
details page
okay so let's switch over to repo - DT
RTS and implement the things we do need
here in that page class and the
implementation is straightforward so we
do you need on class level a new class
members
I would like to name selected retool
live type any and this arrival will hold
the current ripple object so that we can
access all the properties within that
object for including the values in the
template and now we need to make sure
that it's selected repo is set to the
selected ripple object and that can be
done here in the constructor because we
have parsed in the current repo of the
navigation parameter we now need to
extract that repo navigation parameter
once again and assign that value to
selected repo okay so let's do it - all
this selected repo equals nice parents
get and the navigation parameter we need
to access is repo ok so that's all
what's needed now we can access all the
repo properties in selected repo and
switch over to the template
implementation ok here the template code
we first are are changing the iron -
title content to repo details page ok
and then within the iron - content
element we are including again an iron -
card element and the first starting out
with no iron - item and the item is
containing an iron - icon element here
and the icon stood in one line here the
item which should be displayed is the
cube icon okay and then we would like to
to say repository details okay and
include an h1 here and h1 should display
the text which is a Weibull in selected
repo dot name so that the name of the
repository and then let's include an h3
tag here to display the information of
selected repo dot owner dot log in which
is marketed user profile name ok next
let's include a a horizontal line here
ok like so and then we are using the
iron - card - content element to bring
in the main current content area and now
we would like to print out information
like the description of the repo of the
programming language used on the watch's
count to the Stars count and the Fox
count so let's start with the
description first let's include the
description in the paragraph here and we
are using a strong elemental printed
bode so it's the scripture and then
let's say ok the description is a
Weibull and select a repo dog
description ok let's copy that line of
code several times ok now we change
description here to language next is
Watchers then we have Taurus
and finally we would like to include the
Fox in our output and now achieve I need
to change the properties used here as
well so that one is language that one
should be Watchers underscore count that
one should be our gathers underscore
count and forks underscore count okay
like so so now let's check it again if
other thing on the our own repo details
page is displayed as expected I once
again open profiles using my user
profile name hit search hit the public
repost button and then I open up one of
the repos and you can see that the
output specified so far
okay so let's in the next step bring in
one more piece of content here we would
like to include a button which gives us
the possibility of clicking on that
button and then directly being taken to
the repository web page of github okay
today so here is the template code I
include a one more iron - cut - content
element okay so let's say we need the
power horizontal line here again okay
and within the new iron cart content
section I'm using an H a link element
with the eight risk
attribute and set this value to selected
repo HTML underscore ul okay and then
use the I - button attribute and icon
left to pull it to the left side okay
so within that link element let's use
again an eye on - icons in this one I
would like to use the icon with the name
get - network once again and then
include a dis section and the gif
section is containing the text of our
button and the text should be go to
repro website okay
so check it out again here on profiles
page and tell the github user search
public repos and now you can see here is
the button with the icon and now I can
click on that button and then I'm taking
TC github.com repository side you can
see it here so it's working as expected
