Matt Wacom and today in this short video
tutorial I'll give you an introduction
to visual studio code Visual Studio code
is a free and open source code editor
from Microsoft and it runs on all major
platforms so it's available for Mac OS
for Windows and for Linux it's a very
lightweight code editor so it's great
for example for a your web development
project it supports different languages
it is very easy to use it's lightweight
but of course very powerful and it's
extensible so in this video we will take
a look at how to set up visual studio
code on your system and we will run
through the basic functionality so stay
tuned okay so the first step we need to
take of course is the installation of
Visual Studio code and my system here is
Mac OS so I'm guiding you through the
installation for Mac OS and the website
is a Weibull here at code.google.com
here can find all the information on the
documentation a block about Visual
Studio code and here on the first home
page you can see it presents your
download button for Visual Studio code
and it recognizes your system
automatically so you if you are running
on on Windows for example it gives you
here and download option for all the
windows installation package but as I'm
running on Mac OS it's saying download
for Mac OS and if I here click on that
button it starts the download as you can
see here
just take the moment to complete and
okay here we are let's show it in here
in the download folder you can see it's
an archive if I double click on it its
unpacking that archive and here I have
the application file don't app and now
all I need to do here on Mac OS is to
drag and drop let's go here to my
application folder here and then it's a
Weibull from the launchpad ok ok so if
you want to install visual studio code
on windows for example you can see here
then you will get download for the
windows installer which is called vs
code setup - version dot exome and you
need to execute that installation
program on Windows the requirement here
is that you have the dotnet framework
installed as you can see here and then
it's installing Visual Studio code view
on that path on your system if you would
like to run Visual Studio code on Linux
you can go here to you on the section
set up Linux from the documentation
section here on the website and you will
see here is that there are descriptions
available for all the major Linux
distributions for example if you want to
install on it on a Debian and Ubuntu
based installation order for example
fedora and so on so here you need to
choose all the section for your
distribution and then follow the
guideline here on the website okay so
let's stop the application you can see
here our visual studio code is opening
up and showing the following screen here
you are presented with welcome page here
you can find quick links to
documentation and so on and in here at
the screen basically is split up into
three sections at the moment on the
Delhi left side here you can find the so
called view bar and by using the view
bar you can switch the view which is
displayed in the sidebar I can show you
here clicking on the first view which is
called the Explorer view you can switch
the view which is opening up here as it
is called as a sidebar and yeah by
clicking on the icons here and though
it's run quickly through it you have an
explorer view here which gives you
access to your current project folder
and the project files within that folder
so at the moment you can of course see
that there is no project folder opened
so we are presenting with the option to
click here on the button open folder to
open a new project folder what we will
do in a second but first let's complete
all the view bar here the second term
view option here else the search new you
can see it here it's giving you a search
option then there is the github or is a
gate of view if you have a project
folder open which is a good repository
it gives you access to two git
repository commands here from that view
then there is the debug view and last
but not least the extensions view where
you can select from the extensions
marketplace visual studio code
extensions and install extensions
directly here from the list but we will
see it later on
okay now that we have opened up
various views here in our sidebar area
there is a zone option to toggle so with
ability of the sidebar with a key
combination so you simply need to hit
the command key and B to toggle the
words ability so you can see it
disappears hitting it once and then come
on B twice it reopens again okay now
back here in the Explorer view let's use
on the button open folder and then I'm
selecting your project folder which is
an angular 2 application and you can see
it loads on the project structure here
um I can expand it here and collapse it
or so you can see that's my project
structure and now I click can click on
any of the files here for example it's
open the main TF file and the code
editor loads here on the right of the
side ok so now that I have opened up the
project and the file you may have
noticed that we have an area here at the
bottom which is highlighted in blue
let's call the status bar and the status
status gives me information status
information about the project itself and
the file which is opened here at the
moment in the editor view and it's
highlighted here in blue color so the
code editor as you can see here it's
organizing the open files in tops for
example if I open up our another file
index dot HTML you can see it here it on
changes the tab because it's printed in
italics as you can see here and let's
just mean that the file is only opened
in View mode and as long as the file is
opening up in View mode I can click on
the next file and then it's replacing
that tag which is opened in View mode
with a new file
I need to enter edit mode which I can do
for example by editing the file here you
can see it's now not longer printed in
italics and the null profile is open in
in edit mode and if I now click on a
second file for example index dot HTML
you can see it stays open in the edit
mode and the next tab is opened which is
now of course a new View mode again and
if I hit return here and I'm doing a
change to the file you can see it's
opening up that file in edit mode too
and now it stays open and if I click on
for example F dot module dot PS another
tab opens up so it's possible to open up
up to three files side-by-side in the
code editor area here on the right side
and to do so you have several options
the first option is to use the split
icon here so if I hit on it you can see
it's splitting the view into to open
editors and now I can select for example
here on the right editor and open up
another file here and now it's opening
up the tab in the second term editor
here and I can hit that button again and
then open up another section here and
now you can see it's displaying 3 5 side
by side ok let's close it there is
another option of opening up 5 side by
side if I select the file here from the
editor I only need to hold a big command
key and then click on that file like so
and you can see it's opening up
two are the existing editor view here I
can also select from the context menu
the option open to the side or let's
let's select a new file here open to
side and you can see it's opening up
another side-by-side editor here so
especially if you have side by side
editors open there is a View mode in the
visual studio code which makes it a lot
easier to deal with code files it's
causal Zen mode and you can enter the
Zen mode by hitting the key combination
command K and then releasing it and then
hitting that okay you can see it here
now we are in the mode and of the Zen
mode remove everything from the user
interface which is not related to two of
the code editor area so on the only
thing which stays with Apple R our code
editor code editor parts here with the
three side by side editors open open
them but nothing else you can leave the
Zen mode to harm by hitting obvious Cape
key two times one two and then you are
back into the default UI mode another
great feature of Visual Studio code is
that it has intellisense
support so intelligence from the feature
provided by Microsoft which could be
summarized as the riverine code
completion as you type delivering
content assisting and code hinting and
by default
intellisense in Visual Studio code
features are available for languages
like JavaScript type squid - Jason HTML
is and so on and I can quickly show you
how intelligence is so working so for
example here if I start typing and try
to access a platform browser dynamic
which is something I imported here in my
main TS file you can see it's
immediately popping up giving me several
suggestions based on my input here and
that line so far and then I can hit
return
because platform browser dynamic is the
object term which is um which is a
suggestion here so then this completed
then up and continue typing and you can
see it's opening up again giving me all
the members which are available here for
the return type of platform browser
dynamic and for example I can now use
bootstrap module and it also gives me
here a little information about on that
method you can see it here so I can use
it and again if I continue typing
immediately suggestions coming up and I
can select from the list of suggestions
and hitting return and that of course is
speeding up my implementation
significantly okay so if you want to
quickly open up files on just by using
your keyboard
visual studio code offers a quiz file
navigation and you can access the quote
file navigation by hitting on the
command key and P and you can see here
an input arm control is opening up where
we can all start typing directly and
start typing entering a string which is
part of filing for example I start
typing yep and you can see I'm present
it was a list of five results the first
part is containing all the files which
have been opened recently and the lower
part of the list is containing the other
five results and you can see I've only
tagged into the screen app and I'm
getting back all the file names
containing this F string in the file
name you can see here it's containing up
at the beginning the TS config tab dr.
jasion file is containing that string in
the middle it's giving me back all
matching results and I can select an
entry from that list by using the up and
down arrow keys here and if I found on
the file I would like to open I can just
hit return and the file is opened up
here okay another option is to use the
input on element I'm using view opening
up files to execute commands and to do
so I have two options I can switch to on
the so-called command palette mode by
using the arrow to the left or to the
right character here so just start
typing like so and now I'm able to
search for commands and there are
commands available for nearly all of the
functionality Visual Studio code is
offering for example I can type in
install and you can see I'm getting back
all the install commands for example
here to install extensions so that's the
first one way to access the command
palette the other option is to opening
up the command palette directly and to
do so I only need to enter one for the
key in my key combination this
have to use three keys shift command and
P and you can see now the input field is
opening up in the command palette mode
directly okay now let's use a command
palette to search for a command which is
a cold shell command install code
command in path and let's see what does
this command is doing let's hit return
and you can see I immediately get back a
notification saying the shell command
code successfully installed and pass
okay now we sell that command on a label
in our path we can switch to the
terminal and first close the visual
studio code here okay and now I'm inside
of one of my project directories and
then now with having added code to my
path I'm able to launch Visual Studio
code by using the code command here and
pass over our GM directory which should
be opened and in this case I'm already
in my project folder so I can use just a
dot here and then you can see visual
studio code is launching here you can
see on the Explorer view that my new
project folder is opening up and that I
can now start editing files here from
this folder okay now you can see we have
another area showing up here and that's
the year panel area here and the panel
area is another area with four views is
as you can see here you can change it by
clicking on the tab the problems view
the output view the debug console
the terminal view and the no let's focus
on the integrated terminal which is
available here if the panel is not shown
by default here you can go to the View
menu and then choose integrated terminal
like so then it's showing up and by
using that integrated terminal here we
can execute command line programs
commands just from within visual studio
code which is very handy because we do
not have to switch to an external
terminal window and yeah you can use the
terminal here too for example starting
up on the development server here for
that project and you can see the
terminal here is responding okay like
you would expect it from an external
terminal window the development of
service starting up and we have the
responses and the messages returned by
that server available here within our
code editor and what's also possible is
to not only use one instance of the
integrated terminal we can create a
multiple instances here you only need to
click here on plus and maybe add a third
one and then you can see it here from
that drop-down list you can choose and
switch between on the open terminal
instances you can see here in the first
instance through my angular 2 project is
running the second instance here is
waiting for my input the third as well
and yeah you can switch between the
instances very easily you can also
delete instances here by hitting on
or clicking on the trash icon here okay
you can see only the first instance is
left now okay next let's see how we can
configure Visual Studio code and to
configure this development environment
we can choose between two different
scopes the first way is to apply use of
settings and these are earth settings
which apply globally to any instance of
Visual Studio code you open on your
system and the other possibility is to
store configuration settings some are
specific to your workspace and by using
that way the settings are stored inside
you our workspace folder in a dotter vs
code folder and those settings only
apply when the workspace is opened
settings defined on workspace level in
general can be the same type of settings
like on user level but the rule here is
that workspace settings override user
settings okay you must accept other of
setting some view and to open it it's
the best way and the easiest way to use
the mantlet again and only need to type
in settings and you can see here I have
two options of user settings and open
workspace settings and I first decide to
open the user settings here and you can
see here in my editor area I get a split
view on the left side you can find the
default settings which are available and
on the right side you can see
the settings my user settings here on
the system I've already saved okay let's
close the panel here that we have full
space label here the default settings
you can see are organized in categories
and now to override a certain setting I
can take that setting from the left side
view copy and then pass it here and then
adapt the value which is assigned for
example to switch the font size to 18
and you can see if I save the setting is
applied immediately to make it more
visible let's use dirty here you can see
I'm saving and the font size is
increased immediately so let's get back
to you let's save 16 and here you can
see the default setting is only 12 and
if I remove that setting here and save
it you can see it changes the font size
back to 12 which may be a little bit
small so once again copy that setting
inserted here and depth the value 16
save it and we are back to found a size
of 16
here you can see I'm currently in the
user settings I can switch here to the
workspace settings it's the same view
view it's split into two areas the left
side with all the default settings and
there the right side with my specific
settings here for that workspace and I
can copy any of that those settings
olicity on the left side endured those
settings here on the right side and
overwrite the value if you are searching
for a specific value you can use a
search input field here for example is
very searching for anything related to
files for example the setting here which
specifies if I would like to open the
files in a new window
I can then quickly get the results here
by seeing all the matches is mentioned
in the beginning it's possible to extend
the functionality is the default
functionality of Visual Studio code by
using extensions and there are a lot of
extensions already available and you can
take a look at the full list of Weibull
extensions by clicking on the extensions
icon here in the view bar and you can
see clicking on but item opens up here a
list in the sidebar containing the list
of extensions and you can scroll through
it and just just to get an overview of
what extensions are available and you
can see by default on you have an entry
field here and you can start typing in
any text string and the list of
extensions will automatically be
filtered to exactly match only
extensions which contain that of
substring in the title or in the
description so for example I can start
typing in angular and you can see it's
filtering the list automatically to only
give me back a list containing
extensions which are related to angular
and which have the angular or text
string in the name or in the description
and and to go back here I can open up
the menu and use the menu and we show
popular extensions and then you can see
I am getting back the original results
because by default you can see we have
good entry here it's the sorting of the
extensions by their number
of installs so here you can see the
extension C sharp which is adding
additional functionality to use the
c-sharp language here within Visual
Studio which has yeah by far you can see
here 1.7 million by far the most
downloads and installations ok here from
that list you can now click on any of
those entries and by clicking on a 1
extension you can see that here on the
right side another view is opening up
giving you more detailed information
about that specific extension you can
see here you get an overview of the
functionality the extension is providing
you can see what's the current version
and maybe what so the latest features
which have been added here to the
version and yeah you can see how many
downloads it has and what the user
writing here out of a five-star rating
and the most important thing here is you
have the button install available here
and you can click on install either here
or in the list the install button is
available here in the list as well and
then the extension is added to your
installation of Visual Studio code and
adding the new features ok now let's try
it out and choose one of those
extensions to install here in our local
visual studio code installation and I've
already opened up a you're an angular 2
project I'm choosing the angular v2
typescript snippets extensions so let's
take a look at the functionality that
extension is providing you can
he let us go a little bit down in the
usage section it gives you access to
some type of script snippets and HTML
snippets so the function functionality
is as follow you can start typing in as
you can see here snippet name in this
case the snippet was a - component and
then you are presented with a template
of a component so that you quickly can
fill in here the missing pieces and
start implementing that component
okay so let's hit install and you can
see it's saying installing under it's
already ready so now you can see the
button install have changed now we get
three options here we can reload abet
extension we can disable that extension
and we can of course uninstall it but
now of course we would like to try it
out and see that it is actually working
okay I need to hit on the reload button
once so that the extension is activated
so here I can say reload window so it
reloads the application window and now
the extension is ready to use and if I
now switch back to you on the Explorer
view you can see I've already created
here in my app folder a new file which
is called my new component Doug PS that
file is empty and now I would like to
use a snippet from my extension to bring
in all the skeleton code which is needed
to implement an angular 2 component here
and that corresponding snippet name is a
dash and you can see as I'm typing I'm
getting back a list of
actions by intellisense and i would like
to have the a - component a leopard and
here you can see I get the inflow
angular component snippet so it's use it
hit enter and you can see is immediately
filling in the code which is the basic
skeleton for implementing a component
also that I can now start to adapt and
extend to that code and implement my
English component here thanks very much
for watching this was about them from
coding this Matt Wacom if you do like my
videos don't forget to subscribe to my
channel on YouTube I hope to see you in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
