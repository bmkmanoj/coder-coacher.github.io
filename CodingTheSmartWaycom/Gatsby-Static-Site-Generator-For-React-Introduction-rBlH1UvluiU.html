coding the smart way comm today in this
new video I'm going to introduce it to
gets be gets me as a static site
generator for react so you can write
your code in react using react
components and gets B else generating
static content server-side and the
result is an ultra fast website and
Gatsby has a lot of advantages so by
using Gatsby you will have an automatic
routing system installed which is based
on your protect structure and your
folders inside the project you have pure
HTML code which is generated server-side
you have a pre-configured web pack
building system installed and gatsby is
easily extensible by using plugins there
are a lot of plugins available for
example for getting data from api's from
databases into your static website and
gets be is clearly optimized for speed
so it is putting out a really fast
website and you can host that website
using any static file hosting service
and we will see how this is this is
going to work by deploying it after we
have built our first project but in the
first step of this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to install Gatsby we will
walk through a sample project and then
see how you can extend it by adding
pages by adding
react components and so on so stay tuned
so first let's take a look at the Gatsby
website and the website can be found at
the following URL gets bjs org
and here you can see that's the home
page of the project and you can find
links here to get started for example
which gives you a quick installation
guide you can go to the docs section or
the tutorial and follow along and if you
are clicking around here and let's say
switch between pages you can get a
feeling because Gatsby Jo Stoddart is
fully built with Gatsby of course you
can get a feeling of how fast gets be a
Gatsby website can be so it's showing up
immediately as you can see here okay so
if you would like to get going with
Gatsby the first thing we need to do is
to install the Gatsby command-line
interface and installing the Gatsby
command-line interface is done by using
an NPM package so it comes as a node
package manager package and on the
command line here the command which is
needed to install it globally on your
system is NPM install - g4 installing it
globally and then the package name here
else gets B - CLI okay so using that
command you can install it on your
system it's installing Gatsby command
line interfaces and it's installing all
the dependencies all the dependent NPM
packages which are needed by Gatsby I
have already installed Gatsby command
line interface on my system so I'm not
going to execute this command right now
we can directly move on and then use the
Gatsby command line interface on the
command line to generate a new project
and to do so we're using the Gatsby
command so gets me to the command which
comes was it gets be command-line
interface and then we are using the
option new here to indicate that we want
to
set up a new project and then we need to
give the name of the project so I can
name it my first gets beside okay so hit
return you can see it here it's
downloading the project template and
then installing the dependencies this is
taking a minute to complete so here we
are as the project has been created
successfully now in the next step we can
switch into the newly created project
directory so on CD my first gets beside
so now we are inside that directory and
first of all we can start up the Gatsby
development web server by using gets be
developed as a command here so this is
starting up the web server and this is
taking a second to complete and if the
web server is up and running we can try
to access the web site in the browser
you can see it here it's available on
port 8000 here on my local machine so
let's switch to the browser open another
tab here passed in that URL and you can
see my first gets beside is running so
this is a default project here it's just
printing out a greeting and here is the
link we can go to page 2 page 2 is
displayed here and page 2 has a link
back to the home page so two pages a
header our section here containing the
headline gatsby that's what is inside
the default project so now that the
first gatsby website is running with and
move on open the project in the code
editor of your choice in my case is
Visual Studio code and let's explore the
project structure a little bit to better
understand which components are inside
the Gatsby project and how everything is
fitting together so okay so let's start
up a code editor so Visual Studio code
so I can type and add the command code
and pass over the current directory by
using a dot then it's starting up here
okay here we are you can see that's the
project structure by default and you can
see maybe it's familiar to you if you
have been working with other note or
genius based projects you will find here
a package.json file which is containing
all the dependencies which are needed
here about the Gatsby project and then
you will find the note underscore
modules folder that's the place where
all the dependencies are installed into
you so you can see it here is that a
project which is based on the Gatsby
default starter template and the main
building blocks of the main
implementation parts of the project can
be found in the S or C folder here and
if you open up the SRC folder you will
find two subfolders inside the first one
is layouts and the second one is pages
so let's first take a look into the
pages folder here to begin with
you will find a three files here the
index dot JSP let's open it up you can
see it here it's implementing a very
simple reactor component which is
returning JSX code as you can see here
the component is called index page and
there's nothing nothing more in that
component
it's just returning the template code
here and that's exactly the code of the
greeting we saw when we are accessing
the default page and that is a code
which is printed out under the header
section so a link to page 2 is
established here by using the link
component and that is a component which
is provided by the Gatsby - link package
so we need to import a link here from
that package to be able to then use that
link element here and pointed to page -
- that's the pass to page - and the pass
is defined because here in the pages
folder the second page is contained in
the file which is which has a name page
- - so that is at the same time the name
of that file and the name of that route
okay so let's switch over to page two
you can see it here it's very similar
the component is called second page it's
containing the Deus Ex code here and
it's again making use of the link
component which is then pointing back to
our default route which is opening up
the page which is defined here in index
dot JSP
here the 404 file which can be used for
displaying is it just an error message
in case the user is trying to open up an
application root which is not existing
ok let's move on and take a look into
the layouts folder here in folder SRC
and the layout subfolder is containing
two files index dot CSS and index dot
JSP into the JavaScript file and that's
the main starting point of our reactor
plication that's so called layout
component and if you take a closer look
inside that file you will actually find
the implementation of two components
here first is the header compo
which is again returning just JSX code
here and is including some stylin code
and the second component and that's the
layout component that's template of
rapper so you can see it here template
rapper is taking a property which is
called children children is defined as
prop types funk so it's actually a
function which needs to be called here
inside a better JSX code and the place
where this code is here and by calling
the children function inside of our jxx
code which is returned by the template
wrapper we are defining the place or the
area and the page where the content from
the pages is inserted so you have the
container defined by the wrapper
component by the layout component
template wrapper in our case and then
you define the exact place where the
content from the index dot J as file or
the page - to J's file depending on the
on the road which is requested is
outputted and you can see it here it's
not only containing the content from the
pages it's also containing the content
coming from the header component which
is defined above so by using such a
layout component as template wrapper we
can make sure that for example here we
see header component a header section is
printed out independent from the page
which is requested so all the pages are
embedded and all the pages will be will
be printed out with that header code and
the header code in that case here is
just containing the gatsby headline as
you can see it here
and Gatsby is also a link pointing back
to you the home page so we can see it
here again if I change to page two and
if I click on the Gatsby headline here
I'm taken back to the home page so okay
that ATLA layout component and let's
move on and see what's next we should
take a look inside the Gatsby - conflict
of the chase file because that is Gatsby
configuration file here in the project
you can see it here it's defining a site
metadata in in our case it's just
defining a title here for the side and
you can change it of course if you like
and then there is a configuration
property which is called plugins and
plugins is being assigned an array here
and the array as containing as strings
all the plugins which are activated here
for that react for for that gets beside
so you can see it here we have one
plugin which is by default installed
that's Gatsby - plug-in - react - helmet
plug-in on the Gatsby website you can
find a list of many more Gatsby plugins
for for bringing in additional function
you can install all those plugins by
using NPM here into the project and then
to activate those plaquette plugins you
need to enter the name here as a string
to the array which is assigned to the
plugins configuration property here in
the file gets B - config dot Jas so one
nice thing with Gatsby is is that the
development web server which is still
running in the background is providing
live reload capabilities so what does it
mean I've opened up here again indexed
is a page and you can see it here it's
at the moment displayed in the browser
and if I'm now going to change anything
here in my component for example include
another paragraph here this is another
line of text for example and save it you
can see it here it's automatically this
plate and appearing here in the browser
so I do not need to manually reload the
page its life reloaded and the changes
made here in the code are reflected in
the output here and the browser
immediately so you can develop and check
side by side it makes development really
easy so now that you have a good
understanding of the default project
structure and the various building
blocks here on our project we can move
on and see how we can extend the
implementation a little bit and I now
want to show two things so in the first
step we are going to add another page to
the project and the page will be
implemented again as a react component
and this time we will be implementing a
react component which gives all the user
is the possibility to interact with that
component so the component will be
displaying a counter and the user will
have the option to click on a plus and a
minus button to increment or decrement
the counter on the page and then we will
extend
zir had a section here a little bit to
not only include the gatsby own name
here but also include a menu here on the
right side which is giving us the links
to you Veon to two index dot JSP page or
so and to page two and then page three
which we are going
at next okay so let's start which with
page three and to be able to implement
at that page we need to add another file
here inside the pages folder so I'm
saying new file here and I'm naming the
file page
- 3.2 yes so that's our new file and
then we need to start implementing a
standard react component basically so
the first thing I need to do this import
react from react okay and then implement
the component class so I'm giving that
class a name here in that case its third
page and it extends react dot component
of course so inside of that component
class first of all we need an
constructor here so the constructor is
first containing the call of super two
called parent constructor and then we
are defining a component state here
because we would like to display a
counter so we need two state property
here which is defined here in the
constructor so saying this dot state
equals and then we will define the state
object here which is containing one
property account and initially this
property is set to zero okay that's a
constructor and then of course we need
the render method here which is
returning our
JSX code so our render is returning such
a 6-part here and we need to start with
a leading div element of course so let's
close it first and inside of that div
element we need to bring in the template
code which is needed to generate the
output
so first of all let's print out the
headline so using an h1 here the
headline is just page sweep then I'm
including a paragraph including the
output of the counter value so it's
saying count and then printing out at
the value here which is available in
this dot state dot count of course so
like so and then we need two buttons so
the first button here is the button with
a plus so that we can increment the
counter so let's define on click event
handler and assign the following event
handler method here so it's defining a
new state this dot set state and the
call of set state needs to have one
parameter we need to pass in the new
state object with the count property
again but we see incremented count
property so let's call that method and
pass in that object with the property
count and saying this dot state dot
count plus one plus one okay like so
okay
let's close this tech here then the
button should have a plus print it out
and then we've closed in the button tag
here
okay so let's copy that button and in
desert it once again this time it's -
and we are setting the state here to a
new state object which is including the
current property again but this time
we are assigning the new value which is
decremented here by saying -1 ok so
finally we don't need to forget to
export our cert page component so that
there's a Weibull outside of that file
let's say export we fold third page ok
like so so that's all what is needed to
be able to test it out
and because we have named of the file of
the cert page component page - 3 here we
can now go to the browser view and
extent of the URL here was page - 3 + 3
is the result so the page sorry is
loaded it's embedded here here is the
header part of the layout component and
then the content which is generated by
the render function of page 3 is
outputted here we have the headline we
have the information that count is
initially 0 and now we have two buttons
and here I can use those buttons here
and increment and decrement the count
value as expected so next let's switch
to index dot JSP and the layouts folder
and see how we can extend the header
component to include the navigation menu
on the right side so here I'm only had a
component you can see it here that's the
link element which is printing out on
the gets beam headline here and just
after that closing in tag here we can
move on and include the code which is
needed to print out the navigation menu
here and we are
get out as an unordered lists starting
right away within ul element give it a
styling here an inline styling let's say
we would like to have a list style of
nine and we are setting the float or
property to right to display it on the
right side okay let's close on the UL
tag here and inside of that list we can
now bring in three list elements to have
three links a Weibull here in the menu
so list item again give it a styling
here by using the style attribute let's
start with display and set it to inline
- block okay like so and we need a
margin on the right side so margin right
and we are setting that margin to one
rim okay
okay and then we are using inside of
that element here let's close it first
we are using link component again to
print out the link we are giving it a
style tube first of all we need a color
of white because we would like to have
white text let's say text decoration
should be none and the font size here is
set to eggs - lot okay like so and then
we need to define the target of the link
was a tube property here and in the
first case that's the default route here
of our application and the link should
be named home and then I need to close
the link tag here as well okay so you
can see it here oh that's the first link
element and it's working it's taking us
back to the default page okay so now we
can copy and past that li element here
and insert it a second and a certain
time and now we need to change of course
the link name here so in the second case
that's page to page two and the third
case it's page three of course and then
we need to adapt the value which is
assigned here to the to attribute in the
second case that's page - - and in the
last case here that's page - three ok
let's save it now you can see it here
it's printing out the navigation
you and now I'm able to switch between
pages by just clicking here on the link
in the header section ok now finally
let's talk about deployment because
gatsby as a static site generator we can
use as mentioned in the beginning any
static file hosting service available
and for example one of file hosting
service which is exactly providing such
a static web hosting service is search
you can find it here it's search dot s h
and by using search it's free so we can
use it very easily here without creating
creating an account which is causing
additional costs here so you can see it
here on the website we simply need to
install as a search command by saying
npm install - - global and then search
that the package name and by installing
that package globally on your system you
will then have a command waiver which
which is called search and by using that
command we can then deploy our project
first of all before using the search
service here we need to go back to our
command line and stops the development
web server here and then execute the
following command it gets be built so
this is creating a production built of
our gatsby project and it's outputting
that production built in a folder which
is called public you can see it here so
once it is finished successfully we can
take a look at the public folder and
then we will find the static assets of
our project which we then need to deploy
to make our website a Weibull in the
internet so it's done here you can see
it here now if we take a look inside
the public folder here you can see it
here you will find many files inside of
that folder here so that's the static
content and now we can switch back to
the command line I've already installed
a search here and now I can switch into
the public folder and then simply need
simply type in search to start up the
command it will propose a domain name
here a sub domain of search dot s edge
let's change it to maybe gets be game or
oh one ok isn't the deployment is taking
place you can see it here now it's
saying OK our success project is
published and running it's Gatsby DMO or
one dot search dot Asajj so let's grab
that link here insert it in the browser
and you can see it here that's our
project it's running and it's available
here in the Internet thanks very much
