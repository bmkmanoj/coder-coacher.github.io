coding this model a calm and today in
this new tutorial I'd like to introduce
you to a very practical real-world
application with just pure html5 and
css3 and what we will be building in
this tutorial we will be building a
real-world website which can be used as
a template for maybe a web design agency
or any other company as you like and we
will do it step by step and we will use
poor html5 and css3 code to make it
fully responsive ok so let's get started
and to see how to implement that page ok
so first of all let's take a look at the
final result of the website we are going
to build in this tutorial and you can
see it just here that's a very simple
sample website consisting of our 3 3
pages as you can see here the home page
the about page and the services page and
this website can be used for example as
a template website for a small web
design agency or anything like that and
as you can see here it consists of a
headline here with some with the logo
then we have the menu items here which
is user can use to navigate between the
pages and we have a big headline area
here and just below the user is able to
subscribe to the newsletter by entering
the email address here and then click on
now the subscribe button below you find
layout which consists of three columns
I'm just presenting some information
about the agency itself and then we have
a footer here and ok so let's click on
the about page you can see
here the about page conduct of layout
which is build up of two columns the
main column here on the left side and
the second column here on the right side
and then we have the services page where
the user can get more information about
various services this company is
offering as you can see here and in case
user wants to get into contact and maybe
request a proposal he can use that
contact form here three input elements
are label the name the email address and
a message text area control and then a
send button to send this message okay
the tutor available here as well so okay
the website is fully responsive so that
adapts to smaller screen size for
example and just to demonstrate let me
resize the window here a little bit
maybe I'm going back to use the home
pages so that we can see the responsive
behavior here first
okay so let's resize the window and now
you can see it a depth here now you can
see it's the layout changes so that we
now have the menu items below the logo
and branding the newsletter layout
changes so that we have the input
element and the button below the
headline get our newsletter here and the
layout with three columns have changed
as well now you can see it's not
displayed in columns it's just displayed
in one column as you can see here okay
let's change to the about page you can
see here no longer two
only one column left and the same is
true for the services page you can see
it here it is
now arranging the content in just one
color okay if I resize the window again
you can see a depth once again now the
two columns layout aspect you can see it
here as well the about page so it's
fully responsive and we will implement
it by using our CSS as you will see
later on okay so now let's start with
the implementation part and the first
thing we will do we will create a new
project folder so let's change to the
terminal here and I'm going to create a
new empty project folder here by saying
M current year 1 2 3 web design that's
our project and ok let's change into
that newly created folder ok and let's
create some subfolders we will be using
later on we will use a subfolder CSS to
put our cascading style sheet into next
we will use an IMD folder where we can
put our images in and finally I'm using
fonts folder because we are going to use
font awesome he'll an icon library and
the project that's what we are
downloading and installing next and
that's what others fonts folder is used
for ok next let's download the font
awesome icons and we can do so by going
to the website of the font awesome
project which is available here at font
awesome dot IO and here on the start
page you will find the download button
and if I click on download you need to
select here in the pop-up window which
appears no thanks to download for all
four so let's do so and download the
package you can see it here that the
package and now what I needed to do is
to copy the content of the CSS folder
basically we need the font awesome dot
min dot the CS CSS file and the content
here of the fonts folder to our project
okay here's my project
let's take the minified version here and
copy it to the folder and selecting the
content here copy it and insert it here
in my fonts folder okay that's all we
need to do and now we are ready to to
move on to the coding part and start
implementing the HTML page for the start
page of our website template okay
yes my code editor I'm using atom so I
can start
Adam up here we'll use the atom command
and it's ah opening up my folder and now
within the folder I can create a new
file and I'm naming that file index dot
HTML because that is a file where I want
to put the HTML code of one start page
thank you okay and here we are
I want to save it and now we can start
writing the HTML code okay so let's
start with a basic HTML template here
and and you can see that our basic
structure we have we had a section here
and where's the body section so let's
start with the
we had a section first let's insert the
title here
1-2-3 web design welcome okay then I'd
like to include another meta information
here this time it the viewport
information and I'm setting the value of
the content attribute here to width
equals device - with okay um let's
include another meta element here okay
I'm setting the description here to
affordable web design for small and
medium sized companies and another meter
information I'm using as if the author
information and setting the content to
my name okay so finally I need to
include a link element here to the
stylesheet of our project which we are
going to implement later on and we are
using a style sheet file in the CSS
folder and the name of the file should
be star dot CSS okay and then I need
another link element to the font awesome
style sheet and that is available in
GSS /font - awesome
dot mean dot CSS okay so that's our head
section okay next let's implement the
body section here and we start out by
including half section first okay like
so that the header where we are putting
in the branding and the navigation menu
of our side and next I'm using three
section elements to separate the various
sections on our side and on I first
wanted to create a section which Rd a
showcase and to do so I'm using the
following syntax II because I have the
Emmet package installed so I can use
that subtext here to assign the i-beam
and then hit Ted and I have a section
element with rd showcase included once
again for the next section which should
be of ID newsletter okay and assert a
section I'd like to include is of ID
boxes boxes okay like so and finally I'd
like to include a footer element here
where we are putting the HTML code which
is needed to display and the information
in the footer we saw earlier okay okay
so first of all within the hell
section I'd like to implement the
display of the logo of the branding and
the navigation menu and to do so I'm
starting out with a disc of glass
container
and within that if I'm using another
diff which is of a D branding and is
containing the year global okay and here
to display the logo I'm using h1 and
within that h1 I'm using an eye tech to
include now an icon from the font
awesome library and the item I would
like to use is GSA - record icon okay
like so then I'm using a spawn element
on which gets assigned the class island
okay and within a let's Parliament I'm
using 1-2-3 as a text and then web
design and okay so now we can check
already the result in the browser and
the easiest way to do so is to use a
development web server which is called
life server and if you have not
installed laps around the system yet you
can use the node package manager the NPM
command to do so and to install it by
using NPM you simply need to type in NPM
install - G live - servers as the name
of the package and the - G option just
specifies that the installation should
be done globally on your system I have
already installed live server so I do
not need to execute that command right
now instead I can send a user live
server here within my project directory
and
it's starting our development life
server here and you can see it's it's
making my website available on port 8080
here on localhost and the result that's
my icon and the headline I'm using here
of course the classes I have assigned to
the various element are not in effect
yet because I have not implemented as a
corresponding CSS code that will be done
later on but for now I have a first
result here on the browser and the
advantage of using life server here is
that I now have live reloading
capabilities just to demonstrate it I
can place a window here side by side so
that's my browser view that's my code
view and now I'm simply changing web
design to web development here save it
and you can see the website here is
reloaded instantly I do not need to
refresh the page manually it's
displaying the new text of a let's
change it back to web design save it
once again and you can see it's again a
web design okay and with a live server
running in the background we can now
move on here implement implement on the
other parts of our page and as we go you
can see the results here live in the
browser okay let's move on here in the
header section now I have the diff
branding already implemented next thing
I'd like to do is to introduce a map an
element here and that is containing my
navigation elements and the navigation
elements are listed with an unordered
list here they were using ul element and
in that element I do need three Li
elements okay the first one should get
the class signed of name current like so
I'm using a element to to link it here
to index.html that's of course a home
link and then I'm using another Li here
which links to about HTML and link
should be about and the last link to
services okay here we are
okay now let's continue with the section
of ID showcase and within that section
first of all another div element with
class container okay within the div
element of using it one here to include
the text I would like to display as a
headline that's again the text I have
already used here in my meta description
okay so let's grab it and insert it here
again and another element is a paragraph
a P element and just some text as
placeholder here so I'm typing in lorem
tab and gives me some
we text here so save it and again you
can see it's updating my view here and
browser once again automatically now
it's displaying the headline in the text
information so next the newsletter
section and first of all again a
development is needed with class
container assigned within that element
first of all an h1 which contains the
headline here get our newsletter and
then of course the form so that the user
can input an email address so the form
and within that form and do you need
input element and a botany ok ok the
input element should be of type email
and I'm using a placeholder text here as
well enter your email address and the
button should be of type submit get the
clock assigned of button and the score 1
and has the label sub scrap
okay here we are so let's move on to the
boxes section again I'm starting out
with DIF and clear out of the container
okay within now that if I'm using
another def here which gets the graph
assigned which is named box within that
if I would like to have an eye element
for including the RPF font awesome icon
I would like to use an h3 for the
headline and I'd like to use paragraph
for some text okay first of all the icon
I'd like to use is for the first case of
a - signal and I'd like to use it a
little bit bigger so amusing another
class here which is called F a slash 5x
k the headline here should be grow your
audience and some text again here okay
you can see it here now I can copy that
div element and insert it another time
and another time so I'm simply changing
the icon here for a second
one I'd like to use the photo icon and
I'd like to use a different headline
here as well the headline in that case
is modern web design and for the last
box I'm using the icon
jefe - cube and the headline ultra fast
hosting okay here we are so let's not
forget the footer text which needs to be
included here you can't add the footer
element and I'm using a P element once
again and then I'm including the text
1-2-3 Web Design common copy right copy
2017 okay here it is now the website is
complete with all the content displayed
now we can move on to the styling and
include some css3 code to give our
website the right look okay to do so
let's go here into the CSS folder and
collect a new file and the plan I would
like to create here in the folder is
named style dot CSS and that's the place
where we put all our arm styling code
into and let's begin by using the body
tag here and defining a font for the
size and then I'd like to use overall a
weight a car or some serif okay I'd like
to use a padding of 0 here and the
margin I'm setting to 0 as well okay and
then I'd like to use the back ground
color
the following value okay you can see it
here the con car has already changed
into a light gray okay next I'll define
the styling for our container class we
have been using multiple times so don't
container okay and I'd like to use a
width of 80% here for the container
element the margin I'm setting to outer
and the overflow property and setting to
hidden okay let's save it here you can
see it's applied now we're using only
80% of the available width here okay
finally let's style the UL element
that's the body element we have been
using to display our menu items and here
I would like to have a margin zero and
padding:0 as well okay okay now let's
concentrate on the elements in our
header so I'm putting a comment here
okay and I'm starting with the header
element itself and I'd like to use a
different background here and I'm using
the following color code is we are five
three six three seven I'd like to use a
foreground color of white padding to the
top of 30 pixels a min height of let's
say 70 pixels here and I'd like to use
the bottom - bottom property to display
a border at the bottom
the bottom should be displayed or
rendered out in the following color as
we to a toe see to bottle should be
three pixels and should be displayed so
it okay and you can see the result
already now let's move on and down the
links here in the header and first of
all setting the color as you can see
here that's not the optimal color so I'm
using white color here again and then
I'd like to send the text decoration to
none and I'd like to use text -
transform as well and I'm transforming
the text to uppercase here and I'm
setting font size of 16 pixel okay so
that looks much better now and then the
styling for the list item element as
well within the header so first of all
the float setting to the left
display:inline
and I'm using a padding here like so
okay here we are you can see now our
menu items are displayed okay next
within the header element I'd like to
set this tiling for the if was ID
branding okay
yeah I like to set flow to left as well
okay like so and then he'll bringing
again h1 the margin should be here oh
okay and then the not element within the
header again flow to this time the value
here is right and the marching - top is
set to 10 pixels okay next I must to
make sure that oils which are
highlighted or the link which is the
current one is displayed and then bold
and we have been using two classes here
at the highlight clause of the current
class
so next I'm saying header dot highlight
and head dot current okay setting the
color here - three - a Oh see - again
and setting the font weight to mode okay
now I can see s home is our current link
to to this page it's displayed in this
color here and not in no in a white
color and it's displayed in bold as well
okay finally if the user is moving the
mouse over that link or over any link
I'd like to display the link in
a different color and in bold as well
and to achieve it I'm saying heavier a
and I'm using D over selector here which
means assembly um mouth is moved over
and then I'm telling the color here this
time to CCC CCC and fond weight to bold
again now you can see I can move the
mouse here and the color changes to
white grey and it's displayed in boat
now let's move on to of the CSS code
which is needed for all the showcase
section and again I'm including them
command here showcase say and then I'm
starting out with the show case ID and
first of all setting the min height to
400 pixels okay and then I'm setting the
background here because I'd like to have
a background image to the following URL
I've already prepared on JPEG image in
my image folder you can see it here it's
named header big t dot jpg and now we
can use that image here add a B G dot
jpg and then I'd like to set it to
no-repeat Center it and then I'm using
the property background size inside to
cover
texts - Ilan set to century as well and
let's color the foreground color for the
text is white okay here we are you can
see now it's displaying the background
image the headlines and the occasional
text okay next let's change the
appearance of the headline a little bit
dancing show phase h1 I'm setting a
margin at up top to 100 pixels I'm
increasing the font size to 55 pixels
and the margin at the bottom set to 10
pixels okay looks much better now
and finally the text which is embedded
in the P element I'm setting the font
size 0 to 20 pixels as well okay and now
you can see if I'm going to read a
resize my screen size here a little bit
you can see the images were starting
also
so let's continue with a newsletters
section Oh
next I'm putting a new command right
here and starting out with the element
with a dnews letter and include the
corresponding CSS code first of all let
to set the padding to 50 pixels here
then again the color to white and
background color 2 3 5 3 6 3 7 ok then
next is the headline okay look so I'm
setting the float to left okay and then
within the newsletter section the form
element and the flow
the form should filled out alright and
the margin to use a top should be 50
pixels okay next on the email input
element and I can select the citizen the
following wave type smell I'm setting
the padding here to 4 pixels the height
to 25 pixels
and the width to 250 pixels okay let's
check it exactly
pain then I need the class which I have
access em aside to all the subscribe
button and that is button one and again
on the height let's use it 38 pixels
here in the back ground color border
heading left 20 pixels and padding right
and 20 pixels as well okay and the
foreground color three five three six
thirty seven okay here we are then okay
that's the newsletter section okay let's
continue with boxes the section and I'll
just begin by adding stylings to the
death element with Rd boxes and I'd like
to add margin at top I'd say 20 pixels
here okay next let's use boxes
and on the box cloth okay first we need
to load the left next text-align which
is set the center the width should be
30% and the padding should be 10 pixels
okay you can see now we have the three
column layout term in our boxes section
okay and finally don't forget the footer
section so it's the footer element and
here we need a padding first for about
20 pixels next margin top again
20 pixels and the color for the font
should be white and we are setting a
background color as well so when using
the color code 3 - a o + C 2 again and
text align set the center here so let's
take a look okay here we are here is a
footer section and now you can see our
home page our start page is complete
with all the styles included and the
various sections here on the page are
now correspond to what we see at the
beginning however one last piece is
missing we would like to have a website
which is fully responsive and the you
can see I'm resizing the page and for
example here and then you slide that
section you can see and here you can see
it's not
behaving like the example I showed in
the beginning and to make a website now
fully responsive we need to add some
further CSS code code and yeah it would
use a media query for a certain screen
size and that's the way in which we can
define CSS code which is only applied if
a certain screen size is used and that
if the last step now we need to take
here to make our first home page
complete okay so the media query is
added here to our CSS file by using the
add media keyword and then passing in a
parameter which is called max width and
setting this parameter to 768 pixels and
the assembly saying that all be our CSS
code which is now following inside that
mediator is only applied as a screen
size is of a maximum width of 768 pixels
and if the screen size is getting larger
so if exceeding that amount of pixels in
it with those CSS code which is embedded
here is not activated okay so first I
would like to deactivate a floating
behavior I have used for various
elements and though I need to list first
all those elements so it's the header
element with the element with ID
branding I had enough
header in love Li on the news letter
element the headline then use letter
form and the box class inside the
developer method inside the box the
section okay and now I can set the Lotus
simply to none soon no floating is
activated here I'm setting text arrived
at the same time to Center and with I'm
setting to a hundred percent in this
case okay now you can already see if I'm
resizing and I'm within that limit here
of 768 pixels you can see now it's the
layout has changed for example here it's
centered now here it's centered as well
you can see here the multi-column layout
changes so we have no floating all in
those boxes are listed one after another
and that's the layout I would like to
have
okay so let's add a little bit of
padding to the header I think adding
bottom 20 pixels okay you can see it
looks better and what at imagine a
different margin to the h1 element in
the showcase section here so in this
case I'm using margin top into setting
it to 40 pixels okay and maybe the
newsletter button let's select that
buckling newsletter button okay
I'm using display block and width of
100%
and finally let's adapt the input
element of the newsletter section again
I'm using the type here to select the
right element email in that case and the
list shipped 100% as well and I'm
setting a margin bottom five pixels here
okay you can see and that's perfect
layout that's the result we want to have
so the home page of our website template
is already next we're going to implement
about page you can see it here if I
click on the link it's pointing to you
about dot HTML this file is not existing
yet so we get this error back and now
I'm going to write that file game right
in the project folder so let's say your
file about dot HTML and okay so
to start here with that an empty file I
just copy and paste a few things here
from index dot HTML
let's start by copying the header
section here so okay next let's see the
closing HTML element so okay so I'm
going to change the title here at this
time it's not welcome it's about okay
and then I can copy on past let's see
the body and the header in that body
okay okay let's close the body tag here
and now within my navigation elements
here I'm assigning this class current
not to the first li element but to the
second one okay so let's see I'm
clicking on about and you can see here
we are
that is my empty page the header is
already there
I have the branding here with the logo
and the one to use free web design
headline and here is my menu was home
about services and I can click on home
to go back and again on about and it
opens up the about page and now we can
start to implement the content of that
page let's first start with the section
element and we are assigning the class
main here okay within that section oh
man we need a dis
class contain I assigned and as we want
to have a two column layout we are
defining the main column with an
art-deco element and we are assigning an
ID of name - Paul okay I like so so for
the main column I'd like to add a
headline first so I'm using an h1 here
and sign the class page - title okay and
the headline here is about us
next let's include ins paragraph and
subtext here okay
next paragraph with drawn dot and again
text so for this purple of let's add
some more text k12 or swing okay you can
see it here okay and now for on the side
column let's introduce another element
here which is called a side and I'm
assigning the ID of sidebar within a
side let's implement a gift was class
dark
inside that element again starting with
a headline here and this time I'm using
an icon here let's use if FA - users
icon from the font awesome library and
the headline here is 15 K again a
paragraph and some text ok so finally
I'd like to include the footer here as
well so I go back to index.html scroll
down here to the footer element copy it
and pass it here so you can see the
footer is there ok now the content of
the page and here the content is
complete and now we can go back to style
dot CSS and include some additional
styling for that page so back here in
style dot CSS let's write back a media
query let's include another comment here
sidebar ok and then first of all I'd
like to select the side element with ID
sidebar and use float and assign the
value right because we would like to
display the sidebar on the right side
and all right like so ok and give it a
width of
35 of 30 percent of course and a padding
of 5 pixels okay you can see it here
next let's select the article element
voice ID main - go and give it a float
left and a width of 65% okay now you can
see it here now we have a side-by-side
okay so in addition I've used for that
second paragraph here in the main column
I have used the class width name darker
so I needed to implement that class here
as well so let's scroll to the top here
and just add the class doc right here
enter first of all I need a padding of
15 pixels here next I need a background
color three five three six zero let's
use three five four two for a okay then
I need a foreground color which is white
a margin at top of about 10 pixels and a
margin bottom of 10 pixels
okay here you can see that the result
now it's displayed in dark color so
let's also adapt the media query here a
little bit and reactivate the float here
for the element on the about page in
case we are dealing with a screen size
which is below 768 pixels and in that
case I would like to include the article
element was ID main color and I'd like
to include the aside element with ID
sidebar ok let's save it and now you can
see if I'm adapting the size here the
width you can see it's changing from a
two column layout to a one column layout
and of course here on the header section
the media query has the same effect as
it has on the home page there is no
difference as you can see here okay so
the about page is array and now we can
implement the last page of our project
and notice if services page
so first let's create a new file here
within our project folder and that file
is named services HTML clay here we are
and then it's the same procedure l so
before I'm copying some of the code from
index.html so let's copy that block here
go to service of HTML and inserted here
so that's the code which is needed for
the header
okay so let's close
the body pet here and the HTML tag as
well
okay now I'm changing the title here
again now services and let's assign the
current class not to the first menu item
instead to the last please so let's
check it out
and okay let's go back to index.html and
I do need here in the footer as well
okay so here we are all that's the basic
layout and and now we can start again
inserting the content which should be
shown here on page
okay so let's add a section element
first with our D main within that
section we'll use in the diff which gets
the container turnoff assigned once
again then I'm using the article element
for our main column and it gets assigned
PID main column again as we've already
used on in about on HTML okay and then
first I need on h1 here which gets the
class of page title clay and then the
headline here is our services in that
case and then I'm using an unordered
list with ID
services and within that unordered list
I'm listing basically three offers this
company has to mate and each of offer is
embedded in the list item okay and
consists of a headline which is an h3
there may be the first at the website
start a package and then a paragraph and
some text here
okay let's include some more text okay
and that's the first offer now you can
see that the results so far
okay maybe let's include another
paragraph here and add the price tag so
this is $1,000
okay now I can copy and past it and
insert a second and the third offer so
the second offer is the website
professional package and it costs some
five thousand and the third offer is the
e-commerce package and it costs seven
thousand okay here we are
okay next let's implement a sidebar and
I'm starting out with the aside element
and define the idea of sidebar again
within her bedside bar I'm using diff
endless
a class of dark and then h3 of to
contain the headline focus of sidebar
box and this is contact us because we
would like to include the contact form
here and below the age of three it's on
the phone which gets assigned a class
contact okay I need to get it in one
line here okay and within that form
first I need an input element for the
name and I'm including it in a disk and
then you can rival here and I need an
input element okay so the label that the
input element and label is named here
and the input element is of type text
okay so another div and then a label
again the label now is email address and
the input element of type email
the third element is down text area
element for the message text
so again label this message here and
then I'm using a text area click don't
meet those attributes instead I would
like to have two placeholder here and
the placeholder is containing the text
to your message okay
that's finally a form meeting submit
button so it gets assigned to class
button one we have been using earlier
and it is of type submit' here okay and
it gets a label of sent so now you can
see it here that the contact form three
input elements and the submit button
okay so finally let's switch over to
skunk don't CSS once again and add some
more CSS code here to cover the services
page as well
our creative services and the first
thing we need here is the UL element was
ID services and within the elemental
list item element and let's use here
host star none okay padding of 20 pixels
um a border with the following cutter
solve it in one pixel imagine at the
bottom of five pixels and a background
color okay like so next thing we need is
a styling for a BH 3 element within the
services list okay and the headline
should get a border a bottom border as
well so border bottom 3 5 X 3 6 3 7 fold
1 pixel
okay so furthermore let's add for the
sidebar the following styling aside
sidebar input and the side sidebar text
area the waist should be 90% and padding
should be introduced here with 5 pixels
ok so now it looks much better so
finally let's adapt our media query a
little bit here for the last element
which is setting the waist to 100% for
the input element of the newsletter data
entry field let's add our
from input elements of the contact form
as well so this is cross contact and the
input element contact text area and
contact label okay now you can see if
i'm reducing the width of my screen now
the contact form is displayed here below
and all the elements are aligned in
center and are are displayed with 100%
of the available width here in bed
