Matt Wacom and today in this video
tutorial I'd like to introduce you of
how to use the bootstrap framework
together with angular and bootstrap is
one of the most known CSS frameworks for
for example of styling your user
interface in your web development
project bootstrap makes it very easy to
apply certain styling it supports
seaming so you can use bootstrap in
different ways and your application
would look like depending on the
bootstrap theme you are using and
bootstrap is is great because it makes
no assumption of the underlying
JavaScript web framework so you can use
it together with various frameworks and
for example one is angular and in in
this video I'd like to show you how to
integrate or how to use bootstrap with
your angular 2 or maybe already angular
4 project and in addition we will also
take a look at the ng bootstrap project
which delivers bootstrap angular
components which can be used
out-of-the-box and which makes it a
little bit easier to apply a certain
bootstrap components and bootstrap
styling within your angular application
so let's get started okay so the first
thing we need to do is to set up a new
angular project and the easiest way to
do so is to use the angular command-line
interface and you can find website of
the angular COI project here at CLI dot
angular dot IO and right here on the
on the homepage you can see on its label
as an NPM package and the package name
is at angular / CLI so on the first
thing you need to do is on your system
if you have not installed angular client
before it is to perform the installation
and to use the node package manager to
install angular client on your system by
using NPM install - G - G is for
installing it globally on your system
and then and then giving the package
name here which is at angular slash CLI
and then having installed it
successfully and you command R becomes a
Weibull on your system and XE and G
command and that's exactly the command
we can now use to set up our new project
okay so let's switch over to the command
line and use of the angular CLI command
in the following way ng new because we
want to initiate and generate a new
project and then we need to specify the
project name so maybe let's use my
bootstrap project or one ok now you can
see it's downloading the angular project
structure and then in the next step
installing all the project dependencies
which are needed by our default by using
the node package manager again and of
course installing all the dependencies
takes some time here ok here we are as
you can see installation has been
completed successfully and now we can
change into the newly created project
directory which is my bootstrap project
or one and within that a project
director
we can execute the ng command with the
option search so Angie serve and now you
can see it's starting up a web server
first of all it's using webpack to grade
on the bundles here for our project and
then it's starting up a web server which
is running on port 4200 and now we can
go here to the browser and access that
part here on our machine and you can see
it's printing out a quirks which is a
default output of the newly created
angular 2 project so this gives us proof
that everything has been um installed
successfully and now our application is
running and in the next step now we can
add the bootstrap framework to our new
angular project ok the bootstrap of the
frameworks website can be found at get
bootstrap comm and if you click here on
the link getting started you can find
some instructions of how to include
bootstrap in your web development
project and there are two ways which are
relevant for our angular project so the
first way is to add bootstrap from a
content delivery network as you can see
here and the second way which is
relevant for us is install bootstrap by
using the node package manager
okay in the following we will see both
both ways and actions so we will first
start out with adding bootstrap from the
content delivery network here and in the
next part we will then use NPM to
install bootstrap and see how you can
add bootstrap to your arm project if you
have been using NPM and the first thing
now to start out with on the CDN option
we need to do is go back to the command
line and here I'm still on the project
directory and now I can
open my editor which is Adam so that I
can edit the part of my project
Adam starting up here you can play
that's the file structure and now we
need to open up the index dot HTML file
which is located here in the term SRC
folder okay here we are including the
font size a little bit and now let's go
back to the browser and P what elements
are needed to add bootstrap from the max
of CDN first we need to include the
bootstrap dot MnDOT CLS CSS style sheet
file and to do that we need a bed link
element and we grab it here and past
that link element to the bottom of our
head section okay here we are then I go
back again it's optional to include a
theme here we will not do it here in the
first step but what's mandatory is to
include the bootstrap dot min dot J's
file if you also want to use some of the
bootstrap JavaScript functionality so
let's copy that script element here and
passed it into the body of our page like
so now we need one further our script
here because the bootstrap JavaScript
functionality is depending on jQuery and
the jQuery library is available here at
jquery.com
that's the project website and if you
are accessing code jQuery calm you can
find links to locations of
content delivery network which delivers
the jQuery library and we would like to
include jQuery in the last version which
is three point one point one I'm
choosing here is the mini site our
version and if I click on it you can see
a pop-up windows opens and it gives me
access to a script tab here and I can
copy that script from element here like
we did it before with the bootstrap
script element and then I insert it here
just above the script tag which was used
to include bootstrap code MnDOT KS like
so so let's bring it into one line here
okay like so now you can switch back see
the output in the browser from our
application and you can see the font arm
have has changed because no bootstrap is
active and will be h1 headline here is
no displayed in a different font so now
we can go back to our project and make
make some use of bootstrap elements to
see that it's actually working okay back
in the editor or let's open the app
folder here within our our source folder
and here are the app component term
files and as we want to change the
template of app component I'm opening up
F dot component HTML and first let's
remove the code which is inside here and
then I start out with new HTML code so
first we needed this okay
not an uppercase the first we need this
element here and we are assigning a
class of container which is a bootstrap
class and within that main div element I
am using another on this element here
and give it a class of jumbotron
okay and the jumbotron area will be made
up of an h1 which is just the Welcome
message and then an h2 tag which um have
the text included angular and bootstrap
demo okay and then we need another div
section and I'm assigning the class of
panel and panel - primary and the boot
scratch panel here should include a
heading so I need another div element
and this time I'm using the graph panel
- heading and it includes the text
status and a panel body of course
so another this element was cross panel
body and now I'm using h3 and include um
the title
um information here again so let's save
it and you see on the result e which is
automatically updated in the browser and
you can see here that the jumbotron area
here that's the panel information all
made out of bootstrap classes so you can
see the bootstrap framework is fully
working ok next let's try to our change
of the scene we are using
let's go back to the browser and then a
free resource for themes for bootstrap
scenes is boots watch calm and if you go
to on that website and scroll a little
bit down here you can see there are
various themes available and we can just
to show that switching themes as
possible we can for example decide to
use a cyborg theme here and all I needed
to do now is here click on the download
button and here you can see of the
corresponding bootstrap CSS file opens
up and I can just copy that link here
and go back to my index.html and remove
the default as he SS file here and just
include on the boots watch as file ok
save it and go back to the browser and
you can see the output we get back from
our app here in the browser changes so
now you can see the cyborg is Seema
supplied all the elements are displayed
in a in a dark color and that is the
effect the the theme has on our user
interface okay next let's try out all
the other options and install bootstrap
by using on the node package manager and
so first I'm removing here all the
elements which are including bootstrap
from a content delivery network so we
are back to the initial state of our
index dot HTML here and to install our
bootstrap I need to switch back to on
the command line and then using
NPM is tall and the package name is
bootstrap okay and I would like you have
version 3 because version 4 is not yet
released and I need Jake for review as
well and then I'm using - - safe because
I would like to save the bootstrap and
the jQuery dependency to use as a
package.json file of the project and
finally hit return and then you can see
the installation is done bootstrap and
jQuery is downloaded and installed into
the node modules folder of our project
ok here we are you can see installation
has been executed successfully and if I
now take a look into package dot Jason
here in the dependencies section you can
see bootstrap was added and jQuery is
added as well ok let's go back to the
command line
and if I now take a look into the node
modules folder and the subfolder
bootstrap you can see that cell the
location where it is installed and if I
now come out looking for the fact I
would like to include in the project so
basically the bootstrap dot min daughter
CSS and the bootstrap dot min dot L j as
I can take a look here into on the dist
folder and you can see here I have
subfolders called CSS and j s and if I
take a look into the CSS folder you will
see here let's the file I can now
include in my project if we go back and
change into the ers folder instead you
can see here at the bootstrap dot min
dot KS file is a Weibull ok
let's go back again okay Cleary as well
here in the node modules folder and here
you can see a dist folder is available
as well and here I can find the jquery
dog MnDOT class file so now I can
include those files here right from the
node modules folder in my project and
the first way to do so is of course go
back to index dot HTML and include
corresponding link and script text like
we did it before but there is another
option we can use and though that is a
way I would like you I would like to
show you
and that else by editing the
configuration which is available here in
in the file dot angular - here i dot
jason here you can see within the apps
array I have a property called styles
and scripts and you can see here again
in both cases and array is designed and
so I have the possibility to adhere to
first to the Styles array another
element here and specify the path to my
bootstrap main dot CSS file that is node
modules of fresh boot strap / beast
slash CSS fresh boot threat dot min dot
CSS and on the same I need to do here
for the scripts array the array is
initially empty and now I'm adding two
more elements the first element of
course kills the yes would pass to my
jQuery don't mean dot gif file
so it's again node modules a jQuery gift
jQuery dot min KS and next I need to go
on the bootstrap dot min dot JS file so
I can copy that here and in the Arctic
so now I need to change CSS to jf and
set as well okay okay switching back to
the command line and then I'm restarting
the server arm so that web pack is able
to build new bundles here including our
rebound jQuery and bootstrap filed and
pains starting up again ok there we are
switching back to the browser refreshing
our page and you can see the bootstrap
styling still is is there and so you can
see now we switched from a CDN based
inclusion of bootstrap to in
installation with the node package
manager into our project and when
including it by using the configuration
in the angular - CLI Delta J's and
configuration file ok next let's take a
look at of the ng on - bootstrap project
and the project website can be found at
ng - bootstrap dot github dot
you can see it here and if I click here
on demo you can see the components on
the angular components which ng boot
strap offers and that are already made
components you can use in your angular
component templates which are based on
bootstrap so for example you can see
here if I for example open the taps
section here you can see some examples
here maybe you are recognizing the
bootstrap receiving which is applied
here and by using that component for
example you can bring in the type of
functionality for example there is the
accordion component here as well score a
little bit down you can see it here we
have buttons writing component for
example in different styles with a time
picker component and so on so let's see
how we can make use of ng bootstrap in
our angular project how to install out
that exact library and how to make use
of those components in our template so
I've already created a new angular T
project with named my bootstrap project
Oh - and that is the initial project
setup by using ng new here and now the
first step to include ng bootstrap is to
install all the library by using NPM and
I am using the command in the following
way NPM install - - safe to add that
dependency to package Jason and then the
package name here is @ ng - bootstrap ng
- bootstrap ok hit return
then you can see it downloading the
package and adding it to the node
modules folder again ok so here we are
successfully installed and the next
thing we need to add because ng
bootstrap is depending on bootstrap
version of four already even if it
wasn't for is not released yet we need
to edit that dependency as well as we do
it by using NPM again saying NPM install
bootstrap and using the version 4.0
point O - of our six which is the most
recent version and again saying - - save
and again it's downloading bootstrap
version 4 and saving it into the node
modules folder and adding that
dependency to our package that Jason
file as well ok here we are
ok now let's switch to Adam and for this
new project we need to do all the same
you need to home at dot angular - CY dot
Jason and add our bootstrap CSS file
here to the side array again modules of
bootstrap dist CSS bootstrap dot main
dot CSS and we need to adhere to the
script text the two entries as well okay
first of all we need to query
right so okay and then we need the
bootstrap yoga script file which is a
wave of in the Jes folder and it's
called bootstrap a bootstrap dot meeting
dot GS okay play one type hole here we
need to say 3s as well okay now let's
start up the web server again by using
ng serve here in the project folder and
again website is running compiling the
modules okay and then starting the web
server on port 4200 let success it here
and you can see the output again is at
work and now we can continue in in our
project to add ng bootstrap and make use
of the component okay here in Adam I've
already opened up to the file dot module
dot PS which contains the implementation
of the root application module app
module as you can see here and that's
the place where we need to import the
MVB module which is a module from the ng
bootstrap project and which includes all
the components and to do so the first
thing we need to add here is a
corresponding import statement here we
need to say import ng be module from at
ng - boot strap /ng - bootstrap like the
package name
okay and having it imported we can now
edit you the import array here and let's
edit and g/b module and as we are here
in the root application module we need
to import it in the way where we need to
call the for root factory method here if
you are importing an GB module not in
the root module but in one of the
subsequent modules in your application
you do not need to call for root but in
that case here we are in the root module
of our application so we need to call
that factory method okay okay now let's
make use of the components of some of
the components mg boot strap delivers
and to do so I'm switching again to the
template of our main component which is
AB component and the template code is a
wave of you in F dot component of HTML
I'm going to remove it with default code
here and then start out with an empty
file here implementing our new template
and I'm start by adding a disc and amend
and give it a class of container which
is a bootstrap class of course with art
before and then are starting to add one
of the new elements one of the
components which are delivered by Angie
which Pat and I would like to include a
tab set here and the current
corresponding element I do need is mg B
- tab set okay and within the tab set I
would like to include three tabs and
each tap start
with an element which is called NGB -
tap ok like so and the tap has a
template an element so let's say
template and it against an attribute of
n gb tap content okay and as I needed
three times I can now copy it here 1 2
so 3 times the tab key NGB tap element
here and now I can give it a title
the first title should be a simple so
for the second title I would like to use
on some formatting of the text so I
cannot use all the title attribute here
on the level of the NGB - tab element
instead I'm using another template
element here and give it an attribute of
entry leads tab title and all within
that element I'm including armed title
and now I'm using the be element to
print it in bold so it's used fancy
close it here title okay and for the
third tab on again using the title
attribute and let's call it this a both
because I would like to set the this
tables property to true so that the user
cannot see the content of this a third
tab
okay now you can see it here I have
organized upon the windows side by side
layout the output in the browser has
already been updated with our our tab
control here so now I can click on fancy
title which is a second tab and change
to it disabled I cannot click on and
change back to simple and you can see at
the moment we have no content here in
the tab content area so let's change it
start here from the first tab element
within the template NGB tab content
element and maybe let's first include a
paragraph with some text inside this is
the content loss the first tag and you
can see it's automatically updated here
and maybe include another ng boot script
element here let's use ng B - alert
okay let's find the year property gives
miserable to use of value for so that
the user can not close this alert and
include text start with warning print it
in bold here and then say this is an
alert okay save it and you can see it
reload again here in the browser and now
you can see the alert is printed out
okay let's include a little bit of
content here in the second tab as well
again we are starting out with a
paragraph I'll include text this is the
content
of the second tab let's use another
paragraph here and include one more arm
new ng bootstrap component and this time
we're using ng b dash progress bar and
the progress bar can be used together
with the attribute type let's use a type
of success and then find the value
attribute to let's say 25 which means
25% and maybe copy it here a second time
a third time in the first time change
the value here to our 50 75 and hundred
percent and let's use this one two types
we can use the input type here a warning
type and let's use endanger time here
and now okay it's reloading again here
if I now change on fancy title you can
see the progress bar is printed out four
times
