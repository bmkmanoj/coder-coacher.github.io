coatings of smart Wacom and today in
this new tutorial we are going to focus
on Jupiter notebook for pison and this
video is at the same time the beginning
of a series of pison related tutorials
on coding so the smart way comm so if
you haven't work with spice and so far
it's your opportunity to get going was
on this programming language in this
first video we are going to install and
setup tip it a notebook because the
Jupiter notebook web application is the
application we are going to use them in
the upcoming videos for our development
environment for Python so Jupiter
notebook is a web application you can
include live Python code in Jupiter
notebook you can also include exponent
turret text as in markdown syntax which
is great for guiding you through of the
various concepts of pison and in this
video we are going to focus on
installing jupiter notebook on
downloading the right Pisan distribution
and then i am going to explain
everything you need to know to get
started with jupiter notebook at first
so okay in the first step we are going
to set up TripIt a notebook on your
system and to do so let's first visit
the website of jupiter notebook which
can be found at jupiter org
that's website you can see it here
basically there are two options to get
started with Jupiter here you can choose
it from the two buttons which are
available here the first button is
saying tried in your browser that is the
first possibilities this is going to
open up a hosted version of Jupiter
notebook and
second option here is install the
notebook which means installing it on
your machine and that is the option I'd
like to choose now so if I click on
install the notebook it gives me a brief
guide which is including the steps I
need to perform to get going well
stripped a notebook and as you can read
here it's saying that it is strongly
recommended that if you are new to
passing and you haven't installed Pisan
on your computer before it's recommended
to install it by using the anaconda
distribution and here is link if you
have already installed Parsons free on
your computer you can just jump to the
chapter installing Jupiter with pepper
which is the person package manager here
are the commands you can install Jupiter
by using pip in the following way here
but because I assume that you are new to
a person and you have not worked with
spice and before surprisin is not
installed on your system we are going to
choose the option of the anaconda
Christopher ocean so just click on that
link here this takes you to the website
of the Anaconda distribution you can see
it here and you can choose to download
that distribution in the latest version
for various platforms here so you can
download it for Windows you can download
it for mega warehouse and of course
Linux so just choose the platform which
you would like to install anaconda on so
in my case it's Mac OS and then it takes
you here to the section which gives you
a download link to use the Anaconda
installer you can see it here we are
choosing of course the latest stable
version of person so pausing 3.6 you can
download the installer here
then it gives you access to a graphical
installer because I have already
prepared the installation on my system I
do not need to do the download right now
you can just click here on download and
then executing the installation program
and once it is finished we can now
switch to the command line and then
start up the web server which is hosting
Jupiter notebook web application for
access on our machine ok so let's switch
to the command line and just type in
Jupiter notebook with white space here
in between hit enter and now you can see
that the web server is starting up and
it directly takes me here in the browser
to Jupiter notebook you can see it here
just change the directory here to my
Jupiter notebook folder ok so you can
see it here it's running on localhost /
part 8 8 8 8 and that's the default user
interface of jupiter notebook and you
can see it here on the top the user
interface of the jupiter notebook web
application is split up into three areas
so we have the file step here we have
the running tap on the cluster step
later on we will see for which purposes
those tabs are used first of all let's
stay on the files tab to get familiar
with the functionality which is
presented here on that tap because the
files tab is the tab where you can
navigate to the folder where you Jupiter
notebooks power in you can open existing
Jupiter notebooks right from here by
clicking on the notebooks with files you
can see here is the ending of a jupiter
notebook file is i
P Y and B or you can choose to create
just a new notebook file here in the
folder your you are in by choosing here
the new button which gives you the
option to create a new path and three
notebook here which we will be doing in
a second you can also choose to upload
Jupiter notebook files here and of
course you can log out from Jupiter
notebook if you would like to leave the
web application okay so let's get
started and the next step by creating a
new Jupiter notebook file and then
opening up the notebook and see what's
inside
okay so let's select from the new drop
down button here the option pass is free
to create a new notebook which is ready
for bringing in pass and three code so
as you can see here it's opening up
another browser tab and that's the
notebook which is created and that's the
user interface for a Jupiter notebook
file so the first thing you are going to
notice here maybe is the title of the
notebook is by default if you create a
new one is by default untitled you can
see it here and the title of the browser
tab as well so it's untitled and that's
the first thing what we are going to
change now so let's click here into the
untitled headline and then the following
pop-up window is opening up and now you
can assign a new name for that notebook
for example do you picture tutorial one
so now you can see the title has changed
here the title here in the browser tab
has changed as well and
you can see it here it's out was saved
so we do not need to save it manually
it's saved automatically and else we
have now assigned a name here for that
notebook if I go back into my files
overview you can see here my new file is
a Weibull here in my folder the file has
the exact same file name as the title of
my Jupiter notebook so the file name is
the Jupiter tutorial one dot i py and b
and in contrast to you on the other two
notebook files here in my folder you can
see it's highlighted the symbol here is
highlighted in green color it's saying
in green running here and that's because
this notebook is running right now I've
opened it in the second browser tab here
and here it's saying or running we can
change to the running tab here as well
and here you can see the current
notebook is listed in the section
notebooks here and I can choose to shut
it down here by hitting the shutdown
button but that is not what I'm going to
do next
instead let's switch back to you the
Jupiter notebook tap here and let's
explore some of the features which are
inside the notebook user interface so
the Jupiter notebook itself consists of
so-called cells and one cell is created
by default a bets the area which is
visible here and that cell I can click
into on the input field here in that
cell that cell is of type code which you
can see here you can change the type of
a cell by clicking here on the drop down
menu and for example change it to
markdown we will see it in a minute but
for the moment let's stay and choose the
code cell type here and
because we have chosen to set this
drippity notebook up for passing we can
start now
typing in Python code into that cell
right away so let's let's try it out
let's say print hello world so this is
one line of Python code and now I can
execute this cell by clicking either
here on the button run cell this is the
first possibility or are just staying
here in the editing mode of the cell
content and hitting shift return and you
can now see okay the cell is executed
the pass and command is executed and the
output is printed out here right
underneath the cell it's saying hello
world so my print statement has been
executed successfully okay now you can
see I have executed my first code cell
here and not only the output appears
here but Jupiter notebook created a
second cell a second code cell now let's
use that second code cell for bringing
in another example and I'd like to show
you how you can include multiple lines
of code as well here so let's first say
we have E which is equal to one and next
we have a while loop here and the while
loop needs to be executed as long as E
is less or equal ten and for each run
through here of the print command should
be executed and print out the value of E
and finally I need to make sure that I'm
going to increase e as well so okay now
I have multiple lines of code and again
I'm hitting shift return and you can see
the output here it's printing out one to
ten the while loop is executed ten times
and the result
here's a Weibull immediately here
underneath that second cell
okay now having executed the second cell
another cell has been created here a
search cell and now we can use that a
cell to maybe demonstrate how you can
change the type of that cells so let's
change it from code to mark down and now
include some markdown text here so let's
say this is a headline a sub-headline
and then maybe let's bring in some text
here and some more text so this is my
markdown code and now I can execute this
cell so that I get the result from a
markdown code that it is compiled to the
output in the same way as have executed
parsing cells just need to hit either
that button here or shift return and you
can see that the output here and if you
compare it to what is happening here for
code at the cells you can see the code
cell is staying here you can still see
the code you can later on again click on
that code change it and execute it again
and the output is a Weibull here
underneath for markdown sounds the
behavior is a little bit different it's
giving you the output here and it's
replacing the input area of the markdown
but if you click in the markdown text
here again you can see you can you are
back in the mark download and you can
make changes here and hit shift return
again and it's compiled again okay so
maybe you've already noticed that there
are two different activation modes of a
cell for example if I click here on
my first coat cell just in the cell area
here you can see it's activated which is
indicated by the border which is placed
around that cell and the cell is
activated in the so called command mode
and the command mode each is indicated
by a blue colored left border on the
right side on the left side here and now
I can change the mode by clicking in the
code editor area here and now you can
see the left border color is changing to
green which is indicating that we are
now in edit mode of the cell and to know
the mode of the cell is important
because it depends on the mode whether
you in command mode or you are in
editing mode which commands are
available and to get an overview of all
the commands and the corresponding key
codes you can click here on the help
menu and select the menu entry keyboard
shortcuts and in the following pop-up
window you can see first of all here is
the hint that you need to know in which
mode are you are staying whether you are
in edit mode and command mode as
explained now you can see a list of a
Weibull keyboard commands first of all
all the commands which are available in
command mode that's the first part of
the list and in the second part you can
see a list of keyboard commands which
are available in edit mode so for
example I've already told you that you
can run a cell by hitting shift return
here is the corresponding entry in my
keyboard shortcuts list here and that is
only true if I'm staying in edit mode so
if I can see the green colored left
border I can hit shift and return to
the selected cell if I scroll a little
bit up for example you can see that if
I'm in command mode for example I can
hit D the D key two times to delete a
cell but this is not working when I'm in
edit mode so let's try it out
right now I'm in edit mode if I hit didi
of course that is not going to work
because now I'm entering text here my
code editor but if I'm leaving now the
edit mode which I can always do by
hitting escape and I'm begging command
mode and now I can hit didi and the cell
is gone so that's the main difference
here and always if you would like to
have an overview of all able a keyboard
commands let's remember to open it up by
using the help menu and selecting
keyboard shortcuts menu entry here you
can also edit the keyboard shortcuts if
you want to change some of the shortcuts
you can use the link here edit keyboard
shortcuts so okay another cool function
of jupiter notebook is the ability to
create checkpoints by creating a
checkpoint you can store the current
state of a notebook so that you can
maybe later on go back to of this
checkpoint and that notebook state and
but going back you are reverting changes
which have been made to the notebook in
the meantime and yeah let's see how this
is going to work so if you would like to
create a checkpoint here from the state
we were seeing currently here you can go
to the files menu and just say save and
checkpoint okay you can see it's saved
here and now you should all be able to
see okay we have one checkpoint of abel
that's the checkpoint i've just created
here and before reverting to use a
checkpoint let's make another change
here to
the notebook let's say print again
hellworld executed so now we have made
one change here and now I can see that
the checkpoint is still wavering if I
now click on that menu entry it's
bringing up at that pop-up window and
it's saying okay we revert notebook to
checkpoint just as a warning message
this cannot be undone okay let's do it
revert and you can see my a print
statement is gun again and I'm back to
the state of the checkpoint so another
important function here is in the files
menu the export function which is a
Weibull here in the menu item download s
si consider you have various options of
exporting your jupiter notebook and
download it as a file you can see the
file formats which are available here
you can choose to download it for
example as a pass and file HTML file a
markdown file you can also download it
as in PDF if you have configured a lot
ash so various options here for
downloading your Tibetan notebook which
makes it very easy to distribute it and
yeah send it to other people and make it
available sex very much for watching
this was Sebastian again from coatings
of smart Wacom if you do like my videos
please don't forget to subscribe to my
channel on YouTube that would be great
and don't forget to visit my website at
coding the smart way comm and I hope I
see you in the next video when we are
going to go through the basics of the
Pisan programming language so stay tuned
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
