coatings of smart Wacom and I wish all
of you a Happy New Year 2018 and I would
like to use this opportunity to thank
all of you very much for supporting
coatings of smart Wacom and my youtube
channel in the last year it has been an
outstanding support and I can give you
some numbers just that you can get an
impression we had a total of 700
thousand video views with a total of 3.7
million minutes watch time and that is
simply outstanding so awesome numbers
and we have been growing the YouTube
channel to over 13,000 subscribers by
yesterday so on the website coding the
smart way comm there have been over a
three hundred thousand visitors in 2017
which is also a huge number and for 2018
of course you can expect many more
content to come we will be releasing new
posts new video tutorials always about
latest technologies in web development
in mobile development and so on so you
can expect to find many more content in
2018 so I hope you will continue to
support coding the smart way comm and of
course the YouTube channel that would be
great so maybe you are just starting out
as a web developer so in 2019 and you
are just looking out of how you can
start what to learn first what to learn
second and so on and let me just point
it to my latest post on the website
which is named the 2008
in a roadmap to full stack web
development so this is just a guideline
summarizing the most important topics
and bringing them into an order so that
you have a guideline what to learn first
where to start and then where to move on
so I will include the link in the video
description of course it would be also
great if you can give me feedback what
will be your favorite front and web
development framework in 2018 and I've
just updated the coding on the smart way
voting tool and let me quickly show you
you can find it here at vote codings a
smart way calm and it's just a very
quick wealth - you can vote for angular
reactive you just click on the logo here
and then your vote is recorded and I
have the feedback Weibull what's most
relevant to you and you can expect that
for the most relevant topic I will be
releasing quickly new tutorials in 2018

year and I hope to see you in the next
video again bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
