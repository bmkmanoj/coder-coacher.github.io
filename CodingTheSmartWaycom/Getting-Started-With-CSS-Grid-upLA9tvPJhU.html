smart way comm and today in this new
video tutorial I'm going to introduce
you to CSS grid so the CSS grid layout
system is great for building more
complex layouts for your web web page or
web application and for example in
comparison to the bootstrap grid layout
system CSS grid enables you to build
layouts by purely using our CSS rules
you do not need to include any external
libraries which is of course great and
the CSS grid system is an two
dimensional grid system so if you would
like to compare two Flex boxes flex
boxes is mostly used in a one
dimensional way and the CSS grid layout
system is two-dimensional so it's built
up of columns and rows and this enables
you to build yeah more complex layouts
and yeah we will dive into the topic
today I'm going to explain some basics
first and then we will see some
real-world examples you can follow along
and build a first example with CSS grid
so stay tuned okay so before diving into
the first examples of building CSS grids
in our application let's first take a
look at the basic terms you need to know
when talking about CSS grid here is a
picture here you can see a grid layout
which is built up of three rows and four
columns and the grid layout system here
is referred to as a word container so
the grid container is a parent element
of the grid layout system and to define
the grid
container element we will later on sees
that we need to apply the CSS rule
display and assign the value grid here
and this needs to be applied to you the
container element then another important
term here when talking about a CSS grid
layout system are a grid lines grid
lines other lines which defines the
structure of the grid and those lines
are dividing the grid into cells lines
in a grid can be either vertical
dividing the grid in the columns
direction or horizontally dividing the
grid into rows each grid line has a
unique number starting from one on the
left side of the grid or at the top of
the grid and then the line numbering is
used to define grid areas we will see
how this works later on then we have the
term grid cell a grid cell is the
smallest unit in our grid system then we
have the grid area a great area is
inside a grid an area which is
surrounded by always four lines you can
see an example here in this image each
area can comprise any number of cells
and a grid area can then be used to then
place an item which is added to the grid
to span across multiple cells so those
are basic terms when talking about a
grid I hope you know have a very basic
understanding of what the CSS grid
layout looks like now let's move on and
see the first practical example let's
create a basic HTML page and let's add a
CSS grid layout system next okay so to
get started I'm switching over to the
command line and first of all I'm
creating a new project directory here so
let's create the direct
and name it for example CSS grid 1 then
I'm changing into the directory and
adding two files so first of all we will
need an index dot HTML file and then we
will need stars dot CSS file which is
containing the CSS code we are adding to
the application so you can see it here
the directory is created to the to new
and at the moment empty files are placed
in this directory and now I can start up
in my code editor which is visual studio
code so I can type into code dot to open
it in that folder here so it's starting
up here we are you can see it here the
folder is opened at the two files are
contained in Dex dot HTML and starts dot
CSS okay so let's start in index dot
HTML you can see it here I've opened up
the file and now we need a basic HTML
structure in that file here so I'm
typing in and selecting here from my
Emmet extension of the html5 template ok
here we are now let's remove all the
meta elements here from the head section
we do not need to those elements for our
sample let's change the title here to
include something like CSS grid team or
one and let's adhere in the head section
a link element pointing to our Styles
dot CSS we have first a rel attribute is
set to style sheet and then the H ref
which is pointing to Styles dot CSS so
that we are including the CSS file here
in our application and let's define
in the body section diff element which
gets assigned a custom class which is
named container so we need to define
that class in the next step of course
but first of all insert that div element
here and okay
so that's our basic structure now in the
next step we now need to activate the
CSS grid layout mode for that
development and to do so I'm switching
over to styles dot CSS and I'm adding
some CSS rules for the container class
here so let's do it in the following way
for container I need to bring in the
display CSS property and assign first of
all to get the grid system activated the
value grid here okay like so and now we
have the grid activated of course
nothing is specified so far we have no
content and the grid so we need to add
in the next step the grid specification
and the word specification and the first
step consists of defining how many
columns and how many rows should the
grid include to do so we need to bring
in two more CSS properties here first of
all I'm using red - template - columns
and now I'm assigning three values here
one F R fr F the unit I'm using for the
defining a fraction one fr another one
fr and one fr and this simply means that
I'm defining a grid layout which
consists of three columns each column
has a width of one fraction of the space
which is a Weibull I can also use
something
yeah for example defining a fixed layout
and say okay one column should be of
hundred pixels this would also be
possible I can use the auto keyword to
define that a column sure to resize in
its width automatically or I can use
fractions and if I say three times one
fraction each column is getting assert
from the available width okay we need to
do so for rows as well so let's say grid
template rows this time and again I'd
like to have three rows of equal height
so I'm using the fraction unit again one
fraction one fraction one fraction and
that is now my definition of the grid
three columns three rows so nine cells
in total so next let's start up on my
development web server which is live
server so I need to type in live -
server live server as a as a development
web server with a live reloading
capability so if I'm going to change
something
in my code it's automatically reflected
in the output in the browser without
needing to reload the page so live
server is it's a really cool tool and
makes development very easy because you
can check your results immediately if
you have not installed live server on
your system yet you can do so it's
available as an NPM package so by using
the node package manager you can install
live - server the package name here is
the same as the command so the package
name is live - server as well so if you
would like to install it just use NPM
I'm starting and up here in my
integrated command line the browser is
opening up here at port 8080 you can see
I'm getting back
at the moment just in a white empty pay
a page nothing is displayed here and
that's quite clear because we have
defined that the great layout but we
have not included any items in the in
the grid container so far and to get
something out here to get something
displayed in the browser we need to add
great items next so let's keep the
server running for the moment I'm saving
that file here and going back to him
next dot HTML and let's add some great
items here to our div element was a
glass container so let's say we would
like to bring in let's say six grid
items here so I'm assigning classes to
each grid item so each grade item gets
the class item and then each grid item
gets an individual class which is item
one in the first case here so let's copy
this this is the first one then second
third fourth fifth six and let's change
at the individual individual item class
here to item two three four five and six
so with those classes assigned we have
both possibilities we can use the item
class to bring in some CSS styling which
is applied to all our grid items or we
can use the individual classes here item
one to item six to bring in styling
which is only applied to a single grade
item let's include some text here we can
use the lower keyword here and say ok
the first item gets text of twenty words
yeah as well okay let's say here we are
using 40 okay and now for the item class
let's add some CSS code here to give it
a background and the background should
be a green color so I'm using the
following color code here let's see okay
like so and now let's check again in the
browser and you can see here is the
result we have now our sixth grade items
displayed 1 2 3 5 3 4 5 6 you can see
those items each is filling up one one
grid cell so this is the first cell
second cell sort a cell and then it's
automatically switching into you the
second row here and filling up the 3
available cells on the second row and
yeah so that's all we do not need we do
not see any content which is displayed
in the third row here because we have
only defined 6 great items and by
default each which great item is only
filling up one cell so the left is the
last row is left empty here so at the
moment you can see it's a little bit
difficult to exactly see where a one
grid cell ends and where the other grid
a cell starts because we have no gap
between other cells and that is
something we can change
so the
of the next step we can adhere to the
definition of the container class to
more CSS properties we can introduce
something like grid template no grid
column gap and say okay we would like to
have ten pixels here and then we can
define something like ripped row gap and
assign the value 10 pixels here as well
so let's check it in the browser now you
can see each cell is separated we have
the 10 pixels gap here between the cells
and between the content of the cells so
now you can see a little bit better how
the structure of our grid was the 6th
grade items inside looks like you can
also write it in a shorthand notation
you can combine it into one CSS property
you only need to write grid gap and then
specify the row gap first 10 pixels and
the column gap second so if you check
this it's the same result so next let's
talk about how to align on the content
of the cell and we can use two
properties basically here we can use
justify - items to you align the column
of cells along the row axis and we can
use a line - items to align the content
along the column axis so let's first
talk about just define items we will
bring that property in here into the
definition of the container class
so let's add it here justify items and
the default mode or the default value
which is assigned here to that property
is stretch and this is stretching the
content to fill the complete width of
the cell and now we can change it there
are three more value so default is
stretch if we say stretch here nothing
is happening and if we say ok let's use
other values here we can as an option
you start which is aligning two to the
left we can use and which is aligning to
the right and we can use center to
aligns in the center so that is the
value I'd like to use here and to see
the effect I need to go to index dot
HTML and for example let's include a
much shorter text here into the first
item let's use test here and if I'm now
going to check the result in the browser
again you can see it here because the
text now is not requiring to fill up the
complete space the content is centered
here along the row axis so this is a
result so next let's bring in the
property aligned items I have the same
options here by default it's stretch
this is stretching the content to fill
the complete height and the other
options I have here our start as this
Alliance to the top then we have end
which aligns to the bottom and we have
sent
which centers the content so let's save
it again take a look at the result and
now you can see it's centering the
content here across Xia column axis so
now you have seen how to align the grid
content by applying CSS properties line
- items and justify - items on container
level it's also possible to do the same
on item level and therefore we need to
apply the CSS properties justified -
self which is aligning the content of
one item along the row axis or align -
self which is aligning the content of
one item along the column axis so let's
see how this works here in starts dot
CSS let's define class item 1 which is
only applied to you the first great item
and we are using the justify self
property here and assigning the value
end and together was justified as self
I'm using a line - self applying value
end here so we are lining till the right
to the bottom let's check the result and
you can see the test text is no longer
centered it's overwritten by the
specific roots for this item which is
pushing it to the bottom and to the
right by using two times the value and
one time for justified as self and to
the second time for align - self so this
is the way how you can apply the
alignment to just single elements in our
grid
okay so far our examples just showed
that the defined grid elements are put
into the grid cells one by another which
means each grid item is placed inside
exactly one grid cell it's starting here
on the left top and then you are filling
up the first rows and entering the
second row and so on you can change that
grid item location and define that a
great item should for example span
across multiple cells in your grip by
using CSS properties like grip - column
- start grid - column - and and in rows
as well you can use here grid - row -
start and grid - row - end and the
values which needs to assign to those
properties to define the area or other
cells which should be should be the area
where the item is displayed the values
which needs to be assigned here are the
line numbers so switching back to our to
our graphic from the beginning you can
see we have grid lines here and for
example you can say that one of you
items one of your grid items may be in
the second row should not only be placed
in the first grid cell it should be
placed in this grid cell and maybe in
the second grid cell then you would
define the grid column start value with
one because it's starting here was line
one and it should span across line to
end until line three so you would set
the value of grid column and to 3
because it's ending here in grid line 3
so this is the way it works now we can
try it out and let's for example say we
would like to
span our false correct items so this one
across not only this cell across this
cell as well and this cell so it should
fill up the space in the second row
completely and the way we can achieve
that we can define that it should span
from line one to line four so we have
line 1 2 3 4 so the last line here is 4
so this is area which should be used for
placing this element so how how to do
that let's go back here into starts dot
CSS and let's use item for class like so
and we are using grid - column - start
who is well u 1 as described and we are
adding grid - column - end with value 4
let's check the result and now you can
see it's filling up Row 2 completely
it's spanning across three grid cells as
expected so we can also take out the
definitions of justify - items and the
line height
- items here to maybe make the layout a
bit more understandable because now it's
stretching again you can see it a little
bit better here and another way of
defining that one element should span
across multiple cells is to use a
shorthand notation here instead of
writing great - column - start and great
- column - and you can just use a
property which is called great - columns
or great - column
or grit - ROH that's working in the same
way and now we can specify that it
should spawn but we in line one and four
by using the following syntax here 1/4
and now you should see if we check it in
the browser the result stays the same so
it's just having the same effect it's a
shorthand notation so inside of a grid a
grid area can be any area surrounded by
four lines as already explained each
area can comprise any number of sounds
and in the last example we have seen
that you can describe an area by using
properties like great - column - start
great - column - and and so on however
there is another possibility which is a
little bit easier and which gives you
the possibility of
defining grid areas as well by applying
properties or by applying the property
grid
- template - area you are able to
describe the grid areas in your grid by
assigning names to it in just one step
so you can describe in one step multiple
areas in your grid so let's take a look
at a practical example just imagine that
you would like to you define the
following layout here you can see it
here we have four areas here you have a
header area on top of footer area at the
bottom and then a sidebar at the left
and a Content area which should should
be the largest area here in this layout
on the right side so what does it mean
for our grid if we would like to define
such a layout was for great areas and we
have a grid
three by three cells so three columns
three rows we can assign the following
grid areas in our grid so in the first
row the first results can be defined to
belong to grid area with the name header
then in the second row we start with
defining that as the first cell should
belong to the grid area which is named
sidebar then the two the two cells in
the second row which are on the right
side belong to the area which is called
content and all cells in the last column
in the third column should belong to you
the footer area okay let's see in the
next example how to define such a layout
and define all those four areas in just
one step
so I've already created here within my
project folder a new file index two dot
HTML and another new file starts to dot
CSS and you can see here was in index to
my file Styles to dot CSS has already
included so we can now start over with a
new example here first of all here in
the body section you notice that I have
already prepared a parent div element
which is my grid container and gets
assigned the class container and within
that parent div element now I need to
bring in for for grid items because in
my grid I will have four grid areas and
each area will display one grade item so
let's do so let's include four diff
elements first was item one class is
including the text header header
the second was item 2 class is including
the text sidebar next one with item
three class assigned
and it's containing the text content
here and finally we have the item for
element and this is the photo okay so
that's our structure you can see it here
again the HTML code the markup code is
not containing any layout elements the
complete layout when working was a CSS
grid layout system is separated and it's
only available in your CSS file so that
makes it much more flexible so if you
would like to change your layout you can
do so in your CSS code you do not need
to rearrange your markup code here like
you would need to do when using for
example the bootstrap grid system okay
so let's go over here to stance to dot
CSS you can see it here it's empty so
I've started to includes a definition of
the container class so now what I need
to do here is first of all say okay it
should be of a width of hundred view
port width so it should take the
complete width and it should be off a
height of 100 viewport height so that it
fills out the complete available space
of my website now I need to activate the
grid layout system again by saying
display width then I need to define the
grid template columns this time I'm
using one fraction for the first column
suite fractions for other for the second
column and free fractions again for last
column okay next grid template
gross
one fraction ten fractions and one
fraction and now I'm using a new CSS
property which is called grid - template
- areas and here now I'm describing my
layout by defining the area names and
the syntax which is used for this for
this property and for giving the value
here is a visual representation of the
weight layout so repeating a name of an
area multiple times causes this great
area to span across all all those grid
cells so I will give you an example here
so let's describe the first row the
first row contains three cells and I'm
saying header header header which is
describing that all three cells and the
first row are belonging to C header area
next row is sidebar content content and
finally it's puta puta puta okay so now
we have described our our layout three
bus results and now we have assigned all
three grid areas which we will be using
when now arranging and bringing in our
grade items okay so let's start with the
item one class here so item one for us
now I'm using the property was the name
grid area to just specify in which of my
defined good areas this item should be
displayed
and I'm assigning the value header and
this simply means that item one will
span across all three cells away both in
Row 1 okay what I'm doing also here is
to assign a background color using the
color code 86689 okay like so and then
let's continue with class item two so
this is my sidebar and that's the reason
why I assigned to property great area
the value sidebar this means that item
two is displayed in the first cell of
the second row as well I'm assigning a
background color here this time it's
let's see BD e 9 8 6 ok like so so next
items 3 of course grid area again now we
have the content items so I'm assigning
the value content here and the
background color of p8e 9 8 6
so finally item 4 that's the footer so
I'm assigning the value footer to grid
area and I'm assigning a background
color again of a 9c 8 8 6 like so okay
and maybe let's say that for our body
element let's say that we would have
a padding of zero pixels and a margin of
zero pixels as well okay so let's check
the result in the browser and you can
see it here I've opened up in the x2 dot
HTML and you can see we are getting
exactly the layout we would like to have
for Z header area the sidebar area
content area and footer area so with
this example I think you can see how
easy how easy it is with the CSS grid
layout system to define even more
complex layouts for your websites so
