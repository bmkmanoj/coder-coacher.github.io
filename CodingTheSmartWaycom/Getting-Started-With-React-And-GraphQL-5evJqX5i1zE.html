coding the smart way comm and today in
this new tutorial you will learn how to
use react and graph QL and to do so we
will be using a library which is called
Apollo react Apollo and this library is
Weibull in the latest version which is
2.1 and with that new version a lot of
new features have been added to react
Apollo which are now making it very easy
to make use of graph QL in your react
application so today you will learn how
to use the new query component for
example which makes it very easy to
connect until your graphic you are back
and and yeah that is what we will be
doing so just follow along and enjoy it
so to get started with react and
graphically and well the first thing we
need to do of course is to setup a new
react project and the easiest way to do
so is to use a script which is called
great
- react - app which is way below on
github if you take a look here at the
URL github comm a slash face book slash
great - react - app and this script can
be used to initiate set up a new new
standard react project and that is
exactly what we are going to do in this
first step and the cool thing about the
script here ills if you scroll little
bit down you can see it here in the
quick overview section of the
documentation you can use it directly
without the need of installing it on
your local machine it can be executed
with the npx command which is a Weibull
on your system if you have the latest
one of the latest version of
note and NPM installed so by using the
MPX command you can execute that script
directly and that is what we are going
to do now so I'm switching over to you
the terminal and here I'm typing in MPX
and then followed by the script name
which is great
- react - app and then followed by the
name of the project I would like to
create and the name I'm using here is
react - a graph QL so hitting return you
can see it's already running it's
downloading the react project then
fetching all the dependencies of the
packages which are needed by react and
installing it all into a newly created
folder and this command is running as
you can see here it takes just a few
seconds to complete so now you can see
it's ready and it already gives me the
next step so I know I can change into
that newly created project folder and
then I can use yarn or NPM to start up
the development web server so let me use
NPM here and then I need to say NPM
start hit return and you can see it's
starting up the development web server
it's bringing up the browser loading on
the project here which is running on
port 3000 on my local machine and you
can see it here it's printing out the
greeting welcome to react to get started
edit also see fjs and safe to reload so
what we have here is the life reloading
development web server so it you can
keep it running in the background make
your changes to the code and the live
reloading development web service making
sure that the content presented on the
browser is reloaded automatically so
that you can see
changes made to your source code
directly in the browser without the need
to manually reloading anything here so
now you can see we are ready the project
is being set up and now we can move on
and install in the next step a few
dependencies to use the project because
we would like to use the reactor power
library so we need to install
dependencies so to install the needed
dependencies I'm switching back to you
with the terminal stopping the webserver
here for a moment
and then using the NPM tool here within
the project folder to install the
dependencies and the command I need to
execute here is NPN with the option
install and then followed by a list of
package names and first of all I'm
adding the package Apollo - boost next
react - Paulo and cert the graph QL -
tech package and finally graph QL itself
hitting return and you can see now the
installation process is being executed
it's downloading the packages including
additional dependencies installing all
that into the node underscore modules
folder within my project folder and it's
running and will take some seconds to
complete and once it is complete we can
move on and make use of the react Apollo
library within our project so here we
are the installation process has been
finished successfully the needed
packages have been added as you can see
here and next I'm starting up my code
editor which is Visual Studio code of
course you feel free to use any other
code editor if you like I'm using Visual
Studio code here and to start it here
and to open the current folder I'm just
typing in code and dot for the current
folder and then hitting return and then
Visual Studio code
is starting up with the project folder
I'm located here in opened up in Visual
Studio code you can see it here so
that's my project setup we have the note
underscore modules folder a Weibull here
at the place where all the dependencies
are installed into you then we have the
public folder and we have CS / C folder
and within the SSV folder you can find
the main implementation parts of our
application and that's exactly the place
where we are going to start to adapt and
add code in the following steps so the
first thing I'd like to do here in my
project is to open up Epcot jas from
here within my SOC folder so here can
see that's the default code which is a
Weibull here and in order to be able to
access the graph QL service from the
reactor plication the first step I need
to complete here in my application is to
create an instance of Apollo client
because Apollo client is it's the thing
I'm using to connect to my graph to our
back-end and this is done here in F dot
J's and to do so I'm adding first of all
an another impulse taekman tear and I'm
importing Apollo client from the Apollo
boost package like so and with Apollo
client a Weibull here in app dot J's I
can now create an instance and this is
done on the following way so Const
client and this equals new Apollo
clients I'm calling the class
constructor here and the constructor is
expecting to get a configuration object
and the configuration object needs to
contain
one property and zealously you are I
property here and this is a place where
I need to assign a string which is a UI
of my graph QL endpoint so I need to
include a semicolon here and of course I
have no graph QL endpoint a Weibull so
far so we know we need to talk about how
we can create or get an graph QL
endpoint we can use here for our sample
application because we do need the uri
string here so let's talk about the
different options you have to set up a
graph QL back-end we can then use
together with our react application so
of course there are multiple options
just to name a few the first option is
to use the Apollo server package here
from the Apollo project to create a
graph QL server together with for
example no chance and Express so you can
use it as a middleware in your Express
server and then set up a server on your
own if you would like to use that way
you can take a look at our policy ver
introduction tutorial here at coding
system at wacom here you have a full
introduction of how to set up a power
serve ER and to configure Apollo server
and then implement your back-end using
that library another option else to use
the Express - graph QL library which is
a similar library which can be used
together with node.js and Express and
the Express - graph QL library is acting
as a middleware again and it's working a
slightly different and Apollo server but
it's another option and if you would
like to go this way and use Express
graph QL you can also find a tutorial on
coding this mod wacom hits the tutorial
creating a graph QL server with no GS
and Express here can find
the full video our tutorial on how to
set up a server by using that library
there is another option which is a lot
easier if you just want to set up your
graphic you out back-end for force a
sample application and for testing
purposes and that's a polar Launchpad
Apollo launch pad is an online service
where you can create your server
directly here in the browser so you do
not need to implement it on your local
machine you can set it up here in the
browser and I have already implemented
here a sample graph QL server which is
giving you access to console stator and
this is a Weibull here in bio is this ul
you can find it as a link in the
description of this tutorial and this
this graph QL server which is
implemented here using the launchpad
service is Weibo and can be used and for
example I can show you here as simple
queries that's the all courses query I
can execute it here just test if my
server is working and you can see we are
getting back data which is containing
the oil causes property and then just
listing some online courses here with
properties like ID title also
description topic and you were out and
that is the data we are going to use
together with our react application so
for the first steps here in this
tutorial I'm using this graph QL server
which is implemented here with Apollo
launch pad and here you can see it's
printing out the graph QL endpoint
that's the string we can just copy it
from here go back to you will studio
code and then I can insert the value
here for the UI property and that's
exactly that endpoint
string so that is all what is needed so
was that code in place Apollo client we
are creating an instance of Apollo
client and the pollak line is connecting
to our graph QL back-end which is
implemented using the Apollo Launchpad
service in the browser so there is no
additional server running on your local
machine so having established on the
connection to the graph QL endpoint with
this code the next step now is to
connect at the instance of Apollo client
we have a label here in client to our
react application and today so I'm first
of all deleting the default
implementation of the app component here
which is printing or outputting the HTML
code which we earlier saw on the browser
and first launching the application that
is not needed instead I'm adding now
another import statement and to connect
the instance of Apollo client to our
react application we do need the Apollo
provider class which is a Weibull in
react - Apollo ok like so and now of
course need to add the implementation of
app component once again and the way we
do need it and let me implement it in
the following way like so and the JSX
code which is needed here is first
making use of the Apollo provider
element so let's use Apollo provider
here and then we are using the attribute
client and passing in was curly braces
our instance of Apollo client so that is
a most important step to connect adhere
to our react application of course we
need to close the Apollo provider
element here and within that for
Apolo provider element we can include
additional JSX code which is used to hot
put maybe a headline first so I'm using
a div element here and within the div
element I'm using an h2 tag to output a
headline text and that is my first
Apollo react application like so okay so
now let's check the result again in the
browser and you can see the default
content which has been outputted before
from the default read project as gun
because we've deleted everything from
the implementation of that component and
instead only happened my first Apollo
react application is printed out here in
the browser so now our application is
ready we have established the connection
to the back end to the graphical back
end which is provided by Apollo launch
pad and then connected that back end
connection to a react application now
we're ready to go we can now enhance our
react application to actually request
data and then provide the data to the
user here in the browser so that would
be the next step and to do so we are
creating a new component in our
application so let's go back here to
visual studio code and to add a new
component I'm adding that component here
in the SRC folder I'm saying add file
here and the name of that file should be
conscious dot J s so the course is not
cause J as let me rename it to cause us
dot Jaso k like so so we are introducing
a conscious component here in our
application and of course as file is
empty its newly created so we start with
the implementation
that react component from scratch in
that empty five year now so to start
with the implementation here in that
file we first need to import a few
things so we need to import react from
react next I need to import query from
the react - Paulo package then I need to
import gql from the graph QL - tech
library and then of course we need to
implement the component so the component
is named causes ok like so and finally
we need to make sure that courses is
exported here as a default export so
that it can be later used in other
component files here in my project so we
are exporting it by default s courses
like so ok now of course I need to
include the implementation here in
courses and the first thing I'm now
doing here is to make use of the new
career component from the react Apollo
library to actually execute a query to
my back-end and the way it is done is by
including query as an element here with
the attribute query and crew gets
assigned as an expression so in curly
braces the graph QL query and to include
graph QL query language here actually I
need to use a GQ tag I've imported so
like so and then using tactics here to
include it as a multi-line string
like so and now I'm able to include the
graph QL query right inside this element
here so because I'd like to retrieve a
list of all away but causes I'm once
again using s seen before here's you
know the Apollo launch pad the all
causes query and I'm requesting the
following attributes here for every
single call CID the title also
description topic URL ok like so let's
close the query element here and the
next thing now is the curry is executed
and then I need to include a callback
method here which is then invoked if
once the query is executed and then I
can include the logic I'd like to
implement in that callback method but
before doing so let's includes a closing
pure attempt here so that this element
is opening and closing correctly and now
within our bad query element I'm able to
include the callback function I'd like
to use and we do it in the following way
here as in function without name and I'm
expanding the list of parameters here so
we have loading arrow and data okay then
the function body and the first thing I
now need to check is if loading so if
the crew result is not yet available but
it's loading I'd like to return the
following JSX code here just to print
out an information to the users that the
loading is taking place so I'm printing
out the text loading like so the next
case is if in error hands are cured I'd
like to inform the user as well so in
that case I'm returning again just the
following information arrow and I'm
closing the paragraph element here okay
and of course the most important case is
when the data is available and I'd like
to output the data to the user so that
is a cert case and that is what is
handled if it is not loading and if no
error is a cured so the way I can output
everything as by returning what we're
getting back from the call of data or
causes - map I'm using the map method
here - I - right through the list of
returned causes and passing in a
callback method which is then executed
for every single cause and that list and
this method is again containing the
properties which I am extracting here Rd
title author description
like so topic ul okay like so and then
in the body I'm returning that Jane has
X code here and forever sing across
element in the first temp now I'm
printing out div element which gets
assigned a unique key here was a key
attribute and this is what we are having
a Weibull in our deep because ideas
containing the unique identifier for
everything of course so I'm using that
div element here and let's close it and
within that div element I'm using a
paragraph again to include the following
expression was it which is printing out
just a title and see also information so
don't assign curly braces title by
dollar sign curly braces authors so this
is inserting the value of title and
inserting the value of author here in my
string I'm printing out okay closing the
string and finally closing P element
here so this should be all including a
semicolon here so this code should do
the job so let's check it out so to be
actually able to see the output which is
coming from our causes component we
first of all of course in dt2 included
in the main application component which
is app and here I'm importing now
courses from our arm file where it is
implemented which is courses now it's a
Weibull and i can make use of that
component here in my JSX code and for
included here as the only element in my
top development so cause us in that way
so let's check it at the browser and as
you can see we are not getting back what
is expected
instead we're getting a syntax error
which is saying unexpected name all
causes and it's highlighting here's the
line and the quail code in the source
code and you can see here so let's
correct it
it's a Weibull here in Casas dot j s and
this is the place which is highlighted
and the reason is all causes krory else
included here directly in the graph QL
string and this is not correct because
all the queries needs to be embedded in
in opening and closing curly braces like
we saw before when executing the on
console query in the Apollo launch pad
user interface and we need to include
that here as well so opening curly
braces closing curly braces and
embedding all courses just inside those
pair of curly braces okay so let's check
it again and you can see now we are
getting back what is expected we are
getting a list of courses just with the
title information and was the name of
the author so this is obviously working
so so far on the output of course
information like title and author is
done directly in courses component and
in the next step we're going to
introduce a new component to our project
which is called just cause and this
component should then contain the code
which is needed to output one single
coil
and then we can make use of that
component here within courses dot J s
and first to implement that component we
of course need to add again a new fungal
to the project this time it's called
cost dot J s okay and then we need to
empty implementation here first because
we are we are going to implement a new
react component here we need to part
react from the react main library and
then let's let's implement cause and now
cause gets the current cause information
which with all the properties we need to
output here via a component property so
we have props as an parameter here and
claim like so and of course I need to
export course here so that I can make
make use of course in causes component
later on ok like so and to output one
sing a course let's include another div
element here again the key attribute is
used and the value which it is assigned
the key is again the idea of the current
course which is now available in props
dot cos da tardy
and then I'm outputting just as seen
before here and causes dr. J s so I can
copy and past it here so this paragraph
element but this time title is not a
Weibull directly instead we need two
accesses with our props dot title and
the same as about for the author
information its props dot course dot
Asura
like so okay now let's go back to
Coruscant j/s to the top and then I'm
adding the import statement here for our
course component so import course from
course okay like so and then I can
replace it here so everything which is
included here inside of the map handler
so let's remove it here let's remove the
list of extracted parameters here as
well instead we are just expecting to
get the current course as an object and
I'm using here inside the callback
handler I'm using the cost component to
output the course and I need to pass it
in by a component property which is
called course and I assign here with
curly braces as our current course so
okay so on the server is still running
in the background so I can switch back
to the browser and you can see the
output has not changed it's basically
the same as before it's outputting the
title and the author information for
everything of course but this time we
know the output is not coming from
causes component instead
it's coming from the course component
which is embedded here for every single
course in the list we are getting back
from or graphically all beckoned okay so
to further complete our application in
the first in the next step we are adding
the bootstrap library because what we
saw so far in the Brahmas our output is
not looking very nice so we will be
using some bootstrap CSS classes to make
our output look a little bit nicer and
to do so we first need to install the
bootstrap for library and today so I'm
opening up here in Visual Studio code
the integrated terminal and you can do
so from the View menu and then select
the menu item integrated terminal and
then the integrated terminal is opening
up here and you are located by default
in the project folder and to install
bootstrap library we can use the node
package manager again so NPM is the
command and then we using the option
install and then followed by the package
name which is bootstrap
okay so we're turn and now you can see
it's running again downloading bootstrap
installing it into the node underscore
modules folder of our application and
once it is completed we are able to
import the bootstrap CSS file into our
project so that we then can apply
bootstrap CSS classes to our HTML output
okay here we are you can sit here
bootstrap 4.10
has been installed successfully and now
I can open up index dot JSON the
following important statement here to
import the bootstrap CSS file so import
from node underscore modules in
bootstrap dist
/ CSS / and the fire we would like to
import here is boot boot scrap dot MnDOT
a CSS like so okay now it's Weibull and
we can make use of bootstraps CSS
classes first in constant je s so that's
where every single cause is outputted
and so far we have been using the
following JSX code here and now we are
going to enhance it a little bit to make
the output for every course look nicer
so I'm going to remove those three lines
of code here and start over again with
embedding development here and this time
we are going to assign a CSS class here
which is called cart and you need just
to remember that in react you need not
to use class you need instead use class
name as the attribute and that is what
we're doing here and then I'm including
some inline styling as well so I'm
assigning a width of let's say 100
percent and I'm using a margin to the
top so much on top of about 10 pixels
are things that should be sufficient
okay so it's closest if element here and
within that div element I'm using
another different element this time I'm
assigning a class of card - body again a
bootstrap class
so and within that card body section I'm
including first from now outputting see
the information of that cause and I'm
starting first was including the title
as a headline so I'm using h5 element
here
assigning a class of God - title like so
and outputting here was in that h h5
element outputting was curly braces this
value which is avaible and props dot
cross dot title like so okay next I'm
using an h6 element here class name is
cart - subtitle and m/v - - - at a
margin to the bottom and I'm using the
class text - muted looks so and it's
very I'd like to print out here as in h6
element is a Weibull and props dot cost
dot officer okay so next else a
paragraph was class name of car - text
and value as props dot course not
just scratching like so okay and finally
i'd like to include a link to the
courses website as well so i'm using
anchor tech here and I'm assigning the
following value to Z H ref attribute
here which is a label and props dot cost
or ul and of course I need to asana
classes here as well
starting with card - link okay that's
sufficient only that class here and
closing this anchor element here and
including the text go to cross okay
let's so and checking the result in the
browser again you can see the output
else now looking much better we have the
list of courses now presented at
bootstrap as bootstrap card elements we
have that link here available so you can
click on the link and it takes you to G
courses website and now we can make some
final final enhancements to our
application and maybe include a top
navigation bar so that the application
looks a little bit more professional and
to do so we are going back to amp
tortillas in Visual Studio code and add
as a necessary code changes here so
first of all to use the top-level
development here I'm assigning a class a
bootstrap class which is called
container like so and then here inside
that div element I'm using another day
another nav element to includes a
navigation bar area and therefore I need
to assign the following classes here
navbar Neph or dark and BG - primary to
display you know in a bluish color ok
let's close that Neff element here
and within the Neph element I'm
including just man kortek here was class
name Neff or - Brent like so and it's
pointing to the current website and the
text should be displayed here react and
ref QL sample application flex so okay
Rhett underneath the nav element here
I'm adding another div element here just
you include the output which is coming
from the courses component inside of
that div section here which I'm going to
close here okay so let's say fit going
back to the browser and now I can see
it's looking again better now we have
the navigation bar area here on top we
have it centered because the container
class are supplied and now you're
getting back the list of courses which
is coming from our graph QL back and by
using the Apollo react library so so
this one's about stem from coding this
man without common sense will be very
much for watching if you do enjoy my
