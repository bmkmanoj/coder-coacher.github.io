coatings of smart Wacom today in this
new video I'd like to give you an
overview of my top 5 atom packages as
you might know from our other videos
atom is my favorite text editor for web
and mobile projects and atom is very
lightweight and of course free editor so
this is a great thing it's easy to use
it's open source and it's very
extensible
so you can use a list of a total I think
of 6,000 or over 6,000 packages to
extend the functionality and the day
let's take a look at my top 5 packages
so stay tuned so as you can see I've
already opened up a sample project here
in atom if you have not installed atom
yet on your system you first of course
need to go to adam.com download that the
package was was the installer for your
platform and install atom and if you
have atom installed and open to add
packages here to the editor we need to
go to the settings view and there are
two ways to go there the first way is to
simply use the atom menu here and select
preferences and you can see it opens up
the settings tab and from the settings
tab you can select here from the
left-side menu the packages view and the
install view the other way to go to the
settings tab is to use command or Shift
+ P on Mac OS and then just enter here
install packages and you can see it's
bringing up a suggestion settings view
install packages and seams and just
selected and you can see it takes me
directly to Z install view here within
the settings tab so the first thing we
can do here is to open up the packages
tab and just see the list of already
installed packages and as I scroll down
you can see there are many packages
pre-installed which are part of the atom
core packages list here and you can use
and that view here to enter a package a
name or just a part of a package name
let's try out HTML here and you can see
the immediate immediately filters maoist
to do packages containing the string
HTML in in the name and here you can see
for example i have a default package
installed which is named autocomplete -
HTML which gives me an auto completion
feature for writing HTML code here okay
now to install new packages we can
switch over to the install view here and
then type and the package name we would
like to search for or just a part of
that name and then we get the results
here in that list and then we have the
install button here for each package and
clicking on the install button is adding
this package to this item installation
so the first package which I would like
to to show you is Emmet so let's type in
Emmet and search for Emmet and here you
can see it's a first match so I'm
hitting install here and now it's
downloading and installing Emmet Emmet
is a really powerful tool which makes
writing HTML and CSS code really easy by
using abbreviations or a very short text
string and then using the tab key to
expand it to the full HTML
or css a structure okay as you can see
here download has been completed package
is installed now you have different
options available here you can disable
this package you can also uninstall it
so completely remove it here and you can
go to the settings view of this package
where you can find additional
information about key bindings you can
change the key bindings of course and
now let's see how M it works of course
in this video I did not give you a full
introduction to M it but if you would
like to get basic information about the
m @ syntax you can go to Emmett dot IO
and then click on documentation and
there you will find all the
abbreviations you can use to write HTML
and CSS code okay so to give you a first
impression of what M it looks like and
how you can write a mod code I've opened
up an empty HTML file it's test - I'm a
dot HTML as you can see here and now we
see activated Emmit plug-in I can do
something like for example say okay I
would like to have div element here and
then I'm using the arrow brackets
pointing to the left and then I would
like to include another element as part
of the div element and I would like to
include a paragraph for example and now
I'm hitting tab the tab key and you can
see it brings the HTML structure into
that file and that is why I'm it is
working and just to to get a feeling of
how powerful I might actually is I can
also give you another demonstration here
for example let's say we would like to
have a div element with a certain ID so
I'm using the ID page here by using the
syntax here with a hash
element then would like to include the
beef element with class logo and a list
element okay let's say then we would
like to have the idea of navigation
assigned and was in that list element
let's include five list items like so
and let's say was in each list item I'd
like to include an anchor tag and I'd
like to include an expression here as
well in the following way
item dollar sign to just print out the
item number here okay let's hit tab
again and now you can see that the
resulting structure I have a top div
element with ID page assigned another
child div element with class logo a UL
element was ID navigation five lists
items which contains a link element here
with the text link text item and the
number of that item it counts from one
to five so it's very easy to write
complex HTML structures with just one
line of emmett code so the second plugin
I'd like to show you is named advanced
open file so to install that plug-in
let's go back to the settings tab here
and click on menu item install and then
let's type in advanced open file okay
let's hit return and search for that
package okay it's the first hit here
advanced - open -
let's install that package as well with
advanced open file you get a dialog
which makes it very easy to to open and
create new files much more easier than
it is in atom by default okay you can
see now installation has been completed
the plugin is ready okay again let's
switch to the settings view of that
package and here can see if I scroll a
little bit down it gives me an overview
of the activated key bindings and the
most important one is the first one here
it's the Alt key in combination with
command + o and by hitting that key
combination on my keyboard you can see
the following dialog pops up and that is
exactly what the Advanced Open File
package is looks like because in that
dialogue now you have two areas here you
have one input element and the structure
of our project by default the root
folder of my project is selected and you
can see the path is already filled out
here in the input field and the
corresponding content of that folder or
the sub folders and the files are shown
here and now I can do many things here
with a plugin for example if I would
like to open up a file let's say I will
open up again tests in - Emmet I can now
enter that file here and you can see as
I type I already get suggestions with
results matching my input and if I would
like to select from that list I can use
my mouse to go over that file and click
on that file then it's opening up in the
text editor I can also use auto
completion here for example
if I start entering a filename here
let's say I start enter test here and
there's only one match and now I can use
the tab key and it completes the file
name and now I can hit return on my
keyboard and you can see it's opening up
that file ok let's open the dialog again
I can also use that input here to
navigate through my project for example
now I can start typing in one of the
subfolder names here CSS for example and
you can see as I type the the content
view heat below changes so that I always
get the content displayed which is
within that pass and now I can enter
again a file name for example and open
this file ok I can also use this plug-in
or as a package to create new files for
example let's say I'd like to create a
test a mat to HTML hitting return is
opening up that file and you can see at
the moment that this file is opened up
for editing so I can enter something
here and save it and now you can see
it's part of my project structure here
so I can use that file ok so let's take
another look here and there's one more
option as you can see we have plus signs
here right besides of folders and by
using the plus sign I can add that
directory to my Adam project for example
if I hit plus here with mail and now you
can see the mail directory is added on
top level to my project project struck
again okay the next plugin I'd like to
show you is called file icons by default
you can see Adam is already displaying
some file and folder icons here but
those icons are not specific to the
exact type of that file for example and
we are going to change that by again
going to the Settings tab here and then
opening up the install we view again and
searching for file icons hitting return
and then it's the first match here of
founders icons I'm installing it so it
takes a second to download this package
and make it a Weibull here in my Adam
installation okay now as you can see the
installation is ready the package is
installed you can see the difference
here on the left side now every file
type has its own icon you can see here
the Z J's file is displaying a
corresponding icon same for html5 and
Jason and if I open up folders here you
can see the icons are all there and
makes it easier to identify the right
files here in my projects tree view the
next atom package I'd like to show you
is named pigments so let's search for it
again it's the first hit here and let's
install that package as well and see
what this package is about
okay here we are so from the description
of the package you can already see a
package to display Carleton in a project
and found and what Pig mounts actually
does it recognizes hexadecimal colors
and color name names in in files for
example in CSS files and then it's
displaying those color names and color
codes with a background in exact that
color so let's see how this works let me
create within my project a new file so
let's say test
pickmonz dot CSS so within that file
let's say we have a class test and we're
assigning a background here a background
property and as a background property
I'd like to have white so I'm using the
hexadecimal code here okay so there's
one sign too much okay and let's say we
would like to have border bottom as well
and let's use another code here
and I would like that border to be of
three pixels and it should be solid okay
now you can see for those color codes
white here in the first example and in
the second example you can see that
color is displayed as a background and
you are able to immediately recognize
what this code stands for which makes it
very easy to write CSS code use color
codes within your CSS code and see in
your code what does this color will look
like in the browser
okay so let's switch over to the
Settings tab again go to installation
and the last package from my list of my
favorite atom packages is called
mini-map so let's type in that name hit
return for search again and you can see
here is the first result from my list
let's install that package as well so
the minimap package is installed and
here we can read from the descriptions
that mini-map is displaying a preview of
the full source code so the question is
where this preview is displayed and now
if I go to a file for example index.html
from a sample project here which is
containing a lot of code actually you
can see here on the right side this is
the place where the mini-map is shown
and mini-map as you can see here is
showing a preview of my source code of
course you cannot read the source code
but you can see the structure of the
source code and from the structure you
can maybe guess we would like to go to
scroll to and the content which is
displayed here in my actual editor view
is highlighted here was the gray
rectangle
and now I can use the mini-map here not
only forgetting my preview but also for
navigation and scrolling inside my file
so I can take this rectangle here and
move it down and you can see it Scrolls
down and I can see in the mini-map
exactly where I'm in my file and it
makes navigation as especially if you
are dealing with large files as I as I
have an example here in my index.html
file it makes navigation a lot easier
because you can guess from the source
code structure where you would like to
go and then use the mini map to navigate
