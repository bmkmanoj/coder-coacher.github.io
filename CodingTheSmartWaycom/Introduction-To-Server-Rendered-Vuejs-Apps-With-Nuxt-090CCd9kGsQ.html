the smart way and today in this video
tutorial I'd like to introduce you to a
new framework which is called next hand
by using the next framework which is
built on top of view jails we are able
to build server render to UJS
application so UJS is one of the top web
development front and frameworks this
year because it makes developing single
page applications really easy it has a
very steep learning curve and so it's
under the top frameworks and Max is now
built on top and by enabling you to
build a server rendered applications
with view you are able to to really
increase the performance of your
application and how this is achieved and
how you can make use of knucks
is part of the video so let's get
started and see how to install and how
to build your own project by using next
so getting started with a new next
project it's very easy because to
initiate a new project we can use the
view command-line interface and the view
command-line interface is available by
using the View command and if you have
not installed the view CLI yet on your
system you first need to do so and you
can do so by using the node package
manager command NPM and say NPM install
- G - make sure that this installed
globally on your system and then the
package name is view - CLI that is a
command you need to execute in order to
install the view command-line interface
on your system I have already done so so
I don't need to execute this command
right now
can move on now with the initiation of a
new next project by using ligament and
in this case I need to save you you need
to specify that I would like to initiate
a new project and then the template I
need to use is called next slash our
starter and finally I need to specify
what's the name of my project and in
that case is my knocks the tap ok hit
return and now the next starter template
is downloaded automatically and here I'm
asked to choose a project name I leave
it to the default setting to project
description as well the author and ok
now we are done but template has been
downloaded and new project folder with
the name my Knox app has been created
and now here you can see there are the
next steps now we need to take first I
need to change into the newly created
project folder by saying CD my luck's
tap and then it's at that folder I need
to execute one time the npm install
command to make sure that all project
dependencies are downloaded and
installed into the node underscore
modules folder within my project so
let's execute npm install and you can
see it just takes a few seconds to
complete it downloads know every
everything what's needed here and there
of executing the installation afterwards
ok here we are you can say everything
has been downloaded and installed
successfully and now we can run a first
test and startups here Knox development
web server bye
using NPM run bet and hit return and now
you can see it's starting up the server
and here it's saying ok now the
application is a running locally on my
system on port 3000 so we can change to
the browser here and access the
application and you can see this is a
response we are getting back the next
application is running and his is ready
to be extended ok next let's take a
quick look and the Year project
structure which has been created by
initializing our application and I have
already opened up the project folder
here in my my text editor which is Adam
and you can see the product structure as
a tree here on the left side and let's
explore our project structure
step-by-step and you can see we have a
bunch of subfolders included here and if
I open up the first subfolder which is
called assets you can see and that is
very handy here and all those subfolders
a readme and on MD file is placed and if
I click on that file you can see it
gives you a quick hint of what this
folder is used for and here for the
assets folder you can read it here now
this is intended to contain your
uncompelled assets and though this means
you LSE or SAS files or a yellow script
files which you do not want to be
compared by the framework so that's the
assets folder here and we can move on
the components folder I think that
that's
pretty much clear because that's a place
where you can store all your view J's
component funds and it says here is this
directory of course is not required so
if you do not want to use components
here in your project of course you can
delete it and it doesn't need to stay
part of your project structure here you
come here see as well a local W
component is implemented and that's the
component which is used here in the
default locks template to to print out
the logo we saw before okay and then
there is the layouts folder here you can
see again a readme file that folder is
containing it on your application
layouts and layouts on a special concept
of next with the middleware folder you
can place yeah let's say middleware code
which is basically a custom function
which is executed before the pages in
rendering out with browser then we have
the note underscore module folder and
that folder is containing all the
dependencies which have been installed
earlier when executing the npm install
mod so this folder is nothing you you
have to work in when implementing a web
application and we have the pages
subfolder and the pages sub folder
contains your next application views and
routes and what's special about Knox is
that it just scans through that
directory and scans all the dot view
files which are placed inside this
directory and automatically creates
corresponding
and the corresponding parameter
configuration and that is this is very
very handy because this is preventing us
from meeting to create to create the
router configuration of our application
explicitly and we will see how this is
working later on in this video when we
are going to add some pictures to the
application and then we will see how we
can access those pages by automatically
created routes okay so then the plugins
folder is here on the plugins around
directory as containing JavaScript
plug-in files that you just want to run
before new application as it is created
then there is a static folder the static
folder is containing it just static
files of your project and all of those
files are mapped to your default route
from for example you can see it's
containing the faff icon file here then
the last subfolder here is store and the
store directory has intended to contain
implementations of of UX stores so if
you would like to use the view extension
in your project
you can place the store implementation
files right here inside that folder and
by bike writing code in in that folder
here the view extreme work is
automatically activated for your
application ok so if you do not want to
use a view X in your application you can
simply delete that store folder
as you can see here it's not required
and you can delete the dentin it's gone
and you do not need to use it okay so
besides the subfolders here you can find
two configuration files with which are
essential to our project the first one
here is the package dot JSON file you
can see here there are two things here
you can find if you take a look inside
that file you can find all the on
dependencies of our application and yeah
that's basically the list here and we
have installed those dependencies by
using the NPM install command and then
you have the scripts section here where
you find the definition of the scripts
for example if we say NP n R and F the
dev script is activated and executed and
it just called the next command here and
you can also see we have both the script
defined to start the script we will make
use of those scripts later on also the
generate script here in them you will
see what the purpose of those scripts
later on in that video when we are going
to use those scripts okay then there is
another configuration file and that's
the next dot config dot class file and
that file is containing all the
configuration settings which are needed
for our server rendering basically and
you can see it including code for a
default configuration for example it's
containing the the header attributes
which are generated and our
included in the HTML output of our
application here you can see it setting
the title information in the HTML header
section it's using some meat our text
and order a link tag to the point view
the favicon and there are many more
options for a configuration here in that
file and if you would like to have an
overview of configuration of options
here you can go to the website which is
available here it next Jo dark and take
a look here in the guide in the section
configuration where you will find a
detailed configuration of all the
options which are available and which
can be included in the configuration
file ok so as already explained
Nucks is doing our implicit a router
configuration for us and in the next
step I'd like to add two more pages to
our application and I'd like to connect
both pages to two new routes so one page
should be made with Abell if the user is
going to access the home so route as you
can see here and another page should be
made with a bow as a user accesses home
slash about ok so to do so let's go back
to our code editor and open up the page
some directory and now we are start to
add two new files in that directory so
to add those heart of hers need to
create a new subfolder within pages and
I'm naming that subfolder home and
within that empty subfolder now I'm
going to add a file which is so-called
index dot view
and another file with the name about dot
view and as you maybe can imagine the
content of the file index dot view the
component which is implemented here is
executed automatically if the user
accesses the home route and the view
component implemented in about that view
is executed under displayed if the user
accesses home slash about okay so let's
start with the implementation first we
are going to implement index dot view
okay so let's start with implementing
the new components here in index dot
view and in about dot view and I only
want to print out a simple text
information so that the user gets the
feedback which route is accessed and to
do so let me include a default
implementation of a view component I
have a snippet here so it and insert it
well quickly and within the template
code here I now only need one element in
the zoom h1 okay and the text I am going
to point out is this is home okay
so let's take that code here copy it
inverted in about and this done we are
saying this is home slash about okay
let's switch back to the browser and try
to access home and now you can see it's
a Weibull it's printing out the code
which is returned from the component
which has been implemented in home index
dot view and if I'm going to access home
slash about you can see we are getting
the text back from the component which
has been implemented in about mu
as you can see the routing configuration
is active we did not need to include any
configuration code for the for the
router next is just scanning the pages
directory and the structure with
subfolders in that directory and is
making the corresponding routes
available automatically so the next
framework handles all of the UI
rendering of your project and masa can
see here we have already been working
with the on development web server we
have started the development server up
to make our application of Weibull here
on port 3000 on our local machine and in
this case the next framework is already
operating in a server rendered mode
automatically as this simply means that
all the views and pages the user
accesses in the browser are pre rendered
on server-side and delivered have
ready-made HTML files to the client and
this server rendering of course means
that your application is is loading a
lot faster on the client because there
needs to need not to be any rendering
process any interpretation of Yama
script code be executed on the client
side it's all done on server side and
the HTML code is ready to be rendered
out at the browser so in the next step
let's leave the development server mode
and see how we can start up the next
application for use in production ok so
its first stops the development server
here and now we need to to run the npm
run the build script here and this makes
sure that
all the building steps and the
generating of five routes and so on is
happening one time now and if the
process has been executed successfully
and all the resources are there we can
now continue to run the stop script
which is done by NPM run start and that
is starting up the web server now in
production mode and the application is
again hosted on port 3000 and you can
see it here it's available all our
routes are accessible slow home and
about as well okay so beside running
your next application in a server
rendered mode there is another great
option for deploying your next
application and this option is to
generate static HTML files so that you
can deploy your application just to any
static file hosting service you would
like and how to do so let's let me
demonstrate in the following and again
we need to say npm run here and this
time to generate a static HTML file for
our project we need to say or to execute
the generate script
so it's npm run and generate hit return
and you can see the generation process
is going to start here it's again
building our application it takes a
second here to complete
okay here we are and now you can see
it's generating static HTML files if
there are four of what every route in
our application it starts with the
default route it's generating the
index.html file then it's going to the
home and the home slash about route and
generating the static content and now
the static content is available in a
folder which is called dist
so I can change into that folder and
just take a look inside and here you can
see it's containing the static content
it has the index dot HTML file it has a
home directory I can change into that
and this plays the content here as well
and here you can see it's containing the
index dot HTML file for our home route
and now I can change into the about
subfolder here as well and I will find
another index dot HTML file which
contains the static content for the home
slash about route okay so now else is a
static content for our application is
fully generated let's deploy it to a
statting aesthetic file hosting service
and the service I'd like to use in the
following is a Weibull at search dot H
and this service is simply providing a
very simple to use some static web
publishing service for free and which
can be controlled on the command line
and the first thing I need to do is
install the search command line
interface tool and you can see it here
it needs to be done by using NPM install
again and the package which is
containing the search command line
interface is called simply searches ok
back to our command line here and let's
install it
npm install - g2 installed globally on
our system search ok so now it's
downloading the package and the
dependencies here as you can see
installing it on my machine takes a
second to complete ok here we are
installation has been completed
successfully and now I'm able to execute
the search command right within my
disposal in my static file content has
been generated into okay so let's hit
search it's asking me here for my user
account I have already a search account
if you haven't create an account yet you
need to specify your email address
assign a password and so on here at the
command line to create that account
first and then it's asking me for the
project pass where my static content is
Ian and as I have executed search
requisite modest folder it's already
proposing this folder here so we can hit
return and then I need to specify a
subdomain name let's say next test a 1
dot search dot Sh
and as you can see this domain is a
Weibull and it's now uploading my static
content here and here you can see I can
now take this URL go back to my browser
pass in that URL and here can see my
application as a Weibull I can check out
my home routers available and at home
slash about is a Weibull as well and you
can see everything is working as
expected
now the content is not generated on the
it has been generated on my machine
first and then has been outputted static
HTML files and I uploaded those static
content to search and now in what you
can see here is just the plain static
HTML code which is a Weibull okay this
