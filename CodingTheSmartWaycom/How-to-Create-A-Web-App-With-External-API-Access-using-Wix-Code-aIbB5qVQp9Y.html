coding the smart way comm and today in
this new video we are going to take a
look at Wix code which is a new
functionality which has been added
recently to the well-known Wix calm
website builder as you might know
wix.com is a cloud-based website
building platform for people who want to
build their professional web presence
traditionally without coding and now
wix.com has added a new cool feature and
that is called Wix code and that is now
targeting developers as well and if you
now want to use Wix calm to build up
your website and you want to bring in
your own code and want to take full
control of your website and work with
databases dynamic data would like to
create dynamic forms would like to take
control of the website by using the Wix
API or even access third party API to
bring in more dynamic data into the
website you can do whatever you want
because now you can apply your
JavaScript codes and enhance you with
Wix calm website so this is what we are
going to explore in this video so stay
tuned so before getting started let's
take a look at the wix.com website you
can see it here if you would like to
follow along the steps presented in this
video you can sign up for a free account
here and you can try out all the
features of Wix code so getting started
is very easy just sign up and start your
first website and if you want to get an
overview of whit's code you can go to
this URL
it's wix.com slash code slash home and
that is the website giving you a quick
overview of all the features which
counts was Wix code so let's get quickly
through
most important features of wicks code if
I scroll a little bit down you would can
see it here first of all we have the
database collections functionality with
database collections you can set up data
collections and use them to store data
of any kind for example you can store
user data product info and more and you
can choose how and where to use this
data on your website and control who can
add edit and view the data so you have a
dynamic set of data in your website and
you can work with that collection as you
work with a database then we have the
dynamic pages feature which is also
great because with dynamic pages you can
use a single design style for your page
and then create a bunch of pages based
on that design style and each was a
custom URL and unique content and you
have just a dynamic page as a template
and you bring in dynamic data to create
then multiple pages based on that
template okay then we have user input
which enables you to easily create
application forms for example review
sections quizzes and so on and that is
great because you can use forms and user
input elements within that forms to
automatically collect data and then
automatically store the data in a
database collection for example and then
present the data maybe in a dynamic page
you can also use repeating layouts to
display our dynamic data from your
database collection that is just a
single grid or list layout which is
placed inside a page and which is an
retrieving data and then the list is
filled with that collection of dynamic
data first of all we have the year Wix
code API which gives us
to control your website's functionality
you can control the behavior of your
website and you can control the behavior
of single elements on your website so
Wix is offering that API and by using
the Wix code feature you can access at
API and take advantage of it you can
even access external IP eyes we will
also do that in the example we are going
through in in the next step and show you
how you can access a cert party API and
then bring in your data that is another
use case here furthermore you can
integrate custom interactions and make
your website by adding those custom
interactions more engaging and yeah more
with it so the best way to get to know
Wix code is of course to dive into a
real world example and that is exactly
what we are going to do next we will be
building the following website with the
help of Wix code you can see it here
that will be the final result we will
build a website a web application a
cryptocurrency information website where
the user can enter in the input field
here any name of any cryptocurrency for
example its type in Bitcoin like so and
then you can teach the user can click on
the button retrieve information and then
we're accessing in the background by
using our own code we are accessing a
cert paid party API retrieving data
about Bitcoin and then displaying the
data here in our dynamic page so that is
the application we are going to build
and the first step of course is to
create a new empty website in the Wix
calm website builder so let's get
started so if you haven't done so before
you need to first sign up for a free Wix
account of course I'm already locked in
here into my Wix dashboard and to create
a new way
I can simply use the plus icon here from
the top menu which is saying cretin you
will cite so I'm clicking on the plus
icon and it takes me to the question
what kind of website do you want to
create I'm choosing the other option
here and then I'm being asked to choose
how you want to create your website and
I'm deciding for the option create your
website with the Wix editor so I'm
clicking on choose the template
takes me to the next screen and now I'm
choosing blank templates here and
choosing the first option start from
scratch which will just give me a blank
template without any elements are
arranged yet so let's click on edit and
clicking on edit directly takes me to
the Wix website editor so that I can
start creating my website so here we are
Here I am the editor the new blank
website has been created successfully
and the first thing now I can do is
change the background here I would like
to use and I'm choosing the floating
particles background which is part here
of the list of available backgrounds
then I can change the page design as
well and I'm choosing let's say this one
here so that's our basic page design and
now we can start arranging the elements
on our page we'd like to use in our
application so before doing so I'll
let's first enable the Wix code
functionality and to do so just click on
the Tools menu here on top and then
select the option developer tools so
this is the option you need to unable to
make Wix code available to the site and
you should also check both options here
within the developer tools the first
option
the properties panel which is displayed
and you should also check hidden
elements so that you can see all
elements on the page so this is required
to make wicks code away below so the
first element I need on the page is an
input control so that the user can input
the name of the cryptocurrency he would
like to retrieve information for and to
bring him that input control I just
click on the plus button here on the
left side which is saying add okay and
you can see I can choose from various
groups of elements and I'm selecting
user input here and then I do need an
input field so I'm selecting the first
option here and I can simply drag and
drop it to the page and arrange it so
let's say the user should input the name
right here and you can see this input
control gets assigned an ID it's input 1
you can see the ID here in the
properties panel and I'd like to change
that ID so that the element gets an ID
of let's say currency input so later on
we will use that ID to access the
elements value in our code so next I
need a button so on that the user can
click on the button and then access the
external API to retrieve data so let's
again click here on the plus button
again user input and if I scroll a
little bit down you can't see oh no
let's say I would like to have buttons
here and then I'm selecting here is the
first seemed button drag and drop again
and then I can place as a button here
right beside my input element ok let's
change the button text and say
retrieve information okay like so and
you can see this button has assigned the
idea of button one and that is pretty
much okay so we will leave that ID and
later on register an on click event
handler function for that button but
before doing so let's bring in the next
element and that is a text control so
again let's use plus here click on text
and then I'm using just that paragraph
here and drag it to the page and let's
say it should be placed right here and
then I'm assigning the ID of let's say
result because that's the text element
where we would like to place the result
so let's edit the default text here as
well so I'm deleting that default text
and instead I'm using the text retrieve
information to display result okay so as
you can see I've completed the layout
here I have added a few more text
elements to my page so that our layout
and our website is now ready to go and
we can move on to the coding part and
now let's create in the first step a
back-end module where we will be
implementing a service method to access
the external API and then in the second
step use that service method to be
accessed in the front-end code each time
the user clicks on the button retrieve
information and let's start by first
taking a look at the API we would like
to access
so see our external API we will be using
as a free api from
Cornmarket Capcom and you can find an
overview of the various endpoints this
REST API has to offer at Cornmarket
Capcom / API and this takes you to you
on the following website here you can
see that is giving you overview and the
specific endpoint we will be using is
the diversion one endpoint and the tikar
endpoint here and if I click on that you
can see it is returning as a JSON data
structure here and all of the
cryptocurrencies are included with
additional information here in this
adjacent structure oh and to just
retrieve one set so for one
cryptocurrency we can extend this URL
and provided the name of the
cryptocurrency here at the end for
example for Bitcoin and you can see now
this JSON return object is only
containing one object here only for
Bitcoin and that is exactly the way we
will be using the endpoint so that is
our URL here so back in the Wix editor
the next step is that I would like to
add back-end code to my project and the
great thing with Wix code is you don't
need to care of setting up an
infrastructure a server you do not have
to deal with server configuration and so
on you can directly start adding
back-end code and the way you can do so
is by expanding the site structure menu
here on the left side by clicking on the
arrow here and opening up the back end
entry here and you can see at the moment
it's empty and it's saying add a new web
module and by having a new web module we
are adding back-end code to our project
so let's click on that link and you can
see it's proposing a name a module dot
jsoup w and instead of comodo I'm using
the name service module here ok and hit
return you can see the file is created
it's opening up the editor you can see
it here so we have an integrated
development environment here you can see
it's already including some sample
Yahveh script code so we can delete
everything from that file and start from
scratch so let's start coding by
bringing in the first import statement
here and I'm importing an object which
is called fetch so from Wix - fetch and
was fetch we are able to initiate an
HTTP call which is needed to retrieve
data from our external corn market cap
API and the next thing I need to
implement is the back-end service method
I'd like to use and I'm saying export
function and I'm name the method was get
a crypto / currency info and it's taking
one parameter and that's the currency
name like so okay and then inside this
method I'm first building up the UL of
my endpoint so let's say Const ul and
then I'm starting all this URL string
with the first part of my
and point here just without the name
okay adding it here
and then adding the name of the a
cryptocurrency which has been provided
by the user and is handed over to a data
service function as a parameter so I'm
attaching the spring which is available
in currency here okay like so then we
can log it out to the console so that we
can see a result if you would like okay
and then finally let's do the HTTP
request and that is done by returning
the result of the call of the fetch
method here and fetch is taking two
parameters in the first place is
expecting to to get it on the UL
endpoint so I'm passing over URL here
and in the second place is expecting to
receive a configuration object in JSON
format and the configuration property
I'd like to use here is method and I'm
setting method to the value get because
I'd like to initiate an HTTP GET request
here to retrieve information so fetch is
returning a promise so we can use method
chaining here and then connect the call
of the Zen method and I'm using the
response which is returned and I'm
returning the response in JSON format by
calling the JSON method here like so so
now our back-end code is ready and let's
go back to the website by clicking here
on the home page
and bring in the front and code next the
front-end code is executing every time
the user clicks on the button retrieve
information so I need to click on the
button here and then from the properties
panel select the on click event and hit
the plus button here to attach a new
event handler method so clicking on the
plus button you can see it here it's
proposing a method name button one
underscore click that's pretty much a
case so I hit return and you can see
here is the front end code editor is
opening up at the bottom and it's adding
the method button one underscore click
the event handler method here
automatically and as a command it's
already saying at your code for this
event here and this is exactly what we
are going to do next so in order to be
able to access the backend a service
method get' cryptocurrency info we just
implemented in the backend service
module we need to bring in an import
statement here into the front and code
part and the import statement is import
curly braces and we were importing the
get crypto currency info function from
back-end
slash service module like so and now
this method is ready for being used here
in our front-end code now let's call the
get crypto currency info function here
within our click event handler and the
way to do so is to just call it get
crypto
currency info and then passing in as a
parameter because we know the method is
expecting to get the name of the
cryptocurrency
from the user input we need to access
the input control here and the way you
can do that is by using the ID we
earlier set to currency input and we can
select now an element by its ID to using
a syntax which is very similar to what
you maybe already know from jQuery the
only difference here is that we need to
use a dollar sign W object which is a
Weibull here so I'm saying the dollar
sign W and then passing in as an element
selector string here the ID currency in
port like so and then I can say dot
value to select the value which is
currently inside that input element and
which is as a txt the user has provided
okay then we know the this method is
returning a promise so we can then
connect the Zen method to wait for the
promise to be resolved and then it's
executing the method we were passing
here to Zen so I've already prepared the
code so I can pass it in here and we can
see what's happening here so here you
can see it's taking the result and then
on setting was in that method here
setting the text property of the result
element which else is the text element
here to a new text and this new text is
containing multiple lines and ends us
multiple lines it's printing out the
information which is retrieved from the
external API and making a Weibull here
in currency info and as you
see or saw earlier here when we took a
look at the Jason a structure which is
returned we were getting back an array
you can see it here it's containing this
object in brackets so now back here in
the code we need to select the first
element with the index selector here
from the array and then we can access
all the properties from the JSON data
structure like name symbol the price in
US dollars the market capitalization and
changes in percentage terms and then
it's printing those information out in
multiple lines and now we can check the
result by just opening up our website in
preview mode by clicking here on the
preview button so it's opening up at the
website saying you are currently in
preview mode and now we can try the
application out for example I'm now
using another cryptocurrency named
ripple for example like so and then I'm
hitting the button retrieve information
you can see it here it's printing out at
the URL so you can see the name ripple
is attached to the UL endpoint as
expected and here it's printing out the
latest information about ripple so this
