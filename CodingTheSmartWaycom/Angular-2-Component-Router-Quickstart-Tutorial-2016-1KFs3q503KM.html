like to give you a short introduction to
the angular 2 component Ruto the
component rotor is new in angular 2 and
as you might know angular 2 application
consists of a set of components and with
a component Ruta we have the possibility
to connect application specific routes
with components in your application so
for example if the user goes to a
specific URL of your application the
component route one knows which
component arm to execute which component
template to interpret and the resulting
HTML code from the component will be
inserted in your main layout and that's
all what routing is about ok let's take
a look at our project so I have already
prepared a simple angular 2 starter
project and as you can see here we have
our project structure set up we have an
index HTML in the main directory we have
a package.json file a typescript
configuration file and all our angular
components are organized here in the app
folder so if you would like to know how
to set up such a project you can simply
go to angular io home page there is a
link to the five-minute QuickStart
tutorial and in the QuickStart tutorial
you get all the information you need to
set up such a basic project this code is
this this starter project will be also
available on a github repository you
will find the link in the show notes and
if you would like to see how to set up a
project there's also a video available i
will put the link also in the show notes
and that is the structure where we are
going to start to
work with
so to get started with component root
are the first thing we need to do is to
add the component root up a library to
our project because component router is
located in a separate file and not part
of the angular core library so ok let's
open index.html and you can find already
on some script elements here which are
importing all the libraries we need for
a basic setup and in addition we copy
here that um a deadline because it is
pointing to the angular 2 library and
insert it once again and then we change
angular 2 to ruta so we do not need to
install additional and DM packages
because the root of file is already
installed with the angular 2 package but
we need to add set a specific important
statement here one further addition is
needed right piece behind as ehat tech
we need to add ziam base element here
and we say base h f and put in a slash
because we need to specify that route
which is the base root of our
application and all editions do that
based food are interpreted as
application specific routes which are
covered by the router configuration of
component router we are adding in the
next step
okay to add the component ruto
configuration in the next step we need
to open up the main component of our
application and in our case there is
only one component available at the
moment so it's app component es which is
a main component and we open up and to
do the Ruto configuration we need to
import one module and that is called
root config so first of all we need to
add the corresponding import statement
here and we say import root config and
we import root conflict from angular 2
root in that case and after having
imported root config we can add root
config as another class decorator to our
main component grass here and the class
decorator is added by saying ok ed root
config and this decorator is taking an
array of root definition objects so we
put in brackets here to add the array
elements and each root definition
element is an object basically
consisting of at least three properties
and the first property we need to
specify is the past property and the
past property we assign a string here
and the string is giving us that this
part of the URL which should be on yasya
GL extension of our application specific
route and we choose for our first well
let's say we named it route 1 and then
we give all the root configuration
object the name so keep it simple just
say its route 1 and then we need to
assign a component because all what
component routed us is connecting an
application specific URL with an angular
2 component so our component is
specified by bringing in the property
component and assigning the component we
want to display every time the user
accesses that specific route and for the
first case we say let's name the
component first component and another
thing we can do is bring in another
property which is called use as default
and we can put use as default to true
and this means that this route 1 is used
as a default route which is called when
the user accesses a start page of our
application and the browser ok so let's
bring in another route config object
enters this time we specify a path which
is called root 2 and we do one more
thing we bring in a routing parameter
which is called ID we will see that
later on how that works we name that
route in this case a root 2 and we
assign a component and this component is
called a second component and begin it
was a capital letter second component
and of course we do not use the property
use as default this time because we have
already specified that route 1 is a
default route for our application ok so
that is a root configuration and then we
can continue with the next step
okay so now that we have the root config
in place the next step of course is to
implement first component and second
component because here you can see we
have used first component for example he
ran our first root definition object on
the typescript compiler is putting out
an error message cannot find name first
component which is quite clear because
we have not such a component in our
project yet and as the next step is that
we are going to create a first component
and second component so switch to the
console first and what we have to do
here is create two new files and reduce
it by saying touch app the first file
for first component is first comm poland
TS and the second file we need is also
in the app folder of course and this
time its second component TS so ok so
back in our editor we see both files are
there we can open up a first component
yes for example and begin the
implementation so let's implement a very
simple angular 2 component and the first
thing we have to do is import as a
component module of course because it is
the basis for implementing an angular 2
component and we import it
has already seen from angular 2 core and
with a component module available we can
implement our component class so let's
first let's first create that class
let's say export class first component
and the class is just left empty but we
need to add the component and decorator
to our class that the framework knows
that is this is not only a class but
it's a component class okay so add the
decorator object here we assign a
template that we have a specific output
of a first component and we can see it
later on in the browser if the root is
caught and we do that with a very simple
template we just put a headline inside
the template we say first component and
then maybe a little text information
this is a content of first component
okay that's all for now and we can arm
copy so let's first save it and then we
can copy is that a simple component
implementation go to second component
and past all this and then of course we
have to say this time second component
the second component in the headline and
also here and now both is ready okay so
that is all we need to bring our
component implementation in place and
now back in our main component enough
app component TS of course we need to
add
the corresponding import statements
because otherwise in the main component
we will have no access to first and
second component so let's add those
import statements here quickly so import
first component and we import it from
our file and we import of course second
component like so okay so now both
components are in place are imported and
in the next step we can go on
so in the next step we actually need to
do two things as we now have our routing
configuration ready and the components
implemented we now need to add a
navigation menu so that the user can can
use menu links to access both routes and
we have to bring in something called
Ruta outlet and with a root out that we
have see a possibility to define that
area in our main application template
where the component where the router
content is inserted so let's begin with
the implementation of the navigation
menu so we are here in our main
component file and we extend the
template code know a little bit so let's
do this by using some boot strap CSS
classes for applying a nice formatting
and okay first of all we bring in just
the panel and we use a panel default
class here and inside is at panel we
have a section which is using the class
panel heading and inside panel heading
we use a pen or title to bring in a
headline
like so and we assign a headline let's
say routing and navigation here okay and
besides the panel heading we have
another section which is using the
bootstrap class panel body and inside
panel body 3 let's close it we will have
the navigation menu and the menu
navigation menu will be implemented by
using a list item and the list item is
using classes enough and mouth caps so
we will build up a navigation menu
consisting of taps and them as we have
defined two routes in our application we
need to navigation menu items of course
so let's bring in our the first item
it's a list item with the whole
presentation
and the second item okay and inside that
item we need to generate a link which is
pointing to route 1 and we do this by
using the a element and we are using an
angular directive a route directive
which is called route a link so route a
link is used in the way that we assign a
string and the string is containing an
array element basically with which is a
string and the string is the name of our
route definition object we want to point
to so let's see we have named our roots
route 1 and route to as you can see here
and now we are saying okay with a route
a link please generate us a link to the
URL of route one so we say route 1 here
and root telling is doing all the work
so the big advantage is of course we
otherwise we could have bring in the URL
of route one directly but the big
advantage of using Rueter link directive
here is we can change the URL of route
one later on and the link stays stays
intact so so let's close it here and
let's name that link and we can say we
name it was just first component because
it's pointing to first component
actually and then inside as a second
menu element we need to bring in the
link to root 2 and we can do it
basically in the same way just copy that
link and in there
here and let's pointed to root the tube
but we have to remember one more thing
root 2 is using a routing parameter as
you can see here we have defined that
root 2 is taking the ID element as a
routing parameter and to generate a link
which is also containing that routing
parameter we need to pass in an object
here and the object is containing a
property which is named in exactly the
same way as the routing parameter is
named Ord and we can assign a simply 0
value here so let's assign one and then
the directive Rooter link is generating
the appropriate URL to root 2 including
the parameter we have specified as part
as out of our past year okay so now our
menu should be complete until then we
can come to the second thing we have to
add in our template and that is
basically here we have to bring in
another directive and this directive is
called Ruta outlet
so what is the route to outlet for ruta
oh that is just the placeholder and the
placeholder is put here in the template
to you to mark that area in the template
where the resulting HTML code from our
route specific component is inserted so
the root out that element is replaced
and the output is the HTML output is
placed here instead okay so that is
basically our main component template
but as we have used to a Rooter
directives from one is root a link and
the other is routed outlet we do have to
declare as it that the dependencies here
otherwise the template is not going to
work and we do this by bringing in the
directives array here inside our
component decorator and assigning an
array and the array has to contain both
root a link and root outlet but we have
not to bring in two elements instead we
can simply say Rooter directives because
what our directives is containing our
Reuters specific directives angular 2 is
offering so we only need to use one
element here and to have access to
router directors we need to add on the
corresponding input statement on top of
the file and Rueter directives is a
weibull in the angular to a root amp
package and we have already an import
statement here which is important from
angular to ruta and we can add it here
and say ruta
directives okay
okay one last thing needs to be added in
order to make our component rotor
example work and that is that we have to
add the route provider dependency in the
boot TS file so let's switch to boot TS
and first of all we need to import water
providers and we do that by bringing
another following import statement so
import the water providers and we import
it from angular 2 brutal and then we can
declare that when bootstrapping our
application with the app component we
need to bring in the dependency to have
access to Rooter providers and we do
that by passing as a second parameter to
the bootstrap a function an array and
that array is containing the
dependencies and the dependencies we
need in particular as root of providers
so let's say water providers here and
that is all we need to add in boot TS
so as everything is in place now we are
ready to go and we can switch to the
terminal to start up our application
also i'm in the project folder and i can
simply now say npm start and then the
server is starting up and our
application is opened up in the browser
so we can see it here and as you can see
we have everything in place we have a
nice layout and we have 22 menu items
one for accessing first component and
one for accessing second component and
as you can also see first component is
automatically loaded because we have
defined first component as a default
routine component forever our
application so it's directly displayed
here and we can switch the second
component and you can see the content
where we have placed a Rooter outlet is
changed everything else stays in place
so we have the menu here again and we
can switch back to first component and
you can also see that the application
specific route is going to change so
here we have route 1 and if we now click
on second component so a route is
changed we have now root 2 and in
addition we have our routing parameter
is the ID of one and so everything is
working as expected so the last thing
now we can do is to excess this routing
parameter in our second component and to
print out the value not only here in the
URL but also in our template let's say
underneath this line of text and all we
have to do is switch to second component
and import
route params because that is a module we
need to have access to to access routing
parameters and we do that by saying
import route params and it's imported
from angular 2 root oh okay that is all
we need and then inside of our component
class we need to inject it and injecting
route params is very easy we have to
bring in a constructor for our class and
the constructor is taking the route
params object as a parameter
so with this code in place we now can
access route params object and from the
route params object we can call the
method get' and we need to pass the name
of our route parameter to the method
get' and then the method is returning
the value so let's do it and let's say
this ID equals this parents get ID ok
now we have a local variable which is
called ID which is set to the value of
the routing parameter in our case of
value is 1 and now we can print out that
value in our template
okay let's see if this is working let's
switch back to our browser and you can
see it was refreshed and now we have
here an hour second component template
okay it's loading okay now we have here
ID one is printed out we can switch back
to first component of course first
component has no parameters so nothing
is printed out here but in the second
component as we have extended our
template to print out crd parameter is
now containing the information we expect
