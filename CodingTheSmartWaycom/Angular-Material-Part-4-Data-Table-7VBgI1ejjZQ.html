coding the smart way comm in this next
tutorial from the angular material
series will be now focusing on data
tables and yeah just implement another
example making use of angular material
library and you will learn how to apply
data tables in your application how to
make use of data tables and we will go
step by step through the process of
building another application from
scratch so stay tuned so to get started
I've already prepared a new angular 5
project and edited the corresponding
angular material libraries if you would
like to have a tutorial of how to add
angular material to your project you can
follow part 1 of our angular material
series and here this that's the project
that's our our basis where we are going
to start now the implementation part and
the first thing we now need to add here
to the project as a new component
because to integrate the angular
material data tables component into our
application I'd like to use a new
component and I've already opened up the
project here in a visual studio code as
you can see I have opened up the
integrated terminal here and now I can
use angular command line interface to
generate a new component in my
application and the command I'm going to
use here is ng G for generate component
and I'd like to add a new component in
components slash
user table should be the name of the con
opponent and okay let's hit return and
you can see it's adding four new files
here in SRC app components so let's take
a look inside that folder you can see it
here app okay maybe I need to refresh it
here once okay here this app components
you use a table and you will find inside
that new directory our CSS file HTML
file a spec dot TS file NTS file in our
implementation we will only need to edit
the HTML file for the template code and
the TS file for the typescript
implementation of the component class
okay
so another thing which has been added
automatically here in app dot module dot
TS is our new component you can see it
here is a corresponding import statement
has been added without needing to do
that manually and user table component
has also been added to the declarations
of radius so we are ready to make use of
user table component in our application
it's part of the main application module
another thing I'd like to add here at
the beginning else service because for
displaying our at our table later on at
any data of courses at some that's
needed to display several records in our
table and I'd like to retrieve those
data from an external web service so our
best practice here is to establish a new
angular service which is used to request
data from the web service and makes
those data available in our application
so let's quickly generate that service
again I'm using the English Eli here and
Gigi this time I'm generating a service
should be enough the subfolder services
slash user is that's the name of the
service so ok return again and you can
see two files have
edit here is the services folder and we
will later use the file user dot of
service dot TS for implementing the
service class so as I have already
opened up app dot module dot TS I can
bring in some new lines of code here
first of all I need to you at an import
statement here or let's say several
import statements I need to import
something which is called math table
module because that's the module which
is provided by the add angular material
library and which is containing
everything we need to set up a material
data table here in our application and
then of course I need to import the HTTP
client module which is used by ourselves
for requesting data from the web service
later on and that is imported from
angular slash common slash HTTP okay
like so so then of course as I have
imported two new modules here and I
would make use of those modules in my
application I also need to edit those
modules here into the array which is
assigned to you the imports property of
the add ng module decorator here so
let's bring those two modules in so we
have the mat table module and we have
the HTTP client module here ok so
another thing which is missing here of
course we need to bring in our service
so let's add another import statement
here that is user service and
it's imported from our project so it's
Services user slash let's see Services
user dot service unlike soul okay
now having imported user service here it
needs to be added to app module of
course and the place where a services
added is here in the providers array
which is empty at the moment so I needed
to bring it in here user service okay so
next we can continue to implement the
user service class but before doing so
let's first take a look at the web
service I'd like to use and I'd like to
request data from and that's the
following service here um you can see
the result here already in the browser
when typing in this URL
Jason twice holder don't type it
koat.com slash users and this is the
service which is delivering user data as
you can see here with some a lot of
properties it's delivering ten records
and we will use those user records to be
displayed in the angular material data
table and so this is a service URL we
need to copy and then use in our user
service class and retrieve data from
that web service URL you can see it here
it's alright and JSON format so the data
is already in the format we we need to
we need to have for making use of that
data in our application so let's go back
to our
code editor here and open user dot
service dot TS here you can see that's
already the default implementation of
the class and now we are going to extend
user service with the implementation we
do need
so first let's add a few import
statements here first of all I need to
import HTTP client and HTTP client needs
to be imported from the add angular /
comment / HTTP library then I need to
import observable which is provided by
see our XJS library / objects okay like
so then I need to import something which
is not existing yet but what we will be
creating in a minute
user user is containing our data model
and this will be a Weibull in our
project in the models folder in a file
which I will call later on user dot
model dot TS okay so we need a semicolon
here okay like so so first of all here
in the user service class I'm declaring
a property a private property which I
call service URL and that is a spring
which I will set to the URL here from
our service so let's insert that URL
here okay then I need to use dependency
injection and inject the HTTP quad
instance here in the class constructor
by using the private key word here
declaring a member HTTP in that case and
this is of type HTTP client so this is a
way in which we are injecting HTTP
client here in that class and now I do
need exactly one service method here
which is called get user and get user is
returning an object of type observable
and observable is over type there is an
array of user okay and now I need to
bring in the web service request here by
using the HTTP client object so this dot
HTTP and then I would like to initiate
an HTTP GET request so I'm using the get
method here and what I needed to pass
inside of get is as a service URL which
is a Weibull here in this dot service
URL play like so and now to cast it to
the correct type I need to add here the
type user array okay so that's basically
all what we need here inside of our
service class this should be working and
next of course as you see it here it's
underlined in red we need to make sure
that the model implementation for user
is zero okay to do so let's create here
inside of our app folder a new folder
which is called models and inside that
models folder let's create a new file
and the file is called user dot
model dot TS and now I can implement the
user model which is an interface I'm
using export interface user and now I
need to declare what properties should
be part of our model and what's
important here is we do not need all
those properties I just want to select
some of the properties but the name of
the properties I'm using in my user
model class should be matching the name
which is used here in the JSON structure
which is returned by the web service so
the properties I'd like to use our name
let's say email phone here a phone and
the company name okay so let's add those
properties here a first name which is of
type string email string phone or the
string and then company information
which is an object and containing name
which is again string okay okay so next
let's open up the components folder here
was in app and in subfolder user table
open up user table component dot HTML
now we will start to implement the
template which is needed to display on
the data table first of all before doing
so let's first try out if everything is
working correctly so I'm changing here
as a selector in user table that
component dot t-- asked to just use a
table
okay and then I'm opening up app
component of HTML let's remove all the
default content here and just bring in
user table okay you can see it here the
web server is the development web server
is already running so I am able to
switch to my browser and see the result
if I opening up port 4200 and now it's
printing out user table works which is a
proof that the user table component is
working because if I go back you can see
it here in the template it's printing
out user table works okay now we can
delete our bad stuff here and start over
again trust was a leading div tag here
and now I'm starting with an element
from the angular material library which
is a basis of the data table and that is
called mutton - table and I need to bind
the attribute data source here to the
data source which is delivering the data
so this is called data source again we
will implement data source later on in
file user table add component of TS so
for the moment I just I'm just using
here the string data source which is not
defined yet okay now let's add the first
column definition here to our table and
each column definition else beginning
was an mg - container element and we
need to apply the mat column def
directive here and we are assigning a
string here which is containing the name
of that column definition so the first
column definition is getting the name
name
like so and within the ng - container
element we are using a mat - hair - cell
element and now we are applying the mat
head cell death directive and we are
using the asterisk here to say that it
should be handled as an inline template
and what we need to include here is the
the headline of the column and the next
element we do need here announcer the
mat - cell element and for that element
we need to apply the mud cell death
directive and we are assigning a string
of lead user that is defining the user
variable here and we can make use of
user now here in inside of that element
to display the value of a property in
this case it's the name of the current
element so the current element is
available via user and with the
expression syntax here we are reading
out the value of the name property and
inserting that value here in the cell
content so let's copy and pass that ng
container element here and in the latest
second time and quickly change it to you
email and it's user email
okay then we need a dessert time for
phone so I'm assigning phone as a name
phone answer column headline and the
property I'd like to display here is
user dot phone
okay the last column company company and
the valley I'd like to display is
available in user dot company dot name
okay okay now I need to include two more
elements here in math table the next
element is Matt - header - row and here
I'm applying the directive Matt had a
row death and I'm assigning an array
property which I will later on define
which is listing two columns which
should be displayed so the array here is
named this displayed columns okay and
the last element I'm I do need here as
summit row element and I'm assigning the
directive mud Road F and I'm assigning a
string here let grow semicolon columns
and again I'm using here the array which
is listing the columns I'd like to
display let's display the columns okay
so that is the template now we can move
on and add the last part of the
implementation which will go into user
table component but TS so first of all
of course I need to start here with
adding a few import statements
I do need access to user service which
is imported from services user service
okay then I need to have access to serve
them which is imported from the rxjs
library / observable next I need to
import data source from add angular cdk
Corrections ok and finally I need to
import our data model interface user
from the corresponding file in models
use a dot model ok so then before
finishing the implementation here of
user table component class I'm adding a
new class here in that file with export
class user data source which extends
data source of type Annie and this class
is having a constructor the constructor
is receiving one parameter which is the
user service object because the user
data source class will be making the
service request via that service so we
need to pass it in here
and we need to make sure that we are
calling the super method here to call
the parents constructor okay and then we
do need to implement a connect method
here which is returning an observable of
type user array okay so let's say you
returned this dot user service dot to
get user here we are making the service
call and finally we need to implement
the dis connect method here which will
remain empty
okay so then back to on the
implementation of user table component
class first let's use dependency
injection once again here in the
constructor to inject an instance of
user service so like so and then we are
adding two class members here the first
is called datasource because we have
been assigning datasource to the data
source attribute here in our template in
the matter - table element so and data
source is initialized with a new
instance of user data source and we are
passing in the user service object here
claim so and then we need to define the
displayed columns remember we have been
using in our template code and here we
are
signing an array of strings listing the
name of the column definitions which
should be displayed so we have name
that's the first one we have email the
second one phone the third one and the
last one is company okay so okay here we
are
now the implementation is already we can
quickly change to the browser the
development server still running and you
can see the output has been updated
automatically and now we are getting
back all data which is provided by the
web service and we are listing the name
email phone and company information here
in the material data table as expected
