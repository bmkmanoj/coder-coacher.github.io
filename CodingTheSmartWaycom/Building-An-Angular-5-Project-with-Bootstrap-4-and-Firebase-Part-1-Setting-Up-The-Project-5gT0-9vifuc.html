coding the smart way comm and in this
new tutorial we will be building an
application with angular 5 bootstrap
form and firebase integration from
scratch and this is a tutorial series so
with this first part of the series we'll
be starting to create the application
skeleton setting up the angular 5
project installing the libraries and
implementing a basic user interface so
that at the end you can use as an
application skeleton in your own web
projects if you like or just follow the
next part of this series - step by step
enhance this application with further
functionality so stay tuned so okay
before getting started with our
application let's first take a quick
look at the result we are going to build
and that is the application you will see
at the end of this tutorial so as you
can see here as this application is
built with angular 5 was bootstrap 4 and
it has a firebase integration so we have
been making use here of some bootstrap
for elements like a navigation bar here
with a drop-down menu and several items
here in the user interface and you can
see it's just displaying a list of
courses just to get some sample data
into that application and that list of
courses is a data which is needed to to
output that list is retrieved from
firebase from the real time database so
everything you can see here it's coming
from a firebase and displayed here in
our application so if we are going to
change some of those data sets in
firebase
it will be immediately reflected here in
our user interface because it's a
real-time database so it's just showing
the exact same data which is available
in the firebase instance right now okay
so the first step to start this
application is just to initialize a new
angular 5 project and that is a step we
will do first
okay so let's switch over to the command
line and we will be using the angular
CLI the command line interface to
initiate a new angular application
because this is the easiest way of doing
so and to be able to use angular CLI on
your system you first need to make sure
that the add angular slash CLI package
which is an NPM package and thus of
course can be installed by our NPM
command is a Weibull on your system so
if you have not installed an the CLI
before you need to do that first and the
command which is used to install it as
NPM install - G for installing it
globally on your system and then the
package name is angular CLI and we would
of course have the latest version here
so I'm using the add latest tech at the
end of the package name so this is a
command you will be using to install it
on your system as I have already
installed angular CLI on my system I can
skip that step and to prove that the
angular command line interface is a
Weibull I can just type in ng - - help
and see if this command is a wave um you
can see here I'm getting the output all
the options as the angular CLI is
supporting so that is a proof it's a
Weibull here in my system and I can
use it to initiate my new application so
to initiate a new application I will use
the energy command here again and say
and renew for a new project and then I
need to specify the project name I would
like to have here and the project name
is Angie five bootstrap for firebase
okay let's do it in this way and then
I'm using an option - - skip - install
because I would like to skip the
installation step which is normally
taking place automatically here when I'm
initiating a new project and the step is
then automatically installing all the
dependencies but I would like to use
angular five here for our project and at
the time of recording this video and
angular 5 is just in release candidate
state so it's as a final release is not
a Weibull yet so I need to skip the
install here because by default the
project which is initiated here is based
still on angular 4 and I would change
the version to 5 release candidate first
before doing the installation of the NPM
package and that is the reason why I use
- - skip - install here as an option ok
we will see it in a minute
so let's execute this command so here
you can see it's creating a new Energy
5bs 4fb directory here and downloading
the default project template here and
yeah storing everything in that new
directory so now we can change into that
new project folder here and then using
visual studio code as my default code
editor here sir can't
code and open the current directory here
in the code editor you can see it here
and this is my project structure as you
can see and here with in my project
structure I will find the package dot
JSON file and I'm opening up the file
and now we need to make sure that we
change the angular version to version 5
okay you can I sit here I have already
done so so I've changed all the end
angular packages here from the
dependencies section to be at least
version 5 undaunted the euro dot zero
dash R C dot one and those two packages
C at angular compiler - CLI and the add
angular language - service as well and
what you need
although changed here is the version of
the typescript package here and def
dependency section it needs to be word
two point four point one as you can see
here so let's save that file with all
that a changes made I can go back to the
command line now I cleared out here and
then say npm install with in my project
directory now hit return ok and now you
can see it's downloading all the
dependencies and def dependencies from
my package dot JSON file and installing
all those packages into the node
underscore modules folder within my
project directory is that of course
takes a few seconds here to complete
because it's downloading a lot of stuff
so let's wait for the process to
complete
okay here we are as you can see and now
I can try it out by typing in energy
surf to start up the development web
server okay you can see it starting up
it's being a Weibull on port 4200 here
okay compared successfully let's go back
to you the browser view and let's
request a local host port 4200 and you
can see this is a default output of our
angular 5 application so that is proving
that everything has been installed
correctly in this working now and now we
can move on with that application to
bring in the bootstrap library to fire
based libraries and then implement the
user interface with bootstrap elements
and there are the next steps here so
first of all in the next step we would
like to include firebase in our project
and to do so we need to perform two
steps the first step is we need to go to
the firebase website as you can see here
a Weibull at firebase google.com and we
need to log on here create an account to
log on into the firebase back-end -
which is called firebase console and in
the firebase console we need to create a
project we can use and with our
application and then second we need to
install the firebase and the angular
fire to library in our application at
both libraries has additional
dependencies to our project and those
are the prerequisite for when making use
of firebase ok here on the father's
website you can create your account
login with your Google credentials and I
have already created an account here so
I can directly use the link here go to
konso so it takes me directly to the
backend you can see it here it shows me
my projects here here with other link
and project you can create a new project
I have already prepared the project here
firebase demo so I can click on this
existing project and it takes me to the
project's overview here of this project
and now what I need to retrieve from
this project are the configuration
information I need to copy and pass to
my application and the way we can do
that is to click here on the link at
firebase to your web app and if I click
here on this link it takes me to you as
a following pop-up window and here you
can see it gives you the complete script
code which is needed which you can copy
and past in your HTML page and insert it
as the script tag to make sure that your
application can connect to this firebase
project now what do we need to do to get
this information into our angular
project we just need to copy and past
the key value pairs which are inside of
the config object so only this part here
okay so having a copy of the code I can
now here back in my code editor go to
the folder SRC open up the subfolder
environments and within that folder you
will find two files environment dot TS
and environment dot product es we need
to insert the configuration settings in
both files actually so I will start with
environments dot TS
here you can see the environment object
is defined and it has one property
production which was set to false and
now I need to insert a second property
here which I call firebase and this is
an object again and now within and that
firebase object I'm inserting as a key
value pairs I copy it from the firebase
back end so okay now I can copy the
complete firebase object here and then
switch over to environment dot product
ES and do it here in the same way now we
have four boughs for our development
environment and for our production
environment the firebase object
available with all the properties needed
to connect to our firebase project and
to connect with the real-time database
of that firebase project ok so now that
I have the fire base configuration
stored in my project we can move on with
the installation of the firebase and the
angle of fire to library so I'm
switching to the command line again and
both most libraries are a Weibull as an
NPM package so I can use NPM here now
let's say npm install and - - safe for
adding both new packages to the
dependencies section in our package dot
JSON file and then I would like to
install firebase and I'm using the app
assign here to specify the version and I
would like to have at least version 4.4
0.0 and angularfire 2 and here I would
like to have at least one
5.0 0.0 - rc4 release candidate dot -
okay I'm hitting return and now you can
see it's downloading both packages
installing the firebase and angular fire
- library into my note underscore
modules folder within my project
directory okay here we are
everything has been installed and now we
can continue to include the
corresponding modules in our app dot
module dot TS file so I'm opening up the
app dot module dot TS file you can find
it here in the SRC folder in the
subfolder app that's the file I'm
looking for and now first of all I have
to add some import statements here on
top so the first thing I need is the
angular fire module and the angular fire
module is imported from the angular fire
to library and so next one is the
angular fire database module again from
the angular fire to library and finally
I'd like to add an import for although I
see there is an error of course I need
to say angularfire 2 slash database here
ok like so so next one is the angular
fire of module
this one is imported from the angular
fire to library slash pause okay now
having imported those three modules we
need to make sure that all three modules
are additive as the imports array here
within the ng module decorator as well
and let's add first the angular fire
module here and because I'm adding the
angular fire module here to the root a
module of my application I need to call
initialize app and pass in Sofia base
configuration settings we have stored in
our environments object so I'm saying in
vironment dot firebase and in order to
make it work and to get access to the
environment object I need to add another
import statement here of course so I
need to say import environment and then
I'm importing it from the following
location environments environment okay
like so now we have access you can see
the arrow here is gun I can now access a
fire base configuration settings by
using environment don't fire base okay
let's add the angular fire database
module and finally at the angle of
oz module here as well okay and with
these changes made here to about modular
TS we are now ready to make use of the
firebase services here in our
application we can inject as a services
within our components and access the
firebase functionality like the real
time database or like the authentication
functionality which we will see later on
but first of all let's move on with
setting up our project and make sure
that we are adding the bootstrap for
library as well so bootstrap before will
be added to our project by installing
the next NPM package and to do so on
going back to the terminal here again
clearing it out and starting over with
again NPM install - - safe again and
then the package name is of course put
it strap and then I'm using the add next
flag here to indicate that I would like
to get the next version because
bootstrap 4 is at the time of recording
this tutorial is still in beta version
so it's the next the upcoming version
and to indicate that we do not want to
add bootstrap 3 to our project that we
would like to get the next version I use
the add next text here okay
I'm hitting return and it's downloading
bootstrap again it's downloading
bootstrap into my node underscore
modules folder and once the installation
is finished here we can go back to our
code editor here and then we can open up
starts dot CSS here
and that's the place you can read it
here you can add global stars to this
file and also import other stars and
that is exactly what I now want to do
with the bootstrap dot CSS file I'm
saying add import here and then I need
to specify the path to the file I'm
using first of all till the sign here
and then saying boot strap within my
note underscore modules folder slash
dist slash CSS slash bootstrap dot CSS
okay is that all what is needed now the
bootstrap CSS classes are a way per and
can be used within our template mark-up
code okay now that we have included
bootstrap CSS in our project
I'd like to implement a simple bootstrap
based user interface with some elements
of bootstrap for for example I'd like to
include a navigation bar with a few menu
items and so on and a very easy way to
get this needed mark-up code in our
project else to go to the bootstrap
projects website get bootstrap calm and
here click on the link examples and on
the examples page you will find the
section frameworks and you will find a
starter template here which I can click
on and you can see it here is it's a
starter template it's a very basic
template just consisting of content area
here in the navigation bar and that is
very much what we need for our project
what I would like to implement is the
basic UI I would like to start with
so the way we are doing that is I'm
opening up the source code view here for
this website I know I can see that this
is a code making use of various
bootstrap elements and now I can copy
and past of those pieces here from the
code I would like to have in my angular
application and the first thing I would
like to start with is the content a
section which else a Weibull here as
this container div element so selecting
that div here copying it and going back
to my code editor and then opening up
app dot module dot HTML which is a
template code for my for app component
and then I'm removing everything which
is inside okay and then in asserting the
code I copied from the starter template
here okay
let's save it going back to the browser
now you can see okay it's already
displaying the text from the start
template so that's the first step okay
so next I'd like to bring in the MATLAB
code which is needed to display the
navigation bar but before doing so I'd
like to go back to go back to my
terminal and generate a new component
for my project because in that component
I would like to include a markup code
for the navigation bar to keep things
separated and the way I generate a new
component here is by using the angular
command interface again and say ng D
component and the name of that component
should be after
nah okay you can see it here is adding
four files to my project in the folder
SRC / f / app - NAFTA and it's updating
my Epcot module dirty-ass file so that
this new component is included in my
application by default now let's go back
to the code editor and you can see it
here here's a folder here are the four
new files and there's a template code
which is needed for the navigation bar
will be inserted here into AB - navbar
component HTML so I'm removing the
default code here and then going back to
my browser in the source code view and
now I'm selecting is enough element here
copying it and in directing it here okay
next I need to adapt app - enough but
component tortillas just a little bit
because a selector here saying app - AB
- navbar and that is a reason here is
because app is edited as a prefix every
time a new component is generated but
else my component and name is already
starting with app I can delete the first
app here so the selector for my
component is AB - navbar and now I can
make use of that selector and included
my component output in the main template
here at Epcot component of HTML and all
I
to do now is to include the app - left
by element here so now I can check it
back here we can see here is my
navigation bar here is my content area
and you can see now we have one issue
the navigation bar is displayed above my
content and is hiding the headline here
so in the next step we have to bring in
some additional CSS code to correct that
issue here so the CSS code I need to
insert into our application is again a
Weibull here in the starter template and
if you take a look at the source code
view here from the starter template and
you take a look here at as a starter
- template dot CSS file you will notice
that I can click on that file and now I
get the content and that is exactly the
CSS code we are missing so far so just
grab that code here and going back to
the editor and opening up starts dot CSS
again same place as where we imported as
a bootstrap dot a CSS file let's pass in
the CSS code here and then we need to
enter semicolon here as well okay save
that file and now if I check it back in
the browser you can see now the content
area is fully displayed the hands online
is visible again it's centered so the
CSS code is fully working ok if you're
not a closer look at our website here
and you compare with the original
bootstrap starter template you will find
out that is one difference as you can
see here when I click on the drop down
menu
no drop down mmm no drop down menu is
opened and the reason for that is that
we've only included as a bootstrap a CSS
file so far in our project the other
script parts of bootstrap and the
dependencies so the jQuery framework and
the Papa J as framework have not added
to our project and that's the reason why
the drop down menu here is not working
because the drop down menu is relying on
JavaScript functionality as the
bootstrap JavaScript library is making
use of jQuery and is manipulating the
Dom directly for angular applications
this must be avoided so it's not not a
good idea to include those JavaScript
parts here in our application and
establish something which is directly
manipulating the Dom instead we should
give angular the full control of any Dom
manipulations and the solution to this
problem is to use another library here
which is offering bootstrap for angular
directives and the name of that library
is ng bootstrap and you can find it here
on the website ng - bootstrap dot github
I oh I can see it here it's currently
available in beta version and it's
offering the bootstrap 4 components for
angular for example you can take a look
here at the components page here we'll
find a list of all available components
and one component which is a label here
from the list is a drop-down component
and you can see here an example and by
using that component here and apply
that directive here to the elements as
shown we can get the drop down
functionality of that bootstrap element
in our application without the need of
adding the other script parts of the
bootstrap framework and jQuery so to to
add entry bootstrap to our project again
we need to install it first and of
course this is done by again using NPM
so I'm back in the terminal and now the
command are needed to install ng
bootstrap is as follows and npm install
death - safe and the package name here
is at ng - boot strap /ng - bootstrap
okay so it's downloading this package
installing it into the node modules
folder okay here we are
now I'm going back to my code editor on
the first thing I need now to do here is
to open up app dot module dot TS and I
need an out yet another import statement
here because I need to import the MGB
module which is comprising the ng
bootstrap components so let's add it
here and VB
module and we are importing it from the
package @anjghie - bootstrap /ng -
bootstrap ok and now we need to edit
here - the imports array as well and we
are adding it in the following way
NGB module and then we need to call the
method for a route because we are adding
it here on on the root level of our
application ok like so so now we can
make use of the components of anti
bootstrap so let's go to app - navbar
component dot HTML where our template
code for the navigation bar is in so
first let me delete the link item and
the disabled item would do not need
those menu items here so this is the
section where the drop down is outputted
and we are going to change is a section
now so that we are making use of three
directives NGB drop down NGB drop down
total and NGB drop down menu so let's
add those directives first of all here
on the top level element the li element
we are adding the directive NGB drop
down okay next here on the H element
which is the toggle control for our drop
down menu I'm taking out the H ref here
because it should not be a link and I'm
removing those properties here as well
we do not need those properties we do
not need
data toggle here so just the class
property and the ID property and now I'm
adding the MGB drop-down toggle okay
like so tako directive here and I'm
renaming it to let's say we would like
to select a Z category here from the
drop-down menu so and for the div
element here which is containing the
links for the drop-down menu I'm now
adding as a directive MGB drop down menu
and at the same time I'm going to change
the menu items here first one is angular
second one is react maybe and last one
is view J else okay let's save it check
it back here in the browser you can see
the menu has changed and now you can see
I can click on the category menu item
and the drop down menu is opening up and
here from the root down menu I can
select the items so the last thing we
need to do here in our application to
complete our angular 5 bootstrap for and
firebase application a skeleton
I'd like to retrieve and display some
sample data from the firebase real time
database just to show and prove that the
fibroids connection is working and that
we are able to interact with the
database and if I switch back here to
the firebase back-end there's a database
of you you can see here on the data tab
I've already prepared here under the
courses path
some sample data here you can see it
here I have four online console records
Weibull here each record consists of
three properties we have the cost
description here we have the title
information and we have the URL of the d
online course and that is a data which I
would like now to retrieve in my
application and then print out in the
browser so for that purpose I'm adding a
new component to my application again
the command for adding a new component
is mg g component and then i need to
specify the name of my new component and
in that case i'd like to add a component
which is outputting is a list of online
courses so I'm choosing the name causes
- list here for the component ok
component is weibo now let's go to my
code editor again you can see here I can
find a new directory causes - list and
let's start with the implementation of
the typescript files so causes - - the
list dot component dot TS here I first
need to add - - more import statements
because I'd like to access the firebase
real-time database I now need to import
angular fire database here from angular
fire - slash database clean and then I
need to import op servable
from the rxjs library /op servable
because when we are requesting data from
the return database we are getting taken
observables so we need to import
observable here so that we can work with
it ok so let's change as a selector
property here let's get rid of the
leading app - ok and then within the
class implementation of causes list
component
first of all let's inject into the
constructor here the angularfire
database service and this is done by
defining a private constructor parameter
here so private DB of type in Euler fire
database so now I have the DB class
property away below so that I can work
with that service to request data from
the firebase database and within the
entry on init method here and now I'm
using that service to request data first
of all I need another class member here
which I call causes up servable and this
should be of type of server ball which
is of type any array okay and then I'm
implementing a helper method here which
is called get courses and is taking a
database pass to the list data and is
returning of servable of type any array
and so let's return it this DB so I'm
making use of the firebase service here
and then using the service method list
and list is expecting to get the
database pass which is a which is a
Weibull here in list pass and then I
need to retrieve the observable here
which I can do by calling the method
value changes okay and here in ng on and
I can make sure that during
initialization of my component the
acrosses observable class member is set
to the observable and getting back when
calling is it get process method here
and the past I'd like to request data
from is closest in my database as shown
before okay so next let's implement the
template of our courses list component
and here in the template file I'm
starting was an unordered list element
and within that element
I do need a div element here and within
that div element I'm using the ng for
directive to iterate over the list of
courses I'm getting back from the
database and the elements which are
placed inside the div element repeated
for every single course so let's say
here in the string which I need to
assign to ng fall that course of courses
of servable so this is a class member we
defined back in our class implementation
which is containing the containing the
observable
retrieving the list of courses from the
database and every time we now would
like to make use of courses observable
here in our template we need to apply
the assumed type here okay
so within that diff section we are using
another ng bootstrap component which is
called ng be - alert to print out one
single course okay so let's assign type
the type attribute which is set to the
value info and I'm using this there's a
bow attribute here as well and set it to
false so that the complete ng be alert a
section is not dismissible okay and now
I need to print out the course
information here those start in version
h3 and this should contain the course
title which is a Weibull and course
title and need to put in a curly in
double curly braces because that is the
expression of syntax so by using that
syntax I can embed an expression here in
the template and the value of that
expression is then inserted into the
resulting HTML output okay so I would
also like to printer this headline out
as a link some users is a element here
and setting H ref okay and let's copy it
here and insert it here in the link and
the link should point to course study
where he
okay like so and below I'm using a
paragraph element so a P and the
paragraph should contain cause dot
description and finally using another
div element here to include a button so
another element here H ref pointing to
course URL again the target of that link
is a new tab so it's underscore blank
and class SPT n + PT and danger to
display this pattern in red color okay
and the label should be go to course
okay so finally I need to embed the
output which is generated by my courses
list component in my main application
component and the template is a wave of
an app dot component dot HTML so right
here in the diff section with a class
started - template I'm embedding another
h3 first which is containing the
headline course list and then I'm
including the element causes list okay
like so okay now I can check it in the
browser you can see it here it's already
containing the output cause list but
obviously I made a mistake because the
list of causes is missing so back in my
coat hydrating over courses observable
