Wacom and today in this new video
tutorial I'd like to introduce you to a
front-end JavaScript framework which is
called react and react was invented by
Facebook and now is used for many big
websites and is likely to gain more
traction in the near future so it's one
of the top frameworks in 2017 and in
this tutorial I will show you how to get
started with react development very
easily okay so the react website can be
found at Facebook github dot is less
react and here you can find basic
information about the framework you can
take the tutorial here but however if
you are new to react and maybe you have
already heard about a react and you will
quickly realize that react is easy to
learn especially if you are already
familiar with the other component
component oriented in front and
frameworks like our angular or a view
Jas
but however one of the biggest obstacles
to get going with react quickly is to
deal with the make very complex tooling
an ecosystem so basically to set up your
development environment and to get ready
for coding and that's a task though
which is maybe not so easy with react
because you have so many options and
choosing from the various viewing
options and packages is an overwhelming
task especially if you are new to react
and are a beginner in fact trying to set
up the right start a boilerplate
application for react can hinder you to
get going with the framework fast and
this is a problem I would like to
address here with that video because I
would I would like to show you away how
to get going fast without the need of
dealing with a calm
configuration first okay in this
tutorial we will be building a complete
real word react web application from
scratch so you will be guided through
all the steps which are needed to set up
the application and I will show you what
we are going to build in a minute but
first let's talk about how we solve the
problem of setting up a react the
development environment easily and
without any configuration needed and the
solution here is we are using a tool
which is called create - react - app you
can find it here again on github lets
github.com select facebook incubator
slash create - react - app and that num
the command-line tool which has been
developed by Facebook in 2017 and is now
very popular and there it's basically a
react starter kit which has zero
configuration involved so you do not
need to deal with any configuration
files you can simply install that
command-line tool and use it to initiate
your project and then start the
development web server and everything is
running and you can dive directly into
the coding part of your project okay so
let's see how that works
the first thing we need to do is to
install create a react app globally on
our own system so that we can make use
of the command and use that command to
initiate our project so I'm switching
over to the command line
and the easiest way to install create a
react app is to install it by using a
package manager and in my case I'm using
yarn which it is a package manager which
is built on top of the node package
manager and km you can also use node
bottom yarn
from our perspective is the best option
here because it has some advantages over
note and to install create react app you
can use the command in the following way
you need to say yarn global to install
it globally on your system then use the
add command here and then we need to
give of the name of the package here and
that in our case great - react - app ok
hit return and you can see it's
installing the package and now a new
command is available here and that
command is great - react - app and we
can use it to set up our new project
here and the following way great - react
- app and then we need to specify the
name of the project and we would like to
create a simple to-do application here
so I'm naming the project react to do
one okay so here you can see it's
creating a new directory here it's
installing all the packages which are
needed and it takes a moment to complete
the process here ok here we are
the project has been set up successfully
and now we can change into that new
crate directory which is called with to
do a once and then suddenly type yarn
start here to start up the development
web server and open the default
application here in the browser
and you can see it's loading and it's
hosting the application on localhost
port 3000 by default and it's saying
welcome to react to get started edit
after Trias and save to reload and now
we are ready to go we have the react
project set up and
as you can see we do not need to edit
any configuration we have only installed
great react app enter great react app
has done all the stuff for us there is
no need to executing more manual steps
here to setup the project and now we can
take a look at the project structure so
to take a look at the project structure
I'm back here at the command line and
now I'm stopping on the web server and
then I can open up my code editor Tatom
like so and it's opening that and here
you can see that the project structure
three folders included we have the note
underscore modules folder which contains
all the third-party packages all the
dependencies here in the project which
have been installed automatically you
can see here the package.json file which
is all wasting on the dependencies here
ok let's close it then we have the
public folder on the public folder is
containing the static assets of your
project by default you will find the
index dot HTML file here in that folder
until you can see that sir basically the
starting point because here in the body
section a disk
element is defined with which gets an ID
assigned which is set to string a root
and that is a place where later on the
react application will be placed into
all the DOM and then finally we have the
source folder here is it's basically the
place where our react application with
and the file index dot J as in here you
can see it it's called the react Dom
render function and it's getting two
parameters here the first is our route
component which is at component it's
implemented here in fjs and the second
parameter is here on the HTML element
which should be used for inserting of
the react every application so in our
case that the element with the ID route
okay and then you can see here else is
the FKS found that's the implementation
of our app component and let's see okay
that's basically what you need to know
and later on when we are diving into the
implementation part and start developing
our sample application you will get to
know the various parts of react enter
how to create your own component and how
to combine components to build up our
application so the next thing I'd like
to do is to take a look at the final
result of the sample application so you
can see what we are going to build in
this tutorial in the next steps so the
application we are going to build in
this tutorial as you can see here is
consisting of one page and the page is
divided basically into two sections here
on topical we have an import form where
the user can enter new to do items and
here at the bottom we have a list of
existing two views which displayed here
on that list and each two has a delete
button
so if I for example click on red button
but to do is delete it from the list and
then I can use all that form here to
enter and you to do my new to do this is
my to do and them set the priority here
to high maybe and then hit the button
had to do and you can see it sir
displayed here in the list of reduce so
very simple application and that is what
we are going to build in the next steps
so back here in my code editor let's
start the implementation in F dot jf by
adding a data model to our application
and the following code is needed to
define an array here on the top level
and I simply call by the right to do OK
enter define here the array of
consisting of some sample data and I
would like to define three sample to-do
items and each to do adding consists of
a property which is going to do title
let's assign here a string maybe my
first to do okay like so and another
property which is going to do
responsible to put a name inside of here
and the next property is to do
description my first to do description
and finally let's use a property which
is called to do priority and set it to
low here okay so that's the first um
to-do item here in my array let's define
two more
so let's copy that block here one two
okay so I need to change the title of
course the description as well and maybe
I'm using another priority here let's
say it's medium and for the third item
as well my shirt to do and priority is
high in that case okay so now the next
step which I need to complete here is to
add the two gives array which is defined
here with our three example our two
deuce to assign it to the internal
components data so in react every
component has an internal component
state which contains the data which is
used by that component and the state
Ilse is an object which can be modified
by explicitly setting the state and
component and you can modify it you can
delete all things from the state and
update it of course and the first thing
to make the deduce irate a Weibull in
the internal component state of our app
component is to set the initial State in
the constructor so I need to introduce a
constructor here in the app class and
there I'm using the keyword constructor
of course and it gets a parameter which
is called props and as a general rule
you should make sure that all this props
parameter is part two to the parent
constructor which is done by calling
super and then passing in props and then
next we can access all the state object
by
this don't state and then unable to
assign an initial state for the add
component and I would like to put to use
the deduce array here in in the state
and I can do it by saying okay let's
name the state property to do as well
and assign the deduce array here a
shorter form of writing this is just
saying to deuce and that is what I need
to do and then we have a new property
this dot state dot abuse and this
property gives us access to the three
sample elements okay so now then we have
set our initial component state of AB
component and the deduced array is a
Weibull here in the state object we can
continue our implementation and the next
step is to adapt at the output of the
HTML output this component is is
generating to change it so that our list
of the dues is is rendered out so the
first thing I need to do here is remove
the RJ is Xcode which is embedded here
in the return statement which is placed
in the render method completely because
we would like to use different HTML code
to print it out and the term J as X is
used here because it J is JSX of
something special here in a reactor by
using this intention you come put or use
HTML elements in your JavaScript code
directly without the need of embedding
those own template code elements in a
string for example and furthermore you
can use zone this J has Xcode too
although bring in expressions and so you
can access for example state properties
and then wrapping those on state
properties in curly braces and so you
can include the values in your template
code directly and when the template code
gets rendered those expressions are
evaluated and when the value is inserted
into the resulting HTML code and there
okay so let's begin here with an empty a
return of statement and then add the
code the HTML code which is needed to
print out our list and maybe you already
saw that we are using bootstrap CSS
classes for printing out the elements in
on the sample application and to be able
to use bootstrap oh of course
bootstrap needs to be included here on
the project and I've already done so
here in index.html which is located in
the public folder I have placed on
already a link element here which points
to of the bootstrap dot min dot CSS file
and the location you can see is a
content delivery network has also done
so for including via jquery javascript
file and as well the bootstrap yoga
script file all from content delivery
networks so the advantage here is we do
not have to download those files first
into our project structure it's not
needed we can directly place on the
corresponding link and script elements
here in index dot HTML and the bootstrap
framework and all the bootstrap
functionality and the CSS classes of
course becomes a Weibull to our project
and can be used inside our template J's
Xcode
okay let's start by adding at first a
div element here and the dis element
gets assigned the bootstrap CSS class of
container and to do so you do not need
to use on the class attribute here on in
order to use a class attribute here in
react and in with J of X part you need
to use class name instead that's
important here and then we can assign
the container CSS class here okay and
inside the div element let's use a non
h4 element the first thing now I want to
print out is the number of to-do items
here in my array in there let's say to
do count and then use some spawn element
here and again use a class name of batch
to print out in a batch as we saw in the
demonstration of the sample application
earlier and now I can bring in the
expression syntax here by using a curly
braces and then places dot State started
to do that right here a Weibull and the
state object and then the number is a
Weibull in a property which is called
length okay like so okay so let's check
if everything is working as expected and
the number of to-do items is printed out
I'm switching back to the terminal here
and resent starting up our development a
web server once again and you can see
the application is automatically loaded
in the browser again
and now you can see that the output we
are expecting to get here to do count
and it's displaying in the batch here of
three which is a number of our to-do
items in order to this array okay okay
now let's continue the implementation
here because only printing out the
number of our to-do items it's not
sufficient we would also like to print
out the to-do items with all the
information a to-do item is offering and
let's adhere within that container div
element let's start to head an unordered
list item which is ul and the class name
I would like to use here is listed -
group ok and within that unordered list
I'm now printing out all the two items
step by step and to add rate over that
array we can use the following
expression here so again it is this not
state don't reduce and then I'm calling
a method which is called map and I'm
passing over to map an error function
which gets two parameter sets the two
element is the current to do element and
the index recurrent index and then I'm
signing an error function here okay and
then for every element the following
code now is inserted into on the final
HTML output
I would like to print out each element
by using on li element with a class of
list - group on - item
okay and key which is assigned the value
of index okay like so and now I would
like to bring in on the content term
so basically printing out the title of
the deal the description of the
responsible person and the priority so
let's start with printing out the title
information and I would like to use
nature for again here for printing out
the title gets class assigned of list
- group - item - heading okay like so
and we can access the to do title
information by now using the parameter
to do here because it is a current grant
to do object we are out writing over and
then using again curly braces to embed
on an expression here and then say to do
dot to do title it's a property we are
looking for okay so let's save it and
you can see by saving the file here on
the output and the browser is
automatically reloaded and updated and
now you can see we are already getting a
list with some titles my first to do my
second to do my sir to do printed out
here and now we can move forward and add
on the further information for each
to-do item okay so next let's print out
on the priority information right beside
the title on the right side as the label
and the way we can do it here is to use
some small element here inside of the H
forum and then within the asset a small
element here again a spawn which gets
assigned a class of label and
you some maybe label - info okay and
then inside that span element again
curly braces and and now we would like
to access to do to do priority okay
let's save it and you can see the
browser output is again updated and now
including the information of the
priority for each to do as a label here
as expected
okay let's add further information here
so next is of the responsible of that to
do and I'm using a paragraph element
here in again a spawn and the class here
it is classical okay and because I would
like to have a little user icon bracket
on the user information I'm using a
glyphicon - user here okay and then
include another expression this time to
do dot to do responsible okay you can
see it here next let's add another
paragraph and what's missing over to do
description just include it as an
expression here to do to do description
okay like so now we have the description
here and there finally um let's um
include a delete button so that the user
can press a delete button to delete one
item here from that list and we do it by
adding a button element and assigning a
class of BTN BTN - danger to render it
out in a red color and I'd like to have
a turn I'd like to have a small button
so amusing began Tosh - Tess um okay so
here is the button without any anything
printed on the button so we need to add
a base now let's use another icon here
so I'm using a span element again class
name is political and I would like to UM
have the glyphicon - trash icon okay and
then print the lid on work button okay
so here you can see now the button is
complete and the list output is complete
of course the button has no
functionality edges so you can see here
you can click on the buttons and nothing
is happening so the next step is now to
add a click event handler for that
button so adding our the click event
handler to the button um is done by
adding another attribute here and the
attribute we need is called on quick and
we're assigning here on the following
expression this and then we call the
method which
should handle that event handle remove
to do we do need of course to implement
that method here in that class that is
our next step
first we'll need to call bind here
because we would like to make the
current this context a Weibull so we
need to bind to an teasers and we would
like to make index available and parse
it into that method as a parameter so I
can pass it into the bind function here
as well ok let's save it again and then
now we need to implement them handle
remove to do here in other component
class so let's say handle remove to do
index if parameter we're expecting to
get and now I'm using this dot a set
state um to modify the state because I
do want to remove the to-do item the
current to-do item from that reduce
array which is part of its state of the
component and to do that here I can pass
in a new value basically for the today's
property here in the state and this new
value of course is again an array of
to-do items but with one to-do item
removed and to do that I'm calling this
dot state got to do set the current
array and then I'm executing the filter
method here and I'm passing in a filter
function which takes two parameters and
the filter function is returning a new
array which is filtered and you'll need
to apply a filter here so I say return V
which is the current index here
does not equal index and there if that
expression is true the element is
returned and added to the new array
which is returned by the filter function
if that expression is not met and is
false the current element the current
array element is not returned and will
not be part of the new array so those
are the filter function here okay let's
close it here with the semicolon save it
okay and you can see the output here is
back again and now I can try it out
let's maybe remove your my cert to do
click on delete and you can see the
handle removed to do method is invoked
and and the element is removed from
internal state and from the result which
is displayed here in the browser as well
so in the next step
I'd like to end on the input form to our
application so that the user is able to
use that form and add new to-do items to
that list here and to implement that
foreign I'm going to introduce a new
component because I'd like to show you
how you can combine multiple components
in your react application because it
makes sense if you have clearly
separated part of your application like
we have it here the first part of the
list of students and servant is on the
input form displayed it up in components
that's the way in which react tails are
designed and we are calling that new
component to be input and I'm
implementing that component here right
hand side F dot IJ s you can also do it
in a separate file but to keep saying
simple four-four the beginning gear
unless I use of the same file here and
I'm starting by again using the class
keyword and I'm going to do input and it
extends from component which is the
react class and then we are in need of
having a constructor here again so it's
the same it gets props passed in and
then we need to make sure that perhaps
is handed over to you the parent
constructor and then I'm setting the
initial state of that new component here
and the state properties I would like to
use here are the properties for a one to
do element so it's to do title initially
empty to do responsible empty string
here to do description empty string as
well and to do
priority initially offset to reversed
okay
okay so now let's add the template code
which is needed here again a render
method is introduced and then we are
using the return statement and return on
beyond JSX template code starting with a
simple this element here and then adding
first the headline maybe h4 which
displays the text add new to do like so
and then we need a form element and we
are sign a class of form horizontal and
we define an event handler for the
submit event which is done by using the
on submit the aggregate and assigning
this dot handle submit so we need to
implement that method later of course
so first close to this form element here
okay okay so as you can see I made a
mistake here and need to close the
construct constructor function of course
so and then move it here okay so now the
error message is gone so now let's add
the input elements here in the form
element and we start on by again using
this element and assigning a class of
form -
group like so okay and then we need a
label on HTML 4 and the label should be
for the input element which is named
input to do title and it gets class
assigned call - LM - - and control label
okay that's our label and next we need
to arm the input element which is
embedded in another disk with a class of
call SM 10 and then its input the name
is to do title the type is text here the
class name is form - control the ID is
input to do title and corresponds to the
string which arm has been assigned here
to use the HTML for attribute of the
label element okay and then we are using
value attribute and bind the value to
you on the state property off to do
title
so is this state to do title okay and we
are defining an event handler for the
change event time as well
let's this handle input change will be
implemented later and let's say add a
placeholder here to make it complete and
the placeholder text is just title ok
like so ok as you can see here we get
back another error message saying here
on here on line 91 something is wrong
end of one way we are missing the equal
sign here so let's edit and that's the
advantage of having it aside by society
you can see our direct error messages
and correct those errors and we our
source code and the you can see I am
adding the equal sign here and the error
message is gone so now everything is
correct
so the point as you can see is not yet
complete but you can see there is no
output of the first of form input
element yet available here in the
browser so the reason of course is we
started out with a new component to do
input and that component is not used so
our two to make the first part of the
form visible here in the output we do
need to embed them but to do input
component in the template code of add
component and just all your scrolling a
little bit up and it's easy to do that
by just bringing the element with the
name of the component in here and it's
called to do input like so and maybe
just a separator here so let's save it
and you can see our the form with the
one and only input element defined so
far is displayed here
and you can see the title element is
already a Weibull of course a form is
not working right now we first need to
add on further input elements for
responsible description and priority and
then implement the corresponding event
handlers but now we can return back here
to do - to do input component and
continue writing on the template code so
next and let's copy that form group this
block here and insert it a second time
because now we need the input element
for Alberta to responsible property okay
like so so let's changed here it's now
input to do responsible responsible here
as well
okay the expression which is assigned
here to the value property as this dot
state dot to do responsible of course
and the event handler which is connected
to the change event and input change
will stay at the same because when we
are implementing annually input change
later on we will implement it in a
generic way so that it can be used as an
event handler for all of our form input
elements and we do not implement there a
second and third event handler okay so
we want to save it okay there is one
syntax error as you can see and I need
to include another closing this element
here so okay let's move it in okay here
we are
that's our form consisting of two input
elements to do title and responsible and
we can change the placeholder here for a
second text input element as well from
title to responsible so that it's
displayed correctly as you can see here
okay so now let's complete the form
implementation here I've already
prepared on the code so that we can move
on a little bit faster so let me quickly
pass in on the code as you can see here
what's needed is two more or let's say
of three more form groups one form group
this time was a text area element to
include an input field which three rows
or where the user can type in additional
description for that to do element it's
bound to you
this state to do description as you can
see here and the next element here for
priority or using a select element to
present a drop-down list here as you can
see here with the value set it's a
starting with value lowest and it goes
up to highest so that the user can
select from that list here and it's
bound to all this state to do priority
of course and finally in the last form a
group of section here a botanist
included of type submit to and submit to
the form and yeah clicking on that
button is triggering the submit event of
the form and we've already defined here
that we are connecting the submit event
to the handle submit method which needs
to be implemented now to define the
behavior of the form when the user
clicks on add to do button okay if I now
try to enter something here in that form
for example here in the title field you
can see typing in is showing nothing so
the value of this field is not going to
change if I start typing and the reason
for that behavior is because we bound
the value to a state property as you can
see here it's bound to this dot state
dot to do title and the state was
initially set here to do title to an
empty string and that is what is shown
here and entering is not possible
because it's always always displaying
the current value of the corresponding
state property and to make it possible
that the user can type in something here
and change not only the value of the
input field but also the state the value
which is bound here to that field
we need to implement now the handle
input change event handler which
responds if I'm starting to type
something and the change event is
triggered and what we need to do here is
to implement it in such a way that
handle input change text the value I'm
entering and updates of the state
property accordingly and then the value
which is displayed here in the input
field is displayed in correspondence to
the state and in correspond to what I'm
typing okay
sometimes at the method handles input
change here to the module input class
and we expect to get an event parameter
here and the first thing we need to do
is to retrieve the target of the event
and that is the way Bolin by using event
dot target next on the value of the
target label and target dot value and
finally the name of the target target
dot name and with that information label
we can update the state which is done by
are calling this starter set state and
use the name here as the name of the
property we would like to update so we
can use an input change for all the
input elements in our form and use vary
here to update that property okay like
so and the last thing we need to do is
to make sure that we have Excel
- to the this object from the class here
and to get excess we need to bind this
method to Humber this context and this
is done by adding the following line of
code to the constructor this dot handle
import change equals this dot hand will
import change and then we are calling
bind and passing in this okay
so let's save it and now okay now you
can see if I try it out again I can
enter text information here in the form
and change the priority of earlier as
well by selecting from the drop down our
value set and of course if I now hit add
to do but to do is not add it to the
list as you cannot see here because the
last thing we now need to do is to
implement the submit event handler
function handler submit
okay so let's edit here and we'll submit
and again it gets one parameter that's
event and then the first thing we need
to call here is event pre than default
but needed to prevent the default or
submitted behavior of any HTML form
which reads for example to pate recur
will be fresh and this is something we
do not meet here because we would like
to handle the submit event in another
way so we prevent the default behavior
here and then we are
saying this dot props props is an object
here of the component class which gives
us access to all the properties and we
will now work with one property which we
will call on get to do and that's the
function we invoke it here and pass in
as a parameter the current internal
state object which is comprising all the
values from our input form okay so and
the last thing we need
of course to do is to set it across that
state again to initialize all the state
properties after the on had to do a
vendor has been emitted and we do that
by passing the following object here to
do title again empty string and the same
applies to to be responsible to do
description as well enter to do priority
is set to lowest okay now to be able to
access this dot props and this a dot a
setter state we again need to bind all
this and this is done here in the
constructor
this time it's for handler submit it's
done in the same way like we did it
before with handle input change
don't bind this okay like so and it's
basically all what we need here in to do
input component and now to make sure
that when this event on add to do this
invoked that we connect to that event in
our app component because app component
is managing the deduce array in its
internal state and then it's using the
to do input component as part as as part
as the template and we need to add now
that property on it to do connect on
that event with an event handler method
in app component and then make sure that
within that handler method we're
updating the state the to do property in
the state with a new array which is
extended by one element and that's the
to do the new to-do item which is passed
here into on head to you okay
okay so let's scroll up here to the
implementation of app component and
let's see to do input on is included
here in the template j6 code and the
first thing now we need to do here is to
add property on add to do and assign the
following expression this dot handle add
to do that's the method to that's the
event handler method and now we can end
at handle at to do here to our class
implementation okay it gets the
parameter of to do and then we can
update the state with a new array which
is a sign
reduce property of that state so it's
again of this set state and then it to
deuce and the new array is built up of
from the old array this can be done with
the spread operator here this dot state
- deuce
and in addition we add the new to do
element here so that's the new array
okay and then we need not to forget to
bind handle edge to do to you the
context of this as we've done here in
this constructor like we saw it before
this handle add to do equals this and
we'll add to do don't bind this okay
save it and now we can try it out so
let's see what we are typing in here
let's add a to deal with your title of
mine you to do item my description put
it to medium and say add to do and here
you can see it appears immediately here
in my list of today's that's menu item
and I can hit delete of course and then
it's gone again so that's basically the
final sample application everything
working as expected
and as showed in the beginning this was
about sent from coding this mod wacom
thank you very much for watching I hope
that you enjoyed this video tutorial and
that you have now
a basic understanding of react and might
have gained an impression that getting
started with react is not so complicated
complicated as you might have thought if
you are using the right tools for
example create a react app it's very
straightforward and easy process of
setting up your development environment
and setting up an initial project
structure so that you can fully
concentrate on implementing your react
application and you do not have to deal
with endless configuration files and so
on so thanks again for watching and see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
