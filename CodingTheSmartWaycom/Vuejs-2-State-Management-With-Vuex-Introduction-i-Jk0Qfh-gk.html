smart Wacom and in this new video I
would like to give you a short
introduction to the topic of centralized
state management for your view jas
application and centralized state
management in view is done by another
library which is called view X and in
this video I'm going to show you how to
set up your existing view jr's
application install view X and finally
you will learn the central concepts
there and I will show you how to apply
UX in the application so stay tuned okay
before actually starting with the first
practical application let's talk a
little bit about the concept behind
state management so when is centralized
state management actually needed and
that's most often the case if your
application you view giant application
grows bigger and then is starting to
consists of multiple components you
might run into the problem of how to
share data in your application between
those components and make sure at the
same time that you are using the same
up-to-date data in all of the components
and everything is getting rendered and
displayed in sync
however if the application is small you
can solve this problem by omitting
events and passing props to your
components and you have to keep track by
using events and omitting events to to
keep tracks that all components are in
front if a certain data element is a
change in your application and by using
events and emitting events and
subscribing to events you may
sure that you have a certain information
flow in the application and another
component can react on a data change
which happens in another component and
now if you'll occasionally as mentioned
keeping track of all of those events and
properties passing around your
components and events being emitted and
subscribed by other components becomes
difficult and is really hard here to
keep the overview of of all the
components which needs to trigger an
event and component which needs to
listen to events and so on and to solve
that problem you X comes in and
introduces a centralized state
management in your application and by
using that library you will get the
centralized data store and all all of
your components can access the data
within a data store and you do not need
to pass data by using props but we new
component and you do not need to inform
by using events okay so what UX is
exactly about here you can see a picture
giving you an overview about view X and
how it fits in your UJS application so
just to explain a few central concepts
with that picture you can see here you
are view components in your application
and then the area which is surrounded by
the dotted green line here is what is
inside you are view X store a store
basically consists of those three items
every store has a state and the state is
just the wording which is used here to
describe the object containing the data
within that store and the data which
should be
centrally by using that store in your
application so it's an object containing
the data and you can compare it to the
local state of a component if you are
familiar with you you may know that you
can organize the data your component
would like to use in the data property
and you can assign an object containing
all the data properties to that data
property of the component configuration
object and that is on on the level of a
local component and the same concept is
applied here for a state it's also
containing an object with the only data
properties and values inside but in a
centralized way okay so then you have
mutations being designed in your view X
store and mutation mutations are just
handler functions that perform
modifications of the data inside of the
data object and mutations and that is
important you have to do it in a
synchronous way so you cannot perform
any async actions here in within your
mutation functions and that's the reason
why another concept that comes in and
that our actions and actions are
functions that commit basically
mutations and the main difference here
is that in comparison to mutations
action can also contain asynchronous
actions and operations so you can use
actions to for example access your
database or access your web services to
retrieve data and you values which you
would like to parse into the state and
then you can perform those operations
here with an action function and then
commit a mutation and then the new value
is
transferred into the state and the state
is accessible in your components and you
can use the state values to being
rendered out and display in the browser
and then if your user interacts with
your components and performs a certain
action which has the consequence of data
and needing to update in the state your
component is dispatching again in action
here and the flow of the flow of actions
again starts here okay now that you have
a first overview about the concepts
behind view X the let's start was a
practical part of this video tutorial
and we are going to start from scratch
setting up a new view J&amp;amp;S application
and then installing view X and
introducing store with state mutations
and actions within the application and
use that store within of one of our
components so let's get started and to
initialize here on the command line and
you view jf2 application the easiest way
is to use the view command line
interface which gives you access to a
command line command which is called you
if you have not installed a view CLI
you can do it very easily by using NPM
install - tree to install it globally
here on your system and then the package
name is view - CLI I have already
installed UC Ohio ID do not need to
perform that command right now I can
simply use view to set up a new project
and I do it in the following way I call
views and power
the parameter in it because I would like
to initialize a new application then
pass the parameter webpack because i
would like to use the web pack of UGS
template here and then specify the name
of the project i would like to create
let's call it view x - test okay so it
takes a moment and you can see it's
asking me some questions first the
project name I leave it to the default
setting here the project description the
author the view build mode here I choose
a runtime plus compiler view a router is
not needed in that case lsland is not
needed setting up unit tests with karma
and mocker is also not needed and
end-to-end testing I I'm choosing no as
well ok so now the project is created I
can change into that our newly created
directory you can see it here the
project is there and the first thing now
I have to do is to execute npm install
because i do need to install all the
dependencies defined and the package dot
adjacent file and that can be done by
using NPM install so hit return here and
it is downloading and installing all the
dependencies into the node underscore
modules folder of our project and it
takes a moment to complete here ok here
we are as you can see installation and
ascend above our new project has been
completed successfully and now the next
thing I needed to do is or just try it
out before we are proceed with the next
step I can run
project with NPM run death this is
starting up the development web server
on port 8080 and is launching the
default application here in the browser
as you can see so with the proof that
everything has been set up successfully
and it's running now so let's change
back to the command line stop the web
server here and now the next thing I
would like to do is to install view X
because that is an external library here
and you can do it by using NPM install
view X and then I'm also using the - -
safe option to make sure that this
project dependency is all those stored
within our package.json file here for
that project
okay so let's install it okay it's
downloading and here we are
okay so let's next switch to the code
editor so in my case it's Adam and
opening up the project here as you can
see and now we would like to introduce a
store in that application you can see
the main implementation is here within
the SRC folder here we have a main dot
JS file the app dot view file which is
the main component here of our
application and then within components
we have a Hello component which is used
here within app dot view and which is
defined here in that file
and now to introduce a view add store
I'm creating a new sub folder here
within the SRC folder which is called
and in that new folder I'm creating a
new file which is called stored okay yes
okay and that's the place where on the
store implementation will be inserted
okay here in store dot J's we first need
to import view from view and then next
we need to make sure that we import view
eggs from the buicks library okay and
then we are making a cow of method mu
dot use and passing in view X and that
is needed to activate view X in our
application without using that method
call it's not possible to make use of
any of the view X functionalities and
next we will start with a very simple
application we just need for the first
step a state object and that is defined
by using cons to state and we are
assigning an object here and the object
should also be pretty simple which is
introducing one data property and the
discord count and we are assigning the
initial value of that state property
that is 0 okay and finally we need to
create the store we are using export
default and then using the new keyword
and calling view X dot store and calling
that method is requiring one parameter
and there is a configuration object for
the store and
we are passing into that configuration
object the state okay okay now having
defined that initial version of our
viewer X store we can switch back to
main dot j s and make that store
available to our application and that is
done first by adding another import
statement here so its import store from
store store okay like so and then a
store now is Weibull here in that file
and all we need to do to make it
available on application level is to
include it here in the view
configuration object by saying store
okay okay so now on the store is
available and we can switch over to one
of our components so let's say we would
like to use hello component which is
here a Weibull in the components folder
in file hello W and now I would like to
access the count property of our store
and include the property in our template
to print out the value and the first
thing here I needed to do is just to
empty the template here and maybe let's
say removing and those tiles as well and
okay now I can do the following here the
state or let's say the store is a
Weibull globally by using an object
which is called dollar sign store and I
can include it here in the template by
simply saying dollar sign
store State and then I would like to
assess the count value okay let's save
it okay now let's go back to the command
line and start our development web
server again so that we can see the
result and the browser and can check if
the output is as expected so it's
starting up and you can see it's opening
up our application and it's printing out
this zero width which is the initial
value of the of the count property of
our state object so the application is
working the store is accessible and is
now shared across all our components in
our application so let's continue with
the next step and talk about Gators so
so far we have accessed the state also
store directly by using the dollar sign
store object within our components but
there is another way in the store we are
able to define getters and by using
getters we can access store properties
as well and we can also add to have
further logic so you can compare it
getters to computed properties within
your component so let's see how get its
work by the produce in the first Gator
here in our store and I would like to
bring in one Gatorade first we need to
define another cons object-- and that
object is called getters
I'm telling like so and then we need to
add getters here to use eeeh a store
configuration object and here within the
Const categories object we now can add
functions and or a getter function I
would like to make use of
my god even or odd and that function
some like so is receiving the state and
then I use R as a syntax of an error
function here from magma script six and
then using the state current property
applying the modulus operator here
dividing by two and then checking if the
remainder equals zero so all this would
give us the information that the current
count value is even and in that case
it's returning a string here so we are
not returning the value itself we are
returning a string and that is spring
saying even in the opposite case we are
returning a string as well but at this
time we are returning odd because the
value is odd
okay that is our even or odd getter
function and now we can access that
getter function within our component so
let's switch back to hello dot view and
now we need to make it available and we
need to make it available in the
following way first we need to bring in
another import statement here which
gives us access to from a helper
function which is called map getters
okay and it's imported from the UX of
course and now we can introduce here the
so the data section is no longer needed
instead we can bring in the computed
property here and then we are making use
of the map getters function and passing
in an e an array so like so and then
saying which getters should be mapped to
computed properties here in our
component
so that we can make use and access the
getters in the same way we would do it
with local computed properties and
together we would like to bring in here
is of course even or odd okay now we can
adapt the template here a little bit and
not only printing out to account value
so let's say counter then a counter is
even or odd and this gather is now
returning the string and inserting the
string even or odd here in our template
and you will see then the output so
let's save it and check the result in
our browser okay you can see it here
it's pointing out counter is a zero at
the moment and the counter is even of
course and if I now go back into my
implementation into the store and say
for example let's set count to an
initial value of 1 which is odd and
switching back to the browser you can
say C of the result has changed now
counter is 1 of course and it's a
encounter is odd as expected so in the
next step we will continue with
introducing mutations and actions in our
store so that we can not only retrieve
values but also modify values and we
will start out by defining mutations and
defining rotations is done at the same
way as we did it before with our state
and also our getters here we are
defining another Const object and that
is called mutations that is the
convention here
and we are assigning an object here
which includes a list of functions and
those functions are the locating
mutations we can use to to modify the
state and we do need two mutations here
the first one is called in command so
that we can increment the count value
and the mutation gets passed in the
current state here and then we are
saying state dot count plus plus to do
the incrementation step okay next is of
course on the chrome and again the state
is passed in here and then we are using
state count - - okay like so so to make
our mutations are a part of the store we
of course need to add the rotations
object here in our store configuration
object as well play like mentioned at
the beginning in many cases it's not
sufficient to only use mutations to
update values of our state instead you
would also like to use actions because
of the main advantage here by defining
actions is that actions can also contain
operations which take place a
synchronously for example if you were to
first access a bag and a web service for
example to retrieve a certain value and
then with that new where you update the
state of the store so let's introduce
actions here in our application as well
so what we need to do here is to add the
new Khans
object which is called
actions play and then assign an object
containing functions and we would like
to define for functions in total so
first we will have a corresponding
increment action and there again I'm
using the Year arrow syntax here to
define a function and we will do the
following here we will commit the
corresponding mutation and that is
increment in that case we can call
commit here and then pass in as a string
the name of the mutation we would like
to commit so that is increment but of
course we first need to make the commit
function available here in our method
and to do so we can pass in as a
parameter here the context object and
then we can say context dot commit and
there is another parameter which can be
passed in that the payload parameter so
if you have any values you need to pass
and you can use here is a second
parameter to pass in an object
containing the properties and the values
you need to have access to here in the
action but we do not need a such a
payload object we just need access to
the commit object and to make things a
little bit easier we can also use here
the exe s6 deconstruction syntax object
deconstruction syntax and apply the
following syntax here so we would like
to have access to the commit member and
then we can skip stating the context
object here and that is all what we need
okay next of course let's implement
decrement
in the same way
so again commit and then we are
committing the decrement mutation we
already created
okay let's define two more actions to
see how we can bring in more logic and
also see how we can bring in the
asynchronously operation next let's
define an action which is called
increment ephod so in this case we would
like to only increment the count value
if here the current value of count is
odd and to check it we need to implement
this function in the following way first
again we need to have access to commit
and we need to access the current state
here and your next let's check it state
count plus one then applying the modulus
operator again and checking if there are
no no result from remaining and then if
that is the case we know that the
current value is odd and then we can
increment and to increment we again
committing the mutation the increment in
mutation
okay like so okay here we need to enter
the closing parentheses as well and here
euro is missing okay like so check it in
the browser
yes and then we can continue to add the
last actual function and that is
increment 6 and in that case we again
need access to commit and we are
returning can you promise and the
promise cause gets passed in a function
which I which has two parameters the
response and the reject object okay so
and within the promise function we are
now doing on a synchronously operation
by setting a timeout okay so okay we're
setting a time out of 1000 milliseconds
here and within that half function which
is executed it if the time of is reached
we are doing a commitment and calling it
in chrome and meditation and then
calling resolve to resolve the promise
okay
okay to make the actions a way bone of a
store again we need to scroll down to
the configuration object we are passing
to the UX dot store call and
at actions here so this makes our store
complete and now we can switch over to
hello dot view again and then the first
thing we need to do to make our actions
here available in our component and make
it available for use in in the template
we first need to import here not only
map Gators but all the map actions ok
like so and here in the component
configuration object we'll need to add
at the property Messrs and then use the
map actions function to do it in the
same way as we did it with mapper Gators
we need to pass in an array here okay
like so and within that array we need to
define spring elements containing the
names of the action functions we would
like to make available as message here
in our component and in our case these
are all for functions so one start was
in Chrome and then we have decrement
next we have increment is caught and
finally we have in chrome and async okay
now are those for action methods are
waivable here as methods on our
component and now we can go up here to
the template code and extend the
templates a little bit to also include
buttons so that the user is able to
invoke those action methods and we are
able to see what is the result okay here
in our template let's first make use of
bootstrap CSS classes we will include
bootstrap um in in the last step so
let's use container here and then
introduce another div element here and
it gets the class row and your text
centered Center okay
and within that development we would
like to have an h3 and within that h3
I'm copying that text here and let's not
use counter here instead he use clicked
then the value of count times counter is
and even or odd remains okay and then
let's extend the template a little bit
further by bringing in buttons okay so
we do not need a time here we also do
not need the name attribute we just need
to have the class attribute here and we
would like to use again bootstrap
classes here button and button - success
and the button shape D plus and I'm
connecting now the click event handler
or the click event type with the event
handler increment and increment is
mapped here as a method and invokes the
corresponding action for a store ok
let's copy and past it in another time
here so we have the minus button okay
and then we are calling the increment
and I would like to use switch from
button - success CSS class to button -
danger here
um okay okay let's pass it in another
two times then we have a button for
invoking increment if hot
and finally the button for invoking
increment assume pay now let's change
the click event handler as well
increment if aught and implement sync
okay like so let's use just the button
class here BTN okay okay so let's
include the bootstrap framework so that
our CSS classes we have been using here
are working and I'm switching over to
get bootstrap calm and here is a getting
started page and here is the section
bootstrap CDN which gives you direct
link elements by using those elements
you can include bootstrap from a CDN a
content delivery network now we what we
do need else the bootstrap dot min dot
CSS files so let's copy that link
element here go back into our editor and
then I need to open index.html and
insert that link element here within my
hand section
okay so let's save it go back into the
browser to our application and you can
see here this the bootstrap styling is
applied and now it prints out clicked
one time which is not correct
so it's get back because we have put it
here to one let's put it back to zero
that should be the initial state let's
save it back to the browser
I know the right you can see 0 times
counter is even if I now click on plus
it increments and now it is clicked one
time and the counter is out of course so
now I can try out to decrement here I'm
back to zero let's increment again 1 2 3
and so on
so now on the counter is odd I can click
on increment it odd and the counter now
is 4 if I click on increment of odd
again now the context even of course we
expect that this button is not working
now and you can see I can click as many
times as I want it's not incrementing
next we have the increment the sync
button and if I invoke incremental sync
you can see first nothing is happening
and then with a delay of thousand
milliseconds the counter is incremented
to 5 ok now with that tutorial completed
you should have gained basic overview
and a basic understanding of what
centralized state management in view Jas
is about you gained an understanding of
how vu X is working how you can view X
add to your project and make use of a
central store and in one of our next
tutorials we will dive deeper into the
topic and then use the concepts you've
learned on today to build a more
sophisticated in a more real-world
application making use of view X thanks
