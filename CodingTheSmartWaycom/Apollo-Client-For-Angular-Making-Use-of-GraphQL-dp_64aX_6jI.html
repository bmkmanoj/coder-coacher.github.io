coding the smart way comm and in this
new video tutorial we are going to take
a look at Apollo client and we will be
using Apollo client together with an
angular project so you will learn how to
set up an angular project from scratch
then installing Apollo client and we
will be using Apollo client within that
project to request data by using a graph
QL and accessing a graph QL server end
point and then we will be fetching the
data and yeah processing the data in our
angular application and outputting
that data in the web user interface so
stay tuned so before getting started
with our project let's first take a
quick look at on the Apollo projects
website and you can find on the website
at Apollo graph QL comm here you can see
on the home page of the Apollo project
and the Apollo project is not only about
the client framework Apollo is although
offering a graph QL server you can use
together with nodejs but in this
tutorial of course we will be focusing
on the Apollo client project and if I
click on client you can see it takes me
to Z Apollo client website and here you
can find more information about Apollo
client you can see Apollo client is not
only available for angular it's a
Weibull for all the major yama script
based web frameworks and for Android iOS
and so on so you can find more
information here if you maybe are
interested in using a power client
together with reactive view you can take
a look here at the website in this
tutorial we will be using Apollo
with angular so that's only one option
and in the first step now we are going
to initiate a new angular 5 project from
scratch so tuition initiate a new
angular project I will be using the
angular command-line interface and the
angular CLI website can be found at sea
lion glue dot IO if you have installed
angular CLI on your system already
that's perfect you are ready to go if
not you can just follow the four simple
steps here present on the website and
especially the first command here the
NPM install - G at angular slash CLI
zetsu's a command you need to execute
first on your system to make angular CLI
a Weibull having installed at you have
the option to use a new command which is
called ng and that is exactly what we
are going to do next
okay so let's switch to the command line
and making use of the angular command
line interface by typing in mg and then
we are using the option new to simply
say that we want to initiate a new
project and then we need to specify the
name of that project so I'm going to use
angular - Apollo as the name and if I
now hit return you can see our angular
CLI is downloading of the project
template and then making sure that all
the needed dependencies are installed by
using NPM again this is taking just a
second to complete here so let's wait
for the installation process to finish
ok here we are you can see it's saying
project angular - Apollo successfully
created that is what we wanted to see
and the next step is you can change into
the newly created
project folder and just trying out that
everything has been downloaded and
installed successfully by once starting
the angular CLI development web server
which is done by using the command ng
surf so here you can see the web server
is no running and it's listening on port
4200 so this I see is a URL we need to
use in the browser to check if the
project is working successfully and if
we are getting an output here welcome to
app you can see it here that's the
default output of the default angular
project template and so that are the
proof that we now see that the project
has been setup successfully and is
running and now we can move on to our
implementation before doing so of course
we first need to install a few things to
make use of apollo client and that is
the next step now so back on the
terminal window here let me first stop
on the web server so that we now can add
a few dependencies to our project and
the way we are adding dependencies here
is to use npm install command again so
let me type in npm install and then i
need to add all the packages we do need
to make use of apollo client in our
application the first package name is
Apollo - angular then we need Paulo -
angular - link - HTTP then we need
Apollo - client Apollo - cash - in
memory like so then we need the graph
QL - tech package and finally graph QL
itself ok I'm hitting return and now it
takes a few seconds to download
everything to our node underscore
modules folder and you are downloading
it saving it in node underscore modules
and making it there with a Weibull
within our project so here you can see
the installation is as done all the
packages have been added successfully to
the project with all the dependencies
added as well and now we can move on and
yes top of the implementation part of
this tutorial and to do so of course we
need a code editor so let me start up my
project in the code editor of my choice
which is Visual Studio code in that case
so I can simply use the corresponding
command here code and then dot to open
the current folder in Visual Studio code
so if you do like you can use of course
any other code editor that's not a
problem but Visual Studio code is
offering very good support for graph QL
based projects so that is what I'm going
to use here okay so in the next step
let's open up app dot module dot es here
from the SSC app folder and what we are
going to need here is to import a few
modules first hmm
so let's add a following import
statements first of all we do need the
HTTP client module a so let me quickly
import HTTP client module
from the at angular slash common slash
HTTP library next we do you need of
course the Apollo module and we are
importing it from Apollo - angular like
so and then we need to import HTTP link
module and this is imported from Apollo
- angular - link - HTTP okay and finally
of course we need to add those three
modules to the array which is assigned
to you the imports property of the
@anjghie module decorator as well so
let's add first HTTP client module next
pollow module and finally of course HTTP
link module okay like so let's save it
the HTTP link module uses internally the
HTTP client so HTTP client is a part of
HTTP client module so that's the reason
why we've imported HTTP client module
first and see yeah that's the
prerequisite to be able to use the HTTP
link module services here so the next
step is to make Apollo service and the
HTTP link service available in our
application and if you are already
familiar with angular
you of course know that this can be done
by using dependency injection so this is
a way in which we are making those
services available and we do that we're
using the Pennsy injection right here
inside of app module OTS and that's the
reason why we first need to add the
services to our import statements so the
Apollo service is added here to the
import a statement where we are
importing Apollo Apollo module of course
so let's import the service as well and
the HTTP link service of course needs to
be added here to use the import
statement of HTTP link module so now
those service classes are available and
to inject Apollo and HTTP link into our
application here right and the app
module class we do need to add a
constructor to you the class of the
class at the moment you can see it here
it's empty there is nothing inside and
now I'm ending the constructor here and
they now we can inject it so let's say
Apollo is of type Apollo and HTTP link
is of type HTTP link so two parameters
and that's exactly the way how our
dependency injection is working in
angular you simply need to supply the
constructor of the class you would like
to inject the objects into with the
parameters and yeah angular knows then
what is needed basically Apollo service
and HTTP link service and is
automatically creating instances of post
classes and then you are ready to use
those services by yeah
either Apollo or HTTP link so now we
have both instances available we can
make use of the parcels and we can make
use of the HTTP link service here in our
app module class and now we can make use
of the Apollo service actually to call
the great method to establish a
connection to a graph QL server endpoint
and that's what we are going to do
inside the constructor which is still
empty so inside the curly braces here so
I'm calling Apollo dot crate and then
passing in an object consisting of two
properties the first is link property
and we need to supply the link property
here with a link to the endpoint and the
link is created by calling HTTP link
service dot create and here we are
calling this method and need to pass in
an object again this object has a
property we need to supply a value for
sets URI till the end point and here we
need to put in the URL of our server end
point this will be done in the next step
because first of all we need to make
sure that we have actually a server
which is not yet the case but in a
moment I'm going to tell you how you can
create your own graphic ul server which
is suitable for our supplying our sample
application which was a set of test data
but we do need here in side the object
which is passed to the poly dog crate
method we do need a second property
which is called cache because we would
like to use caching mechanism here and
the cache should be managed by
a class which is called in-memory cache
so we are create a new instance of that
class in-memory cache and in-memory
cache of course is not available right
now
so we need to make sure that this is a
label here in app dot module and maybe
you are remembering we have installed a
package or a downloaded package here for
our project which is called Apollo -
cash - in memory and that's a package
now we do need to import in memory cache
here so let's quickly add a bit import
statement here import in memory cache
from and now the package name which is
Apollo - cash - in memory like so and
now it is a label you can see it here no
error is shown so in memory cache is
recognized and it's a Weibull so that we
can make use of it so that's a way which
should be used to create for our pollack
line here in the angular application
crate a link to the server end point and
the only thing which is missing so far
is of course URL to our end point and
that will be completed in the next step
so to create a graph QL server to be
able to define an end point which we can
then use to establish link in our
angular application there are several
ways of cause one way would be you can
create your own and set up your own ref
to our server by using node.js and
Express there is a package which is
called Express - graph QL and you can
use that library to set up your own
graphic ul server with node which is in
very easy there is a tutorial available
if you like to dive deeper
to the topic at my website which is
called creating a graph QL server with
nodejs and Express you can yeah take a
look at that tutorial if you wanted to
know how to set up your own nodejs based
graph QL server from scratch that would
be one way if you following that
tutorial you will have a server with an
end point of able to supply our
application with data of course that's
not the only way the other option which
is a Weibull to create your graph QL
server is to use a polar launch pad that
the project which is a Weibull and
launch pad graph QL comm and that's
simply a cloud service which enables you
to create your graph QL server here
right in the cloud it's just a
playground you can use for your sample
projects like we are doing at the moment
and that's an easy way because you do
not need to install any anything on your
system you do not need to create a
project folder first and installing the
NPM dependencies and so on you can yeah
go to that ul and then start a setting
up your server immediately let me
quickly introduce you to on the
launchpad UI you can see it here on the
left side you can put in your code you
have a script code to create other
server and then on the right side there
is graphical running which gives you the
possibility of executing queries
mutations and and so on directly and
seeing the result and then you can see
if your server is working as expected
so launchpad at the great alternative
you may use if you are working just in a
in a sample project and trying out a few
things it's very easy to set up your
server instance once setup you have the
endpoint available here
so that you can copy and past that and
point directly to here you are high
property in the object which is passed
to the HTTP link not great method so
that's the end point and if you do not
want to deal with the server anyway you
can even use my launch better so I have
already set up a launchpad which is
suitable to supply our angular sample
application with the right set of data
so let me quickly go through the code
here we have defined ya two queries the
all causes query and the cost query so
this is giving you already a hint we are
dealing with a set of courses online
courses and yeah that's a custom data
type defined here so every course has a
few properties here Rd title also
description topic URL and we have
prepared a few sample data sets here in
the causes data array and you can find
the resolver here which is mapping the
query tabs to you the functions which
are returning the data so we are mapping
here all courses to get all courses
function and cause to get cost function
here is the implementation available so
everything is set up and for example if
I'm going to execute here in the
graphical section the all courses query
you can see I'm getting back the result
comprising all three sample records so
if you do not need to to setup the
server on your own if you do not want to
deal with
the launchpad code here anyway you can
simply use my graph QL and point here
created with the Apollo launch pad I
will put that link in the tutorial
description so that we are ready to go
by copying that link going to our code
and passing in that link here write as a
value two zui property so now that we
have fed up the Apollo client connection
in our angular application to the server
end point we are ready to move on to the
next step and in the next step we are
going to expand the angular application
and include the code which is needed to
retrieve data from our end point and of
course displaying that data to the user
and the browser yeah and therefore we
are going to add a new component to the
project by using angular CLI again and
as you can see here I've already opened
up the integrator terminal here in my
code editor and I now can use the ng
command to create a new component so I'm
saying mg g4 generate C for component
and then specifying at the name of my
component which is simply called a list
because we want to retrieve the list of
courses data and then printing out that
list okay so hitting return you can see
it's creating four new files here in the
folder SSE app a new subfolder is
created list containing those four new
files and it's updating app dot module
dot TS so and if you're now taking a
look here in app dot module dot yes you
will notice that list component which is
our new compose
is automatically imported here from from
the new file and add it to you the array
which is assigned to the declarations
property so that we are fully set up we
are ready to use the list component in
our application of course now we need to
bring in the code into list component
bring in the code on the one side and
the template code of course on the other
side to complete the implementation and
that's what we're going to do now so
there's one more file to add because we
do need a file which contains the type
definitions we are going to work with so
you know we have defined a custom cost
type server-side and now we need to have
a corresponding cost are defined on
client side and to do that I'm adding a
new file here let's say touch and I'm
going to add that file in is our C / app
/ and the file name is types dot TS okay
like so here you can see this is the new
file I'm opening up and I'm going to put
in the code to define the type first of
all we are defining cause and because we
want to use that custom type later on in
our components I need to export it so we
can import it in the component the
export type and I'm naming it costs and
it equals the following definition we
have an ID of type number then we do
need a title property which is of type
string of course I'm adding author
property as well again
type string the description property
which is also of type string than the
topic and finally the you al play we
need a semicolon here and then I do need
a second type which is defining my query
so again export type theory and we would
like to use the all courses query so we
are expecting on the query type to have
a property all courses and this is of
type array of course so this way okay
that's our type definition and now we
can use both types
so type query and type course in our
list module now let's continue in file
listed component of TS that's the file
where the class implementation of class
list component can be found in the first
thing now which needs to be added our a
few import statements of course so we do
need to import the Apollo service so we
are importing Apollo from from the
angular from the Apollo - angular
package next thing is we do need to
import observable from our XJS /op
servable and then we need to import
map map is imported from again the our
exchange library slash operators then we
need to import
gql from graph QL - tag
like so and finally we do not need to
forget to import our types cause and
query and we are importing both types
from the types dot TS file which is
available in our project so we have
imported the Apollo service now we need
to use dependency injection once again
here in the constructor of the list
component class to create an instance of
our supplier class was an instance of
the Apollo service so let's use the
private key word here private
Apollo over type Apollo like so and then
you can see the entry on init method as
already a Weibull here that an angular
lifecycle methods which is called every
time this component against initialized
in our application and that's the
perfect place where we can put in our
code which is needed to send the RFQ
our query to the service so that we are
retrieving the data and then half of a
set of data available here once the
initialization of that component is
finished so that's what we're going to
do now first of all it's at a class
member which is used to store the data
into
as retrieved from the server let's name
it causes it's of type of cervical and
observable it's also typed here and it's
returning an array of courses so like so
and now back in ng on in it we are
executing or requesting the data by
using the following call so we are
signing the result to the start causes
and then making the call here is this
dot Apollo that's the instance of the
Apollo client or is a polished surface
and then we are using the watch query
method here and we are saying it's
returning a result of type query and
then we need to pass one parameter to
the call of watch query and that's an
object and the object is containing the
property query and query gets assigned
the graph QR code which is containing
our three reoperation and to embed graph
QR code here directly in our JavaScript
code we can now make use of the ref ql
tech of the which we have imported as
gql and then as a syntax eeriest you
included at the multi-line string is to
use backticks so that's the option which
yamas web gives us to include multi-line
strings and that's perfect you included
the graph QL code here and let's define
a query operations so query that's the
keyword at the graph KO keyword which is
used here and we're naming that query
operation all courses and using curly
braces here and in our all courses
current operation one pro is embedded
and that's
all courses which is a query which has
been defined when setting up our server
and we are defining what fields should
be returned for for courses and that's
ID we want to have the title the also Z
description the topic and the URL so
basically we are requesting all fields
which are available for a cost okay like
so that's our graph GL code which is
embedded here and then we can connect
here with the value changes property and
then connect with the pipe a
transformation and for applying the
current transformation we are calling
the med function here and we are saying
okay please apply the following function
for transformation result then we using
the l function here is becoming result
data dot all courses so this is making
sure that we are getting back a
structure which is all only containing
an array of courses because it's
embedded in the result we are getting
back in the data property and by
applying the transformation we are
extracting it out and only and only
leaving back B array okay let's put
finally a semicolon here so that's the
code which is needed here inside of our
list component class implementation
so to make sure that the user interface
of our angular web application is
looking nice we are going to use the
bootstrap for framework and we are
applying some of the bootstrap for CSS
classes was in our template which we do
need to add to our application but
before doing so this requires us to
install and add bootstrap also
dependency to our project first and
that's exactly what I need to do next so
let's stop the web server which is still
running here for a moment and the way
you can add the bootstrap for frame up
to the project is by using NPM once
again so I'm saying npm install woods
wrap return so this is downloading the
package and installing it to again the
node underscore modules folder within
our project you can see it here so that
it is a Weibull and part of that package
are the files and we need to include in
our project to make bootstrap CSS
classes a waiver so we can have a look
inside so let's open up the node modules
folder and you can see here are all our
dependencies and bootstrap is a Weibull
and inside the bootstrap directory you
will find the dist folder which includes
two sub folders CSS and j/s and we would
like to add the bootstrap CSS file to
our project and you can see it here the
minified version as bootstrap dot min
dot CSS so that's exactly the file we
need to include in our project and the
place where we need to include that file
yes let's close in note underscore
modules folder is in dot angular - CLI
dot Jason and if you take a look inside
that file you will find here right in
the apps section you will find a
property a configuration property which
is called Styles and as you can see
Stars gets assigned array here and by
default the project file Styles dot or
CSS is already included and now we can
use that location here and add and add
our bootstrap file which is a Weibull in
node underscore modules slash bootstrap
slash dist slash CSS F seen before and
then finally is a file name which is put
shrap dot min dot CSS okay so that's
basically all so now we can make use of
bootstrap CSS classes within our
template and template which is still
missing is the list component template
and the file where the template code
goes into is list component HTML so you
can see it here is a default template
just printing out a list of works so we
are going to remove that code here and
then start adding the template code
which is outputting our list of online
courses we received from the graph QL
endpoint so just remember we have stored
a CR array which is containing the data
which will receive from the server in
the class member which is called courses
so now we can iterate over that array
and print it out and the
template code which is needed for that
is what start here was let's say a
development and then we are using the
mg4 directive and since the syntax which
is used here is let course so course is
always containing the current record we
are iterating over of courses so causes
else the class member which is
containing the result forms the API call
and then we need this is very important
because causes isn't observable so it's
receiving data in an asynchronous way we
need to apply the assent pipe here so I
think this way so that angular and the
energy for directive is working even for
that data source which is receiving data
in an asynchronous you Cronus way okay
so within that if element let's use
another div element which gets assigned
bootstrap CSS class card okay like so
and then maybe let's say we would like
to apply some styling here which we are
doing in line we are selling the waste
to 100% and we are assigning a margin -
top of 10 pixels okay like so then we
have the card body and within that body
we are using h5 headline okay we need to
assign a class here as well the class we
are going to use here is called card -
title and then we are printing out here
in
title of our card by using angular
syntax here with two curly braces we are
in bread embedding on expression here
and we are printing out the value which
is available in cost dot title okay this
is the way anyway is working now let's
use the nice six here next and apply the
cut
- subtitle class maybe let's add a
margin a bottom of two and text - muted
as well and we are printing out here is
the information of the author also so we
are saying bye and then using the
expression syntax once again to print
out the value of course dot author like
so next let's use a paragraph so P
element and we are assigning the class
of card - text here and we are printing
out the value which is a Weibull and
course dot description ok and finally is
a link to the course website so let's
use a trefor Elm element here and we are
setting of the destination again to the
value which is available and class dot
URL and we're
applying a clasp here as well the class
we do need is card - link and then we
are saying go to cross okay so that's
basically our template with the
information the user should see included
and the template is printing out this
part for every single course available
in the courses array so now all the list
component template is in place and you
can see here in the integrated terminal
the webserver is again running but of
course if I know check the result and
the browser here oh it's refresh it you
can see nothing has changed and the
reason for that is quite clear the list
component implementation is in place the
list component template is in place but
we have not included list component in
our main application template yet so
this is what we are going to do now so
that we see the result from list
component and the main application
template is a template of app component
and the template of app component the
implementation the default
implementation can be found an app dot
component of HTML so this is exactly the
HTML template code which is used to to
output the default view we just saw in
the browser but this is obviously not
what we want to have in our application
so I'm going to delete it all so let's
start over again let's start with a div
element here in the sand bootstrap
container class within that container we
first add the output of our list
component and the way to include a list
component here is if
again take a look it listed component or
TS here you can see the selector was by
default set to the value app - list and
the selector is describing the name of
the HTML element which needs to be used
to include the output of that component
in any other template so I can now go
back to you app dot component HTML and
just include list component by saying
app - list okay like so now that's a
place in our output where we are
displaying the result which is rendered
by the template of list component okay
but this is not all in addition I'd like
to include a simple navigation bar on
the top just to make a little layout
look a little bit nicer let's do that by
using it enough element and assigning
the classes enough bar enough bar - doc
and bheegi bheegi - primary ok no that's
not the way I want to have so enough
power enough power - doc BG - primary
like so ok that's our nav element and
within that enough element we are going
to print out just a headline text by
using anchor element here assigning the
class of nav bar - brand
if you like you can put a link inside of
here and then including the text Apollo
client for angular sample application
okay like so okay so now everything is
in place and it's time for checking the
final result and the browser and see if
everything is working as expected so
let's open up the browser once again and
you can see it that's the output and
everything is as expected we have enough
element here and then we have three
times the cut area included in our
output with the information received
from the graph QL server yeah you can
see it here so everything is working as
expected
and now you have a running angular
