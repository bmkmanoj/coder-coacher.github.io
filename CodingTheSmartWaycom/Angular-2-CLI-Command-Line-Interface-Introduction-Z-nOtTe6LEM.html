smart way comm and today in this video
i'd like to give you a short
introduction to the new angular 2
command-line interface and by using the
command-line interface it gets very easy
to setup
angular 2 projects from scratch and use
scaffolding to extend your application
with various components in angular 2 for
example we can use a command to add new
components new directives new pipes to
our project in this video we first will
see how to install the angular 2 come on
an interface on your system and then
second we'll walk through a simple
sample application showing you how to
apply the angular command-line interface
in practice ok to get started we will
first take a look at the website of the
angular CLI project and you can find the
website here if you point to CLI dot
angular dot IO and what you can find
here on the website is first of all a
very important information which is
stated here because you can see that
installing the angular CLI project on
your system is done by using an NPM
package so we can simply install it and
we will do it in a minute and you will
see a life by using NPM install and then
using the package which is called
angular - CLI okay a few other things
can be found here on the website here
with link CLI commands you are directed
to a PDF document which gives you a good
overview of all the command-line options
which are available and there is another
link here to the github repository and
the github repository of the project
it's very comprehensive and if you
scroll a little bit down here you will
find further documentation here okay now
the first step is to install angular CLI
on our system
and to do so I'll switch over to Z
command line and then use the NPM
install command to install the angular -
your package as a global package on our
system and let's say that we would like
to get the latest version and then the
installation is taking place it just
takes a moment okay here we are
installation has completed successfully
and now another command is available and
the command is called entry so very easy
to remember and just typing in ng here
on the command line will give you just a
few options which are listing the
command line parameters which can be
used together here we see ng command and
one thing you can do is type in ng
version to get back the version which
was installed and in our case this is
the one point 0.0 beta 17 so the angular
CLI project is not yet released so we
are using a beta version here okay now I
would like to use as a ng command to
generate an initial angular 2 project
structure entity so we are using the ng
c'mon
together with the command line option
new and after the new keyword we are
specifying the name of the new project
let's
angular2 test and then hit return and
what we are getting back is a message
simply saying that the project was
created and then in a second step
installing packages for tooling of ira
npm so now the project structure is
already there and in the second step all
the NPM dependencies are retrieved and
installed that was in our project folder
here ok now the installation is ready so
we do have a new project folder which
you can see here it's called angular 2
tests and all the NPM dependencies of
that project have been installed so we
can switch into that directory and take
a look inside just by printing out the
tree here can see the top-level elements
we have some configuration files and
most important we have a folder which is
called source where the main main
implementation parts of the generated
project are in and to take a look inside
let's switch to atom and see what's
inside
so here's our project angular 2 - test
and if I now take a look into the source
folder you can see that within cells we
have again some configuration files here
for example the TS config dot Jason and
the Taipings configuration and the most
important subfolder here is the app
folder because within the app folder you
can see that we have already available
one component as its app component and
we have the app module implementation
here in app dot module dot TS and if we
take a look inside you can see that our
application at the moment is defined
here with this app module
and at module is containing app
component as the one and only component
which is a Weibull so far a few imports
from angular 2 standard modules are
listed here browser module forums module
HTTP module so we are already ready to
use angular 2 forms and HTTP module
browser module needs to be imported here
because we want to have access to
standard angular 2 directives in the
templates of components belonging here
to Z app module and another important
thing here is that app module is already
assigned to the array which is assigned
here to the bootstrap property of the ng
module decorator and this basically
tells tells angular it by bootstrapping
the application app component should be
loaded first and the template of app
component should be displayed first to
the user okay said so let's leave of the
browser at the editor for a moment and
switch back to the terminal so we are
still in the project folder and now
without doing any changes to the
implementation let's see if the
application is already able to to run
and to execute the project we simply
need to type in ng surf and hit return
and then you can see that ng serve is
starting up the web server and is
building up the modules
okay here it's ready to go and now we
are able to switch back to the browser
and access it on localhost for 200 and
it just prints out app works and that is
telling us that the project was executed
successfully that the server is running
and that the initial project setup is is
running and can be executed and viewed
in the browser okay now is that we have
our application up and running we can
continue to extend our little our
project a little bit and we do that by
using a scaffolding options of the ng
command and the first extension we will
do is to add a custom pipe to the
project and the pipe I'm going to add in
the next step so to simply turn text
string for example the app works text
string into a capitalized string so the
first character of the string should be
turned to uppercase by using that pipe
so we will call that pipe capitalized
pipe and to use scaffolding to generate
a new pipe I will switch over to the
command line again here you can see our
project is is still running the web
server is up I've already opened another
tab here and again I'm within the
project folder and now I will use the
command in the following way ng D you
can also use instead of simply typing in
G you can use as a word generator G is
just the same then pipe because we want
to generate a new pipe and then specify
the name of that new pipe and in my case
the name should be
capitalize okay hit return and you will
see that the scaffolding is taking place
and the scaffolding here is a generating
two new farts in the source app folder
and the first file is capitalized pipe
dot aspecto TS that is a file where we
can or where we have the option to bring
in testing specifications for now we
will ignore that because we are not
dealing with zone I was testing in this
tutorial that will be part of a later
tutorial for now we will only deal with
the capitalized pipe implementation in
file capitalize dot v dot TS okay now
switch over to Adam and see how the
default implementation or is a template
of the capitalized pipe which has been
generated looks like here you can see
within our project structure within the
source folder within the subfolder app
the two new files and first we will take
a look here into capitalized dot v dot
ets and you can see a default
implementation of a custom pipe it's
needed to import pipe and pipe
transformed from the angular co-op
package and then implement a class which
in this case is named capitalized pipe
which implements the part transform
interface here and which has already
attached decorator and add part
decorator which has a property name
which is basically the string which is
used to apply that Piper later on in the
template and most important of that
implementation is the transform method
which is at the moment empty it's just
returning now but here now we need to
step in
and bring in our implementation
transform logic which we need to to
implement the pipe okay the first change
we have to make here is the definition
of the transformers that you can see
here the transform method is defined by
taking optional parameters but the
purpose of the capitalist pipe should
only be to take one string and then turn
the first character of that string to
upper case so to capitalize that a
string which means we do only need one
input parameter so we can delete all
optional input parameters here and
change the type of the value parameter
which is the first input parameter to
the string and of course we are
returning as a result when the
conversion has taken place we are
returning a string as well so we need to
change that type here of transform of
the return type of transform again to
string okay then next we need to bring
in the transformation logic here mm-hmm
and we do that by simply returning the
string we need to retrieve first the
character at the first position pushes 0
and turn that to uppercase so we are
using the message to uppercase here and
then combine it with the rest of the
original string and that is everything
which follows at the second position
okay so that's all what we need we can
delete that return statement and now we
have just one returned a statement which
we need to put in one here which is
doing on the conversion logic so taking
the first character which is at position
zero turn it to uppercase and then take
all characters following after that zero
character here and concatenate both
strings and returns a resulting string
here so now that the pipe implementation
is ready we can continue to applies
capitalized pipe to as the output string
and the output string which we saw
earlier here in the browser ever works
is generated by the template app
component so to find the place where the
output mm-hmm It's Made we need to
switch to the template of app component
which is available here in file have
component dot HTML and here you can see
mm-hmm the template is very simple it's
just containing one headline tech and as
the expression as the angular 2
expression which is needed to print out
the value of property title title is a
property in the implementation of the
app component class you can see it here
in hep dot component on TTS here is the
title property is set to the string we
later saw in the browser okay switching
back to the template now we can apply
our pipe by using the pipe symbol and
then just using the name which was
specified for that pipe which is
capitalized here okay saves the template
and by saving the template you can see
that the app is automatically reloaded
because the server which was started by
using the ng surf command
it's a Weibull with a live reloading
feature so every time we are changing
something in the code the website is
loaded without needing to do anything
manually and you can see the pipe is
working as expected the first character
is turned to uppercase and so we can see
our pipe is working so now with our pipe
working and generating the expected
output you might be wondering because we
have not added any import statements to
the app component or to app module and
so maybe the question arises why
actually is the pipe working and the
answer to the question is very very easy
the corresponding input statements which
are needed to make the pipe a label here
to our components template have been
added by the ng command automatically so
just see where the import statements can
be found
switching over again to our atom at the
editor and then taking a look into the
implementation of F Modula here we can
see we have automatically available an
import statement which is importing
capitalized pipe from our implementation
file and then adding capitalized pipe
till the declarations array here of the
module definition and that is a
requirement we need to bring in other
pipe here to make capitalized pipe the
Weibull to the components belonging to
add module and the component where we
are using capitalized pipe at the moment
is add component so adding capitalized
pipe here in that array makes our cost
pipe away bill to the template and we do
not need to add anything manually so
having generated at the pipe by using
angular 2 a CLI we can take a look at
somehow as our scaffolding options we do
have by using the ng command so I switch
over to the command line once again so
for example we have the option to use ng
G command together with the key word
component to generate a component so
let's try it with my component that's
the name of the component we would like
to generate and as you can see it just
takes a second and then we get back the
result is that four files have been
generated again those files have been
generated in in the folder source
subfolder app and then another subfolder
was created for that component and the
subfolder was an app is named here with
my component so the folder has the same
name as we have assigned it is a
component and then within that folder
you can find four files it starts with
my component component RTS that's the
file where the year component class
implementation is in then again we have
a testing specification file we have the
my component component dot HTML file
which is containing the template code
which belongs to that component and we
have a Styles file here a CSS file where
we can put our CSS coding in and let's
take a look here is a new folder so here
is the default implementation you can
see that's just the initial
implementation of a component we have
the
selector which is app - my component we
have a reference here for our external
template file and we have a reference
here with a style URLs parameter which
gets an array assigned the first element
here in that array is containing a
reference to our external CSS file for
that component and again if we now take
a look in epic modular TTS you can see
that my component has been added here
the the corresponding input statement
has been added here and it has been
added here to the declarations array
furthermore you can use ngg directive to
generate directives as you can see here
then you can use energy service and
generate a service class and in later
versions you will be able to use the ng
G route command to generate a routing
configuration automatically but for the
moment for this beta version you will
get the error message that due to the
recent changes in the angular 2 Ruta
implementation as a service in the
angular command line interface has been
disabled and will be made available in
later versions thank you very much for
