codings a smart way calm and in this new
video I'd like to give you an
introduction to stencil stencil as a web
component generator which is developed
by the ionic framework team and stencil
will be part of the next major ionic
release and with with that web component
generator you can build web applications
with web components so you can compile
your application and then the output is
only standard compliant web components
so you have no dependencies to any
frameworks and that is great so we are
building on the browser platform here
and in this tutorial I will give you a
short introduction we will see how to
install a stencil how to try out the
default project and then we will see how
to implement and enhance the project
with your own web component so stay
tuned so let's first take a look at the
projects website and the stencil website
can be found at stencil Jas calm and
here you can see the website and you can
for example click on the link
what is stencil to get a short
introduction you can see it here what's
what's very important and what makes
using stencil so easy if you have any
experience with frameworks like angular
or a react
Stanfield takes features of those
frameworks it uses virtual Dom async
rendering reactive data binding
typescript JSX for templating so all
those concepts which might be already
familiar to you if you have been using
react or angular framework before and
those concepts are now taken in to
stencil and you can use those concepts
here to implement web components and
then as an output the stencil compiler
is generating standard based web
components for you so you can also click
on getting started and you can see it
here is that the first step to start a
new project so stencil has no CLI no
command line interface instead to get
started with stencil we need to clone we
get hub respond repository here you can
see it here and that is cloning the
default stencil project the app starter
template and that is of course what we
now will do to just demonstrate how to
get started with that first project so
to do so just grab that first line here
as the git clone command copy it and
then opening up my console so let's use
that command here and the last parameter
here my - app is that's the new folder
which is created here and in that folder
the stencil project is downloaded so
let's name it my stencil - app ok hit
return you can see it's cloning the
repository content into my - stencil -
app so let's change into that new folder
and now we are ready to go with that
default project so the first thing we
need to do here within the project
directory is to call the git command
again and call it in the following way
git remote
RM or return to remove the remote
destination here from our repository and
then we need to call NPM install - to
install all the
and p.m. dependencies this is taking a
few seconds because now it's taking a
look into the package.json file which is
part of the default project and reading
out all the dependencies on the packages
which are needed here in our standard
project then it's downloading the
packages here as you can see and then
installing all the packages into the
node underscore modules folder of our
project so this is happening right now
okay all the dependencies have been
downloaded and installed successfully
next we can move on and to use the NPM
start command here to start up a
development web server with live reload
capabilities you can see it here so you
should let's go back to the console you
should see something like that built
finished watching for changes that
assembly means is that now if you are
applying changes to the implementation
to the source code the server recognizes
these changes and is updating the
browser output automatically without the
needing to do the reload manually and
the browser output is visible here as a
browser is starting up automatically and
it's hosting your application on
localhost part 3 3 3 3 and the default
output here is hello my name is tensile
chaos okay so next let's take a look at
other stunts or project structure and
therefore I have already opened up the
my stencil app here in my code editor
which is a Visual Studio code and the
project structure can be here can be
seen here on the left side you can see
the most important folder here is the
SRC folder because that's the
we're all our implementation goes into
and it starts here with the index dot
HTML file you can see it here it's a
quite simple index dot HTML file and
what's important here in the body
section you can see we are using a
custom element which is called my dash
name and it takes two attributes here
first and last and obviously this is the
element which is producing the output we
see here in the browser and now let's
see where is this custom element this
web component so this is actually the
web component here where is this is
implemented and we can see it here in
the SSE folder we can find a subfolder
which is called components and was in
the components folder you find another
subfolder which is called my dash name
and let's a folder where all the
implementation details of the my dash
name web component can be found we have
three files here a TSX file a spec dot
TS file and s CSS file the most
important file here is the tsx file you
can see it here so this is the
implementation of our web components
it's a class and if you take a look here
at the content of that file you can find
things which may be familiar to you you
can see we are using an Add component
decorator here for specifying some
properties for example we are using the
tech property here to assign a string my
- name and that spring is the name of
the custom element which is used to
include that element in an HTML file
first of all we have the style URL
property which is
set it as a pass in the name of the SES
s file which is used for that component
and then the component is implemented by
implementing here a class my name and
you sort in index dot HTML this
component is taking two attributes so
has two input parameters first and last
and input parameter C and stencil are
defined by using the add prop decorator
here and then declaring yeah the
properties which should be used for
input and we are using typescript as you
can see here to define the type of those
properties with a random method here
which is basically returning the
template which is used to render out the
HTML output of that component so this is
e J as xcode which is used here and that
concept to use embedded a j as an Xcode
and user render function which is
returning the template is known from
react so we are combining here the best
from angular and react to here at least
have a new a new way of implementing web
components here what's important
furthermore is we need to include the
import statement here and then import
the component decorator and the prop
decorator which is used here as part of
our implementation from the a distance
though slash core package okay so let's
take a quick look at LCS CSS file you
can see it here and that's very simple
CSS code which is used for that
component and then there is another part
which is important to make that web
component work and make it possible that
we can use the my - name element within
the body section of index dot HTML and
that can be seen here in stands
is here on the EMR - name component is
assigned to a bundle and every component
which is part of a stanza project needs
to be assigned to a bundle here we can
have one bundle and then you can list
all of your components or you can create
multiple bundles here bundles are used
for the lazy loading behavior of our
application so all components assigned
to one bundle are loaded at once and if
you define multiple bundles to the the
bundles with the components inside
unloaded else needed okay so that's
basically the setup here and that's the
default a stencil project you now have a
basic understanding of how things are
fitting together here in the project and
now we can move on and bring in another
component and as a custom web component
here into that project and see how we
can implement a component and then use
that component of course in index.html
from scratch so the new component we are
going to grow to create next year in the
default stencil project should be a
component which is outputting a list of
learning resources for web developers
let's say and it has another features
list the visibility of that list can be
toggled by the user by clicking on a
button and which is also part of the
user interface and to create that new
component we start with creating a new
sub folder inside of components and
let's name that subfolder my sorry my -
first - component so here this and
within that subfolder we do need two new
files the first file is my - first -
component dot TSX second file which is
needed here is
named my - first - component dot s CSS
okay
okay so we start in the tsx file here
and first need to import a few things
again we need to make sure that we
import component then we will use event
and event parameter and we will be using
state here all those types are imported
from the ad stand students
- coop package okay let's start
implementing the component class here
first
adding the nth component decorated to
make that class component so we are
assigning a tech name here and the tech
name should be my - first - component
then I'm using the style URL attribute
here to assign the name of the a CSS
file we have been created before from
onand dot yes CSS so that's the add
component decorator then we need to say
export class my first component and
that's the place where we will be
implementing the class members and
methods so because we would like to
output a list of learning resources we
of course need some sample data here and
that's the reason why I have already
prepared some sample data so the first
member I'm adding here to my first
component class is as a member list
which is of type array any and is
containing four objects each consisting
of name property description
imageurl and those are the four learning
resources we would like to use for
outputting a list here and the image URL
is pointing here to a location in our
assets folder and is containing an image
per item and I've already prepared here
in the inside of the assets folder the
images so images are away bow and the US
are pointing to that location so that's
the first thing what we need here inside
our my first component class so the next
thing I'm adding here to the class is a
property or let's say class member which
is decorated with at state so that
there's a state of the class and to
declare something as a state assembly
means if the state is going to change or
if the value of a state property is
going to change the web component knows
net that it needs to be re rendered and
let the output needs to be updated so
we're using the add a state decorator
here for the toggle property and toggle
is of type a boolean and by default it's
false so that is the property where we
are storing true or false depending on
the situation is the list of a resources
visible or not by default it's not
visible and later on we will be
implementing a button so that the user
can change that property next else an
event we are declaring here with add
event just to show you how to add events
here on toggle
of type event emitter and the on toggle
attribute can be used when including
that component inside of any HTML page
in XHTML for example and you can define
that you attach a function here to on
toggle which is and called whenever this
event is emitted so now we need to
implement a first method here which is
called toggle component so what we need
to do here is to set this dot toggle
which is our state property to just the
opposite value so exclamation marks is
dot toggle and then we are omitting the
on toggle event here in that case by
calling Emmet and passing in an object
was a property visible and visible gets
assigned this dot toggler okay so next
we need the render function and SC
before the render function is returning
the template as a JSX code so we need to
include the return statement here okay
like so so first starting was in return
with a diff statement with a diff
section so within that if we will be
using an acid if which gets assigns a
class jumbotron which is a bootstrap
class and later on when we are updating
index dot HTML we will also making sure
that the bootstrap framework is included
in our project pick
we will be using here several boots
prepped for classes for layouting our
application and getting a nice looking
UI into place so here we are using
Jumbotron as one of the first boot strap
classes okay here was the Jumbotron
let's enter the content okay and we will
be starting here with an h1 which gets
assigned to the class of display - three
and as a good swept class and just
includes the message welcome okay and
then starting with paragraph here gets
assigned the class of lead and here the
paragraph is containing the text this as
a stencil sample application
demonstrating the power of pure web
components okay
that's the Jumbotron area one piece is
missing here I need to add the button
here as part of the Jumbotron assigning
the class of BTN and BTN - primary -
that button and there's a button then
should be connected with the on click
event
okay and call this dot toggle component
okay like so and of course we need a
text here on the button and the text is
saying learning resources for web
developers okay like so okay let's see
okay you can see it here we have the red
underlining part here of the button
element that's because it was
automatically automatically transferred
to class name class name is a wording
which is used when applying JSX code in
react but here in the stencil version
it's not needed we can stick to just
class okay now you can see it's gone so
this is meeting
what stencil is expecting here so for
outputting the list of resources let's
start with another div element here and
this time I'm assigning a class which is
easier active or inactive so it's a
custom class we will later on define
those classes in the LCSs file and the
fact if we are assigning active or
inactive is depending on the state of
this toggle so if it is true we are
exciting assigning the class active here
if not the class name is inactive so by
assigning those two classes we are
controlling if the content of that div
section as wearable to the user or not
so within that deep section first we
start with div element which gets
assigned a class of row within that row
we are outputting now list and to do so
we need to iterate over the elements in
our list array and this can be done here
in the JSX code with the following
syntax we are calling this dot list dot
map here and for each entry we are
executing we are outputting the
following code here first a div element
again and this time we are assigning
goods back classes here for layout
reasons call - LG - 3 call - md - 6 and
call - st 12 so this is activating a
responsive behavior of our website so if
we are dealing with different screen
sizes with applying those classes we are
specifying how many elements should be
outputted in one row ok so now using
another div element here and we are
using the bootstrap part element here
for outputting each learning resource
entry and now is in the card we can
output all the information we have so
the names the description the URL and we
can output the image so first within
that card element I'm using a link so a
draft and the link is set to entry dot u
ow
target in this case should be a new tab
in the browser so we assigning the
underscore blank string here to is a
target property and the link should be
an image so let's use the IMG tag here
assign it a class of card I am G top
because we would like to display the
image on top of scarred clay like so and
there's a source for this image is of
course available in entry dot image URL
like so so let's close the a element
here so next we need the card body
another div element gets class card -
body assigned then we are starting with
an h4 headline class here again must be
title okay like so the headline now
should be the name of the current entry
from our array then we will be using the
paragraph here with class part - text
and paragraph is containing the learning
resource description with which is
available and entry dot description of
course okay then
finally I'd like to include the button
the button is also pointing to the link
of learning resource so let's use it a
element again and set c8 ref property to
again entry dot ul assign a class here
button and BTN - success in this case
because button should be displayed in a
green color target is again underscore
blank okay
and then put some text on the button go
to and then we output entry name again
as part of the text wing which is put on
the button okay so in our code we have
been using the active and inactive class
here depending on the toggle state of
our component so next step is to go to
my - first - component s CSS and define
those CSS classes here because this
hasn't been done yet
I'm starting here with the active class
and the class is quite simple we are
using the display property in a sedative
block to make the element to which the
active class is applied visible and the
other case is inactive in that case I'm
setting display to none so that it is
not visible and finally I'm assigning to
the good scrap card class I'm assigning
here a margin - bottom of 10 pixels okay
that is what is needed here in our CSS
file okay now we can quick check here
our development server is still running
you can see the rebuild is finished so
we have no errors so far from our
compiler and if I'm opening up the
browser again you can see it's still
outputting the same as before so the
output hasn't changed so far and the
reason of course is we have implemented
my first component but we have not used
it and that is what we are going to
change next to be able to use my first
component in for example index dot HTML
just remember the first step here is to
adapt stance or conflict or to Drai's
and here you can see I'm the only bundle
which is created still only my name
component is included and that this was
a default component and the output from
this this component is too visible yes
you saw before but we will not longer
use that component and instead include
in that bundle my - first - component
and now I can go into index that HTML
removes the usage here of my name
component and instead to use my - first
- ok sorry my - first - component like
so and ok that's what is needed to
include the output which is generated
from the JSX template code of my first
component here in the output of our
application that because we have been
using bootstrap a fork
we are not ready yet we first need to
include the bootstrap framework here so
that all the classes can be found and
the output is correct so the easiest way
to include bootstrap here in our stencil
application is to include it from a
content delivery network and to do so
you can get here the link on the home
page the home page URL is get bootstrap
comm and the link is get started here
just click on it and you can see it
start a template here and what we need
is the link element here which is part
of the Hat section so let's copy and
past it here and the next thing we need
are the three script tags here so again
copy those script tags go back into the
code editor and insert those script
elements here at the bottom of our body
section so let's save it and okay check
our compiler again it's still running so
now we can check the result here in the
browser and you can see now the
application of wirelessly is working we
can display the the list of learning
resources here and you can see one thing
is still missing so I think I have the
images are missing I think I have to
restart the server here once
okay here we are now you can see it's
outputting the list of learning
resources as expected with one typo here
it's not welcome it's not word written
correctly so let's quickly change it
here in the tsx file okay so now it's
correct and if I'm resizing my window
you can see the layout adapts as needed
okay and now you can see we have been
using stencil here and the output is an
application a web application which is
using a web component here and it's not
relying on any front-end framework like
angular or react or something like that
it's pure web components so it's pure
browser standard what we are using here
and the web application is working as
expected so one last thing if you would
like to compile your own stencil
application for productive usage and for
example would like to deploy your
application to any web hosting service
you would like to use you can execute
here in the project folder the command
npm run build and it's starting to
compile your application to output as a
standard compliant web components here
and after having finished as this build
process the application which needs to
deploy it is a Weibull in the
WWWE folder here and this is a content
which needs to be deployed to you web
hosting service and then your
application should be ready and made
available in the internet for example so
