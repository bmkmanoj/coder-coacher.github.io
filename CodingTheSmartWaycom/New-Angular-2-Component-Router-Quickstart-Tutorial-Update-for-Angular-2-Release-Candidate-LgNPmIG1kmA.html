smart way comment today in this video I
would like to give you a quick update on
as a new and reimplemented angular to
Rueter a few weeks ago was the release
of the release candidate as three
younger team decided to do a major
implementation of the angular 2
component router to make it more
flexible to make it more applicable to
the component approach in angular 2 and
there are a few major changes in regard
how to apply the router and I've
prepared a little sample application and
quickly want to go throught and show you
what are the main differences with a new
angular 2 root approach ok here you can
see our little sample application to
demonstrate the new component router and
as you can see our application is
consisting of three tabs here and with
the three tabs we are able to navigate
to certain routes the first route here
is delivering the cars list component
output and as you can see it's just
printing out a simple table listing some
car records with the second option new
car we are switching to car create route
and this brings up a form for entering
new car records and we have a certain
route here it's real bout route again
you can see here the URL is changed and
this route is just to demonstrate a
third route which is not related to the
cause features here and printing out
some static text information nothing
fancy here ok let's see let's switch
over to the implementation part of the
application and we have a simple project
setup in place here it's consisting of
a simple angular 2 basic project set up
with some configuration files here on
top and then more important is the app
folder where all our component
implementation goes into and within our
app folder you can see we have different
components already implemented you can
see here the main component of our
applications at SAP component dot TS and
we have the about component which you
already saw when switching over to Z
about route and we have the main dot ts
for booting up our application and then
or another thing the app routes dot TS
and that is a special file which is not
including an angular 2 component but is
including our routing configuration and
then we have another thing here in the
app folder we have the cars subfolder
and the car subfolder is containing
another list of components and the car
sub folder is created because it's
always a good idea if you have certain
features within your angular 2
application which are all related
basically to the same entity so in our
case at scar to combine all those
components services and so on in one sub
folder so you have a better file
structure here and you can directly find
components related sir certain
application entity ok next let's take a
look at the change new routing
configuration which is needed to set up
our application routes maybe you've
already noticed here we have now to
router configuration files included in
our project the first configuration file
is here on the top level that's app dot
a route TS and a second configuration
file is a weibull here with an hour
class folder which is named chorus
routes TS so we first take a look inside
on the ab dot route dot TS file here you
can see the file basically consists of
one array or let's say two arrays so the
first array which is called routers
containing the routing configuration as
ray items NT each array item is
corresponding to one route we want to
have in our application and you can see
it here and that is for example a route
configuration for our about route and
this configuration object consists of
two properties the first property is a
past property and we are assigning a
string here to the past property and
this string in that case is about
because if we switch back to our
application home let's switch back and
see ok here this activating the about
root you can see it here in the URL you
can see here is the extension that's
about and that xx it this is exactly
what we configured here with the past
property the second property is as a
component property and this property set
is a component in this case the about
component which we want to connect with
that route so effort times the about
route is called a corresponding URL is
called the browser the about component
is executed and the corresponding output
is placed inside our application output
so here is another special thing we need
to talk about that's here are the cars
are out object which is imported here
from the cars or out ts5 as you can see
here and we are using here the years
three dots operator to extend cars
routes which is an array by itself and
the scars routes array we will see it in
a minute when we switch over to class
routes is just an array containing more
routes configuration objects as you can
see it here in the same in the same form
and a by applying this operator we are
expanding the chorus routes array to
include all the items inside that array
in our routes array so basically there's
a way we can combine or split up routing
configurations across multiple files and
then combine all those routing
configurations here in one way by simply
using this expand operator okay the
second degree here in the file is the
app underscore router underscore
providers array and this array is gone
this thing routing providers and now to
provide the routes which have been
configured here inside the routes array
as a provider we are using the provide
router function which is important here
from the angular router package and we
are passing in as a first parameter here
the routes array which is containing all
our application specific routes the
about road and all our cars specific
routes and pass it in as in parameter
and then the provider is able to set up
the routes so okay let's complete the
routing configuration and take a look
inside the second files at
cars router DSN term has already
described here and there is no surprise
you can find another array in this array
in this case is typed we are using the
type router config because we are only
using configuration objects here and as
seen before we see about configuration
object each configuration object
consists of again two properties we have
to pass property and the component
property and here you can see for
example its take here is the second term
routing configuration object the car /
great URL extension is activating the
conform component and here we are
leaving the past screen just empty
because we want to have the cause list
component without putting the list of
car records as a default component which
is called when entering yan zi
application at the first time without
needing to specify any route any URL
extension so we are leaving the pass
your empty and then the car list
component gets activated and the output
is generated when first accessing the
sample application in the browser here
we have a cert pass configuration you
can see it here that again something
special here we are using a parameter by
applying that syntax and this parameter
is a dynamic parameter which is passed
by using the URL and the car detail
component reads out as a parameter the
ID and wizard rd is able to access one
exact car record and printing out the
details of that record we will see there
also in a minute how to proceed when you
want to read out routing parameters okay
now we have the routing configuration
for our sample application setup with
four routes and total again three-car
specific routes here and one route
configured on the top level here and ab
dot routes TS for the about component
another question of course is how to
apply that routing how to put that
configuration into place and down the
place where this happens is here in
Maine dot TS you can see it here and we
have exported the app underscore router
underscore providers array in our apt
our LTS file and now we are using that
array which is consisting of providers
providing our routing configuration to
pass it here into the boot strap of
function into the second parameter which
is taking basically an array of
providers and so passing in that array
is is bringing us into the situation
that our routing is applied so first
thing is we need to do import of course
the app underscore router and is called
providers array from a piccata routes
dot yes this is happening here and then
we can put that array here inside own
the second array perimeter of the
bootstrap function and that is basically
all what needs to be done to put our
routing into effect ok now that our
routing configuration is in place and
yeah is included in the bootstrap
function we can take a look at our main
component app component dot TS file to
just see a what is needed to include
links to certain
routes and to mark the area in the
output of the application where the
content of the routing components is
inserted when a specific route is
activated so let's take a look at the
template we are using here you can see
we are using some some layout stuff here
but the most important part is here the
router outlet element that element is
the place where the content of the
routing components the output is placed
in so for example if we are activating
the about component and the text output
is produced the HTML code of that
component is exactly replacing the
router outlet element here to have
access to the router outlet element we
need to include the router directives
array here and here the router
directives array is just containing all
the directives in regard to routing so
you only need to include the router
underscore directives array and then
everything is done and you can use your
router directives to get access to the
router underscore directives array we of
course need to import it you can see it
here we are importing it from the
angular router package so we have
another thing here in that file which
needs further attention and that is the
menu items here our tech elements which
gives us access to all the three routes
and you can see it here we are using the
router link attribute to generate links
to our routes and we can do it here by
applying that syntax we need to pass in
a string and the spring basic
is containing here in array and the
first element of that array is again a
string and that element is specifying
the path of the route we want to have a
link for for example here we are saying
/ about and that is a past extension to
the URL for the about component and then
angular 2 is automatically generating a
link for that route okay the last part
I'd like to take a look into is a core
detail component because that is a
component we connected in the router
configuration with the route which is
using a routing parameter and that the
CID parameter because we want to pass in
the ID of the car record when calling
that component so that core detail is
able to read out one specific car record
and then display all the car details all
the car properties in the output so
what's needed here to reload a routing
parameter we first need to import a few
things we need to import a router
activated route and router underscore
directive from the angular router
package and then I score a little bit
down here in the car details component
we can find a code which is needed to
read out the parameter first you can see
that we are using here is a constructor
to pass in some dependencies and inject
activated route router and the car
service that is a custom service we are
using to generates sample data here for
application but we are injecting
activated route and router so we can
access it by using underscore route and
underscore router
and in our life cycle method here Angie
on in it which is called right after the
constructor and right after on the car
detail component has been constructed we
are reading out the parameter and we are
doing this by subscribing actually to it
this is a very easy way to do it because
by subscribing to a parameter we are
making sure that we are not just reading
out the parameter once at the moment
when the ng on in it lifecycle method is
invoked but we are subscribing to it and
then we are making sure that we get all
the changes to the parameter later on
when maybe the component is not
destructed yet but again used when we
are a second record is called we are
getting the updates here by subscribing
to that parameter and so how is it done
we are using here was our activated
route object we're using the parents
property and then using the subscribe
method and then subscribing basically to
the poems array and to Z element which
is called ID and that is corresponding
to the name we used in the past in the
router configuration and then we can
read out here from our car service a
corresponding record and we have another
life cycle method here is its ng
ondestroy and it's important if we here
subscribe to you on something to
unsubscribe so on that we clean up
things we have used here in our code so
that no
memory is blocked and so as our
subscription is stored here in this app
we are using this dotsub dot unsubscribe
