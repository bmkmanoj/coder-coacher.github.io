like to show you how you can get started
with angular 2 very quickly so the first
thing we need is the quick start
tutorial and you can find as a
QuickStart tutorial right on the website
and the new website for angular 2 is on
angular dot io you can see it here and
in the middle of the page there is a big
button
it's called to get started button and
clicking on that button takes you
directly to a 5-minute QuickStart
tutorial so the first thing we have to
do to get started with a new project in
angular 2 of course is to create a new
folder where our project project is
stored in so let's switch to the
terminal window and let's create a new
QuickStart folder so maybe we should
name it just angular 2 starter so that
is our project folder and now we can
enter the project folder and create some
files we need the first file of course
is the index.html file so let's create
it
ok then we are going to need a subfolder
which is called add because that's of
the forever all our typescript code goes
in ok and then into that folder in the
app folder we need two more typescript
files
the first one is the booty s file the
second is the file where our main
component code goes in that's called AB
dot component of TS okay so there there
it is - farts in the app folder let's
get back to our root a folder and we
need one more file and that is a
package.json file because we are using
various packages here and use a node
package manager to install the
dependencies the dependent packages for
our project we can bring in all the
dependencies into the package.json file
and then install it very easily by using
the node package manager
okay so let's continue with installing
all the dependencies in our project and
as you can see here I have already
opened up the package dot JSON file in
my favorite text editor that's atom in
this case and now we can bring in the
dependency in configuration right here
the easiest way to do so is it just
takes a content of the package dot JSON
file right from the Quick Start manual
on the home page and it's very easy I
can show you where you can find the
content it's right here in the 5-minute
QuickStart a tutorial here is the
content of the package JSON file and we
take all as a JSON code copy and past it
here
okay so let's rename our project it was
angular 2 starter then we have a version
information here we have several scripts
configured so we can execute these
commands by using the NPM command you
will see it later on and then we have
two sections which give us the
information what dependencies are needed
in our project and that is on the one
hand as a section dependencies which
listed all the packages we need for
running our application and you can see
it starts with the angular package
itself of course in beta version and we
have the system GS library and so on and
so on and then there is a def dependency
section which contains three packages in
addition that's concurrently light
server and typescript and these
dependencies these packages are
installed that we can make use of these
tools during our development time so
these tools are not needed to to run our
project but it's needed during
development so for example the
typescript package
is delivering the typescript compiler
and we need to have a type of the script
compiler to transpile our code from
typescript to the other script so that
it can be executed in in in the browser
we use a light server as our web server
and we use concurrently to run you can
see it here is a script configured the
start script to run the typescript
compiler and to run the light server in
parallel so by using that script later
on when we are going to execute our
project we can simply type one command
and in the background the typescript
compiler is started and the web server
is started so it's only one step left
ok so let's save that file everything is
in and then we can get back to the
terminal and do the installation and the
installation is very easy we simply have
to call npm install and we do it in a
root mode i need to type in my root
password of course and then the
installation starts maybe it takes a
time it's depending on your internet
connection speed and that's all we need
for installing the project dependencies
right now
okay now you can see here in the
terminal window our installation is
ready and was successful so all the
dependencies are installed and we can
continue with the next step and the next
step is to configure our typescript
compiler we won't call later on when we
are going to execute the project and
there are two ways of two ways in which
you can do the configuration the first
way is to pass command-line parameters
to the call of the typescript compiler
by using the command T of C that is of
course something which has to repeat it
every time you are calling the
typescript compiler and the more easier
way is to bring in another configuration
file and to use that configuration file
to store all the configuration options
for the typescript compiler and that is
a way we will we will use in our project
so let's create a that configuration
file and the typescript compiler
configuration file should be in your
root project directory and it should be
called PS config dot J's so let's create
that file so there it is and again the
easiest way of filling the content of
that file is to go to the website to the
QuickStart tutorial and to just copy the
content which is given here in the
5-minute QuickStart tutorial once again
to your configuration file and you can
see it here there are various options
which are given very important is that
we say that our target is eggman script
5 we want to have JavaScript which can
be interpreted by most of the modern
browsers and we are using the module
loader system say yes and we have to
exclude that is very important the node
modules directory because we do not want
typescript compiler to transpile any of
the typescript files which are part of
our dependencies so okay let's start and
that is all we have to do now the
configuration for the typescript
compiler is already and we can move on
to the next step
okay in this next step we are going to
implement our first angular component as
you might already know angular to come
applications consists of components
which build and organized in a
hierarchical tree in our application in
this with you we are going to only use
one component one main component and
this component we are going to build in
in this next step so we can continue
right here in our app component dot ts
file and first of all we need to import
component to the component module to be
able to implement a component is that
it's very easy with the system G as
module loader we can simply say import
and then we give the module name we want
to import in embraces so let's do it
so that's component and we import the
component module from the angular
library from the core library so simple
: to end it and the next step is to just
implement the component class we do that
by exporting the class app component and
for the moment this class is left empty
but one further aspect needs to be
included also that the class really
becomes an angular component and that is
the component annotation we do it in
this way add component is that is the
syntax of how you can include the
annotations to a class and this
annotation this component annotation
takes it properties which are describing
this component first of all we need a
property which is called a selector and
we assign a string value here
and by assigning this string value to
the selected property we specify that
later on we can call and included that
component in an HTML file by using the
my app HTML element so next thing is we
need a template and the template is just
included right here in that file and we
assign the template string which is a
property which is called template so
let's keep the template for this main
component very simple we use an h1 tag
and we say my first angular 2 starter
app that should be enough for now so
that we can see a result which is this
component is delivering later on and was
that code in place and you can see it's
only six lines of code our first main
angular 2 component is ready and in the
next step we can continue to include
that component in our application ok
okay so now that we have our first
component implementation ready in Epcot
component or TTS we can continue by
switching to file boot TS which is in
the same app subfolder and the purpose
of that file is to load our main
component and then pass that main
component to the bootstrapping functions
the angular framework provides to start
up our application and to do that we
need to six we need to the boot strap
module which provides us with the access
to the bootstrap function and we need
our module our app component module that
was imported okay so let's begin the
first import statement will be on the
inclusion of bootstrap so it's called
bootstrap and the bootstrap module is
provided by the library angular 2
platform browser okay
and of course our main component app
component and we are going to import
that from from Epcot component okay both
modules are there and then we need one
final step to bootstrap our application
we call the bootstrap function and pass
over the app component and that's all we
need
okay so now our first angular 2
application is nearly ready one final
step is needed so we need the index.html
file and this file is is here in the
top-level project folder and this file
needs to be implemented now okay so
that's a simple HTML page of course so
let's start by adding the HTML tag we
have the head section in here and we are
going to include all the JavaScript
libraries we need to execute our
application so let's start with the
first script tag and as we have
installed all the dependencies as note
modules the other script files are in
the node modules directory and the
project folder right now so we can
access the libraries by simply including
the source attribute here and then we
need to set a node modules of course and
the first thing I'd like to include is
the angular polyfilled survivor II
because was this a library we make sure
that angular 2 applications can be
executed even in older browser versions
so the library we need here is in the
angular 2 folder and then in bundles
bundles and it's called angular pore
refills dot yes ok so that is the first
one and we need to include three further
script tags so let's just copy it the
next script I'd like to include as a
system dot vs module loader and the
system dot GS library as
the node modules folder of course in the
sub directory system GS it's an dist
and the other script file is called
system dot sauce dot GS okay so the cert
library we need its the r x GS library
which is a library which angular 2 is
dependent on so it's an hour x GS
bundles are x GS and the final library
of course because that piece is missing
so far is the angular library itself and
that is an angular 2 bundles and the
file is called angular 2 and F GS so
that is all we need all scripts are
included and then we can okay we can
include one further element here in the
head section let's give our page a title
and we say angular 2 starter app ok so
then we need to include one further
script but at this time we are not
loading a GS library we just need that
script which just needs a script in
order to make a configuration call for
the system GS module loader and we call
the system dot config method and pass
over an object and this object has a
packages property and the packages
property takes another object and that
object is saying ok let's let's do the
configuration for our app folder and so
we have
property up here and we are signing an
object to ZF of property which says okay
we are using the format register and
then we would like to register a default
extension for all our files and that
extension is GS so that is the reason
why we do not need to include the GS v
extension when we are importing modules
as we saw before by using the import
statement on top of the files so that is
all we need here so here we need a
semicolon to close that and then we have
a system impart have boot that is
important our boot dot ts file we have
created in the last step and you can now
notice we do not need to say dot GS
because we have already configured it
here that the system module loader knows
that all our files are registered for
the default extension GS so and then
let's say if if we are ready always
imparting then maybe there are errors
and we just bind the output here to the
console so that if there would be any
errors we can see it on the console ok
so with that a script code in place as
the head section is also complete ok
here's one little thing missing it needs
to be angular 2 ok so now it's complete
and then the body section needs to be
added because now was in the body
section we want to include our main
component and including this main
component is as easy as just writing
my hat and including the tech because
previously in our component you remember
we have set as a selector property in
the component decorator to my app and
that is the reason why now we can just
use the my app HTML element and with
that element here in the body section we
include the resulting HTML code from our
components template so that's all for
now so let's save that file and then
index dot HTML is complete
our application is ready we can now come
to the final step and the final step
means executing our application and
accessing the result in the browser so
let's switch back to the terminal and
here in the project folder it's very
simple to execute the project but simply
typing NPM start because you know from
the package of JSON file that there is a
script start in that file and as a start
squirt just means that it runs the
typescript compiler together with our
live server as a web server and so we
have both tasks covered our code is
transferred to - Yahveh script from
typescript we have a script and this
serve by using our web server to the
browser and that is all we need
so just execute that command and you see
it surroundings as script and it's
opening up browser but we have one error
message here you can see cannot find
module app component and the place where
we included app dot component is our
boot dot ts file and let's see what's
wrong just switch to the boot ES file
and here we have here we have the
corresponding input statement and the
thing which is missing is just that we
need to say that app component is coming
from the current folder in this way so
let's save it switch back to the
terminal and now you can see the
background process which is still
running on the terminal has noticed that
the file was changed it runs a
typescript compiler once again now
without any errors and the result is
just delivered to the browser
automatically we do not need to open the
browser manually it's just there and now
our first angle
Asian is ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
