mod Wacom and today in this video I'd
like to give you a short introduction of
how to use Google's material design in
angular 2 we are going to start with a
basic project setup and you can set up
this project by yourself on your system
by just following the QuickStart
tutorial which is a Weibull here on
angular io just hit the link QuickStart
and you will find the QuickStart
tutorial here with all these steps you
need to go through to set up a basic
angular project once completed you will
be ready to go with the project setup
which basically looks like the following
just let me go quickly through it so
here you can see we have some
configuration files here it starts with
a package.json file the package.json
file is including all the NPM package
dependencies which are needed to get our
project running we do have the system a
GS config GS file here which is needed
because we are using system GS as a
module loader here and this file is
containing the correspondent
configuration we have TS conflict of
Jason here which is a type a script
compiler configuration file and finally
we have typing dr. Jason and this file
is containing the dependencies to the
Taipings
files which are used to to get as a
typescript compiler working and finally
we have the app folder and that is the
most important folder of this project
because that is the folder where all the
implementation is happening and as we
are starting out with a very basic
project we just have three
script files in here we have the epidote
es that file is containing the
application module of our application
because a since release candidate five
modules are required in every angular 2
application and we should at least have
one module and as I see application
module and that module is basically
telling the angular framework which
components belong to the application you
can see it here in the declarations
array we just have one component at the
moment in the deserve component and how
to bootstrap the application by loading
the first main component and as we only
have one component at the moment that's
of course app component again and we
have the app component implementation
here which is not containing much
content yet but we will use it in a
moment to get our angular 2 material
components in and finally there is the
main TS file which is bootstrapping our
application by we are loading the app
module and an app module knows which
component to load first and that is
basically how the bootstrapping process
now with modules is organized in angular
2 ok so now that we have the basic
project setup available here we can go
on with applying the Google material
design here and our angular 2 project
but before we are doing so let's just
talk a little bit about material design
itself and you can see it here on yaw
material dot Google comm material design
is basically a design language specified
the Rhea invented by Google to to make
things very easy for the user and the
the goal from a material design for the
material design language actually is to
to give a unified user experience across
all devices so material design is
applicable for our own desktop user
interfaces web-based user interfaces for
um for tablet user interfaces and of
course for smartphone user interfaces
and if you want to get a first
impression of how material design this
look like and what are the elements
material design is build was you can go
here to that website and just scroll
through and that will give you a basic
impression what media material design is
all about so now the question is how we
can um how can we apply Google material
design to templates within our angular 2
application and to make things very easy
as there is a set of predefined angular
2 components which are ready to use in
your angular 2 application and in your
corresponding templates within your
components and that is the corresponding
website material angular dot IO you can
see all this website is about those
components we are going to use in a
moment and to get an overview of those
components we can switch over to the
list of corresponding node AGS packages
because all the angular 2 material
design components are available as NPM
packages and here on that web start you
can see the full list of packages
available and the next thing we are
doing is to go back to our project and
in store
some of those components to get the
first step done which is needed to
integrate material design in our angular
2 application okay so here in that list
we can make the selection of those
components we want to install in our
sample application and for the sample we
are going to build in this video I'd
like to select the coop package because
that co-op package is needed for all the
other user interface components so we
always need the coop package so that is
the first package which we are going
install and then the second package we
will use as a button package because in
our sample application I will
demonstrate how to apply there are
different styles of material buttons so
we need to button package and for
getting the layout of our application we
are using let's see the cart the current
package and finally the icon package
because I'd like to you to show how to
apply icons to button so that's the last
package we are going to install so how
can we now install those packages I will
switch over to the terminal I'm already
in the project directory and as we are
talking about NPM packages we can simply
use the NPN command to install those
packages so simply type NPM install so
install and then we are specifying that
those things should be stored in our
package JSON file as well and that is
done by using the save command line
parameter here and that simply listing
the names of the packages we are we are
about to add to our application so the
first package is angular
to material core as described the second
is angular to material button next the
card package and finally we are adding
the icon package okay that's all so we
are executing that command and then you
can see the installation process is
about to start
okay here we get back an error message
because okay is a card name is there is
a typo in so let's correct it here
should not care it's card and then
execute it again and now you can see
it's hopefully running yes okay here it
is hmm
okay there is one additional dependency
we need to add to our project and that
is he have a GS library because that
library is needed to add support for
touch gestures and that support is
required by Z icon component we just
installed and so we need hema GS as well
and this third-party library is
available as an NPM package as well so
we can just continue using the NPM
command here and let's say npm install
again this time our GS and again we are
saying just save it in our package JSON
file ok the installation is running and
it's done then we need to add other
corresponding typings as well and we do
that by using the following command here
and the project directory type things
install and then specified where
the source can be found it's in the BT
repository and it's hema GS save global
and then execute that command and ok
here you can see it's added to a project
and the Taipings are now available as
well so back in our project we can check
if all the installation was completed
successfully and the first thing we need
to check is here in the node modules
folder if all Z are angular2 material
packages have been installed and we can
check it here in the node modules folder
by opening up the add angular2 material
subfolder we you can see exactly the
four packages we specified are now in
kora Cart button and icon and then we
can check if the Hema GS library has
been installed successfully as well and
here you can see it's a Weibull Emily
yes it's in the node modules folder and
the last thing we need to check if if
the Taipings the corresponding
homogeneous topics have been installed
and this is done here in the Taipings
directory in the global subfolder and
here you can see the Taipings are away
both ok now that we have unchecked that
all the components are available within
our project we need to add those
packages to our system Shia's
configuration because remember we are
using system GS as the module loader in
our application and the module loader
needs to be aware of those new packages
and needs to know where to find the
corresponding library files ok adding
something to our system GS configuration
is done
and systems yes dot config dot GS and
you can see already all the angular
standard packages are configured and
those packages are configured by using
the universal module definition files
UMD for all those packages you and II
files are available and with you and
defaults is very easy to set up the
configuration which is needed for a
system GS you simply have to add here a
pair consisting of the name of the
module and then add the surahs where the
corresponding module UMD file can be
found and that is basically all which is
needed to configure the system GS loader
because all the detailed information are
available in this Universal module
definition file UMD file and that is all
the systems we as the loader needs to
know and the same way is applicable for
the material packages we now want to
bring in and we do it here in the map
object just adding some and entries here
ok we need to add in total 4 entries
because we have installed 4 material
components in in total and we start by
adding the core package first
so we need to say what's module name
it's at angular 2 material slash core
and then we are specifying that 0 is a
UMD file and that UMD file should be
used for a configuration and the source
of the D&amp;amp;D file it's in the node modules
folder which can be
shortened here with NPM and then in
angular2 material folder chorus up
folder and then the file is called core
UMD GS
okay the same needs to be done for all
the other packages so just copy it one
two three
mmm so for entries in total and then we
can do it for from the card package for
the button package for the icon package
and then we need to adapt the parts as
well you will need card and here we need
button and button dot u d dot GS and for
the icon that's the same it's in the
icon subfolder and the UMD file is
called icon dot u and d GS so that's all
what needs to be added here to the
system GS configuration file ok now is
that the system in GS configuration is
ready we can continue with adding those
new modules to our application module
and that is done by switching over to
app dot Mario dot t-- s and then first
importing from the angular 2 material
packages and we need to import the
following things first import MMD cut
module
from at angular2 material slash card so
the all Z card components are made
available by using the md card module
and once we have imported that module we
can edit as a dependency here to our
application module by adding md card
module as a second item here in the
array which is assigned to the imports
property so just edit here md card
module and next we can import the module
for the button components and that is
called MD button module and that is
important from the add angular team
material package selection button and
edit here to the array as well
MD button module okay and then we need
assert import statement which is
importing the MD icon module from this
package needs to be added here as well
and the last thing which needs to be
imported here is the following MD icon
registry because that is a service
provider which is needed to supply our
application with Z icons and that is
imported from the ED angular2 material
icon package as well but the system CMD
item registry object is not added to the
imports
arrey because it is a provider and to
add a provider to our application module
we need to bring in another property
here in the decorator and that property
is called providers okay so the
providers property is receiving an array
as well and we need to add our MD icon
registry provider here tz2 ray and the
icon registry okay so that is all what
needs to be added here to our
application module and now we are ready
to go to use our material components
within the template okay to use the
material components within our template
we switch to app dot component dot t-- s
because it is a component where we are
going to use those new components and
the first thing we are going to
implement here is to change the add
component decorator from using an inline
template as you can see here to you
using an external template to keep
things a little bit more separate we
will do so by just deleting the template
here and replacing the template property
by the template URL property okay and
then by using template URL we can assign
an external template file and we do so
by let's say specifying that the
template file should be in the app
folder and should be called F dot
component dot HTML and of course this
file is not existing yet and we
need to create it here in the app folder
so let's say new file and let's say app
component dot HTML so there it is and
now we can bring in our template code
and I've already prepared a template
which we can use here so I will quickly
copy and paste in this template code and
here you can see we are starting right
away with using material components we
are using the MD card element here
several times it's just to to get a nice
layout and then we are placing some
button elements here inside the MD card
by using classes which are provided by
the material framework we are using MD
button class here to just get a standard
material button another thing we can do
is use MD raised button here to get a
button which is not on the in the
default flat design which is a little
bit raised we will see it in a minute
how it looks like here in the next card
section we are specifying an icon button
by using the MD icon button class and we
are assigning an icon here by using the
MD icon HTML element okay and then you
can see we are applying not only the MD
icon button class but all the using
something which is called MDF app and MD
mini fab and by using that two classes
you can produce a resulting button which
is of a circular layout and yes although
displayed with a button with which I
come as you can see here we are using
the plus icon which is called it
and display at one time in a in a mini
mini circular button and then in a
bigger circular button the next section
MD card is containing buttons which are
displayed by using the MD raised button
class and at the same time gets applied
a color the last section MD card is
containing buttons of y11 a default
button MD button one button in a raised
layout and one button in as a mini
circular layout and all those buttons
get another attribute and that is a
displayed attribute just to give you an
example of how those buttons do look
like when they are displayed okay so now
that the template is already we can go
on and start our application but it's
one thing still missing we need to add
first and that is a thing which needs to
be added to index.html so we have it
here and what needs to be added is a
link element because we are using the
material icons package and material Alki
cons are displayed by using a special
google font for that and this form that
needs to be added here to our index.html
and we added here just in the header
section so you can see it here and
that's the font we need to edit the
material icons font family and that is a
default formed the icon library so using
okay now we are ready to go start up our
application and see what the result look
like in the browser so just switch over
to the terminal and
here I'm in the project folder and
simply can type in NPM start the start
of the application and what we'll get
back is a list of arrows regarding to
some um checks from the typescript
compiler and it gives us a whole list of
errors here and that is because we have
an unmet peer dependency regarding the
typescript version and we need to change
that and update our project
configuration to contain typescript -
and we can use it by going back to
package.json and here in the Deaf
dependencies section you can see that
the typescript is at least worth one
point eight point ten and that is not
sufficient for the angular 2 material
component library we need to update
typescript to be at least a 2.0 point Oh
save that file go back to our terminal
once again say npm install to update
typescript just takes a second here ok
now it's installing typescript ok there
it is and we can again say npm start and
now we get the result in the browser and
can see that we have as a result a page
containing all our buttons here a button
and a flat design button in the race
design here a button with an icon on the
button a button with an icon and with
circular design buttons with different
colors and in the last section a few
buttons which are disabled
okay now if you take a look a closer
look at the resulting page here you can
maybe recognize that we have four
sections because we have been defining a
template which contains four card
elements but you can see that the result
is not optimal because here is no
spacing between the sections and
therefore it's very hard to recognize
that we are dealing with four card
sections here and that is maybe not the
result we want to have so let's do one
final final change to the project and
add some CSS code to get the result to
look a little bit better let's go over
to our project again so let me get it
back here it is okay and we go back to
our component definition and let's add
one property to the add component
decorator and that property is named
style URLs okay
and again this property is receiving an
array of elements but we are only using
one element here and that element is a
string which is containing the parse to
to a CSS file and let's say that we
create a new file which is called a
component dot CSS which is containing
the CSS code which is the relevant for
rossette component okay so that's all we
need and then of course we need to add
that file as well so it's called Epke
component CSS and then we can bring in
some styling and maybe you remember if
we take a look at our template HTML file
here we have already applied
the class app content to the top-level
div element and now we can use that
class here in our styling okay let's go
back and then we add some styling for
exactly that class and we adding some
padding here let's say 20 pixels this
should be sufficient so the next thing
we need is not only a padding for the
complete content section we also would
like to add a margin for each card
section and we can also do it in the
same way so this time we are saying app
content because it is a class and then
apply a styling to all zmd card element
within the div element where the class
is applied and we say margin again 20
pixels okay and now we can see that the
result is automatically updated and this
result of course looks it looks much
better because now we are able to
recognize that we are dealing with four
card areas here and in each cloud area
there are several buttons and the card
areas are divided by some spacing thank
