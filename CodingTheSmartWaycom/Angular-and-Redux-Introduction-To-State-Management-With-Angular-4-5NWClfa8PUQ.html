Kony the smart way calm end in this new
tutorial I'd like to give you an
introduction of how to build an angular
application with redux and as you might
already know redux as a survivor II
which introduced a central state
management in your application so if
your application grows bigger and starts
to consists of multiple components and
you want to share on the state or let's
say the data between components it's
very easy if you introduce central state
management and redux is a pattern which
makes it very easy and so let's in this
video explore the building blocks of a
redux and then see how you can start an
angular application from scratch a real
word sample application and implement
Redux within your application to share
the state between components okay
so let's first take a look at the sample
application we are going to build in
this tutorial so that you can see what's
the the outcome this is a sample
application
it's an angular 4 application and you
can see it's a simple to do manager we
have two components here we have one
component which displays information
like last update total items and include
a button to delete all to-do items from
the list and then we have a second
component which includes a simple form
here to enter new to-do items and which
contains the list output so you can see
how this application is working if I may
be at some items here so let's say I
want to do is finish the implementation
it's me who is responsible then I click
on create and
can see it's added here to the list of
to do's and here I have the information
to do description responsible and
priority and I have a delete button so I
can delete that one item here maybe I
can add another to-do item here let's
say write tutorial and pull it on high
so you can see it here
another another row here in my table and
now I can hit delete here so you can see
the element is removed from that list I
can insert it again and if I here hit on
on any of those buttons and initiate a
user action the last update information
here is updated and you can see the
total number of items is always updated
to you the total number of items
displayed here in the list so let's add
another item here and you can see again
updated now it says total items 3 so
this is part of the central state
management I'm using multiple components
but all components access a central data
store and so the information is always
updated in all of the places here in the
application so I can hit delete all and
then everything is gone you can see it
here is the list is empty now total
items are 0 again that's basically the
application we are going to build with
Redux implemented in that application ok
so before actually starting with the
implementation part of this tutorial
let's quick take a look at the main
building blocks of redux and redux is
the library which is often associated
was react as you might know reactors
also a web Alva Script web framework for
building single page web application but
redux
in general is a library which can be
used with any
modern JavaScript based web framework
like angular and Redux is is a general
concept so it can be used with any
framework and the building blocks Redux
introduces are always the same so it
makes sense now to you before actually
start implementing take a look at the
main building blocks so you can see it
here Redux organizes your application
state in a store and this is a single
data structure in your application the
components of your application and then
read the state of the application from
that store so the state is managed by by
the store and the store is never mutated
directly that's important instead an
action or actions are dispatched to the
store and then those actions are handed
over to a reducer function and that
reducer function is taking care it
creates a new application state which
then contains the updates the action is
making to the data and then returning
that new state and this new state as
then replacing the old state in the
store so the state is not much mutated
always a new state with the updates
included is generated by the reducer and
then again returned to the store and all
the components which read is a state
from the store getting notified and can
make use of that updated set of data so
the redux a website can be found at the
redux dot J's arc so if you would like
to take a look at the redux framework
and go into all the details you can
always take a look here at the website
it has a detailed documentation it's
explaining all the basics you need to
know it's also explaining advanced stuff
and you will get examples along the way
so just take a look at the website if
you would like to dive deeper into redux
ok so now that you have a basic
understanding of what redux and central
state management is let's directly start
with the implementation part and start
building our sample angular application
with the redux pattern applied so the
first step to initiate a new angular 4
project is as it's the easiest way is to
use the angular command line interface I
have already installed the angular CLI
and the angular command line interface
gives you a new command which is called
ng and you can use that command with the
opt new and followed by the project name
let's say angular redux on their to-do
and a new angular project is generated
as you can see here it's downloading the
template and then installing all the
dependencies via NPM here this takes a
second ok here we are you can see
everything has been installed
successfully and now we can change into
the newly created project directory and
within that project the directory just
try out that everything has been
installed and it's working by starting
up the development web server which is
done by ng surf command so this command
is starting up the web server its
bundling all the stuff in your
application and then it's running your
application on localhost of course port
4200 so you can see it's compiled
successfully and then I can change back
to the browser and sees it it's running
here on localhost pot 4200 that's the
angular 4 default application and that
gives you the feedback that everything
is running and ready for being extended
with
or application requirements okay I have
already opened up the project folder
here in Visual Studio code now the first
thing we need to do is we need to add
Redux to our project at the library
and to do that I'm opening up the
integrated terminal here so you can see
it here
and now I'm using the NPM command and
let's say npm install we need to read
exit itself and then we need a package
which is called angular - redux slash
store and that is the redux angular
implementation we will be using there
are different redux implementation for
angular a Weibull the add angular -
redux slash storuman tation as an
implementation which is very easy to
understand because it's in most cases
pure redux so I'm using that
implementation here okay then let's say
save so that both dependencies are added
to our package dot JSON file here in the
project and I'm hitting return here you
can see it here it's downloading those
packages and installing those packages
into the node underscore modules folder
within our project so here we are both
dependencies have been added
successfully okay so let's begin the
implementation by adding a new file
within the SRC folder and let's say new
file and I'm naming that file with store
dot T s so we will be implementing the
redux store first and now first of all
we are implementing it in a very simple
way so I'm saying export interface I
have
State so and I'm leaving that interface
empty for the moment so that is our
state object and later on we will be
adding the properties we would like to
manage here in the central state till
that interface time and I'm implementing
as well a function here which is my
reducer function so I call it root
producer and I'm defining that this
function should take two parameters the
old state and the action which is
dispatched okay and then I'm saying a
return status so that the most simple
way of implementing a would reduce a
function or a reducer function because
the reducer now simply takes the old
state and returns it without making any
any changes to a new state object but of
course this is what we will implementing
next okay so now I would like to add the
properties here to the I AB state
interface and basically we do need two
properties here to manage the data which
is needed for implementing our to do
sample application first of all we need
to have an array of to do so I'm calling
it reduce and then play okay it's off
type I to do and it needs to be an array
of course the I to do interface has not
been implemented yet and that is
something we will be doing in the next
steps that's the first one and then a
second property which is needed here is
the last update property because we
would like to print out as you saw
before in the application when the list
of the do's has last been updated and
that is a property where we are storing
the date information in so it needs to
be off time date okay and then I'm
heading
another object here and this needs to be
a contest object and I call it initial
state and it should be of type I app
state and I'm defining this initial
state here because I'd like to assign
the values to the state properties which
should be set initially when we later on
in attach on that store to our
application we can use the initial state
cons of checked here from that file to
you initialize as a state with some the
values which are part of that object so
I'm saying to use needs to be an empty
array initially and last update as no
update has happened needs to be now okay
or you can see it's underlining I to do
ret and you can also see that problem
here and the problem step cannot find
name how to do that's quite clear
because we have not implemented the I to
do interface
up until now and that is what we now
need to to do I'm creating a new father
first again here in the app folder and
this file is named to do don TS and here
in that file I'm implementing that
missing interface I'm saying export
interface to do and then I'm adding the
properties which I needed to make a
Weibull for every single to-do item
the first one is ID of type number the
second is I need a description here
needs to be of type spring
then I would like to have a responsible
information for every to do element of
time string then I'd like to have a
priority and feels completed flag which
is of type a boolean okay now my
interface is a way well here and to do
dot TS and now I can go back to store
dot TS and add the following import
statement here on top so I'm importing
that interface I to do from to do ok now
you can see the problem is gone
no red underline here I to do is now
implemented and Weibo and I have defined
which properties should be available for
each signal to do item in my application
now the next thing we need to do is to
activate the store and the state for our
application and this is done in epidural
dot es here we need to add an import
statement first so let's edit here on
top of its import ng redux and ng redux
module from the angular the redux store
package ok
then we do need to add a second import
statement and we need to import i ever
state route producer and our initial
state object from store ts like so and
with those imports available we can now
add as a constructor to the class
implementation of app module and use a
constructor to inject the ng Redux
service here to our application and that
is done by defining energy redox
parameter here for the constructor which
is of type ng Redux and lettuce of type
I error state like so and now within the
constructor we can use the injects redox
service object so ng redox dot and Kanzi
configure store method here which takes
two parameters the first parameter is
our reducer function and the second
parameter is the initial state of our
store and the initial state should be
what is inside our initial understood
underscore state object so we are
handing initial unders scores state over
here to the configured store call ok and
that is the code we need to set our
store with our reducer function
active in our application and at the
same time initialize our store with the
property values which are inside of
initial harness call state
okay so now we can go back to the
browser and check what's the state of
the application here and you can see we
get back one error note provider for
anti Redux and the reason this error
occurs is that we need to add ng Redux
module here to use the imports array of
the ng module decorator here as well so
if re add that module here okay and then
recheck the application here in the
browser you can see now it's working the
error is done our store is set up
successful in our application and now we
can continue implementation with
defining the action types which we want
to use in our application so the reducer
function should be able to handle on our
action types which are used throughout
our application and each action type is
identified by a simple string but it's
always advisable to not use it string
directly instead we will prepare
constants containing that string so that
we can use those constants as throughout
our application and that makes it a
little bit easier to not include any
typos and the string so let's start I'm
creating a new file here inside the app
folder and name that file actions
dot TS and within that file I need to
define for action types in total so
let's start with the first one so I'm
using the Const keyword here the first
one is the add to do action and I set it
equal to the string add to do
second one should be toggled to do so
that we can toggle between is completed
set true and is completed set to false
for every to-do item and I'm not signing
on the string identifier here of toggle
on the squad to do so the next one is
remove to do and the string us again
remove to do and the last action the
user is able to dispatch to the store is
remove all to do actions which is set to
use a string remove underscore all
underscore to do this okay haven't
prepared those action tabs here in
actions dot TS we can now go back in our
file store dot TS and first of all
import those four action types here is
to importing yet to do toggle to do
remove to do and remove underscore all
underscore two deuce
like so from our actions TS file okay
like so now we can make use of those
action types and add the implementation
for our reducer function here in wood
reducer and the first thing I'd like to
add here is a switch statement and the
switch statement is implemented for act
and dot type because in action dot type
we get the action type string which has
been dispatched to the store and is now
handled by our reducer function here and
the switch statement now makes use of
our defined string constants and I'm
using the case statement here now for
all of the for defined action types so
the first is again add to do let's add
the case statements here so the second
is talker to do the next term again
remove to do in the last case statement
here is for remove all taboos okay so
okay let's start with implementing the
first case here and to do and what we
now need to do for every case here is to
create a new state object where the
changes are applied and then returns
this new state object so that it is
replaced in the store and becomes active
so first of all add to do so we
start here was actually not to do dot by
D so in action dot to do we can expect
to get handed over the new to-do item
which should be added to our state and
then let's update that ID information
here just with state dots to do dot
length plus one and then we are
returning the new state object and the
new state object is created by using
object dot assign we are starting with
an empty object here and then we are
adding the old state and we are adding
the new the new to-do item here so let's
add it here to the troduce array by
using state dot two deuce so that is
your state object stay 2.2 deuce and
then concat and with a concat method we
can now concatenate a new array or let's
say a new object which contains our new
to do element and again I'm calling here
the object dot assign method to create a
new object and then pass in an empty
object again and then say actually dot
to do okay and then we are updating the
last update property here as well with a
new date so that it contains is the
actual date now okay so that is the
first case now let's implement the
second case toggle to do so talking to
do we need first to retrieve the to do I
for which he is completed flag should be
toggled and we do that by defining your
and you've are to do and then saying
state which contains the odd state then
accessing the traduce array and then
executing the find mess as a fine method
and here we are using a method which is
doing the filtering we are using the fat
arrow syntax here so T becomes T ID
equals action ID because we are
expecting to get in action toward easy
on D of Z to do element which should be
set to is complete or is completed
should be removed so then we have the
two item a Weibull here and then we can
retrieve the index of the array for that
element of course so let's say index
equals state to deuce index off and then
we are handing over that to do element
and we are getting in return the index
so now we need to create our new state
object with Z is completed property
being updated for that specific element
in that array and again I'm using the
return statement here and then I'm
called an object sign to create a new
object which first of all consists of an
empty object so that is the basis here
and then we were adding the old state
here and now we are handing over the
object with the changes we would like to
apply ok so within that new object of
course we need the produced property
again and that is an array and within
that array now we need to add four
of all all the elements before the
current to do element for which the es
completed property should be changed and
that is achieved by using the spread
operator here and then saying the the
spread operator is three dots basically
and is expanding that array and then
selecting all the elements before our
index and that is done by saying state
dot - duce dot slice and we are starting
with index zero and then selecting all
elements until the index is reached okay
that's the first thing we need to add
here and then the second thing is the
current to do element itself but we see
updated is completed information and we
do that by creating a new object here
again with object assign so the old to
do element and then what we would like
to update you'll see is completed
information or property to use the
opposite value so exclamation mark to do
is completed to turn it into the other
side and then finally we don't do not
need to forget to add all the array
elements after the index element and
that is done in the same way like we did
it for the elements before the index so
we are using the spread operator here
saying state dot reduce and then using
slice and starting with the index plus
one of course
so then we need to enter the last update
property here as well with a new date
new date value okay okay so let's go on
with implementing the remove to do case
here and now we need to remove the the
exact one element which is handed over
with that action from the today's array
and return a new object and use state
object where this array is updated and
this object has been removed so how to
do that we are starting again with a
return statement here and then using
object assign again to create that new
object and starting with an empty object
here adding the old state information
and then adding an object which contains
the updates okay the deduce
arrey here we are assigning the
following thing we are saying State DOT
to Deus which contains all the previous
to Deus and then we are applying a
filter method here and then within that
filter method handing over again a
method which is filtering out that one
element and that is done again he was
using the fat arrow syntax so it's T dot
ID is not equal to an action ID so that
element is filtered out and the last
update information is again set a new
date okay like so so last one remove or
to do this is very simple of course will
return a new state object here again
object assign and then for the new with
a new object here we are setting to use
to just an empty array so that
everything is removed and set the last
update information to new data so that
it contains the Z actual date
information here let's save it and
that's the complete and from
implementation of our reducer function
and now we are able to to use a store in
our application and to dispatch actions
to our store which now can be handled by
our reducer function and they're
updating the store with generating a new
state object which contains the changes
and then setting this new state object
active in the store so that all the
components we will be implementing in
the next
rely on the same set of centrally
managed information so know that all the
redox building blocks are implemented in
our angular application I can start in
the next step with adding the first
component we would like to implement and
that is a to do overview component which
displaces the information of total to-do
items editor or store the last update
information and gives the user the
option to delete all the elements from
the store okay I'm opening up another
terminal here so that I can use the ng
command on the angular command line
interface again to generate a new
component and this is done in the
following way and the G stands for
generate and then I'm saying component
because I would like to generate a
component and I do name the component
term with to do - overview ok hitting
return and from the output you can see
that in total four new files have been
created in our project structure in the
new directory to do - overview here in
the app folder as you can see here F dot
module has been updated so this
component has been automatically added
to our application that we later on can
include that component in our home
main application component template but
first of all let's implement that
component and we will start in to do -
overview dot component dot TS because
that file is containing the class
implementation of the class to do
overview component
now the first thing I need to add here
are a few import statements here on top
I need to import ng redux again a need
to import or select decorated here from
the same library and again its add
angular - redux slash store then I need
to import our state type which is I app
state and this is imported from start es
ok and finally I need to import the
action type I would like to use in that
component and the action type we do need
here is remove underscore or underscore
to do this from actions dot TS okay
now we would like to have access to
store properties within our to do
overview component and the way we can
achieve that is by using the add select
the decorator here to declare class
properties which are connected to stop
properties so let's see how that works
I'm saying add select and saying
introduced so with that statement now I
have internal class property to do and
using that property even in my template
I have no access to that reduce array
from the central application store okay
so my property name is - duze and the
store property to which to do here is
connected is also to do so the matching
is given by the same name if you do not
want to accesses that property was the
same name
you can also hand over a parameter here
string saying - duze and then you can
name it whatever you want but as the
matching is here we do not need to hand
over that string here we can simply say
add select - duze and in the same way we
are using the ant select decorator here
for gaining access to last update
property so that we can output the last
update information here on the
components template as well okay now we
need to inject the ng Redux service here
in our to the overview component class
as well so I need to say private Andy
Redux is of type ng Redux
yeah state ok like so and then we are
defining a new event handler method
which will later on connect with an user
event in our template and that method is
called when the user clicks on delete
all on the Delete all button again we
are naming the asset clear - duze so
what this method should do it
shipped it on clear all the to-do items
within a data in the store and this is
now done by dispatching the remove
underscore all underscore reduce action
to the store and the dispatching is done
by using the NGO redux service object
here and then calling the dispatch
method and handing over the action as an
object and the type of the action is set
to remove underscore underscore to do so
we have imported that a constant here
with the import statement and now we can
use it here okay so next we can continue
with implementing the corresponding
template for to do overview component
but before doing so as I'd like to use
them some bootstrap for CSS classes in
my template I'd like to include
bootstrap in our application here and
the way I'm doing this is going to of
the year bootstrap website here at get
bootstrap comm just opening up the start
page here and on the start page you can
click on the get started link here and
here in the Quick Start section you can
find that we need to add a link Tech in
the section of our a main HTML page and
we need to include a some script tags
and the body section so let's do it
first copy that link element here okay
going back to our code editors and
opening up index dot HTML here and
inserting it a the last element here in
our head sections and going back to the
website copying those three script
elements here going back to the editor
and here pasting in those three script
sections so that is all all all steps
which are needed to include to our
bootstrap for from a content delivery
network here in our application and now
I can go back to the template to do -
overview dot component of HTML remove
the default code here in the template
and start implementing the template code
which we need to I would put the
information of yeah last updated and the
total number of items of to-do items in
our application and the button the
delete all button so that the user can
click on the button and the clear to use
method is called okay so let's get
started so first I'm using paragraph
element here is so P element and I'm
assignments a bootstrap class text -
right ok so within the paragraph I'm
using um spawn our Mandan and I'm
assigning as a class batch
and the class batch - secondary okay
like so and then saying last update here
and then I'm outputting the information
last update so I need to do it in the
following way last update then I need to
apply the assert pipe because last
update is a property which has been
connected with the last update stock
property by using the add select
decorator and when I'm accessing store
properties I need to apply the assumed
pipe here in the template like you can
see it here okay and let's say we are
applying another pipe here and there is
a date pipe and with a date pipe I can
define a format in which the date
information should be outputted and as a
format I'm using the medium time format
okay
the second piece of information I'd like
to include here is the number of total
items total to do items and again it's
done in the same way I'm accessing that
reduce property which is connected to
the today's array which is managed by
our store so I need to apply Xia sync
pipe here again and then I'm accessing
the length property of that array
okay finally we need to include the
button here in our output and I'm
assigning the class BTN and BTN -
primary like so the button gets the text
delete all and I'm connecting the click
event here with event handler method we
have defined earlier implemented earlier
clear reduce okay
so if I now switch back to the browser
and see on the output here of my
application you can see nothing has
happened so far the output of to do
overview component is not yet included
here in the browser output so I need to
change that next and to change that
let's open up five app component HTML
here remove all that default content
here and let's start adding the code and
include the output of our to do overview
component here first of all I'd like to
include a div element here and design
the class container give it an ID here
okay
then I'm using another div here and
assigning the class of card that's again
a bootstrap class and then I'm using a
diff ways card body then an h3 which
cross the signed card - title like so
saying - deuce up here then I'm
including an h6 assigning card -
subtitle class
you
and maybe MB - - and text - muted and
then I'm including the text using
angular and Redux here is a headline so
and now I can include app to do overview
here is a cell the element which is
including is the output of my to-do
overview components template here okay
so let's save it and now I can go back
here and now I can see okay here is the
first part of my application the
headline the status information here was
last update and total items total items
is zero at the moment of course because
we are in the initial State and I
absolutely - all button here I can click
on you can see the last update
information is is appearing here and
total items of course remains zero okay
now we need to add the second component
and that is a to-do list component which
includes two things on the form which is
used to input or to enter new to-do
elements in our application and the list
output is a table output which includes
all the to-do items one per row okay so
to add that new form to our application
again I'm using the angular CLI here
this time I'm saying ng g component and
the name of that component should be to
do - list okay so you can see same
procedure here again for new files are
added in the new folder to do - list and
which is a Weibull here in the app
folder and the new component is
automatically added to our app module
we are ready to go now the four new
files are here so we can start the
implementation but before doing so as
this component should include an angular
form because we want we would like to
offer a form where the user can input
new to do data we need to import the
angular forms module into our
application and the right place to do so
is right here in app dot module dot TS
let's add another module here first the
import statement so its forms module and
we are importing forms module from a
package which is called at angular slash
forms okay that's one of the angular
core packages and then we need to add
forms module here to the imports array
as well okay like so now we are ready to
go
a forms module is imported and we can
start implementing the to-do list
component here right in the TS file okay
here we are
so first of all oh it's end of the
needed import statements here so we need
to import LNG redux again need to import
of the select decorator again it's
imported from add angular - redux slash
store then we need to import our I app
state interface here from store dot TS
next I'd need to import
the action types I'd like to use here on
that component and that is at
underscored to do remove underscore to
do and of course toggle and it's got to
do all those action types are imported
from actions dot ETS like so and finally
I need to import the I to do interface
this one is imported from to do dot es
okay so I said I might import statements
here then the first thing I can do here
in the constructor I can inject ng react
service again sub private ng Redux of
type Angelina's I app state okay like so
and then I would like to have access to
the store property to do here so I'm
using the anti select the decorator
again and define a class property which
is called to do so it's the same name as
a store property here then as I would
like to use a template driven form um
I'm defining a model property here which
is of type I to do and then when
implementing that form in my template
file later on I can bind my input
properties here to the model properties
and let's initialize this model give it
an ID of zero description is an empty
string
responsible as an empty string priority
should be load by default and is
completed should be false by default so
next let's implement the event handler
functions we do need arm in to-do list
component class first of all I need a
submit phone mess it here and so on
submit okay and this method is called
every time the user submits of the to do
entry form and to add the new to-do
element which is available here and
model to our store to the deduce array
was in our store we need to dispatch the
corresponding action and in that case
it's a typo here
it's the add to do action so what I need
to say here is this thought and you
realize dot this patch I'm using the
type here ad to do and then I'm passing
in as a payload here with my action
object the new to do element was
property to do and this is set it is a
start motto okay
next we need the event handler method
toggle to do and this method is taking
in the parameter which is the current
to-do item for which the es completed
property should be toggled so how to do
that again we need to causes dot ng
redux dispatch this time I'm dispatching
an action of type toggle to do and as a
payload I'm adding the ID here ID okay
so add semi-colons here as well and the
last event hello master I do need is the
method I call removed to do and never
should not be should not be removed
unless go to do just remove to do so
let's pass in another to do element I'd
like to remove and then dispatch the
corresponding action to the store its
type remove underscore to do and as a
payload we are passing in the ID of the
action we would like to remove okay so
it's the same here to do dot ID okay
so let's switch over to the template
here in to do - list component of HTML
removing the default HTML code which is
inside that file here a Weibull and then
starting over with implementing our akka
new template first let's use
h6 element you define a headline here
which should be great to do so the first
thing we would like to implement it the
form so I didn't need a form element
here now play the ng submit event should
be bound to the on submit event handler
method and then I need to define the to
do form template very variable here and
assign the string and reform okay within
that form element let's start with a
diff and the diff should be assigned the
class which is called form row okay then
another div inside with class called -
Auto so these are all bootstrap four
classes and then I'd like to define my
first input element here so its input
and this should be of type text like so
then I'd like to assign the class form
control here
let's say we would like to have a
placeholder here which is saying
description the ID is description and
then I'm connecting here my input
control to my model and that is done by
binding and remodeler in both ways to
model dot description so this is two-way
data-binding here I need to give it a
name which is description as well and I
need to define the description template
variable here and I'm assigning ng model
here
so okay let's close it that is my first
input element maybe we can break it a
little bit down here so
okay so the next element let's copy that
section here and insert it a second time
for the second input element should be
for the responsible so you're changing
the placeholder here the ID as well so
the data binding is done for model not
responsible
the name is responsible in that case and
the name of the template arrival is
responsible as well okay so the next
input element should be a select element
so that the user can select a priority
by selecting from a drop down list if a
priority should be low medium or high
let's start with a new dip here again
the class call dish auto should be
assigned here okay then I need a select
element we are assigning the class form
- control again ID is priority we are
binding the value of that input element
to model dot priority giving it the name
of priority
in defining the template of arrival here
okay so that's the Select element okay
let's make it a little bit more readable
here so okay within that a select
element we now need three options so the
first option is slow
NeXT's medium and finally final option
here is high claim like so and then the
last input element is a submit button so
again a diff of column called - auto and
within the diff let's define that button
here should be of class b TN and b TN -
primary pay grade so type of set button
should be submit okay here we are
so to check if everything in our
template what we have implemented so far
is working adding this chart component
to AB component or HTML as well so I'm
including here a new element app to do
list okay and then I'm going back to the
browser as you can see here saying we
have a template a parse error app to-do
list is an unknown element okay there is
a typo in a problem
it's to do list
okay here we are now you can see the
output is containing both of the output
of our first component and the output of
our second component here now I'm ready
to use a form here
you know let's say to do item 1 and
create new elements and you can see it
here this new element is edit or
wirelessly to our store the total items
count is now 1
but of course we cannot see that element
because we have no table output included
yet and that is the next thing we are
going to add to the template code of to
do list component the table output so
let's switch back to the code and open
up to do - list component dot HTML again
and let's start adding more template
code here so let's start with a new
headline here no should be in h6 instead
so and the headline here is to do this
list and then I do need to first if
element here and we're using that diff
to include all the ng-if directive here
and assign the following expression so
to do this we are reading out that
reduce array from the store so we need
to use the async pipe here again okay
and then read out the length property
which
be not 0 because we only want to
displace a table which is following now
inside the death if we have to do items
in that reduce array and if that is not
the case the complete section which is
included here should not be with a bow
and that is exactly what we are
achieving by using the ante if directive
here okay so now let's implement the
table and let's start with a tea head
element inside of the table here and
assign of the class t hat - inverse like
so so table row and then we have a th
element here the first one is including
the ID the second one is including the
to deal scription next one is risk
including the headline for the respond
support column and the last one is
including the head lamp for priority and
then I need one column in addition which
has no headline because that is a column
where I would like to place the delete
button which should be label for each
row in my table
okay so here right behind the closing
tag of the tea head element let's start
with tea body and
with auntie boy I'm using the TR element
the table row element and I'm using here
is the ng 4 directive to loop over the
deduce array and print out one TR
element which corresponds to one row in
the table for each to-do item available
in might reduce array so I need to
assign the following expression string
here or let T off to dues and now again
see a sink pipe here okay and now I'm
inside my row and then I can print out
all the information in my row which I do
need for the five columns I have defined
here in my table so I do need a few TD
elements here so one two three four five
so in the first column let's use the
spawn element here and yes let's print
out T dot R deep
so in the second column we are printing
out t description next column we are
printing out T dot very responsible and
priority
okay
so we can check it here in the output
let's insert a new to-do item okay here
we are you can see the table output is
available I can enter the second item
here maybe put it to medium and I get a
second row here so max let's add of the
button here shortly of class p TN and
BTN primary again okay and the click
event of that button is connected to the
remove to do event handler method and we
are passing in the current to-do item as
T here and the button contains the text
delete okay and now with that button
let's check it out here in the result
I'm able to delete that item and you can
see here as I delete that item the total
items count is again going back to zero
so the information in my second
component here is automatically updated
as both components are accessing the
same store now let's change the output
of the priority information a little bit
I'd like to get that output as a colored
badge so let's
let's remove that here and we will do
the following here we will have a span
element here and the first parliament is
outputting the batch in green color for
a low priority so we're using the ng-if
directive here and say T dot priority
should be equal to low if this is the
case we are assigning the class batch
and batch - success and we are printing
out low now we need to copy that span
element here and insert it as second and
a third time here for the corresponding
priority values so medium and high
medium high and as I would like to have
a different color here and need to
change the second CSS class here for
medium it's batch - warning to display
it in an orange color and for high
should be displayed in red color so I'm
assigning batch - danger here try it out
again so I - one with low priority now
you can see it's displaying a batch in
green color adding a second item medium
you can see the orange color here assert
item with priority set to high in red
color so now you can see the total items
count is three always updated the last
update information is also always
updated and I can use the delete all
button here of course to delete all the
items from the list
so back in our code one last function is
missing the user should have the option
to toggle the is completed state and to
do so the user should be able to click
on either the our DS a description of
the responsible text information and the
toggle should be executed so let's add a
click event handler here to the spawn
tag and this click event handler is
connected to the toggle to do event
handler method we're passing in the
current to do object here let's copy
that edition and insert it here in the
second span element and assert a spawn
how amend as well and now what should
happen of course a taco to do function
is turning the is completed information
for that to do element in the store to
the upper side so if is completed is
false it's turning it to true and if
it's true already it's toggling back to
false the user should be aware of the
state by displaying the to-do item if it
is completed already with line through
so the description and the responsible
and idea should be displayed in line
through mode if is completed it's not
set so if it is false a line through
should be done of course so we are
achieving that behavior by using the
binding syntax here and defining class
dot completed ok
and assigning the following string TDOT
is completed so only when this
expression is true the completed class
is set here so we apply that to all
three elements here
okay and then finally of course we need
to define the completed a CSS class and
we can do that in the to do - list
component dot CSS file here and say
class completed text - decoration should
be line through okay so check it in the
browser again let's insert again a
sample item here if I now click on it
you can see it's displayed line through
easily is completed property is set and
if I click again on this element of the
line through style is taken away is
completed is again set to false so
everything is working as expected and
now you can see is a real power of using
Redux in this application we are only
dealing with two components so far so
it's easy to keep the overview but I'm
very sure you can imagine if your
application is growing and you have a
lot of components and all components try
to work on the same data and you are
trying to keep everything up to date
it's very easy to work with the redux a
pattern here storing all the information
in a centralized store and then all the
components can work with that store and
all components share the same current
set of data and yeah it's very easy to
to keep the overview if your application
is growing okay so we are done because
this one's about stem from coding the
smart way calm sense it's very much for
