runway comm and today in this video
tutorial I'd like to show you how to
implement a real word you J has two
application and we will do so by using a
package which is called you - resource
and with that package we are able to use
the HTTP service to request data from an
external rest-based API so stay tuned ok
so let's take a look at the application
we are going to both in this tutorial
and you can see it here it's a simple
user interface and from the start page
we are able to select a news source from
hosts from a drop-down list here and you
can see we have has options to choose
from various news websites available
blogs and so on and you can simple
selector on one entry maybe Alex used
BuzzFeed here and you can see by
selecting that entry the website is
automatically updated with the latest
news article headlines from the website
you can see here is a short description
about BuzzFeed you can go to the website
by using that button here then it's
opening box vidcom and of course you can
click on any of the headlines and then
the article website is opened as well ok
and now we can select another a news
website for example google news here and
you can see it's automatically updated
with the latest headlines without the
need of reloading the page so to
retrieve all the news the news articles
and
the corresponding headlines and
description of texts and so on we are
using an external ITI and that's of the
news api dot org service and you can
register here to get an api key and
later on we will need that api key
so error from now you can just sign up
here and by using your email address and
choose a password and then you will get
an april i key which is needed for the
implementation part later on in to
access let the rest service here the
news APRs service we are going to use a
package which is called view resource
and that enables us to make HTTP calls
and get requests to that service and to
retrieve the data from the new sources
we would like to display ok so now that
it has an idea of how our result should
look like at the end let's start with
our implementation part let's switch
over to the terminal and we will
initiate a new view jsq application by
using the view command-line interface so
if you have not installed around the
view command already on your system you
can do so by using NPM install - JEE for
installing it globally on your system
and then the package name to view client
ok so I have already installed our new
command line interface who I do not need
to install it again and to initiate a
new project we are using the view
command in the following form let's say
you in it for initiating a new project
then we need to say webpack because we
want to have to be template to be used
here which is based on the web tech
module loader and then just give name
for our project and we call it vu news
and then hit enter to start on the
downloading
says okay and you can see it here we are
asked some questions but most of the
questions we can just answer with the
default arm which is given here
okay runtime compiler
I do not want to use ESL and I do not
want to set up unit tests with karma and
mocker so I'm setting no again and
end-to-end test was not watch I I'm
saying no again okay here we are
and now we can enter the new project
directory and the next thing we need to
do is to execute npm install to download
and install all the project dependencies
okay so that takes the second to
complete ok installation has been
completed successfully all the
dependencies have been downloaded and
installed into our project folder and
now we can test all the initial setup of
our project by typing in npm run death
that is starting up the development web
server on port 8080 and you can see by
starting the server up the the
application is automatically loaded here
in the browser and that is a default
output without having made any adaptions
yet to the project and now in the next
step we can start the implementation
okay so now the first thing we need to
know in this new beauty a new project is
the bootstrap framework and we are
including bootstrap by using the
bootstrap resources from a content
delivery network and so if I switch over
here to my code editor that ethically
you can see have already opened up our
view news project and here is a
structure and the main entry point of
course is index.html and that's the
place I would like in the next step
to include the bootstrap part and to
include bootstrap from CDN we can switch
to get bootstrap calm and open up the
getting started page and if I scroll a
little bit down you can see here the
section will see headline bootstrap CDN
and here is the code which is needed to
include bootstrap arm from from content
delivery network and we do need to copy
and past two things to our index.html
first we need the stylesheet here is
it's the soiltac so let's grab this and
copy it here into on the head section
okay the next thing I do need is the
script text here that's the main good
strip JavaScript file so copy it switch
back to Adam and I pass it here in the
bottom of my body section okay and then
I need announcing and that jQuery
because bootstrap does need jQuery to to
to run and jQuery can also be included
from a content delivery network and your
corresponding link can be found here on
KOAT jQuery calm and I'd like to use
jQuery three point X and would like to
use minified version here and if I click
on that link it gives me that script tag
here so that I can copy it and go back
to index.html and insert this jQuery
link right above my my script tag for
the bootstrap Mendota KS file here okay
so next thing is to install the we
resource package because we want to make
use of the services which are in the
view resource a package to be able to to
make HTTP requests to our external API
later on so the first step is to install
the package and this is done by using
NPM again so I'm here in the project
directory and now I'm using the NPM
command in the following way install at
the first parameter and then the Year
package names it's view - resource and
I'm also using the flag - - safe to arm
make sure that this new dependency is
also stored within our package JSON file
and the project so let's execute it here
and now it's downloading all the package
and install and view resource into the
node modules folder again here you can
see it's completed so now the resource
is a Weibull ok the next thing now that
we have view resource package installed
we need to make our view instance aware
of this new package and we do that by
opening up the main dot ojs file here in
the source folder you can see it here
and I'm adding another input statement
on top of the file and I'm imparting a
view resource from the view resource
package of course and the next thing I
need to do is to call the method view
don't use and pass only resource
okay so by using this command we we are
attaching on the view resource plug-in
to our view instance and with that line
of code label here we have to make sure
that of the HTTP service from this
package is available to our components
and later on we can use that service to
send HTTP requests to the external KPI
of new service to the dock so now here
you can see um when creating the new
view instance the add component is a
main component of our application so for
the next implementation step I'm
switching over to FW because that is a
file where the implementation of the
main app component is in and you can see
it here and I can see um it's already
including a default template here and
some styling and of course the component
configuration object and now let's start
with first removing let's say the Year
template code which is inside the main
div tag here because we do not need that
term then let's remove on the input
statement for the hello component
because the header component will not be
part of our project of course and we can
remove it here from the components
object as well and then let's remove
let's remove the styling okay so now we
can start our component on the template
of our component should and should
consist of two pieces we will split it
up into components the first component
will be called self selection and that
is a component which contains the code
which is needed to output with selection
list for news sources and the second
component we would like to implement is
the news list component and that is a
component which is responsible for
outputting the list term of news
articles so two components and the first
thing now we we implement here in FW is
to to include both components which will
be implemented Lego on here in the
template in the main this section and we
do that by just saying source selection
that's the first component ok like so
soft selection let's close it here and
the next element is News list click so
and we will give us the development here
a clause of container that's a bootstrap
class ok and now we need to bring in to
import statements here in our script
section of course and the first import
is source selection from the component
subfolder sauce collection this simply
means that we later on need to create a
file source selection of you within the
component subfolder to implement that
component and the second file we are
importing or is a second component is
News list of course and news list is
imported from components again
and the file is called news list go to
view so okay the next thing we need to
adhere to the object which is assigned
to component we need to add both
components as well so we need to say
size selection and news list and that it
will project with it for being able to
use those components here in our
components template and okay now we are
expecting our data model to contain one
num1 property so let's say data and
we're returning an object here with the
property included and the property is
Soros and initially we set it to an
empty string so in that property will
now be used to first get the information
from the source selection component
which source which new source has been
selected by the user and then pass that
information on to the news list
component so that is the news list
component knows from which source to
retrace the article headlines and yeah
retrieves the articles and display the
list of articles so we now need to set
up the communication between those
components and the helper which is
organizing that the term communication
here in app component is our data
property source okay now we need to set
up our implementation so that our VRS
has a selection which is a Weibull here
in our data property
is passed to the newest component and
therefore we are expecting the newest
component to to have one input property
and we are using the rebind
directive to bind that input property
which should be current source to our
app component property sauce so we need
to say here shelves as well and that
makes assure that the newest component
is receiving but news list our sauce
option which has been selected by the
user but of course we need a second step
we need to make sure that the source
property is always updated when a new
selection in source selection component
has to be made and there is a second
step here so for the second step we are
expecting the source selection
implementation to to define or to have a
custom event type which is called
has changed and this event type has to
be emitted by the source selection
component each time a new selection is a
label and we can now bind on to that
event by using to be on directive here
and then they saw changed that should be
the custom event and then and then
assign a string and the string is the
name of the event handler method and
that should be solved changed as well
and of course now we need to implement
that event handler method here in our
components configuration object and let
me add another property here and that
property is methods and methods is
object containing the methods of Earth
component and the one method we now want
to implement
of course sauce changed play function
and so it's changed is getting the
parameter sauce that is the user
selection and then the implementation is
really simple we only need to set this
source this is our internal data
property - - source okay and that make
sure that our source is always updated
when a new selection comes in in
components of selection and as source is
all also bind against the source input
property of news list it's passed on to
news list and useless is later on
watching changes to the input property
and each time it changes its updating
the output with a new new new source and
with the new articles retrieved from
better source okay finally for the
implementation app dot view let's add
one last styling element here and we
want to have a heading arm on top which
is 20 pixels okay that's all for active
view and now let's continue the
implementation by creating a new
component the source selection component
we've already included here and yeah
implement that component okay now you
can see I have already prepared two new
house here within components that use
lists of you and source selection W and
if we take a look inside you can see
it's just the just the initial
implementation of a typical view jsq
single file component we have the
template section included here with the
development and we have the script a
section here which is exporting the
component configuration object with a
name property assigned to the
it is in string which is containing the
name of that component and the status
section here and if I switch over to
News list of you you can say it's
basically the same so let's start with
the source of the selection dot view and
with the implementation inside now let's
add in the first step here to the
component configuration object again
data function which is returning the
data model of that component and the
data model is of course a very simple
one we need two properties the first
thing we need is of course a list called
for sources which are presented to the
user so that the user can select a
specific new source and that a list of
sources will be available in an array
and that array is called sources and
initially it's just an empty array and
then of course we need another property
and that property is called source and
that is holding a single information the
new stars which have been selected by
the user so the current news service is
stored within the source property so we
are defining salts and we need to
include it in a return statement here so
that of object is returned here and okay
like so okay that that's the data model
of source selection component and and
now let's continue with the
implementation of the corresponding
template okay so now on before starting
implementation of the template you can
see I now have placed my editorial side
by side with the browser so that we can
see any changes we are making here to
the template code are automatically
reflected here in the browser
so first start by removing this text
information here and instead include a
headline which is containing the text
I'll select new sauce okay and next I'd
like to you to bring in a B on the
drop-down list and against a select
element and we give it a glass of from
control that's from bootstrap framework
we do not need our name here so we want
to remove it and then we need to to
print out all the news source options we
have and as already said we have that
array defined which is holding the list
of news sources and now we can use the
option element here to - I - right over
that array and we do that by using the V
for directive and I'm saying V 4 equals
sauce in sources okay and then I need to
bind the value here with rebind - to
solve ID and the text which is displayed
to the user is a way boolean so also on
name okay
okay and each time the selection is
changing we need to update on the source
property which contains the new source
which has been collected by the user and
we do that by our subscribing to an
event which always will be on here and
that event time is change and we are
attaching an event handler method here
which is called saws changed of course
later on we need to implement that
method herein as a self-selection
component as well okay so at the moment
of course we are just receiving an
output which is containing an empty
drop-down list and that's very clear
because sources is just an empty array
for now and now we need to make sure
that the south of the array is filled at
the beginning when the song selection
component is created and it should be
filled with the values which are
retrieved from the new API dot-org API
and we can request from News API our
list of new sources and that request
should be done and to do that we are
bringing in a lifestyle group which is
called created here and we are assigning
a function of course and within a set
function we can make sure that the API
request is executed and that the array
is filled and we do that by using this
dollar sign HTTP that's the HTTP service
which is provided from the view resource
package and now we can use that service
and call the get method and we are
setting up a get it from HTTP request to
all the following HTTP endpoint
it's new API dark v1 sources question
mark and we need to pause the language a
parameter which is set to English and
then as it requests this get call is a
returning a promise and we can respond
to the promise by attaching another
function within and we take the response
and assigning vir sources which are part
of the response to this
salsa's and it's in response data
sources okay okay then the next thing
let's also implement the resolve changed
event handler method for the change
event of the select element and we do
that by adding the methods property
which gets assigned an object which
consists of all the methods we need in
our component and we say sauce change
because the disease event handler method
and we're assigning a function which
takes one parameter and this the event
itself and within that function we are
using a for loop which is iterating over
our array sources
okay like so and for each of the array
items we do a check so if this sources
was index of e Rd is equal to e that's
the event target that lets the Select
element that's the target of the event
value equals to bat ID and then we know
that that the element in the array which
has been chosen by the user from the
drop-down list and with that information
available we are able to update this
sauce with that array item so sources
index EEP okay okay so now you can see
in the browser output an error message
is shown telling us that we need a
location change the comma here too is a
semicolon so like so and we need to
correct here the class name is not from
control its form control okay and so now
you can see the output is updated to no
errors are present and now you can see
we have the list of news sources with
websites at blocks providing us with
news available in the user can select
from the source and then changes the
selection and our property sauce is
always updated to the latest selection
made here by the user
okay let's change the output a little
bit let's bring in another this our
section here and we give it exams of
jumbotron and let's embed our drop-down
so there
within the Jumbotron play like so and
let utility I use another headline here
let's use an h2 tag use list okay and
within that h2 tag let's use a span for
bringing in a bootstrap icon and we can
do though by assigning the quran'
surahs' blue second and we want to have
the icon good click on let's use list -
odd okay and you can see here's the icon
okay
okay so next let's include in the
template output on another section which
is a section which is placed there right
under the drop-down list and that a
section should include additional
information and also the news source
selected so for example if we select ABC
news it should in output a short
description of the source and a button
which takes you directly to the website
of this new source and to do so here in
our template within the disc action with
grass Jumbotron we are including some
more elegant
so let's include another this section we
don't need a class here instead we we
are using another mu directive and the
directive is called you if and we are
assigning the following that expression
source so this simply means that the
content of this gif section is only
included in the HTML output if source is
defined so if we have not yet selected a
source and source is empty this dis
section is not included in the output
okay and the first thing we would like
to include is a year description of the
news source and we do that by embedding
the description in teheran h6 tag and we
are including the description field of
the other source object by using the
interpolation syntax like so source
description okay and the next thing is a
button let's use a element and we are
binding the H ref value which we - bind
H ref and we are setting it to source
URL because in source dot ul there we
are able to find the URL of the website
of this selected
news source okay let's use button class
here and clapping - primary class to
point out a blue button the target in
that case is a new window and yeah okay
that's it let's close it here and the
label of the button should be go go -
and we are using again source name
website okay
so let's say that you can see it's
automatically updated here and if we now
select for example the feet you can see
a short description
- feet and then the button if I now
click on the button you can see we are
directly taken to BuzzFeed calm and with
that functionality you now have the
proof that our sort of change event
handler is working so you can see if we
update anything here from the dock
downloads list the information which is
outputted below description and the link
which is included here with the button
is updated as well okay so now that the
implementation of soil selection
component is finalized we can switch
over to News list w and implement the
news list component and you can see here
it's again the template I've placed here
in News list view with a template
section with the script section and with
the Style section and at the moment the
template is outputting the string music
list and you can see it here in the
output it's included here but the output
we want to have here is a list of news
articles with an image a headline and a
link to the to the articles page on the
website so we need to to adapt the
implementation here and the first thing
we are going to do is to bring in a new
property here to our component
configuration object and this property
we do need here is called crops and
crops get assigned an array and the
array is in our case containing one of
spring element and this is source so
okay so for what do we need to include
on that new element here it's for
defining that use list is expecting one
inbound property and then maybe you
remember E and F dot view we have
included news list
in our template and we have used the
source attribute as an input property
for that component and to make this
working we now need to define it here in
news lists as as an element which is
assigned to the array here which is
assigned to props okay okay now we need
to bring in a watcher
which watches for changes which are done
to that input property so if the user
selects another value from from the list
of sources the input value is updated
and the new value is passed in and we
need to be notified when this event
happens because then we need to perform
a new request to the news API a service
to retrieve all the articles from this
new Muse off and to do that let's add
another property here to our component
object and the property we now need to
define a water is called watch and we
assign an object here and we need one
water and the water is equal or the name
of the water is equal to the name of the
property we want to watch in our case
source and it gets assigned a function
which has one parameter and that's the
value the new value and then we can say
ok so please update our list of articles
and we do it by calling a new function
we have not implemented yet but we will
do so in a moment and that function
should have the name update salt and
gets a parameter in the value again okay
okay so next let's implement the method
update source and to do so we need to
add another property here and that's
property measures
more playing and within the message
object we are defining our update salt
and are assigning a function here with
the parameter of sauce and now again we
need to make use of the dollar sign HTTP
service object and use the gated service
method to initiate a get HTTP request to
the new API service and this time we do
need to use another end point and the
end point which is relevant for
retrieving a list of articles is HTTP
News API dot org slash V 1 slash
articles and we need to add the sauce we
want to retrieve articles for as a new
URL parameter here with question mark
and we need to set the songs to to the
florist oddly which is passed into the
updated cell phone as a source parameter
so we can say plus to concatenate two
strings source and then we need to
include another URL parameter here and
that is the parameter API key as
mentioned before we need to pass in the
API key from News ap and new API but org
and you can retrieve your own API key by
opening up the account details here at
News API that up after having registered
and then you can pass it in here okay
again the call of the get method is
returning a promise and we are able to
respond to the promise by attaching then
here and then do the following
attach a function here and then use that
function to set this article articles
which is our array to on the articles we
can read out from the response object
and it's available in response data
articles okay okay so it's bring in a
comma here so that will get rid of this
error measure message okay and then we
can continue the implementation in the
template section so let's remove the
news a list string so you can see the
output is gone and now we can bring in
the code the HTML code which is needed
to generate the list output and we do so
by first defining a new dis section and
we again using a container here and
within that container we are using an
unordered list item and we are using
this by assigning the class of media -
list that's bootstrap class again and
within that term unordered list item we
have of course host items and okay like
so and each list item gets assigned to
the class from media and then we're
using the B - for directives again to
iterate over our articles which are
stored in the articles array so we need
to say here articles in articles
okay and then include the code for
outputting one article here in our li
element and we start again by using a
dis section with class media left and on
the left side of this item output should
be on the image of course and we are
embedding the image in a link so let's
start with a link tag here and we are
linking to the URL of the article and in
order to be able to bind to article ul
we need to use the rebind directive here
okay and then we would like to open it
in a new window so we are signing
underscore blank to the third property
okay and then within that link element
we can include the image element and
again we need a glass here the classes
times media object and the source
property is used again together with the
V dash mind directive and we bind to
article and the image is available in
URL to image we do not need this
attribute okay okay then we need to are
inside of the list item another this
element with class on media body
okay and within the body section which
is displayed on next to the image we
would like to include an H for element
which contains them the class meteor -
heading okay and again within that h
follow we are using a big government -
to embed the headline text and to make
it clickable so that the user is taken
to the article website and we do that
again by binding the hrs again to
article a ul okay and yeah using target
what's on the squad blank
okay and then at the link text we are
using article title here okay let's see
h4 and then we include an H five that's
simply displaying the author information
so it's printed in italics and the use
the text by and then use interpolation
again to bring in the author information
which is available in article but author
okay and finally we need a paragraph
item and in the paragraph we are
printing out the article description
okay okay so let's see what I needed
next we have used the article so right
here for outputting each item of that
array and we have used it here when we
are making our service call to then
assign the result to articles but we
haven't included articles as an array
here in our data model so we do need
here the data property as well okay and
as before we have to return an object
which is containing all our data
properties which are used here in the
news list component and in that case we
do need article zoom and we are
assigning an empty array here and okay
okay and another thing we should make
sure it is that we are adding the
creative life cycle hook here and
we're assigning a function just to make
sure that when the component is graded
we are calling this update source with
charged selected as well okay okay now
the new news list implementation is
ready to see if we have some output
available in that has a non-selective
for example and gadget you can see okay
we have a problem here there is no list
output so let's see what's in the
console and you can see ok our request
is not containing so first thing we have
to correct this we need to add in the
the end point in the URL we are using
here we need to add here via following
because we have two parameters the first
services and we have include the second
one like this okay and then you can see
sources empty and that is because ok and
no that's because we have forgotten here
in our source selection component to
commit down the sauce change event and
to do so we need to include the
following line of code is this on don't
assign omit and then we are passing in
two parameters the first one is a string
which is the name of the event and
that's all changed and then the second
one is the parameter we would like to
pass into that event and that is e
target value
so like so and now we can select
something again and here you can see on
the output is a label you can see images
but we need a wisely we need to include
some styling to make the output look
like we want to have it okay let's do so
switching back to news listed view and
here within the styling block let's add
down the following for the class media
object let's define a style or the width
of 128 pixels and a padding of 10 pixels
okay and for the class meteor let's say
we want to have a border on top and that
should be one pixel solid and in light
gray okay and we want to have a padding
on top which is 20 pixels okay now here
you can see on the output is available
now we have now a nice-looking list we
have the image on the left and the
headlines the answer and a short
description on the right and now we can
change here to another news source for
example Google News and you can see it's
updated and if I now click for example
on wall the headlines here I'm taken to
you our to the news website which is
linked so let's see
try another one Huffington Post okay and
open this one now you can see I'm on The
Huffington Post website so that's our
application I hope you enjoyed watching
