Matt Wacom again and this is the second
part of my angular material serious and
this time we will be focusing on
proverbs tool tips and snack bars so
these three components and in the first
part of this series you've received a
general introduction of how to use
angular material a library in your
angular project so the project we
prepared in the first part is the basis
now for this second part so if you have
not followed the first part you can just
find a link here in the video
description and go back to the first
part and see how to set up such a
project because that's that's what we
needed to move on in this second part ok
so let's get started and first let's see
how to work with material dialogues so
to get started with the dialogues from
the angular material library first of
all I'm switching over to my project
which I have already prepared here on
this project is containing the basic
setup we do need to use angular material
and our project and to include the
dialogues we would like to use in the
next step
first we need to import the
corresponding module which is MD
dialogue module in our app module which
is available here in the app folder in
file dot module dot PS so let's add the
corresponding import statement here on
top
steam part and then the name is MD
dialog module and we are importing from
the aunt angular slash material library
like so and the next thing we need to do
here is to add the MD dialogue module to
the import array here as well so let's
add a comma here and then add MD
dialogue module okay with an MD dialogue
module we can find the MD dialogue
service and that is what we need to to
inject the normal component of the next
step and then by accessing the MD
dialogue service we can include a
dialogue now application so let's
continue so to demonstrate to the usage
of the MD dialogue service let's quit
first the new component no application
so that we can put our source code which
is needed to demonstrate the dialogue
usage right into that component a to do
so we can make use of near angular
command-line interface by using the
energy command and to generate a new
component done or a here in the project
folder I can use the ng come on in the
following way
ng and then a gene for generate
component because I'd like to generate a
new component and then I need to specify
the name of that new component and in my
case that should be dialogue gable okay
let's hit return and you can see it's
generating four new files here in SRC
app dialog demo here you can see here
the new files and let's open up for
example the PS file you can see it's
already containing a default
implementation of the dialog demo
component class you can see the template
code here it at the moment it just says
dialog demo works and if I switch back
to the PS file you can see the selector
property is set to F - dialog - table so
to include that new component in at the
output of our application I can switch
over to you
tap dot module dot es and check that it
was already imported here but I found it
though I do not need to import it
manually it's important or the import
statement has been added by angular CLI
automatically and you can see it here as
well it has also been added to the
declarations array so that dialogue demo
component is available throughout our
application and to include it in the
output I can then switch over to my main
app component template which is a
Weibull here in app that component on
HTML and we also let's remove everything
what's included here maybe we should
leave a dis element here and then I can
include a new element which is called
app dialogue table okay let's close it
okay so that's what we needed to include
it here is a child component and to try
it out and actually see that it is
working in the browser and the output of
dialog demo component is is available on
the browser let's quickly switch over to
the command line start of the
development web server here in our
project folder by again using ng and
then the option surf it will turn and
you can see it here is the server is
starting up at local host port 4200 and
it's building building my project and
optimizing the assets within my project
as you can see here and we can switch
over to the browser and okay now it's
ready and now you can see if our access
a local host of port 4200 and the
browser
I'm getting back the output from my
dialogue demo component
it says dialog demo works so it's
working as expected and now we can use a
dialog demo component to bring in the
sample code to demonstrate the usage of
the MD dialog service okay so let's
start here in dialogue demo component of
HTML and replace this HTML code here
with our own HTML code so what we would
like to do here we would like to output
an option for the user so for example a
button so that the user can click on
that button and then a dialog is opening
up and for the user interface here we
will use various material design
elements from the
material libraries so let's start out
with Md cart and at the top level
element here and then we'll have an MD
cart header with an MD cart title and
the title is printing out a headline so
h1 here and the same dialogue demo
okay so next let's use an MD cart
content element here and within that
content element we will use the button
and the button will be display the
material design although so we will use
the MD raced button directive here and
connecting the click event with an event
handler method and the method should be
named open dialogue so this method will
be implemented in the dialogue table
component class next and of course we'll
need label here on the button which is
saying open dialogue okay so what do we
need maybe we need another element here
so let's print out in bold the result we
are getting back from the dialogue and
the result will be available in a class
property here which is called a dialog
result so we are using the expression
syntax from angular here to print out
the value of dialog result so that it's
printed out here what the user decided
to click in the button later on we will
be implementing within the dialog two
buttons so one button to confirm the
message and one button to cancel the
message
and both buttons are returning value and
that's exactly the way we are getting
back from the dialog and are displaying
and outputting here okay so now that we
have used further material design
components here like my card and the
rice button and so on we need to make
sure that the corresponding modules are
included in F dot module dot T as well
so let's quickly switch over here and
first we need to include the
corresponding input statements total the
modules we do need here is first the AMD
card module from of course the end
angular material library here and then
copy it we do need the MD button module
here as well and we do need the MD
dialog okay all right there so I can
remove that element here and then we
need to take care of that both modules
MD card module and MD bad module are
included here within the import array as
well so let's add MD card module here
and what at MD button module here as
well okay like so okay so the
development web server is still running
I can directly switch to the browser and
see the result here
that's our user interface you can see
here is that the button open dialog and
if I now click on the button of course
nothing happens so far because we've not
implemented the event handler method so
far and that's exactly what we are
planning to do in the next step so let's
switch back to Adam and then move on
with our development okay here I'm back
in File dialog demo that component yes I
first need to import the MD dialog
service because we haven't imported it
so far so let's edit here MD dialog and
we are importing MD dialog of course
from the angular slash own mercurial
package and now we need to inject the
better service and injecting a service
into a class is done by injecting it
here in the constructor as a parameter
and using the public key word here is
your public dialogue and then we are
saying
dialogue the class when my dialogue
should be of type MD dialogue and that
is the syntax here in angular we are
using to inject services into our class
and now we can access all the instance
here of MD dialogue by using the
dialogue class member and yeah what we
are going to do next is to implement the
open dialogue method because if I switch
back here is this was the method which
was connect to the click event here open
dialogue and that is what we now need to
implement to to bring in the code which
is needed to open the dialogue by using
the MD dialogue service so let's say
open dialogue the method takes no
parameters here and now we are playing
let M
dialogue ref he close this dialogue and
then we are using default in service
method here to open up a dialogue and
the first thing we need to pass this in
as another component here
so let's use a component which is not
existing yet my dialog component that
component will be created in the next
step and then you'll need to pass in an
object here containing a property with
which is set to 600 pixels maybe you can
also use a height property but for the
moment it should be sufficient to
specify the width of the dialogue we
would like to have and then we can pass
in a custom property maybe data and just
pass in a text information with text
passed into the dialog so later on we
will see how to within the dialog
component how to read out that text
which is passed into the dialog
component and then how to display this
text as part of the content which is
displayed within the dialog okay so that
is the code we need to open up a dialog
and then we can also use the reference
which is returned here in dialogue ref
which gives us access to the dialogue
and then use the after close method to
get access to an observable which is
returned here for the purpose to inform
about closing the dialogue
so let's subscribe here okay and pass in
method here with a parameter of result
and then we can maybe first print it out
and
and say okay dialogue over let's do it
in another way let's say dialogue closed
and we are printing out the value of the
result a parameter of this method here
okay like so so later on you will also
see how to return a specific value as a
result so we will use it to return the
user will have the option to click on
confirm and to click on cancel and the
dialogue to close the dialog and we will
pass back at the result which informs
the parent component here which informs
over the component about that choice the
user has made okay so let's assign it
here to another class property which is
named dialog result so that we can print
out in the browser as well okay like so
okay now you can see it's saying here at
the bottom property dialog result does
not exist and that's true of course so
let's add here dialogue result and
initialize it with an empty string okay
like so of course now we need to create
my dialogue component as well because
that component is not existing it here
in our project and the way is the same
as before let's go to the command line
and yet let's use the ng command with
option G and component once again and
then create my dialogue component so we
only need to
my dialogue here hit return and you can
see again it's creating the following
files here you can see it here here we
are
that's my dialogue component and now we
can begin with implementing the template
code of my dialogue component here so
let's get rid of the default code here
in that file and then start with another
development okay and then I would like
to start out with an h2 headline which
says my dialogue and I am assigning here
the MD - dialogue title directive okay
next way using the MD - dialogue -
contact element - structure but I look
here a little bit so using some text
within that content area and then I'm
including a line break here maybe
another line break and then I'd like to
print out a component class property
which is called data that will be later
on the property which holds the value
which was passed into that dialogue
component by using the data property in
the second object which was passed into
the open service method we saw before so
we are printing out a bed text
information here okay I would like to
have those elements here in the content
section as well so let's pass it here
okay so another line and then we will
use another special material design
element for structuring our dialogue
content which is called nd - dialogue -
actions okay and within that element we
are embedding our cue buttons so first
button and we are assigning the
directive of MD - raced button to
display the study in material design as
well and then I need to bind the click
event to the handler method on clothes
confirm in this case and the button gets
to the text come from okay now for the
second button the event handler method
will be renamed - on clothes console and
the text on the button is cancel as well
okay okay so now we can switch over to
you
BMI dialog component class
implementation here in the type of
script file and then add the
implementation for both event handler
message first so we will be implementing
on clothes confirm and on
sconces so the first thing I need to do
here is add the band the methods so on
close confirm and on pullo's column so
like so and now we would like to close
our the current dialogue here and to do
this we need to call the clothes Messer
and the clothes mess up to to get access
to the close method we need to on to
have a reference to our dialogue and to
get this reference we need to import
first now let's go back we need to
import the following import MD dialog
left of course from the ED angular so -
material library and then we are able to
inject the MD dialogue ref object into
our constructor here
so again public this dialogue ref and
it's of type md dialogue ref and the MD
dialogue graphism type object so I'm
using the type my my dialogue
component here okay like so and now with
this dialogue respirable as a class
member I can make use of this service
and call the close method and I'm able
to use a parameter here which contains
the return text of our dialogue so let's
copy it and insert it here a second time
now we are returning the text console of
course to complete the dialogue
implementation here one last thing is
missing if I go back here to the
template code you can see here that we
have used on the expression syntax here
for including the value of the data
property this data property is as you
can see here still not existing the data
property is or should contain the text
information which has been passed into
the dialogue when calling this dialogue
so here in dialogue demo component just
do to remember this was a text here as
this Texas passed into the dialogue
which has been assigned here to the data
property and this text is passed into
our dialogue and now we would like to
include it in the output and make it
available so that the data property is
also a property and the my dialogue
component class and to achieve that we
need to inject affirm another thing here
so first let me enter another another
object here to the import statement we
need to have in
doable and then I need to add the
following MD underscore underscore
dialogue underscore data from the head
into the material library so with the MD
underscore dialogue underscore data
object available we can now extend the
constructor definition here with a
second parameter and the second
parameter is using the add inject and
the underscore dialogue data call and
then we are using again the public
keyword data as the name of the property
and it's type string here okay like so
okay so now that the implementation of
my dialogue component is ready we need
to make sure that in the parent
component in the calling component
dialogue table component my new
component is available so let's add a
following import statement here and now
you can see here it's label the arrow is
gone and I can use my dialogue component
now here as the first parameter you know
the call of the open method okay so now
we can go to the browser again and check
out if our sample application I was
working okay so let's try it out
clicking here on open dialogue you can
see something is happening here at the
left side but obviously the dialogue is
not a showing up
pected and if I'm opening up the Oberoi
control here you can see it's bringing
up an arrow it's saying no component
factory found for my dialer component
that you edit to ng module entry
components and that is exactly what is
missing so far because we need to make
sure that my dialogue component is
loaded right pepper beginning and that
is achieved by adding it to the entry
components property here in F dot module
dot TS so let's add it here to handy
module it's called entry components and
it gets assigned an array of course and
what we need to add here is my dialogue
component okay okay let's save it and
switch back to the browser so now let's
try it out another time here clicking on
opening dialogue and now you can see the
dialogue is popping up as expected here
you can see my headline the text
information here in bold you can see the
text which is past the environment of
the data property and you can see I have
a confirm and the cancel button here I
can use if I click here and confirm you
can see it's returning the text confirm
and it's displaying the text here after
result and if I open the dialogue again
it gives a cancel button to leave the
dialog you can see here it's saying
console so with with both directions you
can see I can pass text or I can pass
any information into the dialogue and by
using the return value I
and hand back or return any values I'd
like to return here okay okay now let's
focus on two tips and see how we can
make use of two tips from the angular
material library and again the first
thing we need to do it to be able to use
tool clips in our component hills to
open up app dot module dot T has which
you can see here and add another import
statement for on the MD tooltip module
so import and the tool tip module and of
course it's imported from at angular
slash material ok and we also need to
adhere to the import array MD - tip
module okay and this is a prerequisite
to be able to use the two tips in our
components so next let's add another
component to our project which is used
to demonstrate how to include two tips
okay so back to the command line I'm
stopping the FOA which is still running
here and then using again the nvg
component command to add the component
which is called q-tip demo
okay it's adding to the demo component
to my project again for new files here
and you can see F dot module dot es has
been updated as well to include my
tooltip demo component in my project and
make it a Weibull okay so now let's open
up the tooltip demo folder here and we
will start again by implementing the
template code here first removing the
default template and then starting with
with a new template and to structure or
user interface here for the tooltip demo
a little bit again I'm using the MD -
card element and inside that element of
using md card header okay within that
header I'm using md card title with the
headline inside okay like so and then
I'm using the MD - card - content
element here and the content is simply a
text information and better than a span
tag and the tooltip I supplied by using
the MD tooltip directive for that
element so let's start with a spawn
element and using a text this text has
tooltip' maybe and then applying the
director here MD tool tip and I'm
assigning a spring to that directive
containing the text which is displayed
in the tooltip so this is a curative
okay like so okay with that it changes
made of course if I go back to the
browser I can not see the new component
output here that's quite clear because
we have not included the tooltip demo
component as a child component in the
template code of our app component in
add component dot HTML and that's
exactly what I'm going to do next here
is to include the app - to the tip limo
element here okay let's save it and now
you can see going back to the browser
reloading the application again and now
you can see here is the tooltip section
if I move the mouse over the text here
you can see it's displaying this is a
tool tip and it's displaying by default
the tooltip here at the bottom of the
element I have assigned the MD tooltip
directive to and now let's see how we
can change it to display it at another
position maybe we should also assign a
little bit of a margin here to the card
element so that we have some space here
that we need to call so let's let's dude
first I can go to tooltip demoed
component dot the TS and then they MD -
card and I'd like to have some margin at
the top for let's say 20 pixels
okay checking it back in the browser you
can now see okay that looks much better
okay now let's change the position of
the tooltip I'm going back here to my
template code and here to the span of
amend I now need to apply another direct
which is called MD to tip position and
for example if I would like to not
display to taper at the bottom but
instead them above the element I'm
simply saying above here okay above
let's face it
go back to the browser and to reloading
again and now you can see it's
displaying the tooltip above my element
and not at the bottom okay now the last
element I'd like to demonstrate here
from the angular material library are of
snack bars and snack bars are in the
easy way to display a notification in
your application popping up maybe at the
bottom of the browser screen and to make
use of snack bars first again we need to
go back to app dot module dot TS and
bring in another import statement here
so let's say import it's the MD snack
bar module which is needed and again we
are importing of course from at angular
slash material okay and then we need to
add this new module here to the import
array as well MD know it's working with
a capital B here snack bar module MD
snack bar
module to Z imports array as well
now with the MV slack bar module
imported in our application we are ready
to make use of the snack bar by
injecting the MD snack bar a service
tool to one of our components and then
use it as a service to open up the snack
bar and display a notification to the
user and to demonstrate the usage of the
snack bar I'd like to create another
component first in my application so
that we have a separate component for
demonstrating the snack bar
functionality here so I'm stopping my
work server which is running in the
background here again and then use ND d
component snack bar demo again to
generate a new snack bar demo component
okay here we are okay here we are
here's a new folders net bar - demo and
here at the four new files and we will
start right away in the HTML file here
replacing again the default content with
an MD - card element here at the top
element and I'm using the MD cut header
again so including my headline snack bar
demo ok like so okay let's embed it here
in an MD card title ok
so the next element is the MD card
content within the MD core content I'm
using this time again a button the
button should be available for the user
to be able to click on that button and
then see as a response see popping up
this neck bar with a message and the
button should be the arm should be
displayed in material design as well so
we are using again the MD - who raised -
button directive here and I'm using the
click event handler here to assign the
event handler method we will be
implementing in a moment and the method
name here is open snackbar okay and the
text which is printed out on the button
is open snackbar okay like so now we
need to make sure again that the Nakba
demo component is including an app
component in the template as well as you
can see here we will include it by using
the element app snackbar demo okay
because that is the selector which is
set here in the component class as you
can see here selector so we can include
it by using an HTML element with exact
name okay now I can change back to my
command line start of the development
web server again by using anti serve and
then I can check the result in the
browser again
pay opening up the browser and now you
can see Snecma demo on the cart a
section is displayed here we should
assign of the same margin let's do it
quickly here as assigned for on the
tooltip card to the snack bar as well ok
let's save it
okay here we are and now you can see the
button is already there if I click on
the button of course nothing is
happening pick up a open select or event
handler method has not been implemented
so far and that is the next step now to
implement that event handler method here
in snackbar demo component okay let's
add the method here it's open snack bar
and to be able to open snap bar here I
first need to import on the endless
network service and the snack bar from
the angular material library again and
then I need to inject it here to my
class by injecting it here as a
constructor parameter public snack bar
of type MD snack bar like so now I have
access to the snack bar instance and
within my method here I can use it to
open up a snack bar by using this dot
snack bar open and then the out method
takes in the first parameter text maybe
this else of the next bar message and in
the second parameter again a text which
is the label which is printed on the on
the button in the snack bar so got it
okay
so let's save it and now we can try it
out again I'm switching back to the
browser and then if I click on the open
slack pub button this time you can see
the snack bar area is popping up here at
the bottom it's displaying the message
and now I can close it by clicking on
the button here got it and then it's
done again this was about them from
