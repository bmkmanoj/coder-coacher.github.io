smart Wacom and today in this video I'm
going to show you how to integrate
material design components with you
view js2 application and we will do so
by building simple sample application
I'll show you in a minute
and we will use a library called new -
material and with that library we can
easily integrate material design
components in your ujf - application and
make use of those components within your
template so let's get started okay so
let's first take a look at the sample
application we are going to build in
this tutorial and you will see it here
so it's just a very basic application -
just showing you how to integrate
material design components in your view
js2 application and as you can see here
our user interface is very simple we are
using various view various material
design components here to build up on
the user interface we have a card here
which is containing all the elements
here on - 2 buttons and the table here
and by using those two buttons we can
first click on fill table and you see
here the table if so it was free on data
items and we can use the other button
create able to just remove the items
from the table and yeah let's basically
all will go to build because the main
aim of this tutorial is to show how to
use new material at the library to
integrate material design in you UJS
application so the first step we are
going to to to complete is to first set
up a new initial UJS - project
okay so let's start initializing new you
journals application is very easy by
using the view CLI the command-line
interface and the view command interface
gives you access to a command which is
named view and we can use that command
to pass a few parameters here we say in
it and then we say webpack because we
want to use the view j2 project
templates which is which is based on
webpack and then specify the name of the
project so let's call it view J as MD
for material design okay now you can see
here a few questions coming up here on
the command line but I can just leave
most of the answers to the default which
is given here so project name project
description as default author is default
the view built option I choose runtime
and compiler I do not want to use es
volunteer in my project because we want
to keep keep saying so simple I do not
want to use a set up unit test with
carmine maka so no and I do not want to
have end-to-end testing integrated here
so again no one so that's all now you
can see it here a new folder has been
created you JL - Andy and I can switch
into the folder now and to complete the
setup of the project I now need to
execute npm install because executing
this command makes sure that all the
needed dependencies which are already
listed in the package.json file here
within the project folder are downloaded
and installed into our project so let's
execute npm install and it takes a
second to download everything and
installed here okay here we are you can
see all the dependencies have been
downloaded and installed successfully to
our project and now just to make sure
that everything is running we can start
up the development server by entering
NPM run death and let's starting up the
development server and opening up our
view j/s application in the browser
automatically here on port 8080 and so
here it is levelled you can see that
it's the output of the default of UTS
application and now we can start with
first integrating the view material
library which gives us access to the
material design components and then use
those components in one of our
components and only in the associated
templates so there is one more
dependency and we need to install to our
project that is a dependency which is
not in the default set of dependencies
and that is the new material library and
the website of this project can be found
here at view material github IO and you
can see here on the year the overview
page you have a button on getting
started and if I click on the button
here you will find instructions of how
to install the view material library to
you project and basically we need to do
two things we need to install the view -
material and the M package and then
given seed here include the Roboto font
and of the icon set from Google's
content delivery network here by they
are just copying those two linked
elements to our firm index dot HTML file
in the project
okay so let's begin with installing the
NPM package I'm switching back to the
terminal window and I'm starting the web
server here for a moment and then use
the command NPM install new - material
at the name of the library and I'm all
the passing over the - - safe option for
making sure that the view material
dependency is also added to the list of
dependencies available in the package
dot adjacent file
okay so let's install it it's downloaded
and again installed into the node
modules folder of the project okay here
we are
you can see installation has been
completed successfully and the next step
is to download the power project into
the code editor and I'm using atom here
in that case so I'm launching atom here
in the project directory okay here this
okay and then I need to open up
index.html go back here to the website
and just copy those two link elements
here go back to Adam and enjoy both link
elements inside of the add section here
in index.html okay so the next thing
needs to be inserted here in the file
main body is another source folder and
the file main dot yes as you can see
here is containing the main entry point
for the beauteous application so
view the main framework graph is
important here and a new instance is
created and that's the entry point of
the view application and now we need to
add two more import statements here to
make the material design components
available in our application so first we
need to say import view material from
you - material at the name of the
library counter we also need to import
the corresponding stylesheet um that's
called you - material slash dist slash
you - material dot CSS okay we both
import a statements available we need
now say you dot use and pass over new
material that is configuring the
framework so that it knows that there is
a plug-in available view material and
that this plugin is loaded and by
loading view material we make the
material components were able to our
application okay so let's start using
some of the material components first we
need to open fw that the place where the
main UJS component of our application is
implemented and you can see the file is
already containing the default
implementation of app component and we
now need to start implementing the user
interface for our sample application by
first deleting the template content
which is here inside is a dis tag with
the ID of app assigned so let's remove
it and we'll also remove here the
component property
the component configuration object
because we do not want to use the hello
component which is available here in the
components folder we do not want to
include the hello component we are just
using the app component here so we have
no dependency to the yellow component
here so let's remove it okay
okay so let's start here in the template
the first element we want to use in our
user interface is a material design cart
and we can include those cars by using
the MD - cart element here okay and the
cart
accomplice or from - two sections one is
the MD card edit section clean up MD
card header okay let's close it here and
the second section we need to include
here is of course the MD - card -
content section okay so within the
header of the card we are including
first title let's give our application a
title and we do so by using a div tag
here and assigning on the MD - title
class which also comes from the material
design framework and we are using the
title material design
with huge enough to demo here and let's
also include a sub a sub-headline let's
use another big element here and we are
assigning the class of MD subnet okay
and let's give this up headline text
here by coding this mount why not calm
okay so for a moment and you can see
with now also that the header section of
the card of the content is just left
empty okay before implementing the court
content section heal itself switch over
to the terminal again and start the
development web server again so that we
can already see what's there and you can
see the application is loading again
here in the browser and then now you can
see here here is the cloud layout we
already have headline here and we have a
sub headline and now we can arrange on
that window here to maybe have it
side-by-side with my code editor and I
just want to remove some of this styling
which is included here so let's remove I
want to remove everything only the
margin top can can be left okay here
this okay so let's continue in the MD -
card - content section here the first
thing now we would like to do here is to
bring in two buttons and we do so by
using the material design component MD -
button and the button now needs classes
and one class we are using as MD - lower
- right and the second is MD -
primary and mental cause we would like
to respond to the click event of the
button and to do so in view je s we are
using the directive we - on column
followed by the name of am event type we
want to respond to and that is of course
a click event and now we are assigning
here a string which is containing the
event handler method so let's name it
Phil table because the very user clicks
here on that button we want to fill the
table of course we need to implement
that method later on okay
so let's name the button show table and
to close the MD - button element here
okay like so okay so then we need
another button again we are assigning
the class of MD - right and MD - primary
and we're attaching an event handler for
the click event which is called in that
case let's name it clear table okay
okay so let's save it and see how the
output has changed now you can see it's
not only containing a card with just
headlines it's also containing those
buttons here in the blue layout in the
blue the blue color we have choosen by
selecting the class MD - primary ok
before continuing on the implementation
of the template by adding the table
maybe let's go to the Style section here
and to make the card to layout a little
bit more visible here on the Left border
and the right border let's attach a
margin left of let's say 30 pixel and
let it touch a margin right again 30
pixel and see how the output changes
okay let's save it okay let's remove the
space okay here it is so next add all
the table to our output and we do so
here under the closing tag of MD - card
- content and the table is added by
using them the element MD - table on top
and within that element we first need MD
- table - header section
like so and within the header section of
the table we are including an MD - table
- row for the headlines let's close it
okay so in total our table consists of
three rows so we need our three
headlines and each headline is included
by using the MD - table - header element
okay like so let's copy it okay the
first column should I should get
assigned the headline first name the
second is last name and the last one is
email okay you can see here this and now
of course we do not only need a table
header we also need a table body and the
table body is included by using MD -
table body okay and within the body
section we are again including MD table
row and now of course we want to
generate a new row for each data item
which is available for output and we do
that by using the B - for directive and
let's say contact in context later on we
will be defining contacts which will be
an array and that array so by using the
button field table
it's emptied by using the create table
button of course
so let's first complete the
implementation of the template before
doing so and okay let's close this row
here okay within that row we need to
import three things for each each of the
columns we need to output the
corresponding value in contact and again
we do it by using a new element which is
called MD - table - cell okay we needed
3 times a 1 2 3 and now we are using the
view clay as interpolation syntax with
double curly braces now curly braces
okay so first we need to output contact
dot first name then we need to output
contact last name and the last property
whether the contact object is called
email okay
let's save it ok you can see the output
has not changed of the reason of causes
we have not defined a contacts or array
already in our application so there is
no data to output and therefore no table
role is generated only the headlines and
so it's empty at the moment okay so next
let's add on the context array - on the
data model of our component and we do
that by going here to the
exported component configuration object
which at the moment of unequal lists of
the name property which gets here
assigned to where you want to spring
value add and now we are going to add
the data property which is a function
and the function is returning an object
so return object which is containing all
the data properties we would like to use
in our application and we would like to
use in our template and at the moment we
are in need of the context array so
let's define it here so contacts and
let's say it's empty by default so it
has no items assigned save it here you
can see here in the output nothing is
changing and now we need to implement
the two method methods fill table and
clear table and we do that by adding
another property here and that property
is called new methods and methods is an
object containing the implementation of
both functions so fill table first place
the function and we are implementing the
fill table function by adding data to
the context array so we would like to
have three items inserted here by that
function so let's start with this
context and we are using the push
function here and okay and push L
getting passed in the object we would
like to insert as an array item and of
course we are needing an object here
which contains three properties and the
first property is first name
okay let's assign my name here and the
second property last name and the third
property is of course email okay and I'm
assigning an email address here okay so
here we are
now that's copy that line and insert it
a second in the third time let's change
the values here is the first name in
that case let's say go we have last name
list and I need to change the email
address screen as well and in the third
item here I choose a first name and a
last name let's say token and email
address as well
Abel Parker okay so now we have three
and items being inserted here by that
postcards to our array and okay let's
implement clear table as well okay it's
again a function of course and in this
case we want to empty the table and we
do that by emptying the contacts array
and this is done by calling the
splice method and we splice all the
elements out so from zero to all this
contact length okay here we are
okay then finally check the result here
in the browser and now again you can see
the output has not changed yet it is
okay because initially the context array
is empty and then we need to call the
fill table method by clicking here on
the button but do so you can see the
table is filled here with three items
that is a result we have been expected
to see and now I can remove every single
juice here in the table by hitting clear
table you can see the table is is empty
now everything was removed so let it's
exactly the result we would like to have
