coding the smart Wacom and today in this
new video I'm going to introduce you to
bootstrap for flexbox CSS classes so
bootstrap for ELLs in beta version right
now so release is not yet there but one
of the main features one of the main new
features of bootstrap for are the
flexbox utility classes defined by the
boots but framework and those classes
makes it really easy to apply a flex box
based layout in your application so flex
box as a concept which has been
introduced with css3 and now was that a
set of utility classes in bootstrap for
it is getting really easy to apply
flexbox layout in your application and
in this tutorial i'll give you an
overview of the utility classes which
are available in bootstrap for and we
will walk through the examples
step-by-step so that you can see how to
apply those classes in your application
so at hope I hope is that it's helpful
for your next application so stay tuned
and let's get started so in order to get
started we first need to set up a basic
bootstrap for project and to do so I'm
just switching over to the command line
and creating a new folder here a new
empty folder which is called a BS - for
Lex and then I'm entering that folder
okay so the folder is empty of course
and I would like to create the first
file here in that folder so I'm saying
touch index dot HTML okay now you can
see the file is available and now what
we need to do is to include the
bootstrap library here in our index dot
HTML file and the easiest way to do so
is to include a bootstrapper from a
content delivery network so we do not
need to download the library and keep
all the files and assets from bootstrap
here in our project and if I switch now
to use the bootstrap website here at get
bootstrap comm we can click here on get
started and here you will find on the
introduction page here from the
QuickStart guide you can find a section
which he had lined starter template and
you can see it here there is a basic
startup template which is including the
bootstrap files for example bootstrap
dot min dot CSS and bootstrap dot min
dot J as and as well the dependencies
jQuery and property as includes all
those files from external locations from
so called content delivery networks so
to get started we will copy that code
here and then switching over to our code
editor have already opened up the new
project folder here in Visual Studio
code and open up index dot HTML and then
I'm in asserting so text from the Bhoots
but for starter template here okay so
there is nothing much going on it's just
printing out hello world here around the
headline and is making sure that
everything is included so
to try it out now I'm able to go back to
the command line and then start
development web server here so I'm using
live server to start up live server I
simply need to type in the command live
- server here in my in my project folder
so if you haven't installed live server
yet on your system you can do so it's
Weibull as an NPM package you can simply
install it by saying npm install - g
live - server and then it's downloading
and installing live server globally on
your system the main advantage here else
is that live server is a very small
developments web server and comes with
live reloading
capabilities so we can keep the web
server running so let's start it up ok
so you can see it's opening up my
application now it's running on port
8080 mm-hmm so let's arrange these those
two windows here side by side and now
you can see it's printing out hello
world here the output corresponds to
what we see here in the file and now if
I'm going to add an edge to here and say
just another headline save it you can
see when I'm saving it's automatically
updating the output here on the browser
I do not need to reload the page
manually so it's perfect for trying out
things here and if we are going to try
out various examples for demonstrating
the bootstrap for flex classes its yeah
just an easy way of demonstrating as we
run
and run through the code and implement
various examples here okay so now we
have our bootstrap for application
running and we can now start
implementing as the examples I'd like to
show but before doing so I'd like to
bring in some custom CSS code here so
let's say custom CSS and I'm adding a
style tag here so and within that style
tag now I can bring in my classes and we
do so because I need to define some
classes which I'm adding to my Flex
containers later on and to my Flex items
to make those items with a blue on the
page for example we'll use a border so
is that you can see what's the exact
area of the Flex container and what is
the exact area of the Flex items which
are placed inside the container and when
we are making those elements with a book
we can see how elements are arranged by
the flexbox layout and what is going to
change if we apply different classes so
first of all first of all I'm defining a
class which I'm calling my - Flex
container that is a default class I'm
using for my Flex container I'd like to
add a border here of T pixels should be
a solid and I would like to have the
border in green color but also would
like to give it a height of hundred
pixels and let's add a margin at the
bottom of 20 pixels as well
okay then I'd like to define a class
which is called my - flex - container
column those this class will be used
when we are working with a column based
flex layout let's again use the border
here two pixels solid and green the
height for the column based layout
should be 200 pixels and the margin -
bottom property should be set to 20
pixels as well
okay next class is my - flex - item
should have a background color of light
gray okay a border this time I'm using a
bottle of one pixel dotted gray okay and
finally I need a height here which is 48
pixels so the last class is my Flex item
- - I'm using the exact same properties
here so let's copy and past here and I'm
changing the height now to 96 pixels so
it's double the height of my Flex atom
okay so now we have defined us for
custom CSS classes we can apply to our
flex
container and to our flex elements and
so now we are ready to go to bringing
our first flex container
okay so let's remove both headlines here
from the body section and instead use a
div element which gets assigned the
class container and now was in that div
element let's begin with defining a
first flex container and we do so by
saying diff and then apply first a class
which is called D dash flex that is a
class we need to apply for every Flex
container and then with the next class
flex - bro we are saying that we would
like to have a row based flex layout
here and next to make that container
visible we are also applying our custom
class which is my - flex - container
okay
so let's save it and now you can see the
output in the browser is updated
automatically here we have defined now
our Flex container we have that green
border here which is defined by my -
flex - container class and now we can
bring in let's say three elements here
so let's start with add if we are in
signing the class P - - for adding a
padding which is also a good step for
class and then we are adding our my -
flex - item class here so and the
content of this div element is 1 so
let's copy it pass it in a second time
change the content to two and the third
time and content is three and now you
can see that's the result we have a row
based flex layout with three elements
inside okay we are also able to
verse on the ordering of items in the
Flex row so let's copy our difficulty in
our inserted here a second time and now
I'm going to change flex row or flex -
row class to flex - row - reverse so
let's save it and now you can see it's
reversing the order all the elements are
now starting to appear here in the row
from the right side not from the left
side anymore and it's again starting
here on the right side with one two
three just in the opposite direction
else displayed here in our first Flex
container so we are also able to justify
the content of our flex container so
again I'm using my example here from the
first Flex container inserted here and
then I'm applying another class here on
the container level which is called just
e5 - content and then there are
variations of that class first of all
you start and you can see it's just the
same result as in our first example here
but now we can change it here we can use
on start I can also use Center now you
can see all three elements are centered
here in my row I can also use justify -
content - and ok you can see it here's a
the three elements are displayed at the
end of the row I can use justify -
content - around you can see it here now
we have a margin for every element on
the left on the right side
and finally we can use justify - content
- that win which looks like the
following now we have the spacing here
between the elements ok so next let's
again take the first example here and
insert it again and now I'm going to
change the class flex - row - 5 - cover
- change - column based flex layout and
I also need to change the custom class
here my - flex - container - my - flex -
container - column okay you can see the
result there you can see now we have
again three items here but this time not
displayed in a row this time displayed
in a column we can change it to an
reverse ordering by just using flex -
column - reverse as seen before with row
okay here's a result let's take it back
to the standard ordering and of course
we can apply the justify - content
classes I've seen before for example
justify - content - that we need just to
give you one example and now you can see
the spacing is again between the
elements but on the alignment is not
it's done now not horizontally but
vertically because the justify - content
classes are always affecting the main
axis of the Flex
mode we are working in so if we are
working with a flex row we are aligning
horizontally and if we are working with
a flex column we are aligning vertically
okay okay there are also classes away
bow from bootstrap which enabled us to
do an alignment on the secondary axis
for example now I have the example from
the beginning again and the classes I'm
talking about are all starting with
align - items so I'm applying align -
items and the first variation here is -
start again okay as you can see nothing
is going to change here and then Center
now you can see on the secondary axis
here because we're working with row flex
layout again so this is a main Direction
this is a secondary direction here now
they are centered in the secondary
direction and I can apply end here and
you can see that is a way in which align
- items classes are working so we can
also apply alignment on single flex
items again starting with my first
example here what I would like to do now
is first of all to change the custom CSS
class which it's used here from us free
items - my - flex - item - - for the
first element and - - for the third
element
okay let's save it now you can see the
result elements 1 &amp;amp; 3 are double the
height
element to and now with element 2 we can
demonstrate the alignment which is ugly
taking effect on one single flex element
and the classes we need to use here are
the following classes line - self -
start for example the first one you can
see nothing is going to change because
start is saying that this element
element - is aligned to the top second
variation is Center the effect can be
seen here and the last variation as end
and you can see it here we can also
control the wrapping behavior of flex
elements and to demonstrate the wrapping
behavior which is active by default
let's use this example again and maybe
add some more elements here so we have 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 let's say I would like to
use 20 elements here and that will
should be sufficient to demonstrate the
wrapping behavior so need to form more
elements
17 and 18 19 and finally 20 so here's a
result you can see we have applied no
special rapping class so the default of
rapping behavior is simply that there is
no rapping you can see it here our Flex
container is indicated by this green
border and the elements now which are
fitting not in the row are exceeding the
space which is available in our Flex
container now if we would like to have a
wrapping so that elements not fitting
into the first borough of rapping into a
second row we now can apply a class here
on the container which is called flex -
rap and you can see it's changing no
elements 17 18 19 and 20
which are not fitting in here are
available in the second row and if I'm
changing the size here of my window you
can see the elements are floating into
the second row and so the width of the
container gets smaller okay we can also
use a class which is called flex - rap -
we worse and the effect is like you can
see here we are also able to change as a
default order of elements with in our
Flex container so for example here you
can see it's of course the standard
ordering one two and three the elements
are displayed here and now I can apply a
class which is called order - followed
by a number which is indicating the
ordering place so let's say here for the
first element I would like to have it on
assert position or 1 for the second
element
to specify that I would like to display
the second element on first position and
finally honor - to form the last element
and I can see it's changing the order -
is displayed first than three and
finally one another thing which can be
applied to single flex elements or items
are margins there were four classes a
Weibull mr - auto for applying and a
margin to use the right side of the
element ml - Auto for applying a margin
to the left empty - auto and MB - Auto
for applying margins to the top and to
the bottom so let's demonstrate it here
let's maybe for the first element at the
class M our - auto and you can see or
let's say ml auto you can see for this
last element which is placed here to the
right because we applied order - three
we now applied the margin to the left
and that's the reason why we have now
this gap between element three and one
because the automatic margin has added
here to the left and is filling up the
available space here in the Flex
container okay so I can although apply
let's do it for the second element here
in our auto and now you can see it here
is the margin is applied to the right
side of the element and it's again
filling up the available space here in
the container so for all of the boots
flat for flex utility classes
there are responsive variations away
both so we can say that we do not want
to apply a certain flex behavior in in
total but limit it to a certain screen
size and just to demonstrate it for one
example I'm again using here is the
example with the usage of class a line -
self - center NASA can see here it's
centering element 2 in the vertical
direction here in the column in the row
based layout and now I would like to
change it so that aligning that element
to the this is to the top of our small
screen sizes and it should be displayed
centered as seen here in medium sized
screens and it should be displayed on
the top on large screens so that it is
going to change if we resize our browser
window here and the way to do so is to
use the responsive variations of the
align - self classes so let's start by
saying align - yourself - SD for small
devices and apply start next I would
like to say aligned - itself - MD 4
medium devices - centers or on medium
devices should be centered and finally a
line if - self LG for large devices -
end ok now you can see we are starting
here with a very small window now it's
displayed on the top and now I'm
extending the width you can see okay
it's switching over to center and I'm
going to extend it further and now it's
changing to
the bottom so that is a responsive
behavior and that is a Weibull for all
the classes I demonstrated so far if you
would like to have further guidance on
that take a look at the bootstrap
documentation they will find all the
class names including the responsive
variation class names so this was
