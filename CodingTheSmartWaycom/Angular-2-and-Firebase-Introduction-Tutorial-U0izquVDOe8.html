smart Wacom and today in this short
video tutorial I'd like to give you an
introduction of how to use your angular
2 application together with a firebase
real time database and firebase as a
service which is provided by Google and
the real time database firebase office
is just one of the features of firebase
firebase is a is a back-end which can be
used in your web and mobile application
and offers various services and today we
would like to take a look at the
database service because this is a
perfect fit for you angular 2
application because by using the
firebase database you can get you back
end which is needed for a data-driven
angular 2 application and the back end
is responding and communicating with all
your clients in real time so you have
up-to-date data in all your application
instances ok so let's first take a look
at the firebase website and you can find
the website if you point your browser to
firebase google.com and here you can see
our firebase is a service or a platform
which is offered by Google and so this
website and to create a firebase
application you need to access the
firebase console and to do so you need
to create your account here first so
that you can login to the firebase
website into the console and you can do
that by simply using your Google
credentials and log in and then if I
click here on the console link you can
see that the first view I get is an
overview of all the projects which
are already available and here you have
the link you can create a new file based
project and that is what we are doing
next and this link takes you to a create
a project form here and you need to give
a name for the project this will simply
name it angular to test to because I
already have an a.1 here and then you
can select your country region where you
would like your firebase services to be
hosted and then hit create project it
takes a moment and if the project is
ready you will see here another tile and
you are automatically taken to the
console of this new project so you can
see it here we are in the angular 2 test
code tube project and you can see here
on the left side the navigation menu
gives you access to the various services
firebase offers and one link which is
very important for the sample
application we are going to build in
this tutorial is the database link the
database link gives you access to the
the firebase real time database and that
is the firebase service we would like to
use together with our angular 2
application
ok let's click on the database link and
you can see we are directly taken to the
real time database view and the view is
split up into four tabs by default the
data tab is opened and a Weibull are
links to the rules tab is the usage tab
and the back up step so first take a
look at the data tab and what you can
see here is first of all the link to the
real-time database we will use that URL
that link later on to configure the
firebase settings was in our Anglet
to application so you can if you like
click on that icon here and edit this
link and say ok I want to have something
else but for the moment that is
sufficient that we will use that link
later on and here's a message saying the
default security rules requires users to
be authenticated you will see in a
moment how to adapt the security rules
settings so that we do not use
authentication in the first tab and the
third thing you can see here is the
content of the database and you can see
here this is the root note and there are
currently no data in side ok the next
thing we are going to do is to add some
sample data here under the root node and
the first thing you need to know about
the database is that the data in
firebase is organized in a hierarchical
way so we do have notes and within that
notes we have key value pairs which are
holding our data and the data structure
we are dealing here with in firebase can
be compared to the data structure you
may know from your JSON files it's
organized in a very similar way so let's
add some sample data here so that we
later on in our angular application when
we are accessing the database have some
sample data inside that we can read out
and display in our home user interface
ok first of all we do need a a new sub
node here so let's call it items and
within that aside nodes we are adding
key value pairs with some sample data
sets ok each key value pair of course
consists of on the key the key is
entered here in the name field so just
um
for the moment we are using numeric
thumb keys so first it's item 1 and so
that is the first one and now you can
see we have a new sub node and one item
inside and by using this + icon here we
can continue to add more data elements
within the items sub node pay so add
here's another one and we can of course
add a third one okay I think that's
enough for the moment we'll be ok so now
that we have some sample data inserted
into the real time database here we need
to come back to this message here saying
the default security rules require users
to be authenticated to keep things
simple and easy in our first angular
example we are going to build we would
like to not deal with firebase
authentication so we need to adapt to
the security rules here to not require
users trying to retrieve data from our
database to be authenticated first and
we can do that by switching to the root
step here and here you can see this is a
default a security setting so we have
two routes actually available one for
read access and one for write access and
both routes are saying that the
authenticated object AHS does not need
to be equal to now so basically what is
meant here is that the auth object needs
to be initiated that means that all sent
occation is a Weibull and so you read
and write access is only enabled for
authenticated users and we can change
that by a very simple update here
so the very which is assigned to the
read a rule is replaced by saying group
and the same is done for the value which
is assigned to the second project rule
it's also true okay then
firebase Assessor is informing us that
we have unpublished changes and you can
say publish here to set the new security
rules to active routes are published and
so that is all we need to set here and
if we now go back to the data tab you
can see the message informing us that X
s is only enabled for authenticated
users is gone because we have adapted
security rules and now all users can
access at the data of course this
setting is not a setting which should be
used in production but for our example
now it's sufficient to keep it in that
way okay now that we have data in our
real-time database here in of firebase
we can go on and get to the next step
and the next step is to create an
angular 2 application and then within
that application install a library which
is called angularfire 2 and with it
library available we can make use very
easily make use of firebase services
within our angular application for
example we can access the real time
database read data out of the database
write data to the database and the
angularfire library makes it actually
very easy so the first step we need to
take is to set up a new or initiate a
new angular project from scratch
and to do so the easiest way is to use a
project which is called angular
command-line interface and you can find
it here at a CLI dot angular
I owe and as you can see here the
project comes as an NPM package it's
called angular CLI and first of all if
you haven't done it before you need to
install it by using the NPM install
command and then there is a new command
or Weibo that's z-g command and the ng
command can be used to initiate new
projects as you can see here and it can
be used to yeah use scaffolding and in
projects to at various elements like
components pipes and so on so it's very
easy to to get started with angular 2 by
using the command line interface so the
first step is to make sure that the
command line interface is installed and
if that is the case you can continue
with the next step okay so on the
command line we create a new angular 2
project by using the ng command in the
faroe following way we say ng then use
the new command line parameter here and
then we need to specify the name of the
project and let's use angular 2 firebase
to add the name and now we can execute
that command it takes some time because
now the initial project structure is
loaded and all the NPM dependencies are
installed automatically okay here we are
the installation is complete and now we
can switch to the new directory and to
do a quick check if everything is up and
running we can execute ng search and by
executing that command the web server is
starting up the bundles are built and
just
moment and then the application is
accessible in the browser okay
so switch over to the browser and by
using local host on port 412
4200 you can see that the app is running
it by default size app works okay for
now we will close that window go back to
the terminal
and then I will terminate as a web
server which is running because before
going on with the implementation part of
our application we need to make sure
that two packages are installed so I
will use the npm install command and
then say angularfire 2 because that is a
library we would like to use to make it
a little bit easier to access the
firebase services in angular and we need
the firebase package itself and I will
also give the option save so that those
dependencies are added to package JSON
and then hit enter to install ok as you
can see installation was completed and
now we can start up Adam okay here we
are you can see the initial project
structure here is package JSON and as
you can see here in the dependency
section angry of fire 2 has been added
as a dependency and firebase has been
also headed ok so the next thing which
needs to be done here on our project is
to store the firebase configuration in a
new file and to do that I will open up
the source folder here and within the
environments folder I will create a new
file and I will call that file
fire base config TS and basically we
need for information to access the
firebase database and the first thing is
we need a Z API key then we need an auth
domain a database URL and the storage
bucket so we store those four pieces of
information in one object and export
that object and name it firebase config
okay and the easiest way to get the
configuration in here is to go back to
the firebase console within our project
and open the start page of the project
and here you can see there is a link at
firebase to your web app and by clicking
on that link another pop-up window opens
and here you can see at firebase to your
web application and it gives you a
script tag which contains all the
information we need so we need the API
key information the ask domain the
database URL and the storage bucket
basically and you can directly copy
those key value pairs here so I will
copy those information and then go back
to Adam and insert the configuration
here in my file and that is all what is
needed to access firebase later on in
our application ok so now that our
firebase configuration is stored in
firebase conflict on TS we can continue
in app module here and file app dot
module dot ts2 to include the
angularfire service so that we can later
on make use of that service to retrieve
data and the first thing we need to
is apt to import the statements here
first of all we need to import angular
fire module from the angular fire to
library so the service comes packed into
that module and the module includes
everything we need to get started with
the angular fire to service so we need
to import that model here and together
with that model we need to import our
firebase configuration object and the
name was firebase config this was the
object we have exported in firebase
config ts in the last step and now we
can import it from the location where we
have stored the file and that is in
environments folder and the file is
called firebase config okay
with both import statements available
now we can add the angular fire module
to our app module and we do that by
adding another another element here in
ZM ports um array and what we need here
is angular fire module and we call a
factory method which is called
initialize initialize app and we pass
over as the first and only parameter to
this factory method our configuration
object so it's final base config and
this factory method is returning an
angular fire module which is configured
with our configuration so the module is
already aware of how to
our firebase project and our real-time
database because the URLs and the tokens
are stored in our configuration object
and that is all we need to to get a
module initialized here okay so now that
the angularfire module is part of app
module we can switch over to app
component because app component is also
belonging to ab module and within app
component make use of the angularfire
service okay here we are in app
component TS and you can see here it's
just containing one one variable title
which is containing the text which was
printed out after initially starting the
application and now what we need to add
here is first an import statement with
two things the angularfire service
itself and firebase list observable
because that is the return type we would
like to use later on when retrieving a
list of data which is stored in our real
time database and both both are imported
from the angular fire to library here
okay and then we can add a constructor
so we can just add a constructor here in
the class implementation like so and
pass in the angular fire service by
using dependency injection okay
okay so now with the angularfire service
being injected here into app component
we can in the next step now continue to
request data from our video time
database and just to remember I'm
switching back here to the video time
database and you see we've already
prepared our database to contain one
node which is called items and within
that node we have three data elements 1
2 3 with a well use item 1 item 2 and
items 3 and now back in our code we
would like to retrieve that list of data
and we do so by first initializing
another another element here and that is
called items and this is of type
firebase list of server Bo because if we
in a moment requesting data from the
angularfire service the angular fire
service is always returning observables
because we are dealing here with a real
time database so we get back observables
and every time anything changes in the
real time database we get notified by
subscribing to observe words and as we
are requesting a list here we are using
the type firebase list observables and
the vibe is list observable type can be
further specified by giving a type here
and that type is a ray of any okay with
that items and we said items member
label here in the class we can now
request via angularfire we can request
the observable from the database and we
do that by using this
and assigning Z return type of
angularfire service database that is our
real-time database and we are believing
an observable for a list and that is
done by calling the list method here and
we need to pass in the node from where
we would like to retrieve the list and
in our case as we want to have an
observable for the elements in the items
node we are passing in items okay okay
now we have Z items object which is of
type firebase list observable and with
that observable available we can switch
over to the template of app component
which is available here in F component
HTML and you can see the template is a
very simple this is a standard template
which is generated by the angular
command-line interface when initializing
our project and now we can extend the
template a little bit to con to contain
a list or to output a list of the items
we retrieved why are the observable from
the items node of our firebase real time
database and we do that by using an
unordered list here in our template and
printing out list items and we do that
by using the energy for element and we
say let items of items where items is 0
class member where we start 0 return
firebase list observable in and now we
have an observable E and if we want to
use the observable in our template we
need to wait for
the observable to return data and the
standard way of doing that by using
observables is to subscribe to subset
bolts and here in our template we can
subscribe to the items observable by
just using an angular 2 standard pipe
which is called a sync and the essent
part is applied here with a pipe
operator and then with a keyword a sync
and that is all we need to bring in here
in our template code in the background
is a framework subscribed to the items
observable and returns the values from
our firebase database okay that is all
we need here and then we can close with
a list item and then we can bring in an
expression here and the Dupre expression
is printing out from the current item
the value and the value is Weibull with
dollar value and if we now save it in
the background you can see our
application is already running and for
the moment it's just printing out the
title information over there and now if
I save with a new template it just takes
a moment and then it's updated and as
you can see here our list is printed out
and we have three elements here as it
was expected because there were three
elements in our five wasteful time
database and now the value of the items
is printed out here we can extend our
arms list a little bit by bringing in
another expression and I do it here and
together was value I would like to print
out the key as well and the key is
available with a member dollar key
okay we save it again and you can see
the output is updated again and now we
have the key information so one two
three included in the list as well okay
finally now you can see I have the
running up here in the browser side by
side with my live view in the firebase
real time database and now that we have
our list observable in place and
rendering out as a three items we have
here on the list we can experience how
the real-time database behavior is
reflected in our application on the left
side if I now go here to the right side
and maybe add another item so let's give
it a key again fear and we say item four
as the value and then I edit and in the
moment it was added here to the
real-time database you can see it
appears here it is rendered out as
another list item and if I now go and
delete it again here so delete it's
removed from the database and it's
removed from the rendered list here in
the browser as well so you can see all
of the changes we are doing here to the
real-time database are reflected in
real-time to all of the connected
clients so if you are using multiple ID
instances on different computers for
example they all get the same result
because all the applications are
subscribing to the same list of values
here in the database thank you very much
