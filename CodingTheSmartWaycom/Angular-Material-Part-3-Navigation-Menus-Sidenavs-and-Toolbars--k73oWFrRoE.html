coating the smart way comm and this is a
sir part of our angular material serious
so in the first part you've learned how
to install and embed the angular
material library in your angular for
application how to set up a project and
how to use basic form elements like
buttons input elements and so on and
then in the second part we have been
focusing on dialogues tool tips and
snack bars so pop-ups basically and how
you can embed and use those elements in
your application and now in this third
part we will be focusing on another
important area of the library and that
are navigation elements there are three
main navigation elements in the angular
material library that are up menus side
nav elements and toolbars and in this
tutorial now we will explore how to use
those three elements in your application
step by step so stay tuned okay for this
tutorial I'll assume that you already
have a basic angular for a project
initiated and the angular material
already installed if you would like to
get through the steps to install angular
material in your anger for a project
please some please take a look at the
first part of the series where I explain
every step in detail for now you can see
here I have already prepared a new
project the development server is
already running here in the terminal and
the project is a base angular for
project will see angular material
library installed so everything is set
up so that we can directly dive into
navigation elements and the first
navigation element
which we will be using here in our
application will be the menu element so
for the demonstration of the usage of
the menu element let's first create a
new component in our application so I'm
switching over here to this in the
terminal and I'm using the angular
command-line interface to add a new
component here to the project by saying
mg/g for generate component and then the
name of that component should be menu
demo ok here you can see a new folder is
created here within my app folder it's
called menu demo and you can see it here
for new files in total have been added
and the app dot module dot TS as you can
see it here has also been updated the
menu demo component has been imported
here and has been added to the
declarations array so that menu demo
component will be usable within our
application ok so the first step here in
app dot modular TS is to import some
more modules and the elements of the
angular material library are organized
in modules or need to import those
modules first and what I need here is
first the MD menu module of course
because I'd like to use the menu
components in my application then I need
to add MD buckling module as well
because we will also be using material
design buttons I also need the MD icon
module
and finally I need CMD card module here
and all those modules are imported from
the angular slash material library of
course and then we need to add those
modules to the imports array here of the
ng module decorator as well so that
everything is a Weibull here in our
application so we need to add MD menu
module M the button module MD icon
module and MD card module as well okay
okay now let's switch over to the
template of menu demo component and the
template is a Weibull in file menu demo
component dot HTML so I'll remove the
code which is already inside at that
file okay and then start implementing
our user interface which should
demonstrate as a usage of the MD menu
component first I'll start with an MD
card element just for layout um reasons
so we will be using only card here okay
inside of the MD card element I'm
including an MD - card title to assign a
title here to the card and I will be
using the text angular material menu
demo so let's close that element here so
next we will use on the element MD card
content
I'll play and within the MD - card -
content element first I'll include the
buttons of the users and can click on
that button and by clicking on the
button the menu is triggered so the menu
is popping up and to achieve that
behavior let's start with a button
element here let's use a button in
material design by asana the directive
MD - raised - button assign a color here
we will be using the primary color from
our material seam and then I'll bind
property MD menu trigger for to the
spring menu this is the identifier of
the menu which should be triggered by
clicking on that button we will be
defining that menu next but first let's
close this tech here let's include a
description for the dotnet open menu
menu like so ok and let's close that
element okay so next we need to include
the implementation of the menu and we do
that by using the MD - menu element and
then create a local template variable
here called menu so the name of this
variable should correspond to the string
which has been assigned to UMD menu
trigger for and we need to assign here
as a string and the menu so that we are
storing a reference to the menu in in
the template variable
okay so let's closest element first so
with an MD menu we would like to include
two menu items of course of three menu
items and each menu item is implemented
by using a button element
so that the user can click on that
button and we are assigning the
directive MD - menu - item here tooth
button element like so and within that
button we are including an icon because
I'd like to display an item for each of
the menu elements and to include the
icon I'm using the MD - item element
here so this should get as a set
settings icon okay and then of course
we'll need a text we are embedding that
text of the menu item in a spawn element
so it's settings here playing like so
and now I'm copy this button source code
here and injured at a second time and a
third time
okay and for the second menu item we are
choosing the icon let's say voicemail
and the description here should be check
voicemail and for the third item I'm
choosing the icon notifications
okay and the text displayed here is
disabled unearths okay like so so now
the output which is generated by the
template of menu demo component should
be included in the output we see in the
browser and to achieve that behavior we
need to include that component in our
output of our main components template
and that is located here in app dot
component HTML as you can see here as it
is a default source code which is
available here for that template and
then we can first of all remove all web
content here and then I'm starting out
with development again and within the
div element I'd like to display the
output of my men live demo component and
that is achieved by including the app -
menu demo element here and why is it
called app dot app - menu demo the
reason is because if you take a look at
menu devoted component dot TLC you can
see here the selector property is set to
the string app - menu demo and that is a
string which contains the name of the
element which is used to then include
the components output in another
component template like we did it here
okay so our development server for the
angular application st running as you
can see here in the terminal now we can
check in the browser that the output
corresponds was what we want to achieve
now you can see here it's displaying our
MD card element and within that MD card
element we have the headline here on
solves the title and the button open
menu and now I can click on the open
menu button here and the menu
popping up and you can see I have three
elements here in this menu and I can and
select for example Settings here and
that is the way the MD menu element is
working so what's also possible with
those menus here is that we can
implement so-called nested menus so this
simply means that an MD menu item
element opens up another submenu and to
implement a nested menu in our sample
application we just need to add the MD
menu trigger for attribute once again in
one of our MD menu items and to define a
second menu which is on the nested menu
which opens up so let's dude opening up
a menu demo dot component on HTML once
again here and for the first settings
menu item I'm now adding the MD menu
trigger for and I'm binding it to a
string which is called a sub menu in
that case and then I'm defining another
MD menu element here so MD - menu and
I'm assigning now the template of
arrival called sub menu of course and
I'm again assigning the string MD menu
here so within that second menu now
let's define again three menu item
elements so a button was the directive
MD - menu - item assigned let's call it
general close it button here then copy
that button element and passed it in a
second in a certain time just changing
the text
I know what this play and maybe profile
okay so let's check it at the browser
again I'm opening up my menu the first
menu is displayed now you have the arrow
here and you can see it's opening up now
the submenu here with my three items as
defined so next now let's take a look at
the second element and that's a side nav
element sat-nav as part of the angular
material library as well and makes it
possible to display a panel next or
decide on some form of primary content
and to demonstrate the usage of side nav
let's first create another new component
in our application again by using the
angular command-line interface so here
in my terminal in my project directory
I'm again saying ng the component and
the new component should be called side
nav demo ok it will turn and you can see
here it's again generating a new
subfolder of your side nav demo with
four new files in side and epcot module
of PS has been updated again the
component is already included here in
attitude the declarations array so
everything is set up so that we can make
use of side nav demo component to
demonstrate as a usage of side nav next
so to make use of the side nav element I
first need to import one more module
here and the module we do need an MD
side nav
module and don't forget to enter that
new model module here to z imports array
as well okay so everything is set up so
now we can switch to use the template of
side nav demo component remove the
content here and start over again okay
so let's start with an MD - card element
again here in that file let's assign a
class as well which is called demo -
panel we will be implementing the
corresponding CSS code later on and
within that MD card element let's make
use of an MD card
title here and now the title should
being you laura material side nav demo
this demo okay
the next element we do need here is MD -
card - content of course so within the
content we start using the MD sidebar a
side nav container element first so it's
MD - side nav
- container and I'll be assigning a
class here as well which is called
example container so let's close that
container element first within that
container now let's define the site and
Neph element itself which is done by
using MD - side Neph let's assign a
template variable here is suicide Neff
and I'll be using a class again this
time this class is called example side
nav okay
so within the MD - side nav element
let's include just text information so
side nav content goes here that's a
place where it can endure all the code
which is needed to - displays a side nav
content and now we need to include a
button so that the user is able to
trigger and open up the side nav and
I'll be embedding that button in in the
development and signing a class here
which is called example -
side nav - content okay so now then we
are defining a button here of type
button MD button and the click event is
bound to the following code so side nav
and then I called the open method to
open up the side nav
okay like so let's close the button here
and the button should contain the label
open side now okay like so okay so next
let's add the CSS implementation here in
pharma side FD water component dot CSS
and first I need to define the class
example - container would what to
include once we CSS properties here so
first of all we are defining the weather
should be of hundred percent okay Mac so
the height should be a three hundred
pixels and I would also like to you
define the border of one pixel solid and
give it a color following okay like so
now I need to define a class example -
side nav - content the display mode here
should be Flex height should be 100%
aligned items should be sent to you
center to center all the content here
it's basically on a button and justify
content should be Center as well to
center the button bills horizontally and
vertically
ivana items okay like so next let's
define cross example - site 9f just was
a padding of 20 pixels and finally you
don't forget to define demo - panel with
the margin of 10 pixels okay like so so
let's copy and passed on the CSS class
demo panel here - menu demo that
component dot CSS as well okay then go
back to the template and I will use that
class here are four of the MD - code
element as well so the AMOLED panel
okay and now finally to make the content
of side nav table available in our
browser we do need to include it here in
our main components template as well so
I'll add here AB dot in AB - side nav
demo ok like so so back here in our
browser else as web server still running
you can see the content has already been
updated automatically now you can see we
have two card areas a Weibull here the
second card area now is containing the
output of our side nav demo component
and you can see here in that area I have
the button a Weibull open side nav and
if I now click on the button you can see
the side nav he is popping up here at
the left side and you can see the
content just as saying side nav content
goes here because we have only included
the text so far of course you can
include all the buttons
or other element whatever you like so
that's a ways a side nav is working so
the default behavior as you can see here
is that the side nav content is floating
over the primary content you can see it
here so the primary content is not
moving away it's just floating over we
can change the set behavior by using the
mode property for the side nav element
and change it to push and the difference
here is that and the primary content is
pushed out of the way and I'd like to
demonstrate is this so let's go back
into side nav demo component today HTML
and four of the MD - side nav element
here we are adding the property mode and
I'm assigning the spring push here
okay let's save it
so let's save it back in the browser if
I now click on open side NIF again you
can see it's pushing over to the to the
right side the primary content here so I
think the difference in that behavior
becomes with the pull here so ok finally
is the last navigation element we'd like
to use in our application is a toolbar
element from the material library and
first of all again I'm here in my
terminal and I'd like another component
for the demonstration of the toolbar and
again I'm saying ng D component toolbar
demo in that case ok hit return and
again we get of a new component files
generated and first of all again I'm
opening up app dot module dot es adding
another material every module here and
that is called MD toolbar module okay
and included here in the imports over I
as well MD total module ok and now I can
open up the new file toolbar then a
toolbar not component or HTML removes
the default content again and then start
implementing the code which is needed to
demonstrate the usage of the toolbar
component so I'm starting with MD - card
again assigning the class of demo -
panel include an MD -
current title element here we see
headline angular material toolbar demo
okay next let's use an MD - card -
content
element and within that content element
let's use MD - toolbar element and I'd
also like to use the color attribute
here and assign of the string primary to
display our toolbar and the primary
color which is defined defined by the
seam we are using okay so within the
toolbar at first I'd like to use a spawn
element here and include the text first
row so okay let's include on the toolbar
demo component in F dot component dot
HTML as well with AB dash to pound demo
okay and let's copy and past as a demo
panel class here T 2 bar dot component
auto CSS as well okay here we have still
our present what's not include include
the first row text here as part of the
element should be the content of the
span element okay so let's check it back
here in the browser now you can see the
cert MD card area is visible and the
toolbar here is displayed and the
primary color of our seam with a first
row okay so the toolbar cannot only
consist of just one column we can add
multiple columns to over to over and
just demonstrate I'll add another column
here inside the MD - toolbar element so
let's use the MD -
to borrow here to add a second row and
this second row should first contain a
text again so I'm using the spawn
element here and include within the span
element the text second row and then
this second row should not only contain
a text information should contain an
icon as well but the icon should be
displayed and on the left side it should
be displayed on the right side so I'm
using another span element here which is
getting the class tool bar spacer to
fill up the space here okay and then use
the MD - icon element again with a class
of toolbar - icon and the icon which
should be displayed here is a favorite
icon
okay and now of course I need to enter
the CSS code for toolbar - spacer and
toolbar - icon as well - to body mode
component dot CSS so let's add the
corresponding code here so first of all
we have toolbar - I can I'd like to
define a padding here for the icon so it
should be no pixels and 30 pixels okay
and finally I need to include the CSS
code for
so class toolbar - spacer and I'd like
to have a flex element here and assign
the following values okay now let's
check the result in the browser and here
you can see now a second row is
displayed the icon is displayed here on
the right so that exactly what we were
expecting
expecting to get as a result here thanks
