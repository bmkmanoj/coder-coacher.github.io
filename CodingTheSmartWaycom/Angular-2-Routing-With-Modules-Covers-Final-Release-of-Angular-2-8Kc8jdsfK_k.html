Matt Wacom and today in this video I'd
like to give you a short introduction to
the new angular 2 routing concept which
is now available with a final release of
angular 2 and the main difference to the
routing concept which was used earlier
on in in beta versions and in the
release candidate versions now the new
angular 2 modules concept is used to
attach the routing configuration in your
application and in this video I will
walk through a simple sample application
setting up the application or step by
step implementing the various pieces we
need and showing you how you can set up
routing in angular 2 so let's get
started ok we start with a simple
project structure you can see it here
and the project structure is set up by
simply following the angular 2
QuickStart tutorial you can find the
QuickStart tutorial if you go to angular
I oh that's the main website of the
project and there is link a get started
button which is directly taking you to
the QuickStart tutorial and by following
the steps you will end up with a project
structure which should look similar to
what we have here just let me go quickly
through it we have a package.json file
that file is containing our npm
dependencies we do need for this angular
2 project you can see it here here are
the angular modules as dependencies and
some other dependencies we do need we do
have the system GS config dot GS file
this file is the main configuration file
for the system GS module
loader and is containing the standard
configuration here which is also a
Weibull if you go through the QuickStart
tutorial we do have the TS config JSON
file this is the main configuration file
for the typescript compiler mess you can
see here we have various configuration
settings inside and that is also the
standard configuration as it is
available in the QuickStart tutorial the
last configuration file is typing Stata
Jason which is containing typescript
definition files which are needed for
example for the Jasmine library and for
some or for a note as you can see here
and that file is needed because the
typescript compiler is not able to
retrieve some of the definition files
automatically most of the definition
files are retrieved automatically but
some of them needs to be configured here
as dependencies so that the compiler is
able to find the definitions then we
have the index.html file this is a
starting point as you can see here we
have already configured the header
section which is containing some script
elements we do need here and we have
also included the bootstrap framework
you can see it here with a GS file and
we'll see a corresponding style sheet
file though later on we are able to make
use of boot script components to
implement in user interface in our
application then we have the app folder
and that folder is containing the main
implementation of our application you
can see it here we are starting right
away we have app component dot TS that
file is containing the main main
component of our application and
is configured in in a way you can see it
here by using template URL as a
component property which is pointing to
an external template file and the
external template file is available in F
component HTML next we have F dot module
dot ts that is the main angular 2
application module every angular 2
application should at least have one
module and by convention this main
module is called app module and is
implemented in file F dot module dot TS
and the module is implemented by using
the yet ng module decorator and this
decorator in this case has three
properties imports where we are
importing other modules declarations
where we are assigning an array which is
containing all the components we want to
include in app module at the moment as
we have only one component that is AB
component with only one element here in
that array and then we have the
bootstrap property which is containing
the main component which should be
loaded first when the application start
and in our case that is again AB
component and then we have made yes
that file is containing the code which
is needed to start the bootstrapping
process and finally it is calling the
bootstrap module function and we are
passing in app module because that is
the main application module and then
this module knows which component to
load first because we have used the
bootstrap property within that module
and that the bootstrap property has been
assigned with the array which is
containing AB component at the main
application component and then when the
module is parsed here it is a bootstrap
module function the framework knows
which component needs to be loaded first
so that is the basic setup we are going
to start with and now we can go through
the next steps which are needed to get
routing to work okay the first thing I'd
like to add to the project is three more
components because in the next step we
will configure the routes and for our
application and each route will be
connected with one component so that
when the user types in one specific
route in the browser the connected
component is loaded and the output from
the components template is displayed to
the user and to get the components here
in our project the first thing I will do
is to create three new files and I will
create those files in the app directory
and just the name name the components
our first component dot TS and then we
create a file second component TS and
assert component and this component is
called search component TS so now the
files are available and we can start
right away with implementing first
component and we will do a very very
comprehensive implement implementation
so just set em one or two lines of
output generated by the components
template the first thing we need to do
of course is to import component from
the at angular 2 core library
then at the component decorator and the
component decorator is containing one
property which is called selector that
is an our case my app and another
property which is containing the HTML
code for the template and as we are only
implementing a very short template we
can do it inline and to do it in line we
are using backticks here and then we are
able to include multi-line HTML template
code right here in the file so we do not
need to use external template files we
can do it here right in the year in the
component implementation file and the
template will just include one headline
that headline is saying okay we're in
first component and maybe another line
of text this is the first component this
is sufficient okay and then of course
finally we need to at the class and that
is all we need for our component
implementation so I will save it okay
and then we will use the exact same
component implementation here in second
component the only thing we need to
change is the wording here so it's 2nd
component and of course a class name in
this case it's also called a second
component and again we are going okay
save it we are going to sort component
insert the template code change it is
surd
and of course the class name dessert
component and that is all we need now in
the second step we will bring in our
route uh configuration by implementing a
new module and to implement that module
which is containing our Rooter
configuration we will add first another
file in the app folder and this file is
called app dot routing dot TS and first
we need some input statements here we
need to import the ng module decorator
from again the angular core library
because we are implementing a module
here so we need a set decorator and then
we are importing two new things
the first is routes and route a module
from the angular ruta package next we
import a first component from first
component component ok and of course
second component and finally third
component so we have all our custom
components a label for the router
configuration and then we can continue
with the implementation by introducing a
new array and that is a Const array the
array is called routes and its subtype
roots and is containing three elements
at first and each element is a routes
object so a configuration object for a
specific route and therefore we need two
properties within that configuration
object we need the past property and the
past property is receiving a string
which is the URL extension of that
specific route so here it is first and
just that you see it if we access our
application for example at HTTP the
local post later on specifying a path
with a spring first means that we can
access that route by calling later on in
the browser localhost first that URL
will then correspond to that route okay
so of course I need to delete it and a
second property is used here and that
its component because we want to connect
that ul pass with a specific component
and of course the URL paths first is
connected with a component first
component and that is all we need so
each routes object which is available
here and that array is consisting of two
properties passed as
pass this is the URL extension and
component that is a component which is
loaded when that route is accessed in
the browser
okay so let's complete it here we of
course again need it for second
component and search component to get it
complete and of course we need a
different pass here as well we say
second and we say shirt ok so now we
have completed the routes array which is
containing three objects which are
connecting a certain path to a component
but I'd like to add one more object on
top and that routes object is a little
bit different because what we need is a
default route so when no URL extension
is used and that is simply a path with
an empty string and now we need another
attribute or property which is called
passed match so we want to have a full
match here and now that is different we
do not need to bring in component
because we want to do a redirect and to
do a redirect we can use the property to
redirect to and then just assign a pass
string so we are assigning first because
every time the user calls on the default
URL without any extension so for example
just localhost this route configuration
becomes valid and then angular 2 is
doing a redirect
component and loads on the connected
component that is in this case first
component here so with that force
configuration object now away but our
routine configuration is complete okay
the next thing we need to do is to
implement the module because at the
moment we have just a routine
configuration available here in our
array and now we need to use that
configuration within a module and that
is done by using again the decorator ng
module okay and then using the imports
property which gets an array and now we
are doing something special here we are
saying router module and then calling on
the method for route and passing in our
configuration array so what this method
call is doing is to take our
configuration object and then return a
Ruta module which is configured for our
route our setup and we do it here within
the import array because that statement
is returning a configured routing module
and that is exactly which what we want
to have and what we want to import here
in our custom routing module okay and
another thing it's needed as its exports
and we are exporting route our module
because we want everything what is a
Weibull in routing module to be also a
Weibull
in our application and in a moment we
will be importing that Reuter module
here in our main application module and
by doing that also things which are
imported or exported here will then be
imported in our main application module
and therefore become a Weibull
application wide ok to complete it here
we of course need to do at the class
because otherwise we cannot attach the
ng module decorator ok export class and
we call it app routing module and the
class is just left empty another thing
we will introduce here is an Const a
which is called routing components and
that array is containing first component
second component and third component and
you can see here it is exported so later
on we can import a routing components as
an array containing all our routing
components in app module and then make
it a little bit easier to add all those
components to app module by simply using
that array now with a routing module in
place we can switch over to our app
module and include a polluting module
for routing configuration on application
level so just switch over app module TS
that's the file where the main
application module is already
implemented and we need to add on some
things first an import statement because
we want now to import app routing module
and the routing components array
from uprooting and so and now with both
objects available we can first add app
routing module to Z imports array and
second use the routine components array
here within the declarations array so
that we do not have to write first
component second component insert
component in a row we can simply use
routine components and another advantage
of that approach is that we do not need
to add the import statements for first
second and third component in app module
ts file as well so we do not need the
import statements here we can simply use
here's a typo routing components because
that is the array already containing the
components which are used in the routing
configuration
it was exported in every routing in the
approving module file and now it is
imported here and we are using it here
in the declarations array so that's
basically all what needs to be added
here to our app module implementation
now we have attached our routing
configuration which is available in a
routing module to our main application
module and the last step which we need
to complete in order to get our
application running is to change the
template implementation of app component
I've already prepared a little template
as you can see here so what you will
find here is some bootstrap elements to
to get an navigation bar and the
navigation bar which is used here in
that section is containing three links
as you can see here and these links for
first component second component and
third component
links the user can use in the navigation
bar to go to the routes we have
configured and to create Reuter links we
can use an attribute the angular Reuter
module provides which is called Rooter
link as you can see here and all we need
to do is to assign a string to Rooter
link which is containing the pass
extension with slash which is
corresponding to the path of the root we
want to link to another thing which you
can find here in the app component
template is a diff section here which
contains an element which is called
Rooter outlet this element is a
placeholder for the router so that the
framework knows where to insert the
resulting content from the component
which is activated by calling a specific
route a link so for example if first URL
is used here the first component gets a
loaded the template gets loaded and the
output which is generated by the first
components template is placed right here
in this place so now we are ready to go
we can start up the application and the
final result will look like you can see
in the following so this is our
application UI you can see here we have
the navigation bar with three navigation
options in sight and we can now switch
over to the components and you can see
here that the content section is updated
with the template output which is
generated by our various components here
