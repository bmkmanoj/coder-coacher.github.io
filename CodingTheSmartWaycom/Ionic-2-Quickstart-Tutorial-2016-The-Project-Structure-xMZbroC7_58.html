smart way comm and today in this next
video of the io- series we are going to
take a look at project structure in the
last part of this video series we have
built first ionic 2 projects we have
used templates to generate an initial
project structure and today we are going
to dive deeper into that topic and take
a look at the project structure which
has been generated
okay we are back in our project with a
name by Iona Kappa oh three this project
has been generated in the last video by
using the ionic to start a template with
a name blank so we just get generated a
project without a side menu and without
a taps menu we have seen as a rather
starter templates are delivering menus
but the blank template is just an empty
template not containing any content yet
and that's the best thing we can start
with when we are now go to examine the
project structure so let's start Adam to
see the project structure in a tree so
here it is loaded as you can see so
let's leave it like that so now you can
see the project which has been generated
by the ionic command-line interface and
that's the blank template so we are
starting here with siapa folder the app
folder we can just expand it here is a
folder in which most of the
implementation work is happening so when
we are coding the ionic 2 application
this work is done here in the F folder
and you can see within the app folder
there are already three parts inside
there's a pages folder we will take a
look inside just in a second there's the
same folder and there is a file called F
dot T s that's a typescript file because
we have choosen to generate our project
based on typescript we haven't specified
this command-line option TS and that's
the reason why we now have the code
bases on typescript so you can see here
is the TS files and the project so let's
expand the pages folder and see what's
inside here is another subfolder
included and this sub folder is called
home in the pages folder we will find
all the pages which are part of our
ionic
object as we have started on the blank
project template there's only one page
included and that is the home page so
let's expand the home folder here and
you can see each page is consisting of
multiple files in this case we have the
home HTML file which contains the
template code for our home page
component we have CS CSS file which
contains a styling and we have the home
dot ts file which contains the
implementation of our home page
component so let's take a look inside
just starting with the TS file here you
can see that's the implementation of a
very basic ionic 2 component a page
component so what do we have here we
have a class as this class is exported
of course because we want to import it
later in other components this class is
called home page and to make sure that
this class is a recognized Buzi
ionic 2 framework as a page we do need
to add as a page decorator here and
that's added bit was at page and here
you can see this page decorator just at
the moment
contains one property and this property
is called template URL and this property
is taking a string and the string is
containing a path to our template file
which is used to generate the HTML
output which is needed to display the
home page and you can see this path is
pointing to our home dot HTML file
because that is the file which is
containing the template so the
constructor and the file is just empty
some no implementation yet just an empty
class with with the template URL set to
the template the HTML template file ok
there's another part inside that file
and that is the import statement because
we want to declare home page to be an
ionic to page we need to have access
to the page decorator which was added
here and to get access to this decorator
we need to import page here from ionic
angular library and that is done here
okay so let's take a look at the
template which is also part of this page
and it's included here and you can see
it's just a very comprehensive template
actually so we have enough bar area here
it's at the moment just containing a
title no navigation buttons so far and
we have an area which is described by
the iron content element and this is
containing some content cut header and
hello world
this text is outputted in into the our
application page and that this is the
basis template which the home page is
using by default so as we are going
along we will add more folders here
inside of pages because our application
will surely consist of multiple pages
and then another folders added here each
of the pages subfolders is containing
always multiple elements to contain the
class implementation in typescript to
contain the template and the styling
code so three elements that the standard
and that's how pages are here built into
the app folder okay we have another part
here and that is a seam folder you can
see we have stylings included for the
various platforms here just to get an
overview and we have the implementation
of our main ionic component that's the
starting point of our ionic application
and that is a Weibull here in the file
app ts okay let's take a look inside you
can see again we have an implementation
of an class and in this case it's called
my app that's the main app component of
the pie only two application and you can
see it's implemented in a slightly
different way than our homepage because
we are not using an page class decorator
here instead we are using the app
decorator and to get access to the app
decorator we of course need to import
app and that is done here with the first
line you can see app is imported again
from
ionic angular and that's the playback
wizard to edit the page the app
decorator here to the class again with
this decorator available we are
attaching a template for our main
component again it's slightly different
we are not attaching a template in the
form that we are pointing to an external
file where the HTML template core code
is stored we are just designing the
template code to the template property
here in line so without the need of
implementing an external HTML file as in
most situations the template code for
our main component might grow a little
bit bigger it's a good idea to change it
here to template URL not template and
then point to an external file maybe app
dot HTML at that file here and then you
can keep the template HTML code separate
from the typescript code here for the
class implementation okay you can see it
here we are using an I enough element
and we are setting the root property and
this property is bound to root page and
here can see the root page property of
the class which is of type any in
pointing to the home page we just saw
okay is the next important folder here
in our project the structure is a www
folder you can see it here and let's
extend this folder and you can see there
are two components in that folder there
is a subfolder which is called built and
an index dot HTML file so what is
happening here you have seen that we are
implementing our application mainly in
the app folder zetz where all our
application a specific type script and
HTML code goes in and then when you
execute the ionic application and the
build process is running the build
process is mainly taking as a code from
app and applying compilation and
translation steps because we have been
implementing our application by using
typescript features and egg math script
at 2015 features and that is something
which cannot be directly ascended to the
browser it needs to be compiled and
transpiled to validate our script code
which can be interpreted by most of the
current browsers and this build process
is happening in the background and as a
result of the build process is included
in the www folder and in the subfolder
build you can see the software build
contains again some subfolders we have a
folder where all our styling goes in CSS
a second folder contains fonts assert
folder is called GS and is containing as
a Yahveh script code which is as a
result of the translation process and
the last folder here is called pages and
we can take a look inside its containing
a subfolder home and here the template
code code of our home component is
located as you can see here in the our
script folder you can not find
corresponding files to our type script
of files from our app folder and
the reason for that is it's a build
process is all is taking all of our type
of the script code doing the translation
and then bundling the resulting
JavaScript code in just one single
bundle file and this bundle file is
called a bundle dot GS as you can see
here so just one file for all our
application specific JavaScript code
that makes it a little bit easier to
include on that code into our
application and that leads us to the
index dot HTML file which is also
located here in the WWF folder and the
index dot HTML file as you can see here
is the only file here in the w-w-w
folder which is not a result of the
build process and can be edited manually
or the other stuff which is located here
in the build folder do there's no need
to date it manually it's just a result
which is generated in in the build
process so in index dot HTML you can
find the entry point for our application
that's the page which is loaded at the
beginning in it we have a head section
where the metadata for our application
is set and some link elements are used
to include the platform specific styling
and then it second is saying here is a
body section and in the body section you
can find one important element and that
is Ione app this element is used mainly
as a placeholder this placeholder is
replaced at a runtime with a resulting
HTML code which is generated from the
main component of our ionic 2
application and this resulting HTML code
is then placed exactly here at that
position so the ion app element is
replaced by there is
HTML code of our ionic to application
the last part here and the body section
is that we are including some scripts
the first script is called Cordova GS
which is including the Cordova framework
then a second script is the polyfill
library which is needed so that we can
use Atma Script 2015 features and older
browsers then we have a library included
which is called leaf like metadata and
zone a GS both libraries are used in
angular 2 and then the last library
which is most important of course as he
kept or bundled TS library from the
folder built GS and that file as
described is containing all our
application specific JavaScript code and
so was just one script include here we
can include all of our application yeah
our script files
okay the next thing which is important
in our project various configuration
files which are included and as you can
see here you can find all the
configuration files in the root folder
of our project and let's go quickly
through the meaning of the various
configuration files so that you get a
better understanding of what
configuration is needed here
let's first start with the config dot
XML file here and that file is mainly
used by the Cordova framework just to
contain settings which are used for
building your application for the iOS
and Android platform if you added those
platforms to your project the next file
here is the gulp file dot GS and the
build process in ionic 2 is based on the
garb task runner and that file basically
is including all the tasks which are
needed in the build process and yeah you
do not have to change here anything it's
just configured to contain all the steps
which are needed and you can leave it as
it is the next thing is the ionic
conflict of JSON files it is a very
short file you can see only some
metadata here regarding our project you
can see that version 2 is set to true as
we have choosen to generate our project
for version 2 of the ionic framework and
typescript is set to true as we have
chosen to generate our project based on
type of script the next configuration
file is package dot adjacent and this is
a very important configuration file
because package daughter JSON is
containing all our dependencies for the
ionic 2 projects and you can see here we
have two sections we have the
dependencies section here which is
wasting the
note packages which are needed for
running our application in production
mode and we have the DEF dependencies
which are in addition needed in the
development mode and we have a set of
Cordova plugins which are needed when we
are building ionic 2 for iOS and Android
and some dependencies for platform
specific things here ok so you can see
here we have on our angular and BM
packages included for example we have
ionic packages included we have reflect
metadata and a zone GS for example and
as def dependencies we have some gout
packages we need for running the build
process and of course Cordova plugins
which were configured in config dot XML
to be used when building for the mobile
platforms so all the packages which are
listed here are installed when running
npm install and npm install is
downloading and installing those
packages automatically and yeah
installing those packages into a folder
which is called node modules as you can
see here so we have a lot of sub folders
included here and yeah you can find a
lot of packages which need it because
not only the dependencies which are
listed here are downloaded and installed
but although dependencies of those
packages are sent downloaded and
installed so all the dependencies
starting from our project then down to
the dependencies in the packages itself
are resolved downloaded and installed in
as a node modules folder so that we have
included all the things which are needed
in our project folder ok the next
configuration file is T as config
daughter Jason and T as config
J'son is a configuration file for the
typescript compiler which is a running
as part as of our build process and here
you can see our some compiler settings
included you do not need to change here
anything so just leave that file as it
is it's prepared and it's running with
the build process without any problems
the last file is typing started J'son
that's the file where the needed
typescript definition files and
dependencies are listed and when running
npm install the Taipings command is is
executed after having installed all the
dependent packages and the Taipings
command is using this typing Stata json
file to find needed typescript
definition files download those
definition files and then installing the
definition files right here in the
Taipings folder into our project thank
