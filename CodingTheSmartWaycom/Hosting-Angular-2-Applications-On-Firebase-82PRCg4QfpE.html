smart Wacom and today in this video
tutorial I'll show you how to use a
firebase platform as a hosting option
for your angular 2 application in one of
our last video tutorials we already have
used firebase as a real time database
for our application and this time we are
exploring the hosting feature which is
great for hosting your angular 2
application so stay tuned so to be able
to deploy an angular 2 application to
firebase hosting the first thing we need
of course is an angular 2 application
and the easiest way of setting up a new
angular 2 application is using the great
angular command-line interface the
website is available here at CLI angular
dot IO and if you haven't done it before
you first need to install the angular
command-line interface and you can
achieve that by using the node package
manager and say install - G as you can
see it here for installing it globally
on your system and then just specifying
the package name and that is angular -
CLI having installed the client on your
system a new command becomes available
and that the C and G command and with
that command Wavell we can now set up a
new initial angular 2 project which we
then later on can use for hosting on
firebase so on the command line the
first thing I do is to initiate a new
project by saying ng giving the option
new followed by the name of the project
and I choose here FB - host -
test and execute that command by hitting
return and now a new folder is created
with the same name as the project as you
can see here the initial project
template is downloaded and and copied
into that folder and then the command is
installing all the dependencies or the
node packages which are needed for our
angular 2 application automatically in
the background it just takes a minute
here and then it's ready to go
okay here we are installation is
complete and now we can change into that
new project directory was saying CD and
followed by the project name which is at
a - host - test and to make sure that
everything was installed correctly and
the application is working we can simply
type in ng surf that is starting up the
webserver building the packages which we
needed and starting up the application
on localhost port
4200 as you can see here ok the web
server is running and we can change to
the browser and check what's a Weibull
here on port 4200 and you can see it's
printing out app works and that is all
we wanted to know because that is
showing us that the application is
working the web server is running and
now we can use that very basic angular 2
application to deploy it on firebase in
the next steps okay to be able to
actually deploy our application we need
to build it for production and that is
very easy here back on the command line
first I'm going to stop the web server
process which is still running here
then use the ng command again and now we
can say ng built and as we wanted to
build it for production I'll give in
additional special parameter here which
is - - prod and with that parameter we
are initiating a build process which is
optimizing our application for
production which basically means that a
bundling is taking place minification is
taking place so everything we need to
make our application as fast as possible
and then was that production but we can
deploy later on to firebase and yeah use
it in the dist folder okay let's hit
return and see that entry build is
working okay the build process is ready
and the result is put into the dist
subfolder within the project folder and
the next step we need to do is to switch
over this browser and I've already
opened the firebase console you can
access it here at console or fire-based
or google.com and here in the firebase
back-end you can create a new project
and that is needed because for the
features firebase offers you always need
to create a firebase project first and
then with a new application you can make
use of firebase by using a specific
firebase project I hit the button create
new project and then the following
dialog comes up here we need to give the
project a name and we can again choose
FB host test and select a location where
the firebase project should be stored on
the cloud service and then hit create
project okay if the project is created
and ready you are directly taken to the
overview of the project here and
left aside here from the menu you can
see links to the various services
firebase offers for example here the
hosting service we would like to use
mm-hmm
with our angular 2 project and if I
click on hosting you can see the
dashboard is empty so far so no no
deployments listed here and later on
after we've made a deployment and we
come back here you will see that the
deployments are listed here and you can
see all the deployments made to that
product so the next step we are going to
make is to install the firebase command
line interface and I switch back to the
terminal here and the firebase command
line interface gives you the option to
deploy a project to one of the firebase
projects from the command line and that
is exactly what we want to do with our
angular 2 project so we need at that
table and it can be installed by once
again using the NPM command with the
install option - tree and then the name
of the package is firebase - tools okay
so it's installing ok the installation
is ready and now we have a new command
of Weibull on our system and that
command is firebase and now we can use
that command to first login in to
firebase here from the compartment and
we do that by saying firebase and using
the option log in ok so we say no here
and that is taking us directly to the
website and here I can authenticate
again with my firebase account and then
switch back to the command line and you
can see the authentication and the
browser is recognized here and we are
locked in with my account
with my firebase account and now here on
the command line we can use the firebase
command once again because we are
authenticated
and initialize a new firebase project
here was in our angular 2 project folder
and we do that by saying firebase in it
teal completes the initialization here
on the command line we do have to answer
some questions the first question here
is what firebase command line interface
features do you want to set up for this
folder and we of course want to have
hosting here and so as select hosting
and hit return the next question is to
choose the firebase project we want to
associate our folder with and that is of
course FB - host - test because this is
a firebase project we created in the
previous step in the firebase console so
I select that project here and the next
question is what farm should be used for
database rules we can simply hit return
here because we are not using database
rules and that is the next question is
very important what do you want to use
as your public directory and as we have
executed is a built for production we do
need to say here this because that is a
folder where the production build is
stored in - next question is configured
as a single page app which means
basically that all the URLs are written
to index.html and as we are using an
angular 2 application here which is a
single page we do have to say yes okay
and next question is if the index.html
file in the dist folder should be
overwritten that should not be the case
so I should say no and with answering
that last question the firebase
initialization is complete and the next
step we can deploy our application so to
deploy the application we again are
using the file
this command and this time executing
firebase was the option to deploy and
that is all what is needed here it takes
a moment because now the content of the
dist folder is transferred to the
firebase server and make Weibull to the
internet okay here we are deployment has
been done and now we get back the
hosting URL here and we can now take
this URL copy it go to the browser and
see if everything is working
okay and you see we get the exact same
result with the text app works as we got
before when accessing of the application
on localhost and now the hosting is on
the firebase server and you can adapt
all that you are of course to a custom
URL if you would like in the firebase
console it's possible so we can switch
back to the console and now you can see
the dashboard overview has changed you
see we have one deployment with a Surrey
only and the current deployment here in
our list and if you would like to change
to a custom domain you can use that
button here connect custom domain thank
you very much for watching this war
