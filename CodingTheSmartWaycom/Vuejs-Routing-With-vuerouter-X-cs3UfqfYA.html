this again is about stem from coding
this math Wacom and in this tutorial
today I'm going to give you an
introduction to routing with new jails
and we are going to use the core view
route a packet which is called view -
router and by using that package it's
very easy to establish routing in your
application and we are going through the
complete process starting with the
initial sample application from scratch
and then establish the routing
configuration implementing some
components and see how everything works
so stay tuned okay so let's see how to
start the first step of course is to
initiate a new project
muu science - project and the easiest
way to do so is to use the view
command-line interface so I have already
installed a view CLI on my system so I
can make use of a command which is
called view but if you have not
installed you command-line interface on
your system you need to do that first
and the easiest way to do is just use
NPM then install - GT install it
globally on your system and the package
name here is a view - CLI so that's the
command what is needed to install the
view command-line interface so I will
skip the installation as the view or CLI
is already installed and just move on to
the next step if the view command-line
interface is installed we can now make
use of the view command to initiate a
new project and the option I need here
is in it and I would like to use the
webpack template so I'm saying webpack
the next option and then finally I need
to specify the project name I would
to use and in my case its view - routes
- router or let's say routes oh one okay
so hit return and now you can't see it's
downloading the web pack template for
our view project and then the initiated
patient process here running at the
command-line is asking some questions so
I need to you to give a project name
here I can leave it to the default
setting a project description the author
information I need to choose the view
built mode here we need to say run time
plus compiler and then it's asking me if
I would like to install the package of
you - router and we of course would like
to install the package because we are
creating an application - - to show how
the view router packages working so I
can hit return here because yes the
default option I'm adding years into my
project as well
standard but I do not want to include a
unit test setup was common marker here
so I'm saying no end-to-end testing I
would also not like to include so no
again and okay here we are
okay so now you can see the project the
initial project setup has been
downloaded successfully a new folder was
created and now we can change into that
folder so it's named as specified at the
command line it's view - routes - oh one
so now I'm in that folder and now I need
to - to call NPM install because the
dependencies have not been installed yet
so I need to
do that step now and by hitting enter
here
NPM installed as running and this is
going to take to take a few seconds it's
downloading the dependencies now and
then installing everything into the node
modules folder within my project ok here
we are you can see everything was
downloaded and installed successfully
and now I can pry it out by starting the
development web server which can be done
by using the empty hammer command again
and now I need to use the run option and
the death option so it's starting up the
development web server and you can see
the server is starting up and then the
project is loaded in the browser you can
see it here so it's running that's our
own default output from the default
project setup and now we are ready to go
we have an initial view ondrea's to
project the view guys - routed package
is already installed and now we can move
on and see how the router is going to
work ok here I'm already inside my code
editor which is Adam and you can see
I've opened up the project structure
here and s we have choosen to historic
view there's a router package as part of
our initial project setup the router
package has not only been added to the
project but an initial router
configuration is already available and
let's see a way I can find it you have
to go into the source folder here and
then there is a subfolder router as you
can see so opening up that subfolder and
inside the router subfolder is the index
dot JSP so let's open it up ok increase
the font size a little bit in here I
don't see that yeah we initial router
configuration so first of all you need
to notice that
that an import statement is included
which is importing router from the view
- router package so that's important and
then it's a calling that view dot use
function and it's passing as a parameter
to the function the router so that's
that's needed to at the router package
as a middleware java application without
that functions it would not be possible
to use the router functionality inside
of our application and then it's
creating a new instance of router and
exporting that instance here and the
router instance is expecting to get one
parameter as you can see here is an
object and the object is containing a
property which is called routes and the
routes property gets assigned an array
which is containing all the
configuration objects before the routes
we would like to set up in our
application and at the moment as you can
see here it's only including one route
configuration object and that object is
consisting of three properties
it's consisting of the past property
which is pointing to the default route
of the application it's getting a name
assigned here as string so it's called
hello and on the most important property
here it's the component property it's
set to you hello hello is imported from
the components folder here so it's a
component our application which is a
Weibull a view component and we are
connecting that component to a path
simply means if you now are pointing
your browser to that path and they were
executing a request here the following
component is activated and there is a
template of that compare
we used to generate the HTML output and
then the output is generated and can be
inserted into the resulting HTML code of
our application okay okay now we saw
that a new instance of router and has
been created here in that index dot JSP
file and the routing configuration is
passed to all that new instance but now
we have to check as this new router
instance is exported here where the
application is making use of that router
instance and is activating it so to find
that place we need to switch here to the
file main dot draya's in the SRC folder
and here now you can see the place where
the router configuration is set active
in our application it's importing first
of all router from router so that makes
the new router instance with our
configuration makes it a Weibull here in
that file and then here by creating our
route view instance here you can see
router the router instance is added here
to the view configuration object and
that is required to set our router
configuration active in that application
ok now we saw that the default route of
our application is connected to the
hello component so let's check of that
component as existing here in the SOC
folder you will find another subfolder
which is called components and inside of
that folder you can see there is an
implementation available in the file
hello dot view which is containing the
implementation
of the hello component and you can see
here from the template of hello
component it's printing out essential
rings and the ecosystem and if we take a
look at our application you can see it
exactly what is printed out here below
that headline here are the essential
inks and the ecosystem so you can see
it's the HTML output which is generated
from a template of the Hello component
is part of the output so the question of
course is how view or in which way view
knows where to insert the the output it
gets back from the component which is
connected to the current route and that
place is behind we can see it here in F
dot view is defined by using a special
element and that element is called
router - view in our template and here
we are in the template of our route
component it's at the app component and
the template here is very simple it
consists of an image which is displaying
the view logo as you saw here in the
output and then with inserting the
router - view element it is defining the
placeholder here where the output from
the router component is inserted and all
the other stuff which you saw on the
browser is coming from the hello
component so let's try it out we can
change it here and cleared a little bit
up removing everything which is insert
here in that diff element and then let's
say maybe h1
hello component okay I like to close it
here okay save it back in our browser
you can see it's still displaying the
logo which is coming from add component
directly and it's displaying the h1 text
hello component which is coming from
Hello component so of course you know
routing is making sense if we are
dealing with multiple routes in our
application and so far in the initial
point deliberation only one route is
included and in the next step we are
going to change that so back in index
dot JSON configuration is excluded we
can now add another routing object here
to the routes array and to do so let's
add here another object and this time I
would like to establish a new route and
that route should take one routing
parameter and to do that I need to again
use the pass property here and then I'm
assigning the path of string here which
is a slash first route slash and then I
use a column here and say name and by
using that annotation here we are
defining a route routing parameter which
is called name so the part here behind
first route is the value of that
parameter and the value can be accessed
in the route in the route component
okay so next a let's define a name for
the route the name is going to be first
route and the component oh we would like
to connect with that route is again
first route okay okay so of course first
route component is not implemented yet
so we need to change it and add the
implementation to our project to do so I
start here again in the components
folder and say new file and the new file
I'm going to create a scored first route
dot views and let me switch over to
hello dot view copy and past all that
code here so we do not need the styling
so let's remove it I'm setting the
message property here to our first route
so the name of that component of course
is first let's say first route okay and
then I'm changing the template as well
so let's print out the value of the MLC
property here again when I'm saying
hello and including an expression here
and that expression is printing out the
value of the routing parameter name and
to access that parameter we can we need
to say following the dollar sign route
dot parents
dot name okay then I need to switch back
to our routing configuration and of
course - I need to include another
import statement here and so let's copy
and past the import statement and we
need to import first route component as
well okay like so okay so let's check
the results in the browser so you can
see it's still pointing to the default
who are out of our application and it's
pointing out the content of hello
component and if we're now going to
change the URL here and extended with
slash first route slash box and hit
return you can see now the output has
changed the HTML output from Hello
component is no longer included instead
now the headline first route from first
web component is displayed and the text
hello block and Bob is taken directly
from the routing parameter name which is
set to Bob here and if I'm if I'm
changing it to you as a picker here you
can see the output here on the page is
changing as well so next let's talk
about another type of route and let's
add another route to application but
this time a route of type child route
and to add a child around to our
application we first need to choose the
route where we would talk to add child -
and then in my case I am choosing first
route here and - to now define the
configuration objects for our child
I need to include another property here
in the configuration object or first
route
and the property I do need to include
here is named children and children gets
assigned an array and the array of
course is then containing a routing
considerations objects which are
children of our first route so let's
start with the first object here
let's give it a pass which is child and
there assign a component which should be
first route child component okay now we
need to make sure that the first around
child component is implemented as well
so back here in the components folder
let's create a new file
this time we are calling that file first
route child dot view again I'm taking
the code from first route component copy
and pass it here okay let's change the
name of that component is first route
child and we are printing out first
route child as well this time we do not
need to access any routing parameters so
I am able to remove that line of code
here again okay and then I need of
course go back into my routing
configuration file here and add the
import statement for first round child
component okay like so okay so now we
have defined the first child round to
first route and the pass here is child
so let's switch over to the browser
again and here
no the URL interfere let's try it out
say like so you can see on the part of
the string which has been assigned to
the path property of first round child
is extended here or is added to the URL
string so that's the URL but you can see
nothing has changed so far the output we
are expecting to get back from first
round child is not displayed here and
the reason is clear because we have not
defined yet the place where the output
of the child route should be inserted
and we need to refine it on the level of
first round because there is a nested
round here and the content of that child
route is always inserted into the top
the parent route and that is first route
so let's go back into the implementation
of first round component here and now in
the template code I need to include the
router - view element again this x is
the place order for the HTML content
which is coming back from first round
child and that is inserted here in that
place
okay let's save it go back to the
browser and now you can see if I access
this around again you can see it's
printing out the text we're expecting to
get back in addition to you the content
which is coming back from first round so
now our routing setup is is working and
in the last part of this tutorial I am
going to explain how to add links here
in our output so that we do not need to
change the routing URL here and the
input field of the browser
that we can make it a little bit easier
and their display link so you can click
on links and is taken to you the routes
which are available okay so to include
the links in our application output I'm
back here in our world component F dot
view and here in the template section
I'm going to include another div section
here between the image tag and the
router - view element and clay let's
include that this element here and
inside of that div element I'm going to
use an unordered list element and inside
that you own element I'm going to
include three times the error I a list
item element k12 sweet because I would
like to add three links 1q my default
route a12 or first route and want to you
the child of first route okay to
generate our routing links we can make
use of a special element which is called
a router - link so let's include such an
element here the router - link and the
element needs an attribute which is
called queue and I'm assigning a spring
here which is pointing to the route so
the first link should go to the default
route so I just need a slash here okay
close that element router - link okay
and then I can include a link text I'd
like to have in this case at the default
route so I'm labeling it with hell okay
let's copy and past a better router link
Everman
okay the next link those two first
around and I'm passing in a parameter
here so we get Peter but of course this
parameter can all be set in a dynamic
way for now we are not coding it here so
and I'm naming the link first route and
the final link goes to first route Peter
and child and I'm using the text first
route child here okay so let's check our
final result in the browser and you can
see here on the links are now included
in my application and by default of
course the default route is activated
and I'm getting back the HTML content
which is which is generated by hello
component and now I can click on first
route on that link here and you can see
the output is changing and if I now
click on first around with child it's
again expanding here and now also
including the content from first route
child component and of course it can go
back to home so thanks very much for
