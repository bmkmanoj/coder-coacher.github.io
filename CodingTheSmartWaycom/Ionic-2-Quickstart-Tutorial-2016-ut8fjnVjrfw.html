smart Wacom and today in this video I'm
going to give you a short introduction
to the new ionic 2 framework ionic 2 is
the next generation of the ionic
framework and is now based on angular 2
and in this video today I'm going to
show you how you can install ionic 2 set
up projects based on starter templates
and get your project running quickly
okay so let's first take a look at the
ionic 2 website and you can find the
website ionic dot io / 2 and as you can
see here on the website just gives you
the basic information that ionic 2 is
not released yet but there is a preview
ionic 2 version you can access right now
and we will do so just click on that
button and then you are directly taken
to the ionic and getting started
documentation for version 2 and what you
can see here is that the first step of
course is to install ionic and you can
do so by just using an NPM package which
is available so you do need note do yes
to install that NPM package and you need
to have the node package manager
installed on your system so if this is
the case you can simply use NPM install
ionic at beta so you can see I only the
two is not released and that is the
reason why the package name is ionic at
beta so it's easy just to copy that
command head over to the command line
and just saying 0 and then NPM install -
G ionic bad beta the - G option is just
included because we want to install the
ionic at beta package globally on on our
system and so it's easy to do it with
just one command I have already
installed ionic so I'm not going to
execute this command but after having
successfully completed the installation
the ionic command-line interface is
available and we can use the ionic
command to set up our project which is
the next step we are going to take
okay so now as we have installed ionic 2
beta successfully in our system we have
a new command to Weibo which is simply
called ionic so you can see it here so
I'll type it in on the command line I
own it and if I now hit return it gives
you a brief overview about all the
options the ionic command is providing
and I will scroll up a little bit so
here you can see I will just focus on
the two on the two first options here is
its start and serve so with a start
option that is the option we are going
to use next we can download the project
template and initiate a new ionic 2
project that's very easy and there is a
surf command if we have already created
a project and are in a project directory
we can execute ionic surf to start up a
local development web server which which
has also live reload capabilities
included so we can keep the web server
running in the background making changes
to our project to our code and you will
see the resulting application
immediately in the browser in ummm
emulator you are running and so that's
very easy you do not have to reload your
application manually or restarting your
server manually it's a live reload web
server ok so let's try it out let's use
the start option and we are going to
initiate a new ionic to project our type
in ionic start my ionic app 1 and I will
give two more options here I will use
the option
for version two because I have to tell a
onic to start a project based on a
project template which is a waiver for
version two and I'd like as ionic is now
based on angular 2 I'd like to use
typescript so typescript is a superset
for JavaScript application giving you
the feature of using types in your
script code and angular 2 makes use of
typescript and we would I would like to
make use of typescript here and my ionic
2 project too so I will give another
option here is XTS 4 typescript and then
I simply hit return and let's see what's
happening so here you can see it's
downloading something and what is
downloaded here is our project template
and then the corresponding NPM packages
are installed and we just have to wait a
moment
hmm until it is completed okay here we
are you can see the command has finished
successfully it's giving us a message
your ionic app is ready to go which is a
good result and the first thing we need
now to do is to change into the new
directory and as we called our app in my
I own a gap is 0-1 so the directory is
created accordingly so we need to make a
CD in my ionic app a1 and then in that
directory the next step which is given
here is I only serve so let's try it out
first blood change into the directory
and as you can see here there were a
bunch of files and folders included in a
directory we will have a look at the
important pieces of that project in a
moment but for now we would like to
start up the project and I simply use
the
command and given the option serve so
let's see what's happening here it's
starting up the project server and as
you can see here it's using garb as a
task runner which is starting up the
various tasks we are needing here and
then it's loading the web server and
starting up the browser automatically
and here you can see if I just resize as
a browser window a little bit here is
our data ionic 2 application which is
consisting of three tabs we can change
the view here so tab one is including a
welcome message to ionic and tab 2 and
tab 3 are included for navigation but
are empty so you can see if we just
leave it on the default settings ionic 2
is loading the starter template with
three tabs included
so if you do not want to start on a
template which is already containing
three tabs there are other options and
there are two more starter templates you
can use and I will quickly show you how
so you can see here our application is
still running the command line interface
has changed now we are in the ionic
command and we have a bunch of options
to control our web server you can simply
type in R and then the web server is
restarted
you can type in G and specify URL you
would like to access you can activate
console logs here on the command line
just hit C and you can activate server
logs as well will you simply need to
type in s and if you want to quit now
the web server you can just enter quit
or queue and then it's stopped so we are
still in our generated application my
ionic app r1 and I will go one level up
to try out the two are the starter
templates so the first template which is
a Weibull here besides a starter
template is a side menu template which
is also very handy because as that
template is including a side menu which
is used in many apps and you can set up
a project based on the side menu start a
template by again using the ionic start
command and this time we will call the
project my ionic app out too and then
give the template name as the next
option and it's just a side menu and
then we need to specify again that we
would like to use ionic version 2 and
that we would like to
basic project on type script templates
so yes it's basically is a command so
again we are going to execute it and you
can see that again the project template
is downloaded the corresponding NPM
packages are installed automatically and
yeah we have to wait until this finished
here okay it's ready now you can see we
have generated the project mile-high ona
gap zero to I'll say oh let's see what
is the outcome again I'm using ionic
search this sort of other live reload
server
and it's starting up and then again the
project is loaded into the browser
automatically it just takes a second
okay here this and you can see now we
have a complete different result as
there are no tabs instead we have a side
menu here which has two entries you
could hit on list and you are redirected
to page which is listing some items and
you can open up so the side menu again
and clicking on the getting started link
and then we are back on the start page
the start page has also a menu a button
which is called toggle menu and the
button has the same effect the menu is
surviving in as our menu item here on
top has okay so that's the side menu
template and there is another template
which I would like to show and again I'm
going back and this template is called
as a blank template and as the name is
already saying it's just the template
without any
content which is used very often because
in your application maybe you would like
to start from scratch and then the blank
template is the right one to initiate a
project which is based on the blank
template use the following command ionic
start we will call this project now
ionic app 0 3 gives a template name
which is just blank and then say ok well
- and typescript and now we are
generating a blank project ok here we
are again the blank project template has
been and downloaded as a project is
initiated and now we can enter the
project directory and see what is a
result of using blank template so again
ionic surf to start up the web server
and then the new project is loaded in
the browser
okay hear this and as you can see there
is no taps navigation included as there
is no sidebar included is it's just
based on one page it's the whole page
and the home page is just containing one
box showing a headline and a text
information and nothing more is included
here and that is a template where you
can now start on with your own project
from scratch basically this was
