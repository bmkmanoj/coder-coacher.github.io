smart Wacom and today in this video I'd
like to give you a short introduction to
the new angular 2 modules concept which
is very new with angular 2 you release
candidate 5 so stay tuned ok
in the first part of this video I will
give you some background information
about angular 2 modules and in the
second part we will dive into a little
example application and go through the
code step by step so that you can see
what is exactly needed of getting the
modules concept to work in your
application ok first of all some basic
information
angular 2 modules is very new it's a
concept which is introduced with angular
2 release candidate 5 which is the
latest release candidate it just
released last week modules will help you
to organize your application into single
building blocks for example you can you
can create a module and create all the
elements of a certain functionality
inside that model and structuring your
application into single bottles will
help to come up with a better structure
and at the end have a more maintainable
application another important thing here
is that the n/g module decorator is new
and that decorator is used to declare a
model so we will see it later on just
for the moment it's enough to know that
there is a new decorator and this
decorator is called ng module okay let's
focus a little bit on what are the
advantages of modular
tea and as mentioned before it's very
clear with the away ability of modules
your application can be organized in
smaller building blocks and you can
group all the things of a certain
functionality or let's say a business
domain together in one module and this
will clearly help you to further
structure your application and keep it
in a maintainable State another thing is
that with the availability of modules
it's easier to extend your application
by external libraries there are already
a some for example angular to standard
libraries like forms module the HTTP
module which are which comes as a module
now as you can guess by the name and you
can simply import that module into the
root model of your epic application and
include that libraries very easily was
just one module and all the various
components in that model needs not to be
addressed separately okay one angular
model of course consolidates various
pieces a model you can contain
components directives and pipes so
everything which belongs together which
for example belongs to a certain
functionality can be put into one one
building block called module and so you
can keep it in one place okay I already
mentioned the new ng module module
decorator and with that decorator you
can declare a class to to act as a
module and the only thing you need to do
is just attach ng module to that class
and then this decorator is used to
attach further modules specific metadata
to that class and we will see it in a
moment what metadata
atributes are used in general that
metadata is used to declare which
components directives and pipes for
example belong to that exact module okay
now here you can see the first example
of a class which is named epidural and
that is always a root class it's per
definition to name that class at module
and that is the very first module every
angular 2 application starting with
release candidate 5 now should have and
to create a that module you will first
create a new file you can see it here
it's in typically in the app folder it's
called AB dot module dot TS and yeah let
me just point out a few things first of
all first of course we need to import ng
module and we do import ng module from
angular core library as you can see in
the first import statement and then you
see there is not much going on here we
just attach this new ng model module
decorator to the app module class which
is a lambda class and within that
decorator you see there are three
properties its imports declarations and
bootstrap and we are going to use that
the properties to first say okay what do
we need to import here in the module and
as we are talking about the route app
application module the things we are
going to import here will become a
Weibull application wide so we are
importing the browser module as as once
in here and browser module is a new
module one of the angular 2 standard
modules and with browser module we get a
lot of things like standard directives
ng for ng if for example and a few other
things so it's a general rule every
application should import browser module
because with that we are receiving some
of the angular 2 standard
functionalities then we have
declarations and here we are listing all
the things which should belong to that
model for the moment we are only talking
about very simple application so we only
have one component we would like to
attach here to that application model
and that is our our main component as
its named app component so that is the
only thing we are going to list here in
that array and in the third property
which is called bootstrap we again list
app component because that is our single
component and our root component and we
would like to load that application when
we are going to boot strap our
application and bootstrap it by handing
over this app module and then this
module knows which component to load
first and in our case is the root
component which is called app component
okay let's go on I was taking a look at
a real world example where we make use
of the angular 2 module concept and we
will start by just we are going through
the project folder I've prepared so here
you can see angular 2 modules a 1 is
just a very simple project template so
everything we need is in place we have a
typing so JSON file we have a TS config
dot JSON file that's basically the
content which you can get by following
the QuickStart tutorial on the angular 2
the IO homepage so
oh nothing special here just who let let
me get quickly go through we have a
system of GS dot config dot GS here and
starts dot CSS is empty here is a
package dot JSON file with all the
dependencies listed and then we have the
index dot HTML file which is a main HTML
entry point of our application and you
can see it here and we are using the my
app element to include the content which
is delivered by the template of our main
application template main application
component which is ad component here in
exact that place and we need to
implement that main application
component later
but first of all now we will create our
first module and set it up as an
application module on top level and we
will do so by entering here at the app
folder and creating a new file and we
call that file app dot module of TS and
then we are in that file and we are
importing the three things we saw on the
slide our first I import so maybe I can
make the font size a little bit bigger
so ok I'll import ng mod module from the
angular core library the next thing we
need is to import
browser module because that is a module
where a lot of angular 2 standard
components and directives are in so we
need to import that later and I will
imported here from angular plat form
browser okay and as the last thing we
need is to import app component so app
component is our main application
component we need to implement it in the
second step for the moment we just
prepare the import statement here so
that we have it available and it's
imported from okay f dot component will
create file later on component okay so
and now we can declare a class by
default this class is called app module
because it is a named angular to
recognizes LC application module and
then we are simply attaching the engine
module decorator here on class level and
bring in the three properties we saw
earlier so it's imports and here we are
saying that we want to import browser
module that's the first thing then we
have the declarations property and here
we are declaring that our application
module app module should contain our
main application component
and that will be AB component so again
we will say a component within that
array here and the third and the last
property we need to bring in here is
bootstrap because when later on
bootstrapping our application we want to
hand over the app module and to let
angular know which how to how to
bootstrap that module and the wood
component to load we need to see to set
it here with that property and we need
to say again AB component because that
is the very first component we would
like to load when we are bootstrapping
our application okay the next step is to
implement the missing AB component and
we start by creating another file here
in the app folder so let's say new file
and we name it have comm Poland dot TS
because that is the name we already used
here in our import statement as you can
see here and credit file and now is that
empty file available we start to we
start to implement our main component
and the first thing we need to bring in
as an import statement because we would
like to import the component decorator
ok we do that by saying import component
again from the angular core library ok
and then we need to implement it class
again export class F component because
we want to make it a Weibull in other
files we need to say export here and
then just a I'll give it a single
property I'd say a title property
and assign a simple string hello modules
okay that's all and now we need to
complete that component declaration by
attaching the decorator add component
and again the add component decorator
has some properties first we need to
bring in the property named selector and
with selector we are specifying what is
the HTML element name we will use to
include that component and as we already
saw in index.html the element which is
used there was my episode we need to
assign the my app string here to the
selector property so that it's clear
that if the element my app is used we
are we are referring to that component
okay another thing is the template
property because every component has a
template and the template is basically
some HTML code which tells angular how
to render the output of the component
and again we cute right keep saying
things very simple here for our
application we are assigning an inline
template right here in that um
typescript file and OD so by saying okay
let's bring in a headline and then we
would like to print out the title class
our field here close the h1 and that's
basically all we need
so with that implementation available we
have completed our app component and so
now we have on the one hand we have the
app module and we have the app component
and app come
opponent is the main application
component and it's part of app module so
the last step now is to bring in as a
code which is needed to bootstrap our
application and as always we include
that code in a separate file and that
file is called main TS here in the app
folder so let's create a new file main
TS and now we are going to bootstrap our
application by using our application
module we first need to bring into input
statements we need to import a thing
which is called a platform browser ah
dynamic and we are importing that from
the library was basically the same name
it's in the angular namespace and the
libraries go on platform a browser
dynamic okay and then we need to import
the second thing and that thing is of
course our module because we want to
have the app module a Weibull in that
file because we want to hand over that
module into the bootstrapping process
and so we need to import it first so
let's say import add module and it's a
Weibull in the file we just created it's
an app module okay and then the complete
bootstrapping process can be started by
one line of code so let's call platform
browser dynamic and then call the master
boot spread module and hand over app
module to that function as I just all we
need so let's save it and yeah in the
last step we can see if all our
implementation
is now ready to go so let's switch over
to the terminal so I'm already in the
project directory and so now we can say
npm start and just see what's happening
okay everything seems to be working
let's see how our application looks like
in the browser here you can see it's
automatically loaded in the browser and
it's printing out as a value the string
value we have assigned to the title
property just in that class thank you
