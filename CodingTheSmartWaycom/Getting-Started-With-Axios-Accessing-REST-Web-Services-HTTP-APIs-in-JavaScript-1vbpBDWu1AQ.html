smart way comm and today in this video
tutorial I'd like to give you a short
introduction to the x-y library which is
a yahwah script library which makes it
possible to execute promise based HTTP
requests through for example a restful
web service and so you can use Axius
with all the yards but the front-end
frameworks available and you can use
axials in your node.js application as
well so let's get started okay so let's
first take a look at the application the
sample application we are going to build
in this tutorial and the sample
application looks like the following
here you can see it's split up into
three sections here in the UI so we will
implement the llaves Krypton application
which demonstrate three use cases you
can do with sell the excess library the
first use case is a simple get request
if you can see here so the user have the
option to click on get to deuce and we
are requesting a web service which
delivers of the list of to do art of as
you can see here and we are printing out
a nicely form method a result a screen
here you can see we have a status here
which is okay then we have the headers
object from the response and of the data
section which gives us a list of to-do
items as you can see here so let's clear
it and we have a second use case here
and that is again a get request we are
performing with the help of the access
library and here we have an input
element
and here the user have the option to
request the single to do item by
providing a specific ID so it's for
example use 5 here as the ID and then
click on get to dues and you can see we
get another HTTP response object here is
again that is okay it has the Harris
object um printed out here and we have
one data element one to do element here
in the data section okay cleared out our
last a use case here in the application
of the post HTTP POST request and the
post request is used to create new
objects or in this case in you to do
element and here we can enter on new to
do title for example my to do one and
then hit on send and if we hit send here
on a post request is performed you can
say we again get a result here it
returns a status code 200 and 1 which
means created successfully you can see
the errors here and we get back in the
data section the new to do object which
has been created by performing that post
request so that is our sample
application no let's start with the
implementation part ok first let's
switch over to our terminal and let's
create a new project directory here
let's name it for example XE of test o
one then we can change into that new on
directory and we do need two files for
our project we need one HTML file that
file is called index.html and then we
need a second file for our Yahoo script
code and the bit file is main gr ok so
let's
our code editor Adam and when you can
see Adam starting up here and you can
see on the left side here is our project
structure with the two new files inside
okay so the first thing we do need here
is a basic template from our index.html
file and as we want to use some
bootstrap CSS classes for styling our
user interface we can go threat to the
bootstrap homepage which is here at get
bootstrap calm and going to getting
started a section here and if you scroll
a little bit down you will find the
basic HTML template here and we can just
copy back to our code and go back to
Adam and insert on that template code
here into index dot HTML and the
knowledge or depth
a few things here first remove that
attach in here we do not need that let's
change the title here it's Axios test
and you can see our is including of the
bootstrap CSS file here and their
corresponding Yahoo Script file from our
project directory from the subfolder of
CSS and J s we do not have those files a
Weibull in our project structure so we
can change that and include a bootstrap
directly from a content delivery network
which makes things a little bit easier
because we do not have to download the
bootstrap tab we can just replace on the
link element and the year script element
here with corresponding elements
pointing to a content delivery network
okay so let's go back to the bootstrap
website and scroll little bit up and
here we'll find
the element which gives you the
possibility of including bootstrap from
a content delivery network so MaxCDN is
used here and then now let first we
place on the yellow script on file we
can copy that go back to Adam and bring
it in here okay next we can replace from
via via that file here but we do not
want to use the default bootstrap CSS
file here instead I will choose a theme
from boots watch here at boots watch
calm and we'll use that same here there
are several in theme and to get the
corresponding CSS file we can click here
on download and you can see the CSS file
is opening up I can copy that URL here
go back to my code editor and replace
that string here okay to point directly
to the boots watch theme CSS file okay
so next let's include the axiom library
because we want to make use of Axios to
implement our HTTP use cases and the
axiom website can be found here on
github so it's github.com em out
bricky slash axials and here you can
find the complete source code of the
project you can find some instructions
here and the easiest way again is using
axial from a content delivery network
and here in the installing section you
can see in total there are three options
you can install exhales by using an NPM
package or by using Bower package but we
here for our application will make use
of the content delivery network here and
I will copy that protect here pointing
to you the xes dot mint dot JS file copy
it go back to Adam and include it here
at the bottom of my body section ok and
then we need a last script element here
and that a script element is needed to
include the main dot J's file here in
our project folder because there is a
file where you have a script code goes
into you so we need to include it here
ok now let's start up our project and
then we can do also very easily
switching back to the terminal and then
using a small development web server
which is called live - book server live
our server is available as an NPM
package so if you have not installed
live server yet on your systems at
Google or for life - the server and you
will find all the instructions you need
to get going just here in my project
directory execute now the command to
live - server and you can see here web
server is starting up available on port
8080 and it's opening up the browser
automatically because it has live
reloading capabilities and you can see
here it's printing out the results from
our index dot HTML page okay so let's
keep our life server running in the
background and I have organized here at
the windows
side so I can make code changes here in
Adam and because of the live reloading
can see the changes automatically being
reflected in the output I'm getting here
in the browser and so let's start first
with implementing our user interface and
index.html so let's let's start here in
the body section with a new disk element
and we give it a class off on cleaner
okay so let's copy hole let's say copy
that h1 here and let's change the
headline to xef demo term by coding
smart boy calm okay let's say that you
can see how we automatically get an
update here in the browser and you can
see the result immediately
okay now let's add another this section
here and we are giving it a class of
jump or try and within the Jumbotron
element that include again an h1 and
well come to X years Elsie headline and
then h4 and let's er bring in a short
description here is this application
uses axial axial of promise based HTTP
client for yoga script
okay here we are
and next we do need affection for our
three use cases also let's start with
another dissection here and we are using
again some bootstrap styling we are
using the panel class and we said it
Capel primary ok within that panel we
are using two more diff elements okay
like so the first with a class of panel
- heading ok and let's give it a heading
text here for example get a request
because it is our first use case and the
second is element um get a class of
panel - body ok and now we can take that
panel section here and copy it one time
and another time so that we have suite
sections here and we are changing the
panel headline of an X use cases get
requests with param meters and the third
use case is supposed requests okay you
can sit here ok so now for the first
panel let's include
some elements here in the panel body and
we do need two buttons first so let's
start with a button element here give it
a class of BTN and BTN - primary and
then we would like to respond to the
quick event type and we do that by using
the unclick attribute and assigning and
the function here in the string and the
function should be called performed
to request one okay later on of course
we need to implement a Betty Alice code
to function in our main daughter JS file
but that will be done in the second step
here now we need a second button here
okay button again we are shining the
cloud BTN and this time BTN - warning
and we would like to respond to the
click event again by calling the clear
output function and the button should
help the text printed on which is clear
okay and then we need a third element
here in the panel body section we need
this element again we are using the
class panel body here and we give it an
ID of get result one with that ID we can
later on retrieve a reference to the
development from our yellow script code
and then insert the output we would like
to show to the inner HTML property of
that element okay so having saved that
you can see on the result here in our
browser and you can see immediately that
we are missing the taxi for the first
button so let's end it here we would
like to have the text printed on which
is let's say get to Duke's save it again
and you can see it's updated arm as
expected
okay so let's copy that code here inside
the body the panel body and insert it in
second panel body because we would like
to have with same buttons here available
and let's rename our BM event handler
function for the first button this time
we will use perform get request to and
let's rename our B ID assigned to you of
that this element here as well
it's get resolved to and now we need in
addition we need an input element so
that the user is able to specify which
to do ID should be requested so let's
include an input element here it's of
type text and we assigned class from
form control okay and we give it an ID
to do ID and let's say we had a
placeholder text here so to do ID
okay okay
here one quote sign is missing okay so
now you can see that the result we would
like to have for the second section here
now it's turn to the third section okay
here for on the post request use case we
would like to use a foreign element so
let's bring it in we do not need to on
the action I do get here instead I'm
assigning a class which is formed in
line and assign an ID to do input form
and now within a web form we need
another dip element with a class of form
our - loop okay like so and within that
form group we are including an input
element because the user should have the
option of inputting a new to do title
and that input element is of type text
of course again across forum - control
and we need not be here so that we later
on in our our script code can retrieve
all the value of that element by using
the ID eyelids assigned to do title se
Rd and again a placeholder text to do
typos
okay like so now the button is of course
needed and this time as we are dealing
with the form here we are setting the
type of the button to submit okay
so like so and we are refining a crowd
of BTN BTN - primary and the text on the
button is sent ok you can see it here
and finally we need another button
outside of the forum because the button
for clearing the output is not part of
the forum so let's assign again BTN VT n
- 1 as before and we are connecting the
click event by you unclick attribute to
clear output again so the same as before
and we are using the text clear on the
button and of course the diff element
which is the placeholder for our output
panel - body and the ID is this time as
post without ok here we are
ok so now before continuing our
implementation with the Yama script part
let's do a quick recap to just keep the
overview of what's inside of our
index.html and what part needs to be
implemented in the upcoming novel script
code and first of all and the first
section we have defined that we do need
an event handler mess
for the get to this button which is
called perform get request one then we
need another method which is clearing
the output area which is called clear
output for the second use case we are
reusing the clear output method as you
can see and we need another method to be
implemented which is called perform get
request to and that method is
implemented to do a get request and
using the ID parameter which which has
been entered by the user and for the
third part again reuse into the clear
output method and we need to connect to
the form of submit event and define an
event handler function in our Yama
script code so it's not defined here in
the HTML code explicitly but we will
connect the submit event in our Yama
script code so let's continue switch
over to main GL and start implementing
the Yahveh script part with the first
method for the first use case okay
before actually starting with the
implementation here we need to make sure
that we have a arrest back-end available
so that we can make the corresponding
HTTP calls with the Axios library in the
easiest way to arm to get you to get
your restful web services running on
your local system is using a project
which is called um getting a server and
an introduction to user agent server and
how you can use that on that project to
set up your local REST API very quickly
on your local machine is available in
our last review tutorial of your own
code
not weighted con so if you want to set
up your own rest web server you can take
a look at our last tutorial but however
we can skip a bit of step because if you
scroll all the way down here on the
project's website you will find a link
to you Jason placeholder and Jason
placeholder is just a service here
available running adjacent server
instance and making available on some
entities by corresponding endpoints so
we need do not need to set up jason
server locally you can do so if you want
but we can skip that step and make use
of Jason placeholder and the entity we
would like to retrieve in our
application is the reduce entity here
you can see it's containing a list of
200 items and if I click on to do so you
can see that's the URL that's the
endpoint we would like to address when
executing our get and post requests it's
Jason placeholder title koat.com / -
dues so okay so let's switch back to
main GS and start implementation of the
first function
okay function and all the first function
we need to implement is of course
perform data V quest 1 okay so first we
are recruiting a reference to on the dis
element which was placed in our HTML
code to be a placeholder for
the output which is generated by the
first use case here so let's say Lara
result element is equal document dot get
element by ID and the ID of that element
is get a result one okay next we are
making sure that on the inner HTML
property is not containing any HTML code
so we set it to an empty string here and
now we can make use of access to our
send our first get a request and to do
that we are saying axioms dot to get
because that is the method which
initiates the get request and then we
need to pass in a parameter a string
which is the endpoint of our service so
I can copy that URI here and insert it
here in my method call and if the get
method is returning the promise we can
respond to that by chaining the venn
method and passing in a function which
is called whenever the get request has
been completed successfully and the
function gets a response object and now
we can set the output we would like to
to display to the user to use the inner
HTML property of the result element okay
in I HTML and the output is generated by
using another function we will implement
in them in a second here and that
function is called generate success HTML
output it makes sense to do it in a
separate function because we would like
to reuse that function again and with
in Turkey use case and okay so the other
thing we can do with the promise is to
change a call of catch and another
function which is cost to catch is
executed when an error occurs so we have
except an error object here and okay and
this time we are generating a HTML
output as well but this time for the
error case we are using a different
function and this time the function is
called generate arrow HTML output we
will implement that function as well
okay okay so let's continue with the
implementation of generate success HTML
output so let's say function generate
success HTML output at the parameter we
do need the response object and then we
are returning the spring with all the
HTML code which is needed to output of
the information we want to display
included and the first thing we would
like to have an h1 here and that should
be result ok so next let's include an h5
and that the status information
okay like so and then we are outputting
the response don't status information
and the response not status text and we
do include those two pieces of
information in a pre element like so my
pay plus respawns dot status plus plus
the response don't Turkish text and we
do need the closing pre element okay
next line will be headline for the
headers output and we are including the
headline text again in an h5 okay
and then again included in the pre
element for the response both headers
object and to output it in JSON format
we are using the method json dot
stringify to output a string formatted
in adjacent so let's first start with
the pre element here and when they say
plus jason stringify
then we would like to you for another
the response dot headers object and we
need to pass in now as a second
parameter and the third parameter is
backslash t just you to use some
formatting here
and finally we need to close the pre
element here okay next we do need the
data object to be outputted and we are
starting again with an H 5 headline then
data here closing it H 5 + and then we
are outputting the response dot data in
the same way we did it here with
response header so we can copy it insert
here changing headers to data and then
putting a semicolon after that last line
and that's the implementation of the
generate success HTML output from ok now
let's try it out here in our user
interface the perform get request one
method is connect to the click event of
the first get introduced button here and
if I now click on that button you can
see the output is generated as expected
we have the status information here the
headless object is printed out and the
data property is printed out here with
all the to-do items returned by the web
service so we have accepted the result
we would like to have now of course we
need to enter in the implementation for
the generate error HTML output method to
handle a case when the web service is
all the requests to the web service is
not finished successfully so just copy
the January success HTML output method
inserted here again and we start with
renaming the function
so instead of success would you need
error here we are expecting to get the
error object as a parameter and now we
need to change some of the HTML output
elements here we are starting right away
with an h4 result that can stay the same
and the next thing we do need here is
the error message so let's include
another h5 here that is message okay
let's close it okay and then we are
outputting the error message which is
available in error dot message and we
are embedding it in a pre element here a
plus error message plus our closing tag
as you can see okay next the statures
can can remain we do need to change it
here because the response is now inside
of the error object so we do need to
change it to peril not response dot
status and we do need to change it here
as well with our data response dot
status text ok then we are outputting
the headers information again inside the
arrows object and we are outputting the
data ok changed here as well
ok so here you can see it and if I now
are changing for example the service
endpoint here to something which is not
existing you can see now if I hit get to
do again I'm getting back the output
which is generated by
function generate error HTML output
including an error message request
failed with status code 404 the resource
is not found it's clear because that end
point is not existing so here you can
see that our function is working as
expected
okay now let's implement the second use
case and I'm taking the code of function
perform get request 1 copy that code and
insert it here a second time and then
I'm renaming the perform get request one
function to perform get request to okay
and now we need to change a few things
here on the first thing you may notice
is that we now do need instead of a
reference to get result one element we
do need a reference to get to the disk
element with ID get result - ok and in
addition we do need a second element
reference and that is a reference to the
element to the input element with a DTD
ID and we need a bad reference to read
out the value which was included by the
user and that can be done in one line of
code so let's define another variable
here to do Adi and to do it is equal to
you on a return value of document dot
get element by ID to do Rd and then
we're accessing the value by using the
dot value property here ok ok now we
should change back
the endpoint to to do I will do it here
as well
okay so that we are not running in an
arrow state and now we would like to
adapt or get a request we are sending
here by using the axial so get method a
little bit in addition we would like to
pass over one parameter and that is er D
of the to do art and we would like to
request introduced that we can include
another parameter here and that an
object containing a property which is
called parent and the parent gets
assigned another object and that object
is a listing all the URL parameters we
would like to pass over to on forget
call here and we are only needing one
parameter here and that is ID and we set
ID to to do ID here okay so now we can
try it out from here in the second panel
let's use our D 5 again hit get to do
and you can see we are getting back over
to do item with ID 5 okay so let's
implement the third use case and the
third use case is implemented by using a
function which is called perform post
request and the function gets parsed in
our event object because we would like
to connect that function to use a submit
event of the form and to do that we need
to bring in
more in line of code here round before
we are implementing perform post request
and the code which is needed here is
document get element by ID so we are
requesting a reference to the form
element the idea of the form element is
to do input file okay and then with that
reference available we can call at event
listener and pass in the event type of
the first parameter that submit and then
of the event handler function in the
second parameter and let us perform the
form post request of course okay and
then we are ready to implement the form
post request
so first let's copy on those three lines
of code from the perform get request on
T measured in the root of those three
lines here and the first the first line
of code needs to be unchanged now we do
need an element reference to the element
with ID of post result to do I D is not
needed here and that we needed the value
of to do typo which is included in the
element with IV to do title place third
line remained okay and now we are ready
to perform the post request and again
we're using the exes rivalry and this
time we are calling access post now in
the first parameter again we need as a
service endpoint for the HTTP POST
request which the same endpoint and else
a second parameter
we are talking in an object containing
the properties of our new to-do item we
do need sweet properties here the user
ID by default we are setting it to one
the type of the new to deal is set to to
do title so the input value from the
user and then we use a completed
property here and set it by default to
false okay and then use the Zen method
to connect the function which is called
a stable quest has been completed
successfully and in that case let's copy
it we do it in the same way we are
setting the inner HTML property of the
result element is a return a string from
generate success HTML output and in the
error place again setting it to the
return spring from generate error HTML
output a play and last but not wait we
on need to include one line of code
which is very important we need to call
e sets our event of object pre-round
default because we want to prevent the
form from submitting ok so that's the
code which is needed ok so let's again
try it out armed we're entering a new
to-do typo here clicking on button sent
to initiate on the post request and you
can
see we get a status of 201 which means
creditors are back so it was
successfully executed and here you can
see the new data object which has been
created so it's working as expected
so one last card in our code is missing
we have the red clear buttons here and
we have defined in our template that the
clear output function should be called
in case the user clicks on that button
so that at that method here to hard-code
i've already prepared it here and you
can see the implementation as quite
simple we are just retrieving all the
result elements and setting the
innerhtml property to an empty string so
okay so it saves it so for example if we
are now initiating the get request here
getting back the result and we would
like to clear the output again I can now
hit on button clear and you can see the
output disappears this one's a bust and
