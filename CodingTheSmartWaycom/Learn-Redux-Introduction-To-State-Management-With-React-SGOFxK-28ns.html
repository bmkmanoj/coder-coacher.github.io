way comment today in this new tutorial I
will give you an introduction to a Redux
Redux is a library which enables you to
introduce central state management in
your application so it's a predictable
state container and in this video we are
going to cover the basics so you will
learn the building blocks which are
important to understand the concept
behind Redux and then we will move on
and put a practical sample application
in react to to show you how to apply
Redux in your real-world project so stay
tuned ok so let's get started with redux
else already mentioned redux first of
all is a predictable state container for
your script and that assembly means that
Redux is not bound to any framework so
you can use it together with modern
front-end frameworks like react angular
ember a backbone and so on um but of
course you maybe already know Redux is
most often used together with react and
for use of the Redux concept together
with other frameworks there are other
implementations of redux available but
when it comes to using Redux on Quora
library its most of used together with
react so our first of all before diving
into the practical part of our video I'd
like to introduce you to the main
building blocks of redux and they're
here with that um with that picture
explain the data flow which is very
important to understand too to get a
feeling of the concept behind readers so
let's first take a look here at the
building blocks so you can see the data
flow on starts here on the top level
where our component is or let's say our
user interfaces and if we talk about
react of course our user interface and
the functionality of our application has
organized and components so it all
starts with components in react and the
first data flow which happens is that
within a component a certain event is
raised and that for example can be a
user interaction with your application
the user for example clicks on the
button and then data of our application
is going to change in reaction to on
that user event and what now is happen
here in the redox flow is that an action
is created enter actions are a special
concept in Redux and we do need actions
to send information from our application
to the central data store which you can
see here on the right side and the store
holds the application state but the
stored data can not be manipulated
directly so we do need actions and if a
certain event occurs we do need to
create an action and the action is
dispatching then an action to the store
and that is the next step of the data
flow here you can see and then behind
the store we are using a so called
reducer to then do the state
manipulation and the reducer takes the
type of action which was dispatched and
it takes that action of course and then
takes the current state and create a new
state object and manipulates the new
state object to contain the new data for
example data which was some entered by
the user and then create the new State
anthem and then updates the state object
in the store and then the store is able
to update the state of the component and
so the new State and the new data is
selected in the user interface and the
user sees the updates in in the user
interface directly and by using that
concept that concept of a central
application state which is organized
here in a store we can connect many
components in our application with that
one store so that makes the data flow
very predictable and all our components
rely on the same data so components
would stay in sync so you will always
see the same data and you do not need to
take care of communicating changes of a
component state from one component to
another component to ensure that
everything is updated in synchronization
okay so now that you have a first brief
overview of the main building blocks and
the concept behind redux
let's switch to a practical example
because applying the redux concept to a
real-world problem and see some code
makes it easier to understand and easier
to learn so let's see what we are going
to build in this tutorial so the
application we are going to build in
this tutorial should at the end look
like the application you can see here in
the browser and what we're going to
build is a simple voting application and
you can see it here at Congress of to
react components one here on topic and
one showing the voting results here
below and the user is able to vote for
for his or her favorite front-end
framework in 2017 and to do the voting
the user is able to click on one of the
three logos here angular react and view
TS and by clicking on a logo for example
if I click here on react you can
see here in the component below the
results are updated directly I was a
progress bar showing the voting results
here so I can click on angular for
example on view and you can see the
updates are there instantly
okay so let's the application we are
going to both it consists of two react
components but first of all of course we
need to initiate a new project and
install redux and then do the
implementation step by step so let's get
started okay to initiate a new react
application from scratch I'm using the
react react of starter kit create react
app so let's use that command create -
react app and then I need to specify the
name of my application and in that case
it's my routing apps okay let's hit
return and you can see it's downloading
the initial project structure and that's
downloading the dependencies it takes a
moment and there is an our react
application is ready to go ok here we
are you can see everything has been
downloaded and installed successfully
and of course as we want to use Redux in
our application we need to enter that
dependency as well and to do that I'm
changing into my newly created project
folder here and then use the yarn
package manager to add Redux so I need
to execute yarn add Redux here and then
you can see it's downloading the Redux
package and installing it as a
dependency into my project folder
okay you can see it has been completed
successfully
and now to do a first test I'm able to
start up the development web server and
easy on default react application in the
browser by typing in yarn start okay so
it's starting up the development web
server and it loads the application here
okay here we are you can see that the
default application conversing of the
react logo a headline and around the
note here that to get started we need to
edit on BFGS file and now we are ready
to go and we can dive into the code okay
I've already opened up the project
folder here in my code editor which is
atom and the first thing we are now
going to implement is the set of actions
we do need to interact with the store
which we create later on and to
implement on the actions part we need to
create a new sub folder here with an
alga SRC folder so let's do it we name
it he'll simply actions and within that
action folder I'm going to create a new
file which is called index dot vs and
then now I'm ready to create our some
actions here and the way we are going to
create actions our method to which
return an action object and those
methods or those functions are called
action creators because actions itself
are simply our script objects which do
have a type property which contains all
the type of action
and optionally contains a payload object
which enables us to pass data to the
store and so let's start here by
implementing the first actions crater
function ok export Const and the first
action we do need is the action which is
dispatched if the user votes for example
for reactor so let's name that function
vote react here
ok so let's use the set arrow syntax
here from your six and then that
function is very simple it simply
returns the yellow script object which
consists of the type property and we are
setting the type here to vote react we
do not need to pass any payload here
because of that action just is there to
UM to pass the information to the store
with the voting of or react health take
place and by receiving that information
we later on in the store know that we
need to increment the loading counter
for the react framework by one okay so
that's the first action here let's copy
it and pass it in another time and
assert time so we need to implement load
angular as well and change the type here
to vote underscore angular and finally
vote me yes and change the type here as
well
okay okay next let's implement the
reducer which is also a function which
takes our
the action object and the current state
and then create a new state based on the
action passed to the reducer function
and to create the reducer here we create
another subfolder within our SRC folder
which is called we users and within that
folder let's create a new file again
index dot is and the first of all let's
create an initial state object which
contains on the initial state we would
like to set at the store when our
application is starting up and we do
that passing that constant name it
initial state and then in the state of
course we do need three properties first
property at the voting column for
angular which is simply named arm
angular and set to zero here then we
need react again zero and view yes zero
okay that's our initial State and now
I'm going to create the reducer function
and I'm exporting that function of
course and a function is receiving two
parameters here first of all it already
mentioned of the current state and here
I have the option to set a default value
for the state and I setting this data to
of course a neutral state the object we
defined here at first so in neutral
state and then the second parameter is
on the action object okay and then this
reducer function needs to evaluate which
type of action has been passed and
depending on the type of action view
the state manipulation which is needed
so let's use a switch statement here to
evaluate which type of action is passed
in so the type of a book in the action
object in the Kuiper t and we have to
deal basically with our sweet actions we
are created earlier and the first case
is here
those angular then the second case is
about react third case is load UJS okay
like so and then we are defining a
default case which is simply returning
the current state object back without
any manipulations and for the three
cases here where a world voting has
happened we are now able to implement
the state of manipulation or the
creation of a new state object and when
the manipulation in the new state object
and then returns that new state object
and we do that by using the object sign
method passing in an empty object to
create a new key on a script object and
then adding the current state and then
adding for the caseload angular adding
the angular property and we are going to
creasing it by 1 so plus 1 ok and on the
same way we are implementing the case
vote react here
this time of course we do not need to
increase angular property instead we are
increasing the reactor voting count and
finally do are the same here for the
view case okay so that lets our reducer
function are finally implemented so now
that we have the reducer function
available in the next step we need to
create the Redux store in our
application and to create the store
let's switch into of how index dot JSP
randby SRC folder and first of all we do
need to add import statements here the
first import statement is needed to
import the great store method from the
redux library so I'm saying import great
store from redux okay and the next thing
which needs to be imported here is our
reducer function so let's say import
them only app from reducers okay like so
and then we are ready to create a store
here so I'm saying let's store create
store and call the quick store method
here and I'm passing over my reducer
function which I have imported as my app
here okay so then the store is created
and the reference is saved in the store
variable and then I can add another
statement here at the bottom of the file
I need to say stall subscribe render pay
and then I'm calling the render function
which is not hit'em there yet
and then I'm defining the render
function here click render and I'm
comparing the car of react don't render
within that render function okay so you
can see it here okay and now I have to
run the function to find that the render
call is placed inside on my render
function and there that's needed because
I need to subscribe here to the render
function so that the Redux store knows
that the render function needs to be
called each time the state changes and
to initially compliment the function I
need to call it here explicitly in the
index or ES file okay so that our web
server is still running let's quickly
check in the browser if we have any
errors
okay and here you can see your places
corn is misplaced here so let's quickly
to be correction in the reduces function
let's remove it here okay so save it go
back to the browser and you can now see
ok the web server and the application is
still running without any issues ok ok
now we are ready to proceed we have
implemented the main redux building
blocks in our application
we have action creative methods we have
reducer function and we have a store
which is connected with our reducer
function so we can move on and implement
the components we need to display the
user interface we would like to have and
we will start by adapting the
implementation of the main component app
component and extend the UI to include
on the voting logos the user can click
on but before doing so we need to to
complete one step before we need to
include the bootstrap framework because
later on when implementing the user
interface I'd like to use bootstrap CSS
classes and to include bootstrap xzz is
something needed to go here to boot
swatch calm and we can select here from
one of the free themes and let's scroll
a little bit down the seam I would like
to use as a eet seam here so I'll simply
click here on the download button and it
takes you directly to the link where the
bootstrap dot min dot CSS file is
available and here I can copy and that
URL you go back to Adam and go here into
the public folder into index dot HTML
and then the name can include another
link tag here of type style sheet H ref
and here I can pass in the URL to the
bootstrap dot MnDOT of CSS file from the
UTC ok and that's basically all I need
to do now I can make use of bootstrap
CSS classes in my application ok now we
are ready to go and the first thing we
are doing here is
to open the default implementation of
app component in file F dot 3s and
change the default implementation so
let's first remove a few things here we
do not need that import statement and
then let's remove a J of Xcode here
inside the return statement of the
render method so okay and during now
let's start implementing the code which
is needed to print out or to render hard
by voting logos so that the user is able
to click on a button and then a certain
action is dispatched to the store and
the voting is taking place
so let's first add the following import
the statement here we are importing our
action craters our action crater
functions here let's vote angular remote
react and Road UJS from actions okay and
then let's add some to the app clause a
constructor which is done by using the
constructor keyword here and the
constructor gets the props parameter
okay and then we need to make sure that
the parent constructor was super it's
called and props is passed to the parent
constructor and then we are storing a
reference to the store which gets passed
into that add component as a property
here in this dot store and as store is
passed in as a prop
t at the way volanges props store so
later on when I need to dispatch certain
sections to the store we can we can
reach the store by using this dot store
okay then we are adding three event
handler functions the first one is
called handle both angular okay and the
handler function of course is invoked if
the user clicks on be singular icon
later on and all all what this handle
function has to do is to dispatch an
action object to the store and the
acting object which is needed for the
angular route in case is generated by
calling the load angular action greater
function so we just need to add one line
of code here to complete it with store
and then we call this patch and we are
handing over the action we have a scope
object which is returned by road angular
and that's all what's needed and then we
can copy and past that handle function
change it to react here and of course
this time we are dispatching the react
action okay and finally UJS and we call
both ujl to return the action object
here
okay so now let's add the JSX code which
is needed to render out the HTML output
of that app component here and we're
adding the code which is needed to the
return statement here within the render
method so let's start with the top-level
column this element okay and within that
gif element we are going to use a
Jumbotron so let's assign a class of
Jumbotron and just to remember you know
assigning classes to elements in react
is done by using the class name
attribute instead of just class so
Jumbotron is a class I would like to
assign here okay and then apply styling
and inline styling here let's say we
would like to text a line to Center okay
okay within that Jumbotron I'd like to
add an image element to display the
coding this map way logo I've already
placed all the PNG files so we are
coding the smart wave logo the angular
logo reacting view KS logo here inside
the public folder so all the PNG files
are available and I can point to those
PNG files here in my code so let's use a
coding the smart way global dot PNG
first let's say was a height of 96 and
or design the alternative text
folding the smart way to come okay like
so next I'd like to add an H team
headline asking the question what is
your favorite front-end framework in
2017 question mark
okay next our let's include another
headline in H for click on the levels
below to vote and then include the line
break okay and another leaf element with
a bootstrap class signed of rope and
then within that arrow we would like to
display the three icons so the user can
click on the icons to vote starting out
was the first one I didn't need another
div element here I'm using the class
call - exhales - offset three and then
call XS - - okay and inside this element
of course another image element now I'm
pointing the SRC property to the angular
logo file which is angular underscore
logo
PMG again I would like to use a height
of 96 pixels and alternative text of
angular and then I'm connecting the
click event type by using the on click
attribute here to our handle function
which is in that case this dot handled
vote angular okay
like so okay then I'm taking this
element here copied it inserted the
second time of course then I need to
remove the offset class here okay change
integral over to react logo change the
handle method okay again copy it in
there get a third time now it's view
genius okay and the handle method is a
change to this dot handle vote you chaos
okay so let's check it in the browser
no ok save it and check it in the
browser so here you can see that our
first result the headline is displayed
asking the question and then sweet low
logos arm and you can see if I click on
the logos nothing is happening so far
but we are going to change it in the
next step okay the next thing we need to
change is because we are expecting to
get the store reference passed in as the
component property here we need to
change in index dot JSON store is
created and the app
component is is used we need to change
the app element here to get the
parameter store and store is set to
store and with reference to our Redux
stores so that this a store is passed as
a parameter here is a property into that
component and then we can make use of it
has seen before in the component
constructor okay next is that we are
able to make the user action the voting
action visible let's go back here to our
reducer function and for the three cases
for the three voting cases I'm adding
now a control locks statement just
printing out the boat without ok let's
react and finally new chance okay and
save it going back to the browser and
now you can see if I click on one both
icons here you can see it's printing out
the text here in the console and let the
proof that our store and the reducer is
working and it's called and it's
executing the code and in the next step
we can now create a new component the
results component and implement the code
which is needed to display the voting
results as progress bars okay to create
the results component in our own project
setup let's add another subfolder here
to the SRC folder which is called
components
and within that components folder let's
create a new file which is named
resolved on trails so and the code which
is neeti let's first start with an empty
react component first needed the
following import statement we need to
import react and component from react
itself ok and then I can define my class
which is called results and extends
component within that class first of all
I need a constructor ok making sure that
the parent constructor is called first
and then again extracting the Torah
which we get again as a property from
this props store so that we make it a
label here with this dot store and then
of course as FY component we need the
render method which returns the
JSX code okay
let's um directly place a top-level tip
element inside they return a statement
ok and of course we do not need to
forget on the export default of results
so that we can later on import results
in in our main file and included in the
main render call
so let's start with the JSX code which
is needed to display the three progress
bar controls and that's very easy by
using some again some good scrap CSS
classes so let's get started here
first I'm inserting a span element with
a class assigned of label and ylabel -
danger and but the label which contains
the text angular con and then we are
displaying the voting results for
angular in percentage so we are making
use of a helper method we will implement
later on here in that component class
and the method we we are using here is
called webs angular in percent okay and
we are calling - fixed - - on display
peer voting result with with two digits
behind all the comma okay let's add a
percent sign here okay
so next time the next element we are
inserting else the progress bar and the
progress bar is displayed by using a
develoment here so this class name and
this time we are making use of the CSS
classes progress progress
- striped and active ok
and within that development we need
another development which gets assigned
the CSS class of progress - bar progress
- bar - danger to display this progress
bar which is displaying the results for
angular in red color and ok so that's
all ok ok then I can take of this block
of code here conversing of the label
element in the progress bar element copy
it pass it here a second time and then I
can change the label text to react on
the help error method which is called as
a votes reacting percent in this case
and I can endured it a third time here
so this time the text here for this view
Jas and the help method is votes you
Jia's okay okay so now let's implement
the 3 helper methods first we are
starting out with votes including
percent
okay and now we need to retrieve the
value the absolute value of loads for
the angular framework from from the
store and then retrieve all the other
values and calculate the votes for
angular in percentage terms so to do so
we are first checking by using an if
statement here if this dot store dot get
state which gives us the length the
current state of the store dot angular
is defined if this is the case we are
returning the value of the following
statement with store get state dot
angular divided by this store get this
state angular plus this for get state
react plus this store get State mu KS
and the multiply it with hundred to get
it in percentage terms so okay let's add
now statement here as well if the
angular property is not defined we are
simply returning zero okay so let's copy
it again passed it in a second time
change the method name to vote to react
in percent this time we are checking for
the react property
we need to change it here as well okay
and the banner we can insert it third
time for view jf okay well like so okay
now let's try that new component out and
edit to the output here which is
rendered out in index dot JSON the first
thing we need to add here is we need to
add the import statement for results
okay it's imported from components
results okay and then we can edit here
choose the output in the same way like
we did it before with app component
passing in the store has a property to
the component okay okay now let's check
the output here and the browser and you
can see it's already displaying the
result area here at the button you can
see the labels are printed out and the
progress bars are pointed out and if I
now click for example on the angular
logo you can see it's already updating
the information here in the label so
let's try it out for they react icon and
the view yes I can you can see how
nothing is changing so far here so there
has to be another hero in our
implementation so let's get back and
maybe check it in the
reducer function here and yeah the error
which is present here is that we are
still signing the incremented value here
every time to the angular property only
and of course we need to change it here
to react and we needed need to change it
here to view class property so let's get
back to the browser
okay try it out okay and now you can see
it's displaying the right information in
the label but of course the progress bar
is not displayed yet and that is what we
are going to change in the next step
okay back here in results dot J's we can
now try out how to set the progress
which is displayed by the progress bar
actually by applying some styling here
and let's try it out for the first
progress bar here I'm going to add
another attribute here which is called
as tile and then I'm adding here or
setting it equal to an expression which
is an object containing one property and
that is worth and I'm timing some value
here for example 50% okay so it's safe
it and going back into the browser and
now you can see the first progress bar
here is displayed with 50% and so we can
now implement it that the progress bar
is set on dynamically and takes into
consideration on the actual voting
result for the framework angular react
end of UJS so what we are going to do is
to not assign the width here explicitly
instead we are using another helper
method
which is called here inside of that
expression and the help a method we are
going to use is called um clothes
angular in the purse and style okay so
we can copy hit here and edit to the
second progress bar and the third
progress bar so the next helper method
is called load to react in person style
and finally the third helper method it's
going to be called loads view which is
in person style so let's quickly
implement these three new helpers
message here first votes angular in
person style so the implementation is
straightforward we simply need to return
the object consisting of one property
and that is with M the value is this
votes Anglian percent plus the percent
sign okay again copy it the second time
a third time change the name to react
and the name to UJS and yes well react
UJS okay okay so let's check our results
and browser once again so if I now click
here on the elements you can see not
only the information and the label is
going to change also the information
displayed
the progress power is changing if I
click here on the buttons you can see
it's always updated two of the latest
state properties okay so maybe let's do
a last change to our implementation
let's not display all the three labels
and progress bars in red color only only
the first armed label in the first
progress bar should be displayed in red
color and the react components should be
displayed in the blue color so I'm
changing label - danger class - label -
info which gives us a blue color and I'm
changing the progress - bar - danger
class as well - progress - whoa - info
okay and for the view test components I
would like to have a green color and
green is achieved by using label -
success and progress - bar - success
okay check it back in our browser so it
reloads again and now you can see we
have the right colors here in our
progress bar and everything is working
as expected and as shown at the
beginning in our sample application this
