coding the smart way comm and today in
this new tutorial we are going to take a
look at how you can create new angular
projects with angular CLI easily
although this video today is sponsored
by udemy udemy is a really great
platform for learning new skills online
and if you take a look at the website
you can find a bunch of really cool
courses so for example if you take a
look here at the website in the web
development section you can find the
great course
angular 5 the complete guide this course
teaches you how to develop modern
responsive and scalable single page web
applications always with the latest
version of angular and angular as you
know is one of the top frameworks in
2018 and its popularity is constantly
growing so it's worth investing your
time in that course so with total
content of 27 hours of video inside that
course it takes you really from complete
beginner to having a solid and profound
understanding of the framework it's made
by Maximilian Schwarz Miller who has
lots of experiences in teaching web
development and teaching all sorts of
front and JavaScript frameworks with
this course you will be able to
understand the fundamentals of angular
and at the same time gain really deep
insights into the architecture behind
that platform so if you haven't already
definitely check out udemy today and
choose from the top web development
online courses to get started just click
on the link in the video description and
you will get a satellite discount valid
for all the courses on the platform and
with that let's get into our today's
tutorial so today we will be dealing
with angular CLI and we will learn how
to use angular CLI to create new angular
5 projects from scratch so
as you have been following my recent
tutorials about angular maybe you have
already seen on that I am using angular
CLI quite often to initiate new angular
projects and often angular CLI is used
in the default mode which means we are
saying MD new and then followed by the
project name we would like to create and
this is executing angular CLI and that's
initiating a new project so the default
template is downloaded a new project
directory is created the Z dependencies
which are needed are being installed and
then everything is set up so that you
can start immediately and have a running
angular application but this is not
limited to running and renew in that
default mode and that is exactly what we
will be doing today to explore what
other options are 0 to create the
project to set up the angular project
which is exactly fitting to you needs
because ng new is really much more
powerful than just being executed in
that default mode so to be able to use
the angular command-line interface on
your system you first of all need to
install it and the command to do so is
viral NPM so NPM install - G for
installing it globally on your system
and then the package name is an angular
slash CLI so this is a command you
needed to run first so that the ng
command becomes a Weibull on your system
of course I have already installed
angular CLI so I do not need to install
it right now instead we can directly
jump into creating our first project and
to get started let's create a default
project just to get started here and
what I need to say here is ng then new
for are telling angular CLI to initiate
a new project and then I need to specify
the name of that project and the name of
the project directory which is being
created so let's name it Angie Angie -
default hit return and you can see it's
running it's creating that directory
downloading the default
angular 5 project template here and then
in the next step here installing the
packages which are needed in that
angular project by using NPM in the
background so with in that project
directory we will be later on once a
command has been finished we will find a
subfolder which is called note
underscore modules and that's the folder
where all the dependencies are being
installed into so this command just
takes a few seconds to complete here so
let's wait for it to complete so here we
are you can see the command has finished
it's telling me that project ng -
default has been created successfully
and now what we can do here is change
into the newly created project folder
and to just take a look so you can see
the project folder is filled with the
assets we do need here in our angular
project although the note underscore
modules folder is there and to do a
quick test now let's let's start up the
development web server which is done
with ng Cerf and just check that
everything is installed correctly and
that the application is running you can
see it here it's starting up the
development server on local host port
4200 and it's packing and the assets
here it's creating the bundles you can
see compiled successfully and now we can
try to access our application at that
URL so let's open another tab here
access local host port 4200 and you can
see welcome to app that's the output of
the default angular application if we
use angular CLI and default version with
engine you fold by the project name so
now that the first angular project has
been created and initiated let's take a
look in that directory and see what this
default on angular project is containing
and therefore I've already opened up
here in my code editor which is Visual
Studio code in that case you can see it
here is it's my project directory ng
default and here you can see that the
content here of the note modules folder
is filled all the dependencies are there
you can find the packages here and the
list of dependencies is all included in
the package dot JSON file so here in the
dependencies and in the dev dependencies
section you can find the list of
dependencies and there are those
dependencies which are being installed
when we are creating the project with
Anglo Co I in the default mode and which
are then installed into the note
underscore modules folder if you take a
look at the answer C folder you will
find the main implementation parts of
our application for example here in the
app folder you can see we have the app
dot module dot T as file which is
containing the main angular application
module which is being created here and
this default project is containing one
component and that is app components
that's the main component which is
attached here to app module and the
implementation of app component is done
in four files as you can see here we
have a CSS file which is containing the
star sheet code for that component and
by default is just empty then we have
the HTML file of course this is
containing the template code true which
is being used for generating the HTML
output of that component then we have a
spec dot ts file which is containing
test cases which is created by default
here for every component which is
initially created here in the
application and later attitudes at
application and then finally we have the
app dot component dot es file which is
containing the app component class
implementation here and is all the
pointing to the template file F dot
component dot HTML as seen before and is
pointing to you the extra
a CSS file which is belonging to that
component so in that file here
everything is put together for that
component so that's what's inside of the
default project and now we can move on
because now let's examine other options
of creating angular projects with
angular CLI and the next option we would
like to take a look at is the dash dash
minimal option to create a minimal
project setup next so I can also use
angular cui from inside visuals to your
code the only thing I need to do
therefore I need to open up the
integrated terminal and this can be done
by using a menu item integrated terminal
here in the View menu and this is
opening up my integrated terminal as you
can see here so let's get into the
terminal here and use ng new again this
time the name should be ng - minimal and
now we are using the dash - minimal
option here to create a minimal project
setup so hitting return again you can
see it's running again downloading the
project then installing again the
dependencies by using NPM this is again
taking a second to complete here so here
we are again you can see a minimal
perfect a setup has been created
successfully now we can change into that
ng - minimal directory here start up the
cell with ng self once again so that we
can access this new project in the
browser again
once the project the development web
server is starting up here so let's wait
for it to complete so that all the
bundles are compiled and created and now
we are ready let's switch back to the
browser so let's refresh it here once
again and you can see we get basically
the same output so no changes here the
output
it's the same as seen before with the
default project setup so switching back
to visual studio codes a question now of
course is what is the difference here
what is minimal in comparison to you the
default project and let's take a look at
the project structure so we have both
both projects opened up here in the
editor side by side so I can now open up
the ng - minimal folder here and in
comparison open up at the ng - default
folder you can see here in ng - minimal
some of those files are simply missing
so not all the files which are available
here are inside of the ng - minimal
folder available for example the testing
configuration is not there and the
reason is quite wise if we take a look
here at LCCC app once again you can see
there are no testing files included we
have just two files we have the app dot
module up to TS which contains the
implementation of app module and we have
one component here but only implemented
in one file no separate testing a spec
file no separate styling file and no
separate HTML file instead if I open it
up here you can see we have an inline
template so the HTML code which is
needed to generate the output for that
component is placed in line here in app
component dot d s angular gives you the
possibility to use such an inline
template by using the property template
instead of template URL here in the add
component decorator and then assigning a
multi-line string which is done here by
using backticks as you can see and this
gives you the possibility of including a
multi-line string which is containing
your
HTML template code in line here in that
component file you can see the property
starts URL has changed to start so you
can directly include your styling right
here and that's those are the main
points which are different in comparison
to you the default project setup but as
seen in the browser the output is still
the same so okay let's turn to the next
example in the previous example we have
been using minimal angular project setup
by using the - - minimal option was
engine you and you have seen that on
that minimal Angra project setup in land
templates were used this was one of the
things which are a characteristic for a
minimal project setup and if you only
want to have inline templates and do not
need for example inline styling or live
of the testing files or as all the
things which are part of a minimal
project setup you can choose to only say
you do not you want to have inline
templates and that can be done by using
the - - in line
- template option and that is what we
would like to try out next so let's
start up engine you once again this time
we have the project name let's say ng -
in line - template and we are using the
option - - in line
- template to generate inline templates
for the components okay let's hit return
wait for the command to complete once
again okay here we are so let's take a
look at the resulting project directory
and G - in line - template you can see
it here is this time the testing
configuration in comparison to what we
saw before was the minimum project setup
is again Weibull and if I now take a
look in SSC in the app folder you can
see adhere in now we have 4 app
component 3 files well we have the
external style sheet file app dot
component daughter CSS we have the test
spec file which is generated for that
component and then if I take a look an
app dot component on TS you can see we
have still the inline template here so
no HTML file a Weibull and that is
exactly what you can achieve by using
the option for the inline template setup
so in the minimal project setup before
we have also been seeing that inline
styling is applied so the property style
URLs and the add component decorator was
replaced by a property which is called
just stance so that you can place as a
styling code immediately in the very
which is assigned to use that property
and you can also choose to create a
project with inline styling without
having applied all the other minimal
setup steps by using C - - in line -
style option and the way would be ng new
and then the project name let's say ng -
inline - time and then using - - in line
- style as an option here and that is
exactly doing the same so replacing
style URLs property with the Styles
property in the add component decorator
of you components and by default that's
of course add component so you have seen
before that by default angular CLI or
let's say the ng new command is
generating CSS files for every component
and starts dot a CSS file for your
application and that behavior can be
changed and you are able to switch to
other CSS preprocessors like for example
s
CSS by using option - - style and the
syntax to do so is an G new and then the
project name again
ng - style and then we're using the - -
style style alike so option and then say
equal to SC SS if you want to switch to
s CSS other options here would be for
example less sass or or just style so
there are various possibilities but for
the demonstration right here I'm using a
CSS right now hitting return and then
the project entry - style is generated
again the dependencies are being
installed we have to wait for it to
complete so here we are let's take a
look into the ng - style directory the
first thing you may notice here in the
SSC folder you can see by default of the
starts file has been renamed regarding
the extension it's no longer starts dot
CSS instead now we have starts dot s CSS
file here which is containing the
styling code which is valid for our
complete application so if you take a
look inside that file you can see by
default it's empty and the project setup
is adapted accordingly because angular
CLI needs to tell the build process is
that the stance dot s CSS file is to be
used and if if we take a look at dot
angular - Eli daughter Jason and scroll
a little bit down here to the tax
property you can see that's the place in
the configuration whereas the starts dot
a CSS file is connected to our project
and the renaming from CSS to a CSS
place here as well the same is done for
our components so if I now take a look
inside our app folder you can see that
app component dot CSS has been replaced
by a file which is now called app
component dot s CSS so this is the
component specific styling file and as
you can see from the extension you are
now ready to write your L CSS code right
inside that file and inside F dot
component dot T as you can see here in
the style URLs property that is a new
file name will see a CSS extension is
connected here to our component as well
another cool option which can be used as
a dash dash routing option and by using
that option we are able to specify that
a routing module should be added to the
angular application which Ben can
directly be used to configure the
routing for your application and that's
the next thing what I would like to show
so this option is being used in the
following way and gene mu we are naming
the project ng routing and then use this
option - - routing like so hit return
once again the project is generated
let's wait for it to complete so here we
are you can see the energy - routing our
project is available and let's take a
look at the SRC folder of that project
and then opening up app folder where
angular application mainly lives in and
now you can see we have one more module
inside that folder and that is AB -
routing dot module dot TS so let's
opening it up you can see it here that's
a routing module you can see it here
that's the route property which is of
type routes and is
at the moment being assigned was an
empty array here but this array is the
place where we then can later on include
our routing configuration and that is
used here was the router module to be
activated for our application and the
name of that module is a per outing
module in of us which to my main
application module app dot module dot TS
you can see a protic module is imported
here from that file and activated for
the application by adding that module to
our array which is assigned to the
imports property of the add energy
module decorator here so a poor outing
module is placed here inside that array
as a second item and that is activating
the routing configuration which is
contained in that module for our
application now let's let's try it out
and to be able to use on some some
routing in our application let's first
add another component so that we have
two components and can attach a second
route to our application and yeah
configure URL to access as the output of
that second component and to generate
that component for our application I
first need to switch into that the
project directory which is ng - routing
and then use angular CLI again with the
following options so ng generate
component and then finally the name of
that new component and the name should
be second component so I'm simply using
second here you can see it's generating
four new files in SOC app second a
folder with testing a specification file
we have the typescript file which is
containing the second component class
implementation of the HTML file CSS file
and what you can also see here the
update to app dot module has been made
automatically you can see here a second
component has been imported and added
here - you see declarations
arrey to make a second component part of
our application okay so with second
component in place let's check it out
everything is here you can see that's
the class implementation that's the
template is simply putting out the text
second works we can now add something to
our routing configuration within app -
routing dot module dot TS in that empty
array here which is still empty and as
mentioned before as that's the place
where we are inserting our routing
configuration and that's quite simple
let's add an object here with two
properties we first need the passed
property which is containing the URL
extension for that specific route and
that should be second here and then we
have the component which should be
connected with that route component and
here we would like to connect a second
component so and you can see it here as
I'm typing the import statement which is
needed for second component is added
automatically here to the top of my file
so that second component is made label
here within app - routing dot module dot
TS and having that import statement
available here we can use second
component else' value here for assigning
it to the component property of the
first routing configuration object so
with that configuration in place our
route configuration is is valid and
activated and we can now start up the
development web server here in the ng -
routing project folder again by using
and reserve here and the project web
server is starting up by hitting return
here once again on port 4200 you can see
it here the bundles are being built and
compiled and once this is finished we
can switch back to the browser and
what we are getting at it as an output
okay here we are let's get to the
browser let's refresh it here you can
see now we are in the end rerouting
project the output here is by default
the same and now because our routing
configuration is in place we now have
the option to say slash second because
second was the value we assigned to the
past property of the routing
configuration object and now you can see
the output is is changed here you can
see it here is the output of the second
component which is a text second who
works is outputted here underneath all
the other stuff we have here on the
website and that shows us that the route
configuration is working and that the
second components output is included
here in what we see in the browser and
the reason why it is placed right here
is the following let's switch back to
our code editor and let's take a look at
our main component which is app
component here is the template code and
because we have been creating the
project with of the - - routing option
of the following element here was added
to the main application component and
that it's router
- outlet and that is placed here right
under needs the other template code
which is responsible for generating the
output we saw by default on the webpage
and the router outlet element is placed
underneath so that's the reason why we
saw the output second works underneath
all the other stuff because router out
that is yeah you can say a place holder
a place holder on your website on your
main
vacation template where the output which
is generated by child components which
is for example the routing component
second component in that case is being
inserted so that's the reason here of
course you can place router outlet this
element wherever you like this is just
the default configuration here but with
that default configuration I hope you
have been able to see how quickly you
can get going with the angular router by
using ng client here so just to mention
a few more options you can use together
with ng new let's start with Z - -
prefix option but default all your
component of selector prefixes are set
to the straight app this can be changed
by using this prefix option of the
following way there you need to say
energy news and the project name prefix
change for example and then - - prefix
and for example replace F with my app is
then the following syntax equals my app
and with that in place all the app
prefixes are changed to my app and the
place where you can find the prefix is
for example at me show this year with
our previously used set and component
here in the selector property here you
can see it's app - second and that at
the same time the name of the element
which needs to be used when placing it
in a parent template then the element
name would be app - second so exactly
the same same name as you can see here
and this is a default prefix app and by
using the command in that way this is
replaced with my app so let's continue
by default I get a repository as great
it was you know new angular project and
if you do not want to have a gate or a
posse initialized in your project
directory you can skip that step by use
engi new project name and then use the
option - - skip - get in this case no
gate repository is created and you can
do that of course later on when you need
to get repository but by default no gate
repository has credit if you want to
create a git repository she ate the
first git commit already which is done
by default you can use as the option - -
skip - commit this is generating a git
repository in your project directory but
skipping the first commit so it's up to
YouTube then later on do the first
commit by yourself so this one Sebastian
