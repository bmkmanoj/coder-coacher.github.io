mod Wacom and today in this video we are
going to build a small application a
small ujf to application and using the
firebase real-time database as a
back-end so you will learn how to set up
an initial view application how to
install the firebase library and the
view final library and make use of both
libraries to integrate firebase
real-time data into your project so stay
tuned and let's get started okay let's
see what we are going to build in this
tutorial here you can see the sample
application
um which we are going to build today and
you can see it's just a very simple
application using the bootstrap
framework to add some styling here to
the elements and that application can
manage a list of e-books and store owing
to the e-book from home page so if I
click here on the title I'm taken to a
URL of the e-book website and here in
embed list you are able to delete
entries and with a form with the input
form available here on top we are able
to add angry so let's try it out
I will give here a test title then also
and then some website and edit here to
the list so here you can see it's added
and now I can click on that link I'm
taken to the UL and of course I can
delete that entry here and yeah by
clicking here on the trash icon and it's
confirming that was deleted by bringing
up a toast notification as you can see
and the back end of the application is
good upon using the final base real-time
database so the data we are entering
here are synced on to the firebase
database until we can open up multiple
instances of the same application so you
can see it here now I have opened up two
instances of our application here in
window 1 and window - you can see both
instances are containing the same list
of data and furthermore I've opened in
the third window here is a firebase a
back-end which gives us a real-time view
on the database which we are using and
here you can see the structure of the
database and of course I will explain it
in more detail in the implementation
part of this video but for now you can
see we have within the books section
here two entries one two and that is
exactly reflecting the entries which we
have here in the table and now you can
see if I'm going to add another item
here maybe in the first instance you can
see that the real-time feature is
working in the background so let's do it
again
let's add test title hero name an answer
and use some URL and then I'm going to
say okay at book by hitting that button
here and you can see it's at the same
time added here to the list we have no
third entry available here we have it
here in the second instance available as
well as you can see here without needing
to update anything manually and if we
now take a look here at the firebase
back-end you can see I'm here another
entry added inside the books section
which is containing the data of our
short book item here again now with the
third item a Weibull here in our listed
in our database I can of course delete
it again by using the icon here maybe in
the second application instance
now you can see if I click on that item
it's deleted at the same time here from
the list and from the database again I
do not need to reload anything manually
it's assumed across all instances across
the background here and all application
instances are showing the same set of
data
okay now exactly have the first
impression of our project we are going
to plate in the next minute let's start
at the very beginning with our
implementation and before actually going
into the code we need to prepare the
firebase service so that we have a real
time database label which we can use
later on and our view J's to application
and we do that by logging in into the
firebase console so that is the backend
of firebase and you can access it by
using the following ul as you can see
here convo firebase Google calm and I'm
already logged into the firebase service
so if you you have not created the
firebase account before you first need
to do so and then you are able to log in
and see that screen here and you can see
on the first screen you can see an
overview of firebase project see you
have already created that you can see
here in my account I've already created
one scientist project that was the one I
used to demonstrate the application and
now we are starting over from scratch
and I'm going to create a second project
and I do that by clicking here on the
link create a new project and now I'm
getting presented on the pop-up window
here and I can give a name here so let's
say you gales firebase o - and then I
can select the country region where I
want to arm to use servers arm on which
my firebase database is hosted I leave
it to United States and then I
to create project and now firebase is
fighting that project it takes a second
and if the creation process has been
completed successfully and taking to the
back end of my project so here in the
project console you can see that
firebase is actually offering various
services so it starts with
authentication services database service
of storage hosting services and so on
you can see here the service we want to
use for our beauteous application is of
course the database service because we
want to have a real time database store
and that is a Weibull by using the
firebase glutton database and if I click
on database here I'm directly taken to
the database back-end and I'm here on
the data view so you can see we have
four tabs here data routes usage and
backups and the data which is available
in the database right now can be seen
here on the data tab view by default one
root node is available which contains no
data so far so the value is set to null
and now we can start in lurking sample
data here in the database so that we
have later on when we integrate the
firebase data store in our Beauty
application and to try to access data
coming here from the backend we have
some data labels so it insert a first
book record here and we do that by
clicking here on the root node and then
saying plus here with it little icon on
the right side and first I need a node
books and inside of books I'm saying
okay I want to have the first record
here and now the first book of record
Chelsea has seen
is consisting of three properties and
now I can start on typing in the
properties of the first property of the
book title let's give it a title angular
2 and then I'm hitting tab to get the
next line and in the next line I'm
saying okay let's use the also property
and assign my name as Z also well you
and then we'll have the UL and I'm
typing in a URL here okay that's the
first the first book record and finally
if everything is entered correctly I can
say head and then you can see it's
inserted in the firebase database now we
have the books node label we have first
entry here which has a key one and we
have three properties maintained for
this first book entry and it's that's it
for now the last thing we need to change
here and the firebase back-end is not in
the data tab here it's in the root step
and if I click on it you can see here is
a default rule set already a label which
is defining to two rules actually one
for read XS and one for write access and
basically this two rules are saying only
authenticated users can read data from
the database and write data to the
database and because we want to keep
things as simple and easy as possible
I'm going to change the default entry
here to simply saying true here play
true as well and then I publish the
changes and now it's saying okay or it's
printing out a warning message if
security routes are defined as public
anyone can read and write to your
database and that's okay for the moment
of course if you want to use firebase in
a production environment that is not
something you should do but for the
moment for our test application it's
sufficient that we do not need to deal
with our firebase authentication later
on so I will leave the route as you can
see here and continue with the
implementation implementation in the
next part okay next we are starting with
the implementation of the VDS project
and then integrating the data access to
the firebase database and to do so I'm
switching over to the terminal and I'm
starting or initiating to view GS
project and I do that by using the view
command interface which gives me access
to the view command and if you have not
installed the view command-line
interface on your system yet you can go
to our projects website at auj after
dark and go to the installation section
and find instructions of how to install
the view command-line interface and I'm
now using that interface to execute the
following command I'm saying view init
webpack because I want to use the web
tech mutators project template and then
specify a name for the project and I'm
calling the project UJ as firebase okay
and then hit return and now the view
command-line interface is asking some
questions on the command line first I
need to
enter a project name that I can skip it
and leave it to the default here then we
need a project description I leave it to
the default as well we also then we need
to select this view both type I select
rental class compiler I do not want to
use years old do not want to use common
marker from a project and do not want to
use end-to-end tests with Nightwatch so
I'm saying no here again and now you can
see it generated as downloaded to a new
folder and now I can change into that
folder view J's firebase and the first
thing I need to do here is to execute
npm install to make sure that all the
dependencies from UTS to project our
downloaded and installed to the node
modules folder so now let's execute npm
install and it takes a second to
download everything and to install okay
here we are
everything was downloaded and installed
successfully and now before going on and
the diving on deeper into the
implementation part we need to add two
more dependencies or let's say two more
libraries to our project the one thing
which we need is the core firebase
library and the other thing which is
needed is the view file library which
makes it very easy within our beauty as
application to bind beauty and data
properties to firebase data so we are
installing both libraries here and we do
that again by using VM NPM command and
saying npm install firebase with which
is the core library and you fire and I'm
saying - - safe by using the safe option
here we make sure
both dependencies firebase view file are
added to the package.json file as well
so let's executed both libraries are
downloaded and installed again into the
node modules folder okay here we are
again so everything now is installed and
a label for use and then the next thing
that I'm going to do is to open up Adam
because Adam is code editor I'm going to
use here and I'm opening up Adam with
the project structure here in our
beauteous firebase folder and now the
first thing we need to do is to go to
the source folder here and open main go
to GS which is basically the main entry
point of the view GS application you can
see it here view is loaded and a new
instance of the main framework
application class is created and that's
the right place here in that sound to
add view fire else well and first we
need to import it by adding here another
import statement and I'm saying import
view fire from view file okay like so
and next I need to add view fire as a
plugin to the framework and that can be
done by using view dot use and hand over
the view fire class here okay that's all
what's needed now view file is
configured to be used in our project and
next we can go on with the
implementation and switch over to active
view okay within app dot view you can
find a single file implementation of
view j/s component and the thing as a
final implementation of a component is
split up into three sections where you
can find a template section here within
that file you can find the script
section and the Style section which is
contains CSS code which is used here in
the template of the component and the
active view file is containing the main
application component and you can see it
here in the template the dis section is
containing two elements it's containing
an image tag here which is including the
Blue Jays logo and the output and it's
gone it's including on the output of the
hello component which is a second
component which is implemented here in
hello dot view but for the moment we do
not want to use a second component so we
can delete it here and maybe delete the
logo as well so that we have an empty
template and as I'm not using the yellow
component here in the template I can
delete as well from the components
property here from the components
configuration object okay
so the first step we need to to make and
to implement here an apt of view is to
configure the exam to the firebase
database and we do that by yes starting
here in the script section and to gain
access to the firebase real time
database we need to get access to the
firebase API and to get access
I need a configuration object which
needs to be passed to the firebase
service which contains a set of
properties like the API key the database
URL and so on which is needed to get
access to the firebase database so let's
start here with defining a config object
okay and now the easiest way to bring in
the properties and to assign the right
property values for our firebase
configuration object is to go to the
firebase project console and here on the
overview page you can see you have a
link which is named add firebase to your
web app if I click on that link it
brings up a pop-up window giving me
access to a pre-salt
configuration object and here are the
properties are needing a custom simply
copy and paste those properties and I
have some configured everything
according to the firebase settings for
my beauteous firebase Oh to project ok
with the conspiration object available I
can now establish a connection to the
firebase and I do that by saying let app
firebase dot in issue laws app and I'm
passing over the configuration object
and okay one thing is missing and
because I need to access to the firebase
and core library I need to add an import
statement here as well and I need to say
import firebase from firebase and now I
have access to that firebase object and
I can use it here to execute the method
initialize app and now on the reference
to the firebase arm back-end as a
Weibull here with an app and now I can
establish a connection to the database
so let's say
let t be equal to app dot database and
the call of the database method is
returning a reference to the database
and in our application we want to have
access to the data which is stored
inside on the books and I would in the
database and to get another reference
which is pointing to the books node I'm
defining another variable here and I'm
saying let books refs equals DB ref and
now I'm passing the name of the node and
in that case it's books okay
okay with the reference to the books
note of the firebase return database
available here we can now use the view
fire to bring in another property here
to our component configuration object
and this property is called firebase and
within the property or we are assigning
an object here to the firebase property
and within that object we are defining
another property and that property is
called books and we are signing books
ref which is a reference to the books
node in the firebase database and now we
we are able to use books for data access
in our template and you will see it in a
minute and that actually makes
integrating firebase database and
outputting firebase data in our view
chaos of view layer very easy okay now
we are nearly ready to implement the
template and within the template
implement of the output of the books
data from the firebase database but
before doing so we need to complete one
more thing and the
I'm opening up index.html from the root
folder of my project and in the
demonstration of our sample application
you already saw that we are using
bootstrap to include some styling and
our user interface and to be able to use
bootstrap in our project we need to
include the bootstrap libraries in our
project as well as the easiest way to do
so is include bootstrap from a content
delivery network so we do not need to
install it here locally within our
project we only need to bring in the
remote files here by first using a link
tag and let me bring it in here in the
head section of index dot HTML okay here
we are including the bootstrap CSS file
and together with the CSS file we also
do need to the boot scrappy our script
file and let me copy the corresponding
script tag in as well and as bootstrap
makes use of jQuery I need to include
jQuery here as well and again I'm
including jQuery by using a content
delivery network
appe know that that was wrong let me try
it again okay here we are
that's the jQuery library and if you
want to know where you can find those
links you can go to the bootstrap
website and to go to the jQuery website
and search for realm CDN and you will
find the corresponding links where you
can retrieve the ephod from a remote
location ok let's save it and next
continue with the template
implementation
go back into F dot view okay here I am
back in active view and you can see I am
already on the template section and the
first thing I will do here is to assign
a bootstrap class and I am assigning the
container class here to the top level
this element within my template section
ok and ok let's use another div here
give it a class of page header so within
the page header section we are including
an h1 and saying OK you J is 2 and
firebase sample application ok then
we're using another disk section here
and assigning a class of panel and panel
D fold and then I'm using another deep
section which is included here in the
panel and assigning a class of panel
heading ok and include an h3 tag here
and a ok books list ok under of the dis
section of panel heading we are
including another deep section and
assigning the class panel body of course
ok and here is the right place now to
output the table which is including
basically a list of books
which are retrieved from our firebase
instance and D so by saying table and
I'm assigning again booth prep classes
here let's use the class a table and
table struct okay within the table I I
do have a section bounty hat
that's the header of the table and I'm
printing out of the column headlines
here first I will need a title headline
and second I need to the answer headline
and yeah under the tea head section
I'm including the tea body and within
the Peabody I'm printing out how to go
on the data and I'm doing that by using
a table row and I'm printing out a table
row for each of the book entries in the
firebase books note and we do have
access to two that a set of data by
using the books variable we've defined
earlier and to iterate over the items
within books I'm using a view j/s
directive which is called you - form and
I'm saying okay books in books which
gives me access to the current book
object by using the variable book here
and now I'm able to print out the
information I'm including again two
columns here okay and the content is a
book title I'm using the interpolation
syntax here and book dot author and you
saw it in our sample application I
showed in the beginning
do not want to only print out the title
we want to print out the title as a link
which give which gives us access to on
the the books URL and we do so by using
an H element here saying H ref and I
need to use another directive here I'm
using the rebind directive because I
want to bind it to a property of our
book object and saying plate equals to
book dot URL okay and I'm closing the
link element here and that's basically
all what's needed to to print out as a
title in links on and now the link is
pointing to the URL which is stored in
book that ul okay what's the
implementation of the template a Weibull
we can now switch back to the terminal
and just try to start up our development
server and I'm still within the project
directory you can see it here and I'm
typing in the NPM run death this is
starting up a web server and I'm
starting up the view J application in
development mode okay so it's starting
up and it's loaded here in the browser
automatically so just place it here side
by side okay we can see that I'll be a
result is still empty so something is
not correct to file so let's pick sell
some the chrome developer tools here and
see what's what's wrong okay app
database yes there is a typo in the
function call of app database you can
see it here we need to replace it okay
arms so save it again there is a second
error
okay books ref is not
and I forgot to include an S here okay
it's books Rev okay there it is
now the application is running you can
see the list of items that's printed out
and to make it look like a little bit
better I'm going here to the Style
section and let's remove the
text-align:center
styling okay so now you can see we have
the list label here we have the two
information included title and author
and we can here click on the title and
the book page is opening up okay let's
go back okay next we are going to extend
the application by including an input
form so that we can add new book data to
the on databases that we can see that
all the data we are adding to the real
time database are directly reflected in
our books list so let's again open
active view and go to the script section
here and the first thing we now need is
another property here in our component
configuration object and the property we
are needing is data and in this case
data is a function and the function is
returning the data model of our view
component and we do need something which
is an object and may be called new book
and this new book object should contain
the properties we are expecting to
receive from
your form to to describe a new book and
that is of course title and we are
setting it to the artist in empty screen
also and he while okay so we need that
object to here new book so that we have
something in our data model here in our
view transaction we can bind from our
input element to okay a column is
missing here so that is the exact syntax
okay with the new book object available
here in our data model we can go back to
the template implementation and add here
on top of the panel we have been using
for including the table output at
another panel section and it's just the
same we begin by using a div element and
assigned class panel panel default and
we give our panel a heading where we are
including a headline let's say we are
using add book
and then of course we need the
corresponding panel body section and
within the body section we can now
continue to implement the input form so
let's implement it on the form and we do
so by starting with form tag of course
and let's design an ID of form we do not
need an action and we do not need the
method here instead we need a class of
course because again our form if do that
by using bootstrap classes and we are
assigning the form in line class ok here
with an our form let's start with the
first form group by using a div element
again and we are assigning the class
from group and within that first phone
group we do need a label and we do need
that label for the field book title we
are going to implement next and the
label should be just type title
ok and next of course the corresponding
input element and that should be of type
text it gets an ID here and that ID
the book title okay and let's use the
bootstrap class form control here and
then I would like to bind to our new
book object to the property title and
the binding syntax in the UK s is very
easy we can simple use a directive
called Li
- model and we're assigning a string to
that directive containing the name of
our property and our cases new book
title we won't bind to and that is all
we need for the first form groups so
let's save it okay you can see here this
and now we are including two more groups
to more fun rules so one and two and the
next one group of course is for entering
the author so I need to change a title
to author so the label is also also and
then we have here the IPS poke poke
answer okay the class of course is the
famous one - control and we are binding
in that case - new book dot author so
okay let's save it on the third input
element here is book URL
okay and we are binding against the UL
property of course so let's save it and
you can see here our inland form is
already rendered out now we have three
input elements title author and URL but
something is missing of course because
we do need a button to to submit the
form and the button is added here just
before the closing form tag and it is
implemented by using input type submit
in that case we do not get a name here
instead I do need a class and the graph
is button button primary to get a blue
button from the bootstrap framework and
the value should be at book so that the
user knows and that he is adding a new
book item by clicking on that button
okay let's face it here it is okay the
next thing we need to add here in our
form element if an event handler
which responds to our submit event
because now with the button available
here in our form the user can click on
that submit button and then the submit
event of the form fires and what we want
to have is that the submit event handler
is collecting the data the user has
entered in the form and passes that data
on to the firebase real time database
and in there's a new book item 0 ok
let's first I'm here with in the form
element add from the b-pawn directive
cone and we want to respond to the
submit event and we are using the
imitation dot prevent because the form
should not be submitted by using the
default behavior so we want to prevent
the default behavior we want to take
over full control of how the form is
submitted by using the following event
handler we call it at book okay like so
and next of course we need an event
handler method at book which needs to be
implemented here in our script section
and within our within our component
configuration object we are adding
another property here and that property
is called methods okay
and we are assigning we're assigning an
object which is containing all the
methods we were implementing here in
that component and yet the first method
we want to implement here is ad book of
course because that is a wave antenna
for the submit event and we are
assigning a function here and within sit
function we are using again the books
ref variable and push this dot new book
because that is here the receipt data
the data object was a property title
author and URL and the properties will
have been bound to the input elements to
our forms of the properties of the new
book of yet object our containing the
values which have been imported by the
user and we can use that object to edit
here to the database by using the push
method okay and the last thing now we
need to reset the form and we can simply
do it by resetting the new book our
properties first do it with title and
then which also we are assigning empty
strings here and the URL as well okay
here we are
okay let's try it out if everything is
working as expected
let's try to insert another book here
let's see if they give the title also
and then give it a URL okay and now I
hit add book and you can see it's
immediately available here as another
row in our list and if I now switch over
to the firebase database you can see
here the new book object has been
inserted the ID here on has been
assigned automatically and that was my
first item here and now I have the
second item available here and it's
assumed in real time with the data the
list is presenting in that section here
ok let's now include another option so
the option to delete entries from the
database and from the list of course and
we do that by first starting in the
template here on in the template
intersection where the table output is
generated and the first thing I do here
is to include another column in our
table so let's give it a headline delete
and then here in the table body in that
column generate for each row an icon
which we can use from the glyphicon
library from the Bhoots web framework
and we do it LF as you can see here we
are using a spawn element and give it a
class of greatest
glyphicon and we are using the icon
goofy con trash trash okay and well then
we need of course an action which takes
place if we user clicks on that icon and
we are again using the event binding
syntax by using the directive V dash on
cone and then followed by the event we
want to respond to and in that case it's
a click event and we are assigning the
event handler here and in in that case
we are naming the event handler method
remove book and we are passing in one
parameter and that is the current book
object okay so you can see it here it's
immediately there we can now have
another column included here in our list
here is a trash - generated for each row
if I now click on that item nothing is
happening of course because we have not
implemented remove book and that is the
next thing we are going to do so here in
our methods object I am adding now
another method and that method is called
removes book okay and of course it's a
function which takes the parameter and
now I need to remove the book from the
firebase database and by removing the
book entry from the firebase database we
make sure that
the intruders removed from our table as
well because the table is bound to after
that is the data in our 5s database and
the only thing we now need to do is to
use the book graph yeah progress object
again and then select the child which
can be done by passing in to the call of
the child method by passing in the key
and the key is available here in our
current book object and we can select
the key by selecting dot key F item here
and that needs to be passed into child
and now we have access to or we have a
reference available to you on the child
element the book element which we want
to delete and the last thing I no need
to do is to call the remove method here
ok let's save it and see if it is
working so now let's maybe delete the
second entry here I'm clicking on the
trash icon and you can see it's gone
immediately and if a recheck it was a
database you can see it's deleted from
the database as well ok so let's give
our applications of final touch by
adding a toast notification which is
coming up in case the user deletes a
book entry from the list and to do so we
are using the toaster you have a script
library which is great for endorsing
toast notifications in your application
so to add that library tool to our
project I need to go back to the console
so I'm topping the web server here for a
moment and then using the npn command
once again to install
the packaged food which is called
toaster and again using a - - safe to
make sure that this new dependency is
stored in package.json as well so let's
install it okay so it's downloading two
node modules here okay there we are and
yeah now we need to go back to Adam and
the first thing I'm adding is an
index.html the toaster library needs its
own CSS file which needs to be included
here in the header section l and as you
can see I am including it here from a
CDN again for faster delivery and they
are save it and now I can go back to app
dot view and here on top of the script
section I can include another import and
I'm importing toaster from the toaster
library and now we can use toaster - to
bring up those notifications and we're
going to use it here within our method
handler for the remove case
so within removes books we can very
simple bring up a toast notification for
just same toaster success and then
passing in the message string we would
like to have an eye I'm choosing your
book removed ok before trying out all
this new feature don't forget to start
again development web server let's do it
with NPN run death once again
okay here we are now we can add our
second term book item once again okay at
book here this and if I now click on the
trash icon here to delete that second
item again you can see the toast
notification is coming up and saying
book removed as expected okay thank you
