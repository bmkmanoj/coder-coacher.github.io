the smart way comm and today in this new
video I'm going to talk about a new web
application bundler which is called
parcel and if you have been working in
web development for quite some time you
might already be familiar with
application bundlers like browserify or
a web pack for example and all those
bundlers help you to to pack your web
application the assets of your web
application static and dynamic assets
dependencies of your web application in
so-called bundles and makes those
bundles of able so that you can easily
deploy your application furthermore web
application bundles can perform many
more tasks for example you can run a
task as part of the build process like
post code processing structuring for
example transpiling that are typically
tasks which were executed by web
application bundler but however most of
today's web application bundlers like
web tech are struggling with a very
complicated configuration or structure
so if you are dealing with those
bunglers
you will need quite some time to get the
configuration of the bundlers correct
and most of the web developers I know
are at some point are struggling with
the configuration setup of those
bunglers
especially when your application grows
and it becomes more complicated and
there now is possible and the promise is
that parcel is blazing fast and that you
will need zero configuration to get it
running so I think it's worse to take a
deeper look inside and that is exactly
what we are going to do now in this
video so stay tuned
so the first thing we're going to do is
to take a look at the parcel a website
and the website can be found at parcel J
s dot org you can see it here and if you
take a look at the start page
it's got a little bit down here you can
see here at the main features
highlighted for parcel it starts here
was saying that parcel has a
blazing-fast bundle time and that is
fruit because parcel uses multiple
worker processes to ensure that the
compilation process is executed in
parallel on on multiple cores and
furthermore parcel makes use of the
caching mechanism which further
optimizes is a build process parcel is
bundling all your assets you can see
here
passive offers out-of-the-box support
for common project assets like the
yahwah script files cascading
stylesheets HTML files and so on best is
you do not need to install any plugins
to make sure that parcel is adding those
assets to the bundles it creates parcel
is applying an automatic transformation
so that means by default parcel is
performing code transformations using
babel post CSS and post HTML for example
those all the libraries which are taking
of the code you write as an input and
apply some transformation of that code
for the output parcel do need zero
configuration for code splitting code
splitting means that parcel is splitting
the assets of your project into multiple
bundles if not all assets are needed at
once so when your application is loaded
initially by using this approach code
splitting not all assets needs to you
below that first and the user of the web
we'll only need some parts and those
parts are built into one bundle and the
other parts which are needed later up
compiled into another bundle so that at
first loading the website
you only need to load a one bundle and
the web application which is set up in
such a way we'll have a much faster
loading time so that the user experience
will be much better and the code is
loaded as needed so lazy loading parcel
has a hot module replacement parcel is
watching if the development of web
server is running puzzlers watching for
code changes and the places modules
automatically and parcel comes with a
friendly error logging so now you have a
brief overview of what are the main
features of parcel let's get started at
the first step we need to take is to
install parcel on your system so parcel
can be installed virus a command line
and to install the parcel packet we are
using the node package manager you
should make sure before beginning the
installation that you have the most
updated version of node tree s and NPM
installed and if that's the case we can
start right away the installation
command is NPM install - tree for
installing a parcel globally on the
system and then you need to give the
package name here and the package name
is parcel - bundler so that is a command
simply execute this command and parcel
is installed on your system I have
already installed past so I do not need
to execute it now you can also use yarn
if you prefer to use yarn as a package
manager the corresponding command will
then be yon global ad
parcel - bundler so this will have the
same effect it installs password
globally on your system and you can use
both commands you can decide to use NPM
or you can decide to use yarn once
having installed passive successfully we
can now go on and you have create a new
project and initiate this project to
work with passive as a web application
bundle so at first we need to create a
new empty project directory so let's say
we would name this Directory password
mo1 well then change into the newly
created directory and of course it's
empty and the first thing we now need to
do here is to initiate this project with
a new package dot JSON file to do so I'm
saying NPM in it - why and you can see
it here it creates a new package JSON
file that's the content of the file and
if I now take a look in site versus
folder you can see it's no longer empty
the package dot JSON file is zero so to
begin with let's add an index dot HTML
file and let's start the code editor so
that we can write code inside that file
and in my case I'm using Visual Studio
code as my preferred code editor so that
I can say code dot here to open visual
studio code with the current directory
opened so this takes me to the developer
you can see it here here you can see two
files are there packaged adjacent
index.html and let's start to write some
in some HTML code here in two index dot
HTML
here in a video of studio code I'm able
to use Emmet which gives me the
opportunity of using code snippets and
to start with a basic HTML structure
here in my father I simply need to type
in an exclamation mark here and use this
Emmet abbreviation so this expands to
you of the following which is a basic
HTML structure and let's do some changes
here to that structure let's remove all
the meta elements here from the head
section I do not need those meta
elements for my demo right now let's
change the title here maybe we can say
parcel demo 0:01 like so and here inside
my body section let's add a div element
with ID assigned of message like so and
let's add a script element here to
include a Yahveh script file I'm going
to create in the next step and that file
is named F dot J s okay like so and now
of course we need to add that new file
here to the project as well so f dot J s
and now inside that file let's write one
line of JavaScript code just
demonstrated enter this is automatically
added to the bundle parcel is creating
let's say document dot get element by ID
and we have created the div element with
ID of message
so now let's select is this element by
passing in message here to the get
element by ID method and let's select
the property inner text and set the unit
x2 is a string hello world okay like so
let's save it okay everything is in
place okay so we are ready we have one
eight
Team Alpha in our project one Yahveh
script file and the output we are now
expecting to get is the text hello world
because this line of code is selecting
the div element we have placed inside
our body section and adding the text
hello world inside the div element so
that this text should appear in the
browser output and to check if
everything is working correctly we now
need to start up the development web
server which parcel is providing and
that is the next step and then we will
see the result in the browser so to
start up a parcel and to start off the
development web server I've opened up
the integrated to command line here so
that we can do it from within visual
studio code and the command know which
is way but all parcel globally on your
system is a passive command so I can now
say parcel and Anita - provided with
what argument here on the command line
and that is the entry point of our
application and at the moment with just
a few files in our application and the
entry point is of course index dot HTML
so this is the command to start up the
project so I'm hitting return here and
you can see it's starting up the project
on part 1 2 3 4 so I can copy that
address here switch back to the browser
pass it in and you can see we are
getting the result I was expecting to
get hello world is printing out and that
is the proof that everything has worked
as expected parcel has taken the HTML
file and a JavaScript file bundled it
automatically without needing to
configure anything and created a bundle
and the web application is working as
expected so if I'm now switching back to
my editor you can see that Tifa two
folders have been added here
my projects directory the first one is
the cache folder which is used for the
internal parcel file caching mechanism
but much more interesting of the dist
folder because that is the output folder
of parcel and you can see here two files
are included in my output we have one
bundle created here one llaves bundle
and one index dot HTML file so parcel
has created one bundle here because we
have only one asset which goes into that
bundle and of course has included our
static HTML file here which is the entry
point of our application as well as this
in this folder and so you can see the
dist folder is filled and parcel is
working and creating bundles as needed
without needing to include any
configuration our project which is of
course very great so in the next step
let's extend our sample project a little
bit and let's make use of modules of
Yahveh script modules and parcel
supports out of the box
both both syntaxes it supports commonjs
and es6 modules and you can use whatever
you want you do not need to change any
configuration because of course we have
no configuration for parcel yet in our
project and in the following example I'm
using the es6 module syntax and to get
started let's create or let's add a new
file here it is a project and call it
look dot MJS and writing a little bit of
you have a script code here inside so i
need to use the export keyword here and
so export function and we are defining a
square function which takes one
parameter and this function is returning
but square so return x multiplied by x
and so that is my module on the function
is exported so that I'm able to import
this file
in any other file and now I can go back
to app dot J s and add on top of the
file the corresponding import statement
so now I can say import and a dealer
named import here Square from the lip
file and now square is available for
access here in F dot Jas and I can
change for example the output here a
little bit and adapt the text which is
added to the div element with ID message
and I will not use hello world instead I
will use a text the square of two years
and then add the the return value of the
square function which is called for the
input parameter of two so let's save it
you can see it here it has updated the
bundle automatically and now I can go to
the browser again and you can see it has
been reloaded without needing to do
anything manually and now the output is
the square of two is okay we have a
typos error not ID let's change it to
kills so is four and let us approve the
square function has been called the
module is accessible the module the Lib
dot JS file has been added to the bundle
as well and it was able or we was able
here to you to make use of that function
which is exported in lib KS inside of F
dot J s so if you need to add
dependencies to your project that's also
no problem and password will add needed
to external dependencies once installed
to your project automatically to the
bundles
as well and to demonstrate this let's
add the jQuery library to our project by
using the node package manager again I
can say npm install J query and use the
- - safe option as well to add that
dependency tis a package to JSON file ok
you can see a node underscore modules
folder has been created if I take a look
here inside the node underscore modules
folder you can see the jQuery dependency
package is installed and now we can make
use of jQuery in our project of course
and then parcels recognizing that this
dependency is needed by our project and
is adding jQuery automatically to you
the bundles so to make use of jQuery I
can add here an app dot tree as another
import statement and make trickery a
Weibull so I'm importing it as dollar
sign from jQuery like so and now I will
rewrite here app dot is a little bit to
make it a little bit more dynamic let's
first define a variable here so let a
equals 2 and then I'm defining a
function which is setting the message
text the function takes one parameter
which is a text and then it's using
jQuery to select our div element with
our the message assigned and the jQuery
syntax is as follow
so that is equivalent to the document
dot get element by ID method call you
can see here and with jQuery it's
possible to do it a little bit shorter
and I can set at the inner text here by
calling the text message and passing in
the text so now I have a function of
able and first of all I'm now using this
function to set the text initially and I
would like to to use basically this text
here okay but I would like to make it
more dynamic not only to output the
square of two but the outputs a square
of whatever is in E and I can do so so I
first need to change the input parameter
of square of cost to e and then I need
to change the text here as well
so like so and now I would like to
extend some functionality a little bit
whenever the user clicks on the text
which is outputted it should increment e
and therefore increments the output as
well and to do so I'm using jQuery again
so I'm selecting the div element was was
ID message again and then I'm
registering an event handler for the
click event so like so okay and then I'm
incrementing E and then setting the
message text again and I can just copy
and past it from here delete this one so
safe it once again check it here okay no
errors the bundle has been built parcel
has been executed successfully and now I
can go back to the browser and check the
output again and now you can see I can
click here on the text and it's updating
the output for every click so of course
parcel takes also care of your own CSS
and s CSS assets those assets are as
well automatically recognized and
attitude with the bundles as needed you
need to import all the CSS assets in
your JavaScript or HTML file of course
so that parcel is able to recognize that
this asset is needed for your project
let's try it out and add some CSS code
to our project of course first of all we
need a CSS file let's add
now I'm not not here just add it to the
main directory here okay
let's add starts dot CSS and let's add
some CSS text first of all for on the
body element let's add a background
color and set the background to powder
blue for example okay and then let's add
some CSS styling to the div element with
ID message assigned let's give it a
color foreground color of blue let's
increase the font size a little bit 3:00
p.m. and let's do text align to center
now we need to make the starts dot a CSS
file available in index dot HTML by
adding the corresponding link element
here in the head section
okay like so okay so you can see the
bundle is rebuilding parcel is running
you can see it here in the distal and
now that this readies the output is now
including our CSS bundle as well and if
I check the result in the browser you
can see that the styling is applied and
the output has changed so you can all
also use of course as CSS code if you
would like we can try it out of course
again I need to add a new file here to
my project let's call all this file
starts dot s CSS and write down s CSS
code here for example I can now first of
all define variables that I will later
on use in my are styling let's define a
message color variable here
what are set to blue and let's define a
BG color which I'm setting to powder
blue okay
so now with those two variable to define
I can now write all the same styling
code as seen before in my starts dot CSS
file but I'm not assigning the color the
color values now directly instead I'm
using message color and BG color so
let's maybe copy this code here insert
it here again then I'm removing this one
and I'm using BG color here instead and
I'm removing the blue color here as well
and I'm using message color instead so
I'm making use of the variables which is
a feature of a CSS and now of course I
need to include the standards dot our
CSS file in my project but before doing
so I first of all need to remove the
link element here because I do not want
to include starts dot CSS any longer
okay I can check it here in the browser
you can see the styling is done and to
be able to add an S CSS file here to you
my application and in order to make sure
that parcel is compiling that asset
correctly and creating the corresponding
bundle I need to first make sure that
another package is installed and the
package which is needed here is the note
- s a SS package so let's install the
package I'm stopping the web server here
for a moment
installing it here inside my project
folder NPM install node
as a SS so it's downloading the
dependency and installing it into my
note underscore modulus folder and once
it is ready I can include the ass
CSS asset for example in my Yahveh
script file by adding another import
statement okay here we are now let's go
to app dot GS and add the following
import statement here import starts dot
s CSS okay like so and now I need to
restart the parcel web server again of
course
so the bundle is built as you can see
here and once it is finished we can
check it again in the browser so I'm
switching to Chrome again and here you
can see the styling is back so our s CSS
asset is working and that is the proof
that parcel was able to recognize as a
new asset and add it to the output
without needing to include any
configuration we just need to add that
one additional package and everything
else is working out of the box so like
many other bundles parcel is able to
apply transformation to the assets you
have in the project when building as
mentioned in the beginning
out-of-the-box parcel has already
support for many common transformations
and tons panels built into built into
the project and for example you can use
bubble to transform your script code you
can also use post CSS to transform your
CSS code and you can use post HTML to
trans
from your HTML code that are common
libraries which are often used to apply
transformations to to code and parcel
automatically runs those types of
transformations when the corresponding
module is available in the project so
you need to install it very npm again
and a small configuration file is added
but it's really a very small file we'll
see it in a minute and in the following
example we will discover how to use
parcel and how to setup a parcel for a
react project and of course in know a
react project is requiring about our
transformation to you to transpile the
react code into corresponding our script
code and we will set up a new project
and configure parcel to make use of
babel to do the necessary javascript and
JS x configurations which needed for
react so if you have been working with
react before you might know getting
started was react has always been a
difficult task when including the
corresponding webpack configuration for
example there have been projects like
crate reacted at the for example to make
it a little bit easier and to generate a
corresponding web pack configuration out
of the box however if your react project
is growing and becomes more project and
you want to include first built tasks
you have to do at some point with the
very complex web pack configuration and
was passed for now this is not needed
you do not need to use any script for
generating the bundle configuration we
can start right away and that is what I
will demonstrate now so let's begin with
a new project directory here for
we name it react so demo let's change
into that directory and use NPM in it -
why again to initiate this project
directory and add a package dot JSON
file so that is the first step in size
of the requirement we need to fulfill to
be then able to use NPM to add further
dependencies and now react to do need
the following dependencies first of all
I need to install the reactor library
itself and the way I can do it here is
viral NPM install - - safe react so this
is downloading react to the note on the
score modules folder adding it to
package dot Jason
next let's install in the same way react
- done then let's install the bubble
packages where we are need with NPM
install - - safe def this time and the
first package is called bubble - preset
- react
okay here we are and the second bubble
package is called Baba - preset - e and
B so here we are all the packages and
all dependencies have been added
successfully to our project and now we
are ready to go let's open the editor
again so here back and the editor let's
add first of all the small bubble
configuration file we do need in order
to make bubble work with parcel and the
file is called dot both are see so
within the file as a configuration code
is to follow as follows so we need to
say presets and then assign an array
here because we're using two presets
first a CMV and second is react so this
is all this is a configuration which is
needed just to tell possible to make use
of both packages now we can start to
create the application itself and first
of all we do need two more files here
and our project the first file is index
dot HTML okay and the second file we do
need is the corresponding Yahoo script
file let's say we name it app dot J s so
inside index dot HTML
I need the basic HTML structure but
before you see I met appropriation here
and the delete has the meta tags from
the head section change the title in
react castle demo in the body section
include div element with ID of app
assigned and script element to include
the app dot JS file ok so this is what
we need inside index dot HTML and now we
can continue to create our react
component in app dot J's
so first of all I need to import
statements first we need to import react
from react next I need to import react
down from react - top okay and then I
can create on the component class let's
name the component hello message and it
extends from react dot component so I
need to include on the render function
here and return the template code the
JSX code so let's say return and we are
returning a div element which includes
the text hello and then is printing out
the value of one component property
which is called name and I can access
this property by saying this dot props
dot name so this is reactor syntax j6
syntax
so closing the stiff-arm element here
and then finally here below the class
implementation I need to edit to my
website so that's the clear amount of
variable here and let's assign document
get element by ID and select the element
with ID app we just created and then use
the react dumb random asset to insert
the hello message component and I'm
supplying hello message here with the
component property name and setting it
to my name like so
okay here we are so this should know
output hello Sebastian and of course we
now need to start up the parcel
development web server again and then
check the output in the block so I can
start up the server again with parcel
and pass over as the entry point of our
application and again it's index dot
HTML starting up the web server at port
1 2 3 4 just copy that URL again just
check it here in the dist folder you can
see the bundle has been created index
dot HTML is waivable and now we can
check it in our browser if the react
application is working and you can see
it here is the dynamic output from our
react component is generated and
outputted in the browser so you can see
it the react application is working
without needing to include any special
complicated configuration like you would
need to do with web pack in our
application parcel makes everything very
easy and you can setup a react
application without all the hurdles
known from web pack so very great so
