marvel.com
and today in this video i'd like to give
you a short introduction to JSON server
with Jason server you will be able to
create a REST API is very easily so you
can setup a REST API your local system
and make it available for your front-end
development project so stay tuned ok the
first step we need to take is to install
JSON server globally on our system and
you can find the JSON server project
projects website here on github it's
available at the github calm tightly
code slash Jason - server and they're
here on the project home page you can
find some information about the project
you can find examples and explanations
of the functionality Jason server is
supporting and to install Jason Silva we
can make use of a corresponding and VM
package you can find it here it's Jason
- servers it's the name of the package
and if you want to install it you can
use the NPM command on the command line
so let's grab that here and to go over
to the command line and then I can pass
here NPM install - gee Jason - server so
we need to use the minus key option here
to install it globally on our system I
have already installed jason server so i
do not need to execute it to her right
now but if you have completed the
installation successfully you will get
the jason server command on your sister
so you can execute just chasing server
like so and you will see the command is
available and you can find here all the
options and usage examples of this
command ok so let's see how we can make
use of JSON server to publish a first
REST API on our system and what I would
like to do is to publish an API which
gives us access to employee data and to
do so let's first create another another
folder here let's name it employee
- employees - server then change into it
and let's create a file here in
employees server let's name it
DB Jason okay and let's start our code
editor I'm using Adam here so Adam is
starting up you can see it here and we
have one file here in the project folder
and let's define our API down the data
we would like to provide with that API
by using plain Jason syntax here in that
file so let's start so let's open a JSON
object by using curly braces here and
within that curly braces - let's say
that we want to have the employees and
property set here tu and array so I'm
going to use brackets here and that
array of objects should contain your
first employee object here and we will
use the following properties we'll give
it an idea that's one here in that case
then we will use the second property for
our employees object that
first name and I was added to Sebastian
okay let's use the third property here
is of course last name so that it came a
name here and let's use another property
maybe email and let's supply a value
here okay so that's the first object
now let's collect some more a second one
and a third one so let's change the IDS
here at t1 ds3 let's change the names so
let's use teeth Palmer and the email
address keys at coding the smart wacom
let's use some N Smith and it's n at
coding this mod wacom okay so here you
can see that's our content of BB Jason
one employees and D consisting of three
employees objects and now we can hand
over that file to JSON server to
automatically publish a corresponding
REST API okay let's change again to the
command line and now I will use the
Jason - server command and pass some
pass over two parameters the first one
is - - watch just that we started in
watching mode so it's watching four four
five changes and the second parameter is
a file and that's our JSON file so I am
saying DB dodge glazing and then hit
return and you can see it's starting up
the server
it is printing out that we have one
resource label and that our employees
research resource of course and the API
endpoint for a bet employees resource is
localhost port 3000 slash employees and
the server is available here on
localhost port 3000 and so let's check
it out we can go to the browser or a
opened up up here and you can see the
server is responding it's saying that we
have successfully started JSON server
and now we have our employees route
available here and I can click on it and
I'm directly initiating a get request to
that API endpoint and in return as the
response to that HTTP GET request I'm
getting back my JSON data structure with
all three employee objects as you can
see here
ok so let's increase the font size a
little bit so that you can better see
what the result here and another API
endpoint is created and we can initiate
a get request for example to one
specific record here and let's say we
would like to get the record with the
ERD 2 then i can extend my URL heap here
with a slash - and you will see ok
that's a result we are only getting back
one object and that's our record with ID
is equal to 2 okay another possibility
of sending a get request to JSON server
is that we can pass over URL parameters
and we can use all our properties as
parameter so let's say we would like to
to request the record which helped the
first name set to the bastion for
example so you can see that's the syntax
see I'm using so put a question mark
behind all the API endpoint and then use
the name of the property and then set it
to the value you would like to request
and as you can see here I'm requesting
the record with the first name set to
Bastion I'm getting back the record with
ID 1
another possibility is use the cube
parameter here and by using Q you can
initiate a full text that are searched
across all the properties so for example
we can say home let's say if I'm getting
back here just one record and that's the
record which have the first name set to
Steve I can although use of something
like code in the smart way and I'm
getting like all three records because
all three records are sharing an email
address with coding the smart way with
that text in the email address string
array so sending HTTP GET request is
very easy of course by simply using our
browser like we did it now but if you
want to initiate other types of HTTP
requests like delete requests posts or
put requests it's it's best to use an
HTTP client tool to do that and a great
deal which makes that very easy is
postman and you can find it here at get
postman comm you can see postman is a
free tool you can get it for a Mac OS
Windows Linux and you can get it
although as a crow
application so you can install it here
in your browser that the way I'm using
postman and with postman it's very easy
to send requests to our API endpoints
and here you can see that over UI
postman and let's do it again send a get
request to our employees and pause you
can see I've already entered the URL
here and I set it to guest get F the
HTTP request type and now I can hit on
buttons and I'm getting back the same
results like we saw before in the
browser okay now let's try out to
perform a delete request and I'm copying
that URL here again and then opening up
another tab here in the postman
application so passing in my URL and I
would like to delete the record with ID
1 so let's use one here in the URL and
here I need to change the type to post
to delete of course
so what's select delete and now let's
try it out send and you can see we get a
status code back with 200 ok so the
lilit request has been performed
successfully and account switch back
here to my get request it's still a
label here hit sent again and you can
see the record with ID 1 is armed gun ok
now let's try to again create a new
employee record by using a post request
so again I need that URL here a change
to a new tab passed in and now we would
like to perform a post ok to prate on
something and then I'm switching here to
of the body section and I need to set it
to a
and then we would like to use not only
text here but we would like to use JSON
code and I can take it here from from
the result so let's use 100 object
insert here remove the ID because JSON
server is assigning a new ID
automatically okay so let's change it
here let's create a new employee and I'm
using John at the first name let's say
last name is max fly and again the email
address is John net coding the smart
wacom okay so let's try it out hit Send
and you can see I'm getting back a
status code of 201 which means it's
successfully created and as a result I'm
getting back the new object and here you
need to notice that now I'm getting back
not only three properties I'm also
getting back the ID which has been
assigned automatically and it's over
four and if I now go back to my get
request here again perform it again by
hitting send you can see the new record
is a label in my arm in my database file
ok so finally let's use put a request to
update that new data set here so I take
it copy it here and then open again a
new tab sedative put changing to the
body section using the raw option again
setting it to Jason then entering my new
object here I need to copy that URL here
again and now I need to say slash four
at the end because
would like to update the record with ID
number for so and do not need to include
the ID here and let's change it back to
you my original employee record with my
name again and the email address like so
ok I need to remove the comma here on
the last comma and then I'm ready to go
let's click on send and you will see I'm
getting back status 200 which means it's
ok and the record has been updated
successfully you can see it here and we
can again go back to our get request and
just double-check it send it again and
you can see here is my updated record ok
so far we have entered the data which
was exposed by our API manually in a
JSON file in this case D BJT and this
pro approach however is if you need a
larger amount of data this manual
approach can be a cumbersome and an
easier solution to that problem of
generating a lot of a lot of data is
another third-party library which is
called fakir dot Jas and you can find it
here on the github project website and
with photo dot yes it's easy to generate
larger amounts of data and faker's dot
areas offers some data for various
entities as you can see here if you need
address data or company data and finance
data and so on
if we want to make use of fake IDs to
get
with Jason server we first needed to go
back to the command line and stopping
the server here for a moment and within
our employees our server directory I'm
initiating now a new NPM repository and
that is done by using NPM in it and it
is asking well some questions here and
we can just hit enter here to with
everything to the default okay so it's
generated now we have our package Dutch
JSON file and now we can add the faculty
is library to to our project here by
using NPM install faker with the name of
the library and now it's downloading the
package a at the library and installing
it into the node underscore modules
folder within our project folder and
next we do need another file so let's
say touch employees dot zjs and now we
can switch back to Adam and you can see
the file now is a label here and now we
can implement some JavaScript code to
make use of the various library and then
in the last step you will see how we can
hand over those JavaScript functionality
to Jason server and make use of the
automatic generation of data ok let's
first acquire on the paper dr. J's
library and assign
to variable called later so I will use
acquire and pass a number name Baker and
then let's define a function and the
function should be given the name let's
use generate employees l so this is
exactly L describing what does function
now should be doing okay
so within that function let's first
define an empty array array and let's
name it employees okay
and then we're using a loop here a for
loop to generate a 50 employee records
so let's use for VAR ID equal 0 ID osm
50 and ID plus plus okay within that
loop let's use the fakir library to
generate our fake data which we need for
every every object
so let's first generate the first name
and that can be done by using faker and
then using the name hand T and call the
method first name the same is done for
last name again faker dot name dot the
last name that's the name of the method
we are calling here and for email as
well this time we're using this on the
internet entity and calling the email
function okay like so and now we can
push a new object to our employees array
array and that
done by saying employees dot push and
handing over adjacent object here and of
course now we need our properties here
we need to be Rd then we need first
underscore name and we are assigning
first name then we need the last
underscore name property and we are
assigning last name and we need of
course a mail and we are assigning email
here ok so finally let's let's return
something for the function and we are
returning a JSON object which should
correspond to the structure of the JSON
object we have been using a in our file
DB dot JSON so we need to say here um M
employee as this should be the entity
and then assign the content of the
employees array ok and returns it ok one
thing is missing Jason server requires
asked you finally export the method
which is responsible for our fake data
generation exported here in our file and
that is done by using the following line
of code module dot exports equals and
now we need the name of our method which
is called generate employees okay so
that's the export statement we need and
now we can use that file together with
situation server and to do so let's
switch back to the command line
and then turn up the server again by
using the command Jason des - server and
now hand over our employees dossiers
file so it returned you can see the
server is starting up and once again
it's recognizing the employees entity
and ok let's switch affected postman and
check if our fake data generation is
actually taking place I will again
initiate that get request here so hit
send and now you can see this time we
are not only getting back three employee
data sets we are getting back 50 as you
can see I scripts I can scroll all the
way down and you can see packages is
making a great job of generating fake
data which looks like our original data
sets so this is a way you can combine
theta jf with Jason server to publish on
API a rest api with a lot of fake data
inside very quickly this was about them
