coding the smart way today in this video
I'd like to give you a short
introduction to a very new online IDE
you can use for angular and react
development and the name of that new IDE
is stack boots it's very powerful
edie ide which makes developing was
angular and react very easy because you
can start developing immediately you do
not need to deal with any configuration
and setting up the project so it's
really a powerful rde so let's take a
look at this new project so the IDE is
pro info at the following URL it's
stacked let's calm and the project has
been a launch bar all the guys from
sinks to Rio
so they really know what are the
features every developer would like to
have if he is working with nonlin IDE
and you can see here from the website
that says a start homepage it's very
easy to get going so you can start here
are totally for free and that does not
cost anything at the moment so and the
start page gives you three options
without needing to create an account
first you can start right away in your
project and it has three options here
you can see it's supporting at the
moment it's supporting angular which
time script react with Atma script at
6:00 and I own it was typescript of
course that are the three types of
projects you can create with stack beds
and if you click at one of those buttons
here for example let's choose the
angular option here you can see you're
taken immediately into the IDE
and you can start typing in code
immediately but we from doing so let's
first take a look at the main components
of this application so as you can see
some user interfaces split up into three
main areas one here at left the editor
area in the middle and the preview area
here at the right if we take a look at
the left side you can see this area's
split up it's a pre structure on here
and it split up into three main items
here we have the files view which can be
collapsed and expanded here which gives
you access to the file and folder
structure of your project so if I select
a file here for example index dot HTML
you can see this file is loaded for
editing in my editor I can go here into
the app folder and open another file for
example the app dot module dot TS and
you can see here is a corresponding
content of that file we do have the
dependencies section here which is at
the same time listing all the
dependencies which have been already
installed here for the project you can
see it here of course you can remove any
of those dependencies if you click here
on the dustbin icon but a very cool
feature is here it has an integrated
access to the node package manager and
you do not need to go to a command line
window also you can install and add new
dependencies and install those
dependencies by using the node package
manager in the background by simply
typing in the corresponding package name
here which is very cool and I can show
you for example we are going to add the
angular material library and the
corresponding package name is at angular
slash material here and I only need to
type it in here and then hit return and
you can see it's installing the
dependencies and then it's informing me
about the fact that we have we have an
unmet Peele dependency here because the
angular material really relies on the
add angular cdk library which needs to
be installed as well and I can solve
that issue very quickly because I only
need to click here on install missing
dependencies and you can see it's
installed in angular cdk as well and now
here in the list you can see the version
which has been installed for the angular
material library and the cdk as well
it's so easy to to deal with that
package management functionality here ok
then we have a settings option here you
can see so far that only one one setting
I can make I can delete this project
here of course I'm not deleting it earng
no because I'd like to show you some
some more features here from stack
Bloods okay so let's make some changes
here to the project to see how the IDE
is dealing with the changes so for
example we can go here to app component
HTML and maybe add a second paragraph
here so let's include a paragraph here
and then saying this is more text and
now I'm saving it and you can see it's
showing up the text immediately here in
my preview area and that Hills because
stack boards is supporting this preview
here with live reloading capabilities so
every time we are going to change
something and our coding it's reflected
immediately in the preview without
needing to
to reload that menu for example so I can
add more text here and you can say it's
changing the output again and I can see
it immediately reflecting the changes I
made to my source code here so it's very
easy I can open up this preview not only
here embedded in the IDE itself I can
open it in a new window for example you
can see it here so I clicked on the open
in new window button here and now you
can see I have the same the same output
here in my new window and now I can just
display those information here is side
by side to my editor okay like so you
can see I can change here again text
remove that text and you can see it's
reflected in this separate window as
well the same functionality okay I can
open up the embedded preview here as
well again okay and show you another
very cool feature you can use on the
share option here - to share your
project with other users and if I click
on share you can see the following
pop-up appears and it gives your arm
three different URLs you can use for
sharing for example we can use the
editor URL here you can copy it to the
clipboard and if I go here and paste
that URL and you can see it's opening up
the editor again ok but I can also use
it that app URL here that's the preview
if you can see here it's opening up the
application again
takes a second yeah okay here we are as
you can see it's loading again and the
other option I do have here is to take
the embed URL here and I can configure
exactly with the options I have below
what the embed URL should show to embed
a smaller preview of my project in my in
my website well let's say in my my blog
post for example on medium.com and that
is also a very cool teacher okay
another arm thing I'd like to show you
here is for example if I go to hello
component and if I start typing here and
then extend the hello component class in
class implementation a little bit by for
example adding another method here my
measured okay and then you can see a
very cool feature is the code completion
stack blitz offers here and it's a very
similar to and intellisense which is
supported by Visual Studio for example
we will studio code and it gives me a
list of suggestions based on my input so
far and always a default selection is
made that's so so to say the best guess
and I can simply click on return and
then my code is completed or I can
choose from the list here another item
for example now you can see it's saying
console and then I can enter dot here
and it gives me all the maths I can use
here yeah so you can see it's a very
very cool feature which makes developing
really easy
so step but it's an online IDE as you
can see because it's running on the
browser but it's not only an online IDE
and it's a progressive web application
and one characteristic of progressive
web application is that it keeps keeps
running and you can still use it when
your network connection your internet
connection is lost and just to show you
I have it running here and now I can cut
my network connection here so now I have
no connection I'm not online and you can
see the editor is still there and now
let's try to go to app dot component
HTML and for example add another line of
text here play like so and you can see
even the our development web server is
still running I have no active internet
connection it's updating my life preview
here and I can still continue
implementation and I will get will get
the preview updated here for all the
changes I made and you can see it's
still running here in a separate window
as well and it has been updated with
this new line of text as well so it's no
issue and now I can go can activate my
name my connection again and then stack
blades automatically in the background
takes care that all the changes I've
made so far are synchronized with the
server again so this was my short
introduction and demonstration of this
new online IDE stack plaits
I hope you enjoyed it I think it's a
very cool online IDE was a lot of
powerful features and if you are an
angular or react developer give it a try
try to bring your code
to stack put and see how it's working I
think it's absolutely worth it to try it
out and the developers already promised
to add Beauty I'll support in the new
future so I think it's a very promising
project and hope to see some more
features soon so stay tuned I hope you
enjoyed my videos here if you do please
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
also take a look at coding the smart way
comm and I hope to see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
