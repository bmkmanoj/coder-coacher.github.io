video I am going to show you how to use
f and statement with your C++ program if
and statement are also called
conditional statement because we use
ifelse statement to check some
conditions for example I want to check
the age of a person I can use if
statement to check the age of a person
using C++ so let's try to write the code
for if condition just declare a variable
called age and then I will output some
condition so I will say C out please
enter the age and then I will ask user
to enter the age so I will say C in age
okay now in order to check whether the
user has entered the right age I will
say if so this is how you can declare if
condition if and with the bracket and
then this curly bracket and in this
bracket you need to give some condition
so I will say if age is greater than 20
then I will print the statement that the
age entered the age is correct okay I
will just build the program
run it and I will enter age 28
they just fulfilling my condition which
is greater than 20 and when I press
Enter
it shows me the message the age entered
is correct
now if I enter the age which is less
than 20 then see what happens
13 and press Enter then this message is
not executed because this stick this
condition is not true now in order to
catch other condition other than this
condition which is there in if statement
use else statement and how we write F
else statement just like this so in an
statement this bracket doesn't come
because there is no condition it's just
guess it catching whatever this F is not
fulfilling or whatever condition this F
is not fulfilling so it doesn't require
any bracket so I will say in the else
condition the age entered is not correct
now when I run the program and if this
time I will enter the age which is less
than 20 then it will go the program will
go here and we will see age is less than
20 so it's not greater than twenties
then it will go to else condition and
print this message okay so this is the
sequence and it says ages age entered is
not correct right which is this
statement now there are other conditions
you can give in if statement this is
greater than condition you can give for
example equal to condition so you can
give equal equal to check the Equality
so note here we are not
giving one equal to sign we are giving
two equal to equally when you give equal
to that means you are assigning some
value and when you write two equal to
that means you are checking the Equality
okay so let's check I will just build
the program and run it and when I X and
the page is equal 20 which is the
correct condition and when I enter it it
says a J's correct now you can also give
greater than equal to so to check all
the conditions of the age which is
greater than equal to greater than and
equal to 20 so it has it will check all
the values which are greater than 20 and
equal to 20 right in the same way it
will you can also check less than equal
to but always remember that equal to
comes after these greater than or less
than sign you cannot write it like this
equal equal to greater than this doesn't
work you need to write greater than and
then equal to okay now you can also
write smaller than with which is which
will check whether age is smaller than
20 or not okay and the other conditions
you can write is for condition so if age
is equal to 20 or so we can check for
condition with this pipe symbol so 2
times this pipe symbol just give it and
just write or ages greater than
20 ok so this is just seeing whether the
age is equal to 20 or so age is greater
than 20 so if I enter the age is equal
to 20 it will execute this statement and
oh if I enter the age greater than 20
then also it will check it will execute
this statement because we are executing
our condition or means this or this
whatever condition is true it will
execute right so I will run the program
and I will let enter the age 20 which is
true and it says page is correct once
again I will enter the age 23 which is
greater than 23 and then also it says
page enter this correct I think I need
to build the program and then run it and
once again 23 and say wait age entered
is correct
okay in the same way you can check and
condition so for example I will declare
one more variable called int height okay
and I will tell the user to enter the
height also okay please enter the height
and I will just tell the user to enter
the height also so you will user will
enter age and height and then I will
give end condition and I will say if age
is equal to 20 and
height is equal to 100 centimeters then
tell me in this message or show me this
message age entered is correct age and
height entered is correct okay otherwise
age and height entered is not correct so
I will just save it and run build the
program yeah I forget equal to double
equal to n see what happened it's
showing me the message right so just
write double equal to here and build
your program and run your program and
this time I will enter the age is equal
to 20 and height is equal to 100 and it
says age and height entered is correct
or otherwise I will enter the wrong
value 25 or 45 on height is equal to 90
and you can see the age and height is
not correct okay so this and statement
checks whether this statement is true
and this statement is true so both
statement has to be true in this and
condition right so I hope you have
understood the concept of if conditional
statement and I hope you have enjoyed
