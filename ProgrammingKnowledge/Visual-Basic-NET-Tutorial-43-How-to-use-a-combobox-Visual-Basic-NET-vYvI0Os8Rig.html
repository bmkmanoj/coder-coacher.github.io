video I'm going to show you how to use
combo box with your visual basic windows
form application so let's get started
I'm going to take a combo box from my
toolbox and I will take a button and I'm
going to take our text box from here so
I have three items or three controls
first of all I'm going to change the
font size of these items I will select
all of them and I will go to the
property called font and I will change
the font from here okay now what I'm
going to do is let me change the text of
this button also so that it has the text
add items so why we use combo box combo
box generally we use for containing the
items different items or a list of items
right so one way of populating the list
of item in the combo box is directly
just select your combo box and the go go
to the property called items and just
click the small button and in here you
can add your items for example I want to
make a list of items for names so I will
write some names here I will write first
name and press Enter second name and
press Enter third name press Enter
both name and press Enter and in this
way you can make a list of items one by
one and when you click OK and when you
run the program
and when you see this list you are going
to see the list in here and whenever you
select any item from the list it's going
to be selected in here in the combo box
right so this is one way of populating
your list box the other way is
populating your list box at runtime for
example I want to populate my list box
whenever I enter some name in the text
box so how can we do this I will just
select my button and double click it and
in here I will write the name of my
combo box so I'm ruined
combo box one which is the name of my
combo box thought items dot ad okay and
what I am going to add here in this
bracket I will pass the argument text
box one which is the name of my text box
dot text right
so this line what this line will do is
whatever text I will add in the text box
it will add the item in the combo box
so let me demonstrate what this is doing
is for example I will add some names in
the text box and I will say add item and
when you see this here you see one more
item is added to the list here right so
in this way the items are added to the
combo box for example some new name
and I will add item and now it has one
more item so in this way you can add
more items to the list box by adding and
adding the items dynamically or at
runtime okay so let me get rid of the
collection which I have created here I
think I haven't deleted the connection
collection I will delete it and press ok
and let me check whether I have so now I
don't have any collection and I can add
some collection so some name some other
name so you can see items are added to
the list box right now for example
whatever item I select in the combo box
I want to show the message that this
item is selected so what I am going to
do is I am going to select this combo
box and double click it and in here I
will say message box dot show and in the
message box show argument I will pass
combo box
one which is the name of my fumble box
dot text ok and now when I run the
program first of all let me add some
names first name
second name third name 14 so I have some
names in the combo box for names or and
whenever I select some name from here
for example mark it will show me the
message box with the name mark okay and
I select some other name John and it
shows me the message box saying John so
in this way you can display the selected
item in the combo box right but some
more other time you also may want to
make this combo box non editable right
so just select your combo box and go to
the property called so just select your
combo box and go to the property called
drop Tom style and just select here
instead of drop-down just select drop
down list and this will make your combo
box non editable so what the non
editable combo box means is you cannot
enter any text here you can just see and
it just read only and you cannot enter
any item or any text here and when you
do it drop down it's like you can enter
some text manually inside this combo box
so in this way you can use combo box in
Visual Basic you can explore combo box
properties to change the its properties
and you can customize how you want to
use combo box I hope you have enjoyed
