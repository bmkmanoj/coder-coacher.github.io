last video I have shown you how to read
a zip file in this video I will show you
how to create a zip file by using Java
code so for example you have some file
and you want to make a zip file of that
file now you can make it I will show you
right now so what I have taken is one
button which we will press and make a
sip file when this button is pressed
this is the name of the button creates a
pipe and never equal to its action
performed
and in here what I have done is I have
already made made try-catch block so in
the action perform method just make
try-catch block and in the try catch
block we will write the code of creating
zip fight
so in this try-catch block right first
of all
I rename it by s45 input stream is equal
to if I input stream like a make it
closed and in double quote and in here
we will provide the path of the file
whose zip file we wanted to make so for
example I want to make the zip file of
this PDF this one ve 2:05 right so I
will go to its property I will copy its
path and my code and based upon Thea
and double slashes repairs
so
do this and in the second leg right yes
we made it
that I set or s watts with output stream
is equal to this one is about the speed
record that closed
Stream
like this
and in this packet what we do is we will
write W books and India driven write the
part of the five and the name of the zip
file where you want to make and create
your zip file so I will copy the same
part yeah
okay
I copy the same aunt once again and
paste it here and instead of this dot
PDF at last I will write the dot zip
file so this is the same name I want to
give to my zip file or I will change the
name so right so you will be able to
identify that fight okay so this is my
part of that input file stream this is
the PDF which I want to convert into zip
and this is the path and the name of the
zip file
okay so in the next line we will write
this is Erdos yes dot what
next entry and in the blankets light
and then my kids and in the blankets
yeah
you will make double quotes and the name
of the file you want to make the
surprise so thank you for example I want
to make the zip file of this PE 2:05
June so you know nine dot PDF so I will
copy the same name and paste it here
in the next plane right right
it's bad break it
right two zero one zero professor okay
and below that we it int variable called
this is variable and after that we will
make a while
so wild
this might read
is equal to
f is which is this variable firing input
stream not bleed in the packets right
ha ha
which is this value meaning
okay
and in here provide one more bracket so
this is to break it for a while
this is to break it for bite so this is
the bracket for why this is white and
this is buffer three brackets and after
two decades right here
and greater than zero
so while file bytes is greater than zero
what we will do is
right that my office for zip output
stream variable
right
in here before just this very opening
gamma 0 gamma this inter variable bite
the read in the next plane outside your
Y loop right that OS was so powerful ski
not entry and once again Claro s dot
fuels and then the next claim right yes
I just file input stream variable name
dot close
so I hope
our code is complete now and let's see
if we were able to convert a file into a
zip file or not so whatever we do is
right click in one file
and it is button creates a plane so I
press this button and I will go to that
folder created this zip file so yes my
zip file is created already so I will
double click it and extract the file and
see you can see your file inside the zip
folder the folder name is Maya file
which I have given and this is the point
provided so in this way you can create a
zip file any file using Java I hope you
learned something new this time please
