JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will learn how to use
events in JavaScript so first of all
what is an event an event can be an
action which is performed to do some
work for example you click some button
you hover over some HTML element or you
press some key right so let's see how we
can use events in JavaScript so for
example I will create a button element
here and I add our text here and as an
attribute of this button I will add an
event called on click ok so on click is
an event and when this button is clicked
I want to perform some action for
example I want to alert something right
now keep in mind here we are using
single code inside a lot for example
hello world and I think you may
understood this because we are including
alert in double quotes and if you use
double quotes here it will be not
escaped and it will create some problem
ok so let's save our code and refresh
our webpage and you see this button and
when you click this button it will show
you this message called hello world
right now for example I will create one
more item here for example it is a h1
tag and the ID of this h1 tag is for
example my ID okay and instead of using
this I can use this method in JavaScript
which is called get element by ID and
give your name of your ID which is my ID
and keep in mind just add this ID in
single quotes here right then dot inner
HTML
there is a method in JavaScript called
date and this returns current date and
time okay
so save your code and refresh your
webpage and once you click this button
it's going to give you the current date
and time with timezone here also now
there can be different type of event
which are possible and most common
events are these so on click we have
already used for example let's say we
are using on mouse-over okay so instead
of one click let's paste on mouse over
here save your code and refresh our page
and when you hover over your button not
click but hover over and it will show
you the result and once again when you
hover it will refresh the time right
you see it's refreshing the time in
second okay now instead of using this
JavaScript functionality here you can
use a JavaScript function so just add a
JavaScript function like this in the
script tag make a function called Show
and what it does is it's doing the same
job as this code okay so I'm going to
remove this code from here and instead
of this code I can call this JavaScript
function right save your code and
refresh your webpage and when you hover
over your mouse once again you see the
same result now for example you want to
show this time on this button itself
what you can do you can do something
like this so just copy this inner HTML
is equal to date and just write this dot
inner HTML is equal to date and save
your code and refresh it and when you
hover over it it will show the date on
your button okay so you can do this also
now to use this
on load event what you can do is you can
go to your body element and call this
onload event is equal to the function
for example we want to perform this
function okay so do this and then you
can remove this button because we don't
need it right now and save your code and
once you refresh your code it will show
you this date and time when your body
element loads now to use this on keydown
event what you can do here is instead of
a button you can use our input and this
input can be of type text and then you
can call this on keydown event here and
you can call this function to your own
keydown event so like this okay and save
your code and refresh your page and then
it will show you this right so whenever
you enter something in this input box
then your time will change right you can
see here okay now we must remove this
from here in order to understand it
clearly so once again refresh our page
and whenever you enter something it
refreshes your time okay so in this way
you can use these events in JavaScript I
