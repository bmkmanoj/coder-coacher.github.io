video I will show you how to get the
source code of a website using HTTP web
requests and HTTP web response in your
c-sharp application so let's get started
first of all we will take a button and
we will take a text box and we will take
a rich text box so this is a rich text
box and this button I will change the
text of this button and I will change it
as get source code when this button is
pressed it will give us the source code
of the website okay and this text box I
will use it for entering the URL of the
website so I will change the name of
this text box as text box URL and text
box URL and this rich text box will
contain the source code so let's get
started so just take these three things
a button a text box and a rich text box
and just click your button and double
click it and in here we will write our
code so first of all we need to import
some using derivatives so first using we
are going to use is using
system dot net because we are going to
use HTTP web requests and web response
so this will give you those classes and
second thing we are going to use is
stream reader so we will add using
system dot IO so add these two
namespaces and in your button click
event first of all what we will do is we
will declare a string you are L is equal
to the text box text so text box you are
dot text okay so this is the text box
name and this is the text which we are
using and then we will declare HTTP web
request first so write HTTP web request
and we will give it a variable name
request is equal to and we will cast
this request as HTTP web request once
again and then we will write
web web requests dot create so here you
write dot create and we will pass our
URL string here so we are passing of
whatever we enter in the text box we are
converting it into this string and we
are passing this string on URL to the
HTTP web request then we will create
over HTTP web response to write web
response response is equal to once again
we will cost our response and we will
write here this request here dot web or
dot get response okay now we have this
request and response and now we want to
transfer our source code or response to
the rich text box so how can we do this
we will create a stream reader so write
stream reader SR is equal to new stream
reader
and in the bracket we will pass this
response dot get the spawn stream and
break it closed and now we will pass
this stream to the rich text box so our
rich text box name is this text box one
dot text is equal to this stream reader
s r s r dot read to end because we want
to read till last and we will close this
stream reader once again so s stream
reader close okay so we are ready to run
the code this is the code for entering
the URL and getting the response flow
for the source code so let's try and run
the program so it's running and for
example I want to give the source code
of my website www.premierlawgroup.com
the website comes into this rich text
box so I just wanted to show you how you
can use these HTTP web requests and HTTP
web break response that's why I have
shown you this code
the simplest way to get the source code
is just go to the website and right
click and just click view source code
and you will be able to see the source
code of the website but I just wanted to
show you how to do it programmatically
that's why I have shown you this code so
I hope you have learned something new
this time please keep watching these
videos and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
