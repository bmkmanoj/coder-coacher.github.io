pages login page and employee info page
but we haven't run the program as a
whole so now we will try to run the
program as a whole when we try to run
the program the login ID when we fill
the user name and password and take log
login username and password is correct
but
don't windows sometimes shows Java ask
an exception not obese is locked you may
be wondering why this problem is coming
in our program I have a solution for it
and the reason for this problem is we
are trying to open to query blocks at
the same time one when we are logging in
a try to connect the database and then
when we press login
it tries once again connect to the
database from the employee table from
two G frames we are trying to connect
one single database and it could not be
done that's why this problem is coming
so simple solution for this problem is I
will show you
just
go to your methods and try to see
wherever you have made try catch blocks
and wherever you have tried to open the
query and make the connection with the
database after the catch you have to
write this log finally when the
parentheses try RS not close PS dot
close and then catch exception when you
write this after executing the query we
are closing the connection with the
database so it can be made ready for the
next connection so after every catch
statement you must write finally try
I've talked to those PS T dot close and
catch exception I will paste this
my turn of command in the description
below also so you can copy it directly
and paste it after every catch block now
you may be wondering in a big program
how could you find every catch statement
and it will be very difficult to find
each and every catch statement so what
you can do is just select catch go to
add it and just click find selection so
it will automatically find you the catch
no one and then when you press
next selection or f3 then it will go to
the next catch once again next catch so
you can find how many catches you have
an after country catch you should paste
this code block
okay in the employee info page also and
in the login frame also now once you are
done with this code then go to login
page click login and
go to simple formed you will come to the
method of logging button and here we
have written one if statement after this
query
and when our username and password is
correct it will show the message
username password is correct and it will
open the next day flame which is
employee info before employee info just
copy these two things RS door closing
VSD lock closed and just paste tear so
before opening the next day flip via
closing the connection with this
database right now so our connection
with database is closed here and once
again next employ info page it wants to
make the connection with the database
forge a table and jcombobox so the
database connection will be closed and
it can make the connection easily the
new window with the new window so let's
try to run our program
as a game name the username and password
and login username and password is
correct and Sui this time we don't face
any problem in our table shows the data
from the database and our combo box also
shows the data from the database which
are Paul and Mars so this was short
tutorial to avoid the database lock
problem in your program thank you for
watching please rate comment and
subscibe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
