video I will show you how to add a image
or a picture in your QT GUI application
so right now our form or window looks
like this and for example I want to add
a picture here in this area so that my
login looks much professional or much
better so how can I add a picture I will
show you now so go to your widgets and
take a label digit from here drag and
drop to your form and just resize it
according to the size of picture you
want to add in this label so just resize
it and then just go to the property and
you can change the name of object name
of this label so label pick for example
and this text which is showing text
label I can remove this also because I
don't need this so I can just go to text
and I remove it okay so and now I have
blank empty label so there are two ways
of adding the picture to your label one
is directly through the code and other
is the automatic method which I will
show you later
so right now go to your code section
just click this add it and just go to
the CPP file of your page or your form
or your UI whatever you say just go to
your CPP file of your UI and go where
you find this UI arrow point set setup
UI bracket this just below this code you
can define your picture so for example I
will write here a declaration called Q
fix map and give it a variable name for
example fix bracket and break it closed
why it's not showing so my keyboard was
wrongly set that's why I cannot type now
in this bracket we will pass the path of
the picture you want to show ok so just
write Q picks map and give it a variable
name and in here give these double
quotes and then copy the path of the
picture you want to show so I will copy
the path of my picture and I will paste
it here and I will make these slashes
forward slashes and now I will give the
name of the picture which is login dot
PNG file right login dot P and G and now
this makes a pics or q pixmap variable
and i simply add this pics to my labels
so what I will do is I will write UI
then I will search for my label which
was label pick and then I say set pics
map okay
and in this bracket we will pass this
pics variable okay
so just add these two lines of the code
just below your UI setup UI wherever you
find this okay and now we will build our
project and run our project save all the
files why it's giving me wrong
so I write build this project now it's
building okay and I will run this
project so you will see a picture is set
to my label like this okay so this is
one way of setting the picture so when I
just comment these two lines of code and
once again run this application again I
cannot see now the picture so my code is
working I I know that right
so one way of doing or setting the
picture to the label is by code and I
will show you the other way now just go
to your project dot UI whatever your UI
file is just select your label within
which you want to set the picture and
then just go to the properties and in
here search for this pic map and just
click it and click this combo box
and select this choose file option and
from here you can select the picture you
want to show so I wanted to show this
picture so I will select this and I
click open and you can see this picture
is set to my label automatically so this
is the other way you can choose to set
the picture or image to your labels so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
