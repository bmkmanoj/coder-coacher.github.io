tutorial on android app development for
beginners in this video we will see how
we can create a text file and save it
into the internal storage of your
Android device so there are two ways you
can save a file in your Android device
one is in the internal memory and other
is the external memory so in this video
we are going to see how we can save a
file in a in the internal memory okay so
what I have here is I have two buttons
one is to read the text file and one is
to write to the text file and I have one
edit text here and one large text this
added text I am going to use to enter
some text to save and this large text I
am going to use to retrieve the data
I have saved okay so let's get started
first of all I am going to create some
method so I will go to the text area
here and for the button to which is for
reading I'm going to add a attribute on
click and the name I will give it here
is read okay and same I will do for the
write button so instead of read here I
will just write write okay
now I will go to the main activity dot
Java file here and in here first of all
I will declare two variable one for text
view and other for edit views so added
text
now I will cast these two variables
you
now after casting these two variables
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create two method one to read and one to
write right
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go to my write method and inside my
write method I'm going to create a
variable called my text message for
example and I'm going to extract the
text from the text add it and pass it
into this variable so I will take my
edit text variable from here paste it
here dot get text and dot to string okay
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create an instance of file output stream
which we can use to output to our text
file right so file output stream the
object name is equal to open file output
and then gave the name to your text file
for example my text dot txt and then
give the mode so for example mode I am
going to give it like for example mode
private ok and this mode private
indicates that no other app can use this
file other than your app ok so it's
private to your app now you can see here
it's going to give you this red line and
this red bulb and it says you need to
surround your code by try-catch block
because it can through so just click
surround with try-catch and everything
will be good to go now take your object
which is file output stream and then
just call a write method on it and then
we will pass our string here in the form
of bytes so my text message dot get
bytes okay and this is also going to
throw an exception so you need to add
one more a catch Clause so just click
this red bulb and just add a catch
Clause here ok now once you are done
with this once you have written to the
file you need to close the file so take
your file output stream and close it ok
and after closing you may want to show
that your file is saved
so you can call a toast dot make text
and then the context and then you can
give some text for example text saved
okay and then the length of your text so
for example toast length long dot show
okay and you may also want to clear your
added text after writing to the file so
you can just use added text dot set text
and set an empty string here okay when
you want to read a file this time you
want to use our object of the class
called file input stream okay
so file input stream is equal to new
file input stream and give the name of
your text file which is this one my text
dot text right
or if you have provided some location
give the location of your text file and
close it okay and now this time also
it's going to give you this red line
here because you need to enclose it in
that try-catch block okay now after this
you need to have input stream reader
input stream reader object is equal to
new input stream reader and then you
need to pass your file input stream to
this intro stream reader object okay the
third object you need is buffer reader
okay so just use bufferedreader
bufferedreader object is equal to new
buffer reader and pass your interpose
stream reader in this constructor here
and then last thing we need is string
buffer is equal to new string buffer
and one more variable we need is a
string because we want to read this a
text line by line in a variable and this
will store these lines this variable
lines for example ok now I'm going to
create a while loop here and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to just write
lines is equal to your buffer reader
name dot read line and then enclose all
this into one more bracket so here one
more bracket and here one more bracket
and then just write not equal to null ok
and close this while loop and once again
you will observe here that it's going to
give you this red line and this is
because we need to add this catch Clause
here and it will go ok after this you
just need to take your string buffer and
append these lines into this string
buffer so append and then line and then
we are reading these lines one by one so
we need to give the line break also here
right so just give backslash n now once
you have all this string what you can do
is you can show it into your text view
so just use this text view here dot set
text and take your string buffer and
then give to string ok now I think one
thing we are missing here is instead of
using file input stream we must use open
file input right so instead of file
input stream just replace it with open
file input here like we have done here
for the open file output right so let's
run our code and now our app is running
so I can write something here
so for example this
and when I click the right button here
it's going to write this to our text
file and we can see text save message
here right and whenever we want to read
it we can just click this read button
and it's going to read this text and
show it into the text view okay once
again some random text I'm going to
write so this is some random text and I
click right and it's saved and now I can
read it by just clicking this red button
and it reads it and display it here so
in this way you can create our text file
and write it into the internal storage
of your device using Android I hope you
