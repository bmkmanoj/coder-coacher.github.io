show you how you can download and
install latest version of Ubuntu on
VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a virtual machine on which
you can install any operating system if
you have its ISO file and you can run
this operating system on this virtual
machine and you can run it on any other
host much machine so you can run your
native machine for example I am running
Windows as my host and using VirtualBox
I can even use Ubuntu using this
procedure right so let's see how we can
install Ubuntu on VirtualBox
first of all search for Ubuntu on your
favorite browser and the first link will
be from ubuntu.com go inside this and to
download the ubuntu iso file which we
need to you know install it on a virtual
box you can go to desktop and you can
just click get open to now and in here
you can choose the flavor of Ubuntu
64-bit or 32-bit so it depends upon your
you know computer which type you have
64-bit or 32-bit I have 64-bit operating
system so I'm going to download 64-bit
and click download and once you click
download you can just see this page and
if you don't want to donate anything for
the first time it will ask for the
donations it's totally you know on you
if you want to donate or not you can get
it for free and now you can just click
this download button and you're open to
ISO file will be downloaded ok so I have
already downloaded this file this file
is around 800 to 9
100mb so it will take some time to
download so just wait for the download
to complete and once you have downloaded
this file iso file let's see how it
looks like and it will look like this
okay so it's iso file when i go to the
properties i can see it's an iso file
and now what i'm going to do is i will
fire up my virtual box and i'm going to
click this new and in here I'm going to
write Ubuntu and I can choose the
version of Ubuntu from here because I
downloaded 64-bit I can choose with this
drag or combo box from here and now I
can click Next and here you can choose
the memory size for example I am going
to choose 2 GB of memory for this
operating system next this is the hard
drive option you can create virtual hard
drive for this virtual machine or
operating system the minimum requirement
or recommended is a GB so let's create
and just click Next and we want the
physical hard drive to increase
dynamically so click Next and this is
the minimum amount of you know memory
you want to give to this operating
system the default is 8 GB but you can
increase it to up to 20 20 or whatever
you know your computer allows and click
create and you will be able to see this
Oh open to virtual machine is created on
your VirtualBox so once your virtual
machine is created what you can do is
you can click the settings select your
virtual machine and go to settings and
in here you can see you can change the
processors so your machine can use so
you can increase this process
for example I want to allow two
processors to be used by this Ubuntu
operating system on virtual machine and
you can even choose your you know
display settings you can use a storage
or your network serial port settings
from here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go to storage and for giving
the file path for the ISO you can go to
this controller ID and click empty and
from here you will be able to see the
small CD button and click the CD button
and choose virtual CD / DVD file and
then choose your ISO file which you have
downloaded and click open and click OK
once you have done that just click start
and it's going to start your virtual
machine which is open to in our case ok
so it's going to start
now you will be able to see this setting
or installation wizard kind of thing and
in here you can choose the language in
which you want to install Ubuntu I want
to choose English and then choose
install Ubuntu and now it will say
preparing to install Ubuntu and these
are the requirement which are already
fulfilled so that it can download any
extra you know software you can choose
install third-party software download
and up to update while installing and it
requires at least 6.5 we have already
assigned 10 GB so it's fulfilled and the
power source is plugged in so everything
is ok click continue and in here this is
interesting and confusing it's going to
tell you if this computer currently has
no detected operating system what would
you like to do and by default it's
selected that erase disk and install
Ubuntu this is properly safe or totally
safe to choose this option because it's
a virtual machine it's not running on
your hard drive so this is OK for this
installation so leave it as default and
click install now and now you can choose
your location where are you located and
click continue and here you can choose
the keyboard layout which you want to
have ok by default it's English us but
for example my keyboard layout is German
so I am going to choose German from here
and just click continue and now you can
give the name to your computer for
example programming
knowledge and you can define the
password for your virtual machine and
then you can confirm your password and
then continue now the installation
started and it's going to take some time
so just leave it as it is it will take
around 10 to 20 minutes to install
Ubuntu on this virtual machine so just
take a rest and leave your machine for
20 minutes you need don't need to do
anything else I think for this
installation just leave it as it is and
it's going to install so now Ubuntu is
installed in my system and it says
installation complete so I just need to
click this restart now and it's going to
restart my open to virtual machine and
once it's restarted it's going to ask
you for the password and then you can
log-in in your operating system and then
you can start using Ubuntu so let's wait
so now open to has been started you just
need to give your password which you
have given at the time of installation
and now you can hit enter to login so
you are successfully login and now you
can start using Ubuntu so in this way
you can install Ubuntu on VirtualBox I
