tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video I am going to teach
you about variables so I am going to
teach you what are variables and how we
can declare variables in C and how we
can use them so first question is what
are variables variables are nothing but
the data holder or you can save values
in a variable so it just like you want
to save your age in some place you can
store it in a variable and then you can
extract your age using this variable
also now
variable has two different things one is
called data type for example int int is
an integer and then the name of the
variable for example age and then you
give a semicolon here and this is the
Declaration of the variable
now what this the variable means is we
want to declare a variable called age
age is the name of the variable and int
is the data type data types is the type
of data this variable is going to store
so it is going to store integer in our
case then it's initialized by this data
type called int okay now you can assign
some value to this age for example age
is equal to 21 and then you can print
this age by printf function for example
the age is percentage D which holds
integer value and then comma and then
the variable name which is age okay and
when you compile and run this program
it will show you the age is and whatever
the age value is which is 21 in our case
right and you can see this
the age is 21 so once again the variable
are used to store some value okay now
there are some rules for declaring the
variables also for example you want to
store the variables using some number
starting with a number then you cannot
do this so these are some rules I will
just enclose them in the comments so
that they are not executed the rules are
your variable name cannot start with a
number okay so for example you want to
start your variable with a number it's
invalid the number must not be there or
at the initial place okay so whenever
you compile this program it will give
you an error because your variable name
starts with a number but it can end with
a number or the number can you know come
in between your variable name it will be
totally fine because what's the problem
here yeah this age I will just comment
this out because age I haven't declared
it yet right so it is totally fine to
have numbers in between your word but
your variable name cannot start with a
number
okay the second rule is your variable
name cannot have spaces for example you
want to declare a variable called any
age for example with a space in between
so this is invalid you cannot have
spaces in your variable name right the
third rule is you cannot start or use
any special character for example dollar
you want to use dollar to initialize the
variable name it's not allowed or you
want to use s --tx in between your
variable name it's also not allowed okay
so avoid using special characters in
Able's but it's totally fine to use
underscore underscore is an exception
which you can use as a special character
in between your name so for example my
underscore age is totally valid variable
them okay the fourth rule is always
avoid to use special function names for
example main is the function already
declared in C if you want to declare
main as your variable name it's okay but
it will create conflict in C because C
will think that this is a function name
and you have declared it as a variable
name so it will give you some conflicts
and in the warning also when you compile
this program it says main is usually
used as a function so avoid using any
special function names in as a variable
name okay so these are some rules for
the variable names and you can also
initialize your variable like this 21 it
is totally fine whenever you declare
your variable you can at the same time
you can initialize it by this equal to
sign okay and whenever you build and run
it will run totally fine now there are
different type of variables I will just
run this program and then I will show
you what are different type of variable
name which are very basic to see so you
can declare integer variable names for
example you want to declare decimal
point variables you can do it with the
data type float so float you can use to
store some floating point value or a
decimal values for example pi pi has the
value for example 3.14 and whatever
so it is a decimal value you can store
this decimal values using a data type
float okay now in order to store a
character you use care and care you know
you can name it as my underscore care
it's totally fine is equal to any
character for example and always
remember that whenever you want to store
a character you store it in single
quotes okay so do it like this and it's
totally fine and the fourth type is
which is very basic is double double is
also a datatype and you can say this is
a big pi value is equal to 3.14 and
whatever is the value of pi big float
value so these are the four basic data
type you can use in C there are other
data types but these are the most basic
data type you can use to declare
variables in C now I think that's it for
this video I hope you have understood
the basic concept of variables and I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
