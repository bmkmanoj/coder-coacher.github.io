video I am going to teach you what our
function templates and how we can use
function templates in C++ so first of
all what are templates a template or
templates are the foundation of generic
programming so for example you want to
make your program more generic in order
to you know increase the usability of
the program then you use templates so
let me give you an example for example I
want to make a function which adds two
values okay so this is simple you can
make a function which will return an
integer and we can add for example in a
comma int B so we are passing two
arguments to the function and we just
return return a plus B this is simple
right so we are making a calculator we
want to make some function which
calculates the addition of two values
and we can do it like this and in our
main we can just call two variables for
example in X is equal to 36 for example
in Y is equal to 46 and you can just
output this like this C out and then you
can call this add function this is
really simple stuff and you already know
I think what I am doing
right
and I'm just calling this function and
then I will just end this and this will
give me a result right so let me run
this program compile and run so run the
program and it gives the answer but for
example you want to add so this is
adding integers right you cannot use
double values of four float values or
even string values with this function
right because this is the data type is
fixed in this function okay so suppose
you want to make a generic calculator
and you want to make a calculator or
function like this that it can accept
float double and any other integer
values so what you can do you can just
overload this function for example with
float for example load load load and
here double for example double double
double and this is also fine this will
you know achieve the purpose of making a
single function generic but it's taking
too much lines of code and it's it makes
your code lengthier right now in order
to make this function really generic we
can use templates and this is the whole
purpose of template to make a function
or generic so what we can do is we can
use a keyword called template just above
the function name and then in this angle
brackets you can just write class the
keyword and then name of your type this
is user defined names
for example I give my template class
name data type this is given by me okay
and what you just need to do you just
need to replace your data type which is
int in our case int int int with this
dotted line this copy this paste it here
paste it here
paste it here and this is the simple
definition of our template okay and what
this is doing is it's just a telling c++
that we want to make this function
generic using template and this data
type which we are using in here will be
replaced by the initialization which is
given to the function okay and let's
build our program and run it it will
still give the answer now for example we
are adding two integer right now and we
can change it to double values double
double and we can make it for the six
points some decimal points for the six
point some decimal points compile it and
run it it gives the answer okay or you
can even make it float on any other
values and it will give your result so
this type of template function templates
can make your function really general
generic and you don't need to you know
invest your time in rewriting the same
code again and again unless and until
the purpose of this code is same right
now there is a one little restriction
when you use this template not a
restriction but you can work around with
but in this particular condition there
is a restriction that if you define this
data type here here and here this data
type is same type type type type right
you cannot use int here and so now X is
an integer and Y is a double value but
here we have defined that template will
be this data type which is same here
data type data type data type and data
type which is of same type so we cannot
pass two different data type to a same
function okay so it has to be similar
data type
if you define double then all the
function argument takes double values
double and double or if you define or or
if you want to give integer values to a
function you can just define two integer
values let's see what happens when we
compile this and it gives the error and
what is the error let's see what is the
error and the error say is no matching
function to call add int and double
right so always remember when you a are
using templates like this which in which
you are passing two data type in s in in
here and in here you just need to give
the same data type or pass the same data
type to your function okay there is a
other ways of passing multiple
parameters to a function using template
and that I am going to show you in the
next video so stay tuned and please rate
them as a prime and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
