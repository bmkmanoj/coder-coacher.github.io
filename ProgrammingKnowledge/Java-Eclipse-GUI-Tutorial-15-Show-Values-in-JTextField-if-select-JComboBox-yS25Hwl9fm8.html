all I want to apologize for the absence
of audio in the last video on eclipse
GUI application there was some problem
with my microphone and now I have fixed
it so you will be able to hear my voice
now so in the last video we have seen
how to link a combo box with the
database values right so I linked this
name column with a combo box and I
populated names all the names from my
database or all the names from the names
column in my database to my combo box
now in this video I will show you how
you can transfer the respective value
for example I select some name here and
all the data related to Juli for example
should appear in this textbox so how you
can achieve this using your Eclipse cuy
I will show you so what I am going to
show you whenever you select some item
in the combo box the corresponding value
for example the employee ID of Juli the
surname of Juli and age of Juli will
appear here and similarly it should
happen for every name here so how you
can achieve this I will show you in this
video so let us get started first of all
what you need to do is just go to your
combo box and select your combo box and
double click it
and once you double-click this combo box
you will be able to go to the source or
not so if it does not go to the source
code what you need to do just
right-click it and just go to add event
handler and go to action performed ok
and then you will reach to the action
perform method of this combo box ok now
in here what you need to do in this
action perform method of this combo box
you need to add the code so that it
lessens for or it's it listens for the
selected item in the combo box and then
on the basis of that selected item we
will show the mesh show the values in
the j-2x peels right so what I am going
to do is I am going to take this sample
try-catch block which we are using for
now very long for now I think and this
is a sample code I have been using in
last few videos now right so in this
combo box button click event or action
perform event I have this try catch
block which I use to catch any exception
if any exception occurs and then I have
this very string in which I pass some
query and then I create a prepared
statement and I pass the query to the
connection of prepared statement and I
execute this query ok so I am going to
use this and at the end of after
executing this query I just close this
preparedstatement connection right so I
am going to use the same thing but in
here I am not going to use this execute
p st dot execute but because I will
change the I will change this query
first of all let's see what will be the
query in our case to select all the
values from the database so just Y
select star or all from your database
right so database name in our case is I
think employee info right so you need to
write the name employee info this is the
table name right and then we need to
give the clause where because combo box
is populating a name column field right
so we are going to use name as our
condition okay so we are going to use
name so where name is equal to and
whatever is the value in the combo box
we will give as a name but for now I
will give this question mark here and
then we will fill this question mark
with the code then we pass this query to
the prepared statement with the
connection connection dot prepared
statement worried and after that we want
to execute this query right but first of
all what we are going to do is
we will pass the value from the combo
box to the query right so in here
instead of this question mark I want to
pass two value which I get from the
combo box so I will write PST PST dot
set string
set string and the first argument is the
index so we only have one value to fill
in here so index starts from 1 and the
second argument is the item which is
selected in the combo box so let us see
how we can pass this item okay
so our combobox name is this one
combobox name right so just copy the
name of the combobox
dot then we need to have the selected
item so just right get selected item
okay and this selected item will return
you the index oh sorry
the object which is selected so this is
not a string but this second argument of
PST expects a string you see when you
hover over here it expects a string as a
second argument but what this combo box
name dot gets selected item will give
you it will give you an object so we
need to typecast this object to the
string so how you can do it just enclose
this
this enclosed this combobox dot get
selected item in a bracket and then or
you do not even need to do this
you just need to write
little bracket in front of this combobox
name dot get selected index and just
here we will type cos this object to
string so just right string okay and
what this bracket string will do is it
will convert your object which you are
getting from combo box name dot get
selected item to the string that is why
we are typecasting it to the string now
in the next line we will execute the
query so what we can do we can write and
because this is a select query we have
to we are expecting some results so we
need to write result set
resultset
rs
is equal to p st dot execute very okay
and then whatever result we get in this
rs object we will iterate through this
buy while loop while RS dot next
and while until and unless we are
getting the values we will trade through
the while loop and is showing error
okay we will see this error
afterwards but yeah so in this while
loop what we need to do is we need to
get the values right from whatever on
the basis of selected item so what we
need to do is just copy just copy for
example right now I will comment this
because I need to go to design view so I
will go to the design view
and if if this error if you see this
error kind of thing what you need to do
is just click this repass some
until and unless you see your design
okay
so just click this free pass
we pass we pass until and unless you see
your design
okay so what we need to do here is we
need to copy first of all this the name
of this textbox field from employee ID
which is Eid text a ID go to a source or
go to the action perform method of this
which we are writing the code in
and in here we have written this while
loop right and now what we need to do
here is we need to pass the values which
we are getting after executing the
command to the textbox so just write the
name of the textbox dot set text set
text and the argument here will be the
column name okay so what what is the
column name in the database we have I
will open it
and let us see what is the column name
we have
so the column name we have in the
database is Eid okay so you need to
write the column name here because we we
are transferring this value from this
column to the Eid textbox right ew d in
the same way you need to do this the
same thing for name so name will come
here and surname surname will come here
and age you see e ID name surname na
this has the same name as my column
names okay
age and this these text field name will
also change so for the text field name
for this for this name will be let us
see what is the text field name of the
name text field text field name we copy
this and paste it here and then the
cortex field name for surname I will
copy the name surname text field name or
variable name and then I will take the
aged text field name okay each X field
name
this will come here okay
so after you get these value it will be
set to your set to your this one text
boxes and then it will give you the
result so I think this is the code you
need to write in order to transfer the
selected value from the combo box the
response corresponding values to the
text box and let us see why this is
showing us error syntax error
and complete statement
let me see what is the error here
okay so this error is while should be
like this with small letter not with the
capital letter that is why it was
showing Java is a case sensitive
language so just remember that the DS
key word are case sensitive so you
cannot write capital W and H I le you
need to write in this format okay so
this is the code you require to transfer
the value let us try and run the code
and let us see if it gives us the result
required result do you see
as soon as you run the program it has
transferred the values or whatever
because here is selected mark so
corresponding values to mark will come
here so for example I select mark or
okay so it is showing a ID name surname
and age so this this is wrong let us see
why we are getting the problem here
because we are just setting these string
to these text boxes but we need to
transfer the results so I have forget to
transfer the result of Eid I am directly
doing this as a string so what we need
to do is just write our F dot get
string okay and this e ID will come here
as an argument
okay
got it from here I
as an argument
and the same
will happen for the name surname and age
okay
so just remember these things
and here as an argument
the surname will come
surname and here as an argument age will
come
okay now I once again run my program I
will run my program
and now you see the right values to the
selected name already here is marks to
the corresponding value to mark s coming
here is employee IDs one his surname and
his age you can check with the database
values if it they are true or not or you
can check from this table also the mark
name has employee ID one surname is this
one and age is this now we have select
the other name for example John you see
all the values corresponding to John
comes here once again Peter all the
values corresponding to Peter transfers
here or Jonathan all the values
corresponding to Jonathan comes here so
in this way you can write a code to
select any item from the combo box and
show the corresponding values in the
text field ok I hope you have enjoyed
