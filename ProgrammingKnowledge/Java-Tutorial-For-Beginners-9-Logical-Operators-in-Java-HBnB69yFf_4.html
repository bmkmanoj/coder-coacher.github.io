tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how to use if statement in Java and we
have also seen how we can use relational
operator inside our if condition now in
this video we will see how we can use
logical operators in or with our if
statement so what are logical operators
first of all so for example you want to
evaluate more than one conditions using
a single if statement how you can do it
you can not simply do it like for
example I want to check the scores of
the student in some particular subject
so in subject 1 a particular student
scores 40 and subject to a particular
student the same students scores 60
marks and I want to check whether these
two conditions are true or not so I want
to check if the subject 1 marks is
greater than or equal to 35 and I want
to also check if he has passed in second
subjects so I want to check similar kind
of condition with the second subject now
using logical operators you can check
multiple conditions inside single if
statement so how you can do it first of
all there are two kind or third kind is
also possible but most basics are two
kinds of logical operators first is a
and operator
so these double ampersand shows the end
operator and the second type of operator
is called
or operator okay so second type is
double pipe and this is called or
operator or okay and this should be an
operator I can make it bold now
using and operator as the name suggests
it checks to condition wherever it's
used for example we use this and
operator we can define two conditions so
first condition is this one which is
subject 1 math should be greater than or
equal to 35 and let's put them inside
the bracket so there will be no
confusion and the second condition we
want to check that subject to mark
should also be greater than or equal to
35
right so using this end operator we are
checking both the condition so an
operator whenever you use you check
first condition and the second condition
right so whenever you run the program it
checks both the condition so it says the
condition is true okay we can also add
else statements else and we can just
write the condition is false if this is
not true right
so here false so for example I want to
check or I will change the value of
subject 1 for example 20 right now the
subject 1 value is not greater than 35
but the second condition is true subject
to value which is 60 is greater than 35
so only one condition is true in this
case and the other is not true right so
try to run the program and it says the
conditions false so the and operator
evaluates all the condition in the if
statement this and this right and in the
same way you can add multiple and
operators like this so you can just need
you just need to add in this and and you
can evaluate this condition then and
other condition then and other condition
right so in this way you can evaluate
multiple conditions using this and
operator now our operator is as the name
suggests is it checks for either one of
the condition should be true so either
this should be true or this should be
true so at least one condition is true
then it will execute the statement in
the if statement for example right now
this condition in our case is true
because subject to has 60 60 is greater
than 35 this condition is true but this
condition is false because subject 1 is
equal to 20 which is not greater than 35
so only one condition is true in this
case and when we run the program it says
why it says because here we need to add
this or operator here right once again
run the program and it says the
condition is true right so this or
operator checks only one condition or
checks for both the condition and if
only one condition is true also it will
just execute your step inside your if
statement so or means just checking
either I mean if this or this is true if
we execute the statement but in an
statement all conditions should be true
this and this right this is the basic
difference in an operator and
or operator now for example I have both
the condition Falls for example this is
25 so student 1 is also not passed and
student 2 is also not passed because
both are below 32 then the condition is
false in this case so using our operator
we are checking even one condition is
true then it will print this but in this
case both condition are false
that is why it is printing this one so
in this case in this way you can use
logical operator with if statements so I
