last two videos we have seen how to use
basic functions and how to use functions
with arguments and in this video I am
going to show you how to use a function
that returns some value okay so for
example I want to perform some more
actions on the basis of the result of my
function so for example I have this
these two numbers which I can add using
this add function which I have shown you
in the last video right so I can add two
numbers but I want to somehow use this
with that result and I want to perform
some more tasks with the result of this
function how can I do it for example I
want to add these two numbers 899 and
thousand for example so add 899 plus
thousand and I want to multiply this
this number which is a result by the
addition of these two numbers right by
the addition of these two numbers so how
can I do this if I use the simple
function with the argument
I cannot achieve this and why I cannot
achieve this because if you just want to
echo these numbers you don't have a
result right
unless and unless you you have some
variable and you save that this
somewhere right so I want to achieve
something like this I want to add these
two numbers using this add function and
add these two number using this function
but I also want the product of this I
cannot do something like this this
multiplied or multiplied by this and for
that so this is not valid right so for
that what I need to do is I need to
return a value and store it in some
able and then do the performance or do
some some kind of operation like this so
let's see how we can do it I will just
delete it and so we are adding these two
numbers but I want to the value of the
result so that I can perform further
actions so what I can do is I can
declare one more variable called result
is equal to is equal to number one and
number two right now this has the value
of the result and somehow I want to get
the value of this result in the case of
this and in the case of this so what I
can do is I can return this result
return result so that I can store this
result in some other variable and I can
perform some action right so now it's
returning something so how how can we
achieve this kind of a goal what we can
do is we can have for example a variable
called add one is equal to which gives
the addition of this these two numbers
899 and thousand okay and what this
return is doing here is it's taking 899
here thousand here it adds this these
two numbers and whatever result it's
returning
from this function so what this will do
here is its returning the sum of these
two numbers and we'll assign this result
in this add one variable in a similar
way I can declare a second variable
which will add my these two numbers so
for example two thousand and eleven
hundred okay okay now I want the product
of these two numbers so what i can do i
can simply echo echo the product of add
one because it has the result of
addition of these two add one x add two
and basically i get the result like this
okay so by returning the value you can
assign your result in some other
variable like this okay i will save it
and basically let's echo this also
echoed this addition I want to echo
addition one and with a break PR and I
want to echo addition to also with a
break but the parameters will need this
so we know that the addition of these
two number is what an addition of these
two numbers what and then I want to
print the product okay save it and I
will run this and there is some mistake
somewhere let's see where so yes I
forgot this dollars in good
okay now it should run and I don't need
to give any spaces in right and now I
will run and you see the addition of
thousand and 899 is one eight nine nine
addition of two thousand and eleven
hundred is 1100 is thirty one hundred
and product of 899 and thirty one
hundred is this one why so in this way
you can return value using function and
assign it to the other variables and do
some other tasks with it so I hope you
understood the concept of return in
functions I hope you enjoyed this video
