video I am going to show you how to use
je tabbed pane in your Eclipse GUI java
application so first of all in what
cases we can use j-dub pain whenever you
have a concise space for example this
tab this term so je tabbed pane is
working like this it has some tabs and
under each tab it has some its own
functionality okay so this login tab has
the code this employee info has some
other design of my employee info this
other Java file has some other
functionality so they J tabbed pane
works like this it has some pains or
some tabs which you can choose and
choose the function or the code which
you want to execute so let us see how we
can use J dubbed pin just go to your
containers and just click J tab pane and
make a square in your form so just go
there make a square okay so once you
make a square it will give you this
white space and which will not look like
a J tab pane you need to make it look
like a j-dub pane and how you can make
it look make it look like a J tab pane
is adding panels to it yes not tabs but
panels so one just take a panel from
here I will take this panel and drag and
drop inside this tabbed pane okay
and when I drag and drop or not drag and
drop but I will push this J panel inside
this J Pat tab pane you will see one tab
is made now for example you want to add
some more tabs you can just click this J
panel
and go there and when you see this red
line here on the side of your tab just
click your button and second tab will be
added light like this okay now you have
two tabs right tap one and tab - but
still you need to give some layout to
this so that you can you can push your
component inside your tab so I will use
this absolute layout once again in this
tab panel and I will just leave this
absolute layout in this panel first of
all and then I can use any of my
component like button inside my tab or
some table if I want to show I will push
this table in some in second time so
this is my tab - I will use absolute
layout for this also and then I will
push my J table inside this okay and
make it a little bit bigger
and little bit bigger
so you can see
okay so you have this table in one tab
and this button in other tab right and
when you run the program
by the way have I told you this quick
test this there is a small little button
here called put test and you can just
click this and see how your layout is
looking like okay so in this way you can
see your layout okay now when I run the
program it will work fine
it will look like a tap pain right you
have this tab here and it will work like
this okay tab 1 and tab - now I want to
give the name to this tab this only
shows the heading new tab new tab but it
is not enough for us to know which tab
is for doing what so I will go to the
source code and search for this tab
where the definition of this tab is and
then let me search for the definition
first
here is our definition for the dam okay
J tab pane tab pane here and you will
find two panels here panel one this one
and you will find one more panel just
below this which is this one inside your
damn okay so in here instead of new tab
you can change the text to
for example this tab shows button so I
will say this is the button
and the other tab shows the table so the
other tab name I can change it to table
but you can give any logical name to
your dam and now when I run the program
and you will see button here as a
heading and second health the table
right so this has table and this has
button so in this way you can add more
tabs to your this tab and add more
functionality in a limited space in your
jet form suppose you want to add one
more tab or tab inside tab so for
example you have this tab and you want
this tab to be inside some other damn so
just select this tab right click it and
just you can say surround width
once again Java X dot swing dot tab pane
and this will be surrounded with
another tab okay and then you can fill
the parent tab by new tabs right and
when I run this program
you have first tab in which you have two
tabs one for table one for button and
you have another tab which does not have
any anything inside it okay so in this
way you can use J tap pin in your
Eclipse cuy application I hope you have
