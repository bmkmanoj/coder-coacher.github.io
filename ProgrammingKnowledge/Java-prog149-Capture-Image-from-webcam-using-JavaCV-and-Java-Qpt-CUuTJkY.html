how to take a picture from a webcam and
save it to your computer using your Java
CV libraries so if you are not aware of
Java CV I have shown you how to install
a Java CV on your computer in the video
number 146 so you need to have installed
Java CV libraries in your project and
then you can follow this video so just
watch video number 146 and just come to
this video and let's get started I will
take a J button from here and I will
change its text as take picture or we
can say take webcam picture okay and
when I click this button or double click
this button in here I will write my code
so first of all I will make a try-catch
block this is a basic strike catch block
so nothing special about it just make a
try-catch block and above your try block
here we will write OpenCV OpenCV frame
grabber and give it a variable name for
example grabber is equal to new open CV
grabber once again and in the bracket we
will pass 0 here 0 indicates that we are
indicating the default webcam if you
want some other webcam then you can try
writing here 1 all the subsequent number
so it requires the input called
com dot Google code dot Java open
see we frame grabber so I will import
this library just click this arrow
button and just click this yeah
so it's fixed and now I will copy this
grabber and paste it inside this try
block and right grabber dot start grab I
just start and then I will make a IPL
image I am G is equal to grab your
variable dot grab and then in the next
line I will write a condition which is
if condition if my image is not equal to
null so I am G is not equal to null then
this comes here so if my image is not
equal to null then I will save my image
so i will write c v save image and it
takes two arguments first is your IPL
image this one second one is your IPL
image object and first one is the name
of your image so for example i give the
name of the image as CREP capture dot
jpg file or jpg file
okay so just write this code here I will
make this code little bit
bigger so you can see it and copy it and
if you want you can pause the video and
write the code once your code is written
just right click and run the file and
this code will generate your capture dot
jpg in your project folder so just go to
your project folder my project name is
Java CV so just go one step inside this
folder which is my NetBeans Java project
folder and just see here when I click
this take webcam picture it will
generate a capture dot jpg image here so
just keep aah
keep an eye on here and I click this so
I click take webcam picture and is it
showing error no it's not showing error
and you can see here the picture is
created here and it has also opened my
webcam you can see here so this is my
webcam image which I have taken by
clicking this button so in this way you
can take a picture from your webcam
using your java cv libraries I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
