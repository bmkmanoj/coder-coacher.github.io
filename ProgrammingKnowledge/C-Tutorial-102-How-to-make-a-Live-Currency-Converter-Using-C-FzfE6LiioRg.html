video I will show you how to make a
currency converter in your c-sharp
windows form application it's very easy
to make a currency converter in your
c-sharp application so let's get started
I will go to my toolbox and I will take
a button and I will resize it a little
and I will change its name by going into
the property as open currency converter
ok and I also change the font size of
the button so we can see the text bold
16 okay once you have done with the
button I will once again navigate my
toolbox and I will search for the web
browser and I will drag and drop into my
form so for showing a currency converter
we need to have some reference from
which we can convert from one currency
to another currency a bit in your C
shop-windows form so what I will do is I
will go to my google search and in here
I will search for Google Finance
converter ok and the first link you will
see here is www.google.com slash finance
slash converter and when you click this
link here it's www eminence slash
converter so just copy this link here
and the best thing about this link is it
doesn't show any extra thing apart from
this conversion so just you can change
whatever currency you want to change to
whatever currency you want and it
doesn't show any extra thing apart from
that so what I will do is I will just
copy the link from here go to my project
and I will double click my button and in
here I will write web browser 1 which is
the name of my web browser dot navigate
and in the bracket I will pass the link
so double quotes and pass your link
which is HTTP colon slash slash
www.google.com
- slash converter it's that much easy to
write the code convert your currency and
when you run the program and when I
click this button open currency
converter you will be able to see here
fully functional currency converter
inside your windows form so for example
I want to change euro to dollar for
example I can change it for example 100
euros to dollar I click this button and
I can see there is a result
instantaneously this is a very good now
plug-in you can use it as a plugin if
you are making some project related to
economic markets of an ends so I hope
you will use it in your project and I
