show you how you can convert one video
file format to another video file format
using VLC media player for example I
want to convert a file which is dot avi
file and I want to want to convert it to
dot mp4 files I can convert it with VLC
media player VLC media player also
supports a many file format in which you
want to convert to and by converting
your file to the other formats sometimes
you can see that your file size also
reduces some file sizes for example mp4
uses very less space when you use it in
your video so let's see how we can
convert the video in VLC media player
but if you don't have we will see mainly
a pair player you can download it for
free from its website so if you don't
have VLC media player just go to your
search and just search for VLC media
player and the first link here is
www.videoculinary.com Pillai have this
video I will open my VLC media player
and I will go to media here so go to
media and go to this option called
convert save and in here we can add a
video which you want to convert to so
just make sure that it's file tab
selected and just go to add and add your
file which you want to convert to so for
example I want to convert this file
let's see which file format is this in
properties it's a dot mpg file right and
it's located here and no other video is
there ok so this is a dot mpg file I
will select it and
I will open it and then I want to choose
the format I want to convert this dot
MPD file - so just choose this button
here and just click this small up arrow
here and just choose here convert and if
this will lead to this lead you to this
window in here you need to choose the
destination where you want to save your
converted video just try browse for the
destination wherever you want to save
your video so for example I want to save
my video at the same position in this
folder so I will save it here and then
you need to give the name of the video
so for example I will give my video name
converted dot whatever format you want
to convert it to so for example I want
to convert my video to mp4 so I will
write mp4 okay and I will say save okay
so this is the destination and this is
the video name you are going to save
okay now to choose which form you want
to convert to you can go to this
settings here this is a small button for
setting just select this setting and
there are different format in which you
can convert your video so just go to X
and capsulation for tab here and choose
the preferred format you want to convert
your video to it has a Vai or FLV wave
row or many other formats for now I want
to convert my BD video to mp4 so I will
select this and I will save
I will click Save and I will say start
and you can see the process has already
started and it is complete because it's
a small video it's about 7 second videos
it the process completed fairly fast and
you see here my video is converted and
it's present here ok so once the process
is complete you can go to the
destination wherever you have saved your
video this is my converted video and I
can open this video from here ok
so this video I have converted to this
video this is a mpg file and I have
converted it to mp4 file so in this way
you can convert any video file format to
other video file format using VLC media
player and it's free of cost I hope you
