show you what are abstract classes and
how to use abstract classes in c-sharp
so generally or commonly you would like
sometimes to make glasses that only
represent base classes and you don't
want anyone to create the object of
these classes so you can make these
classes by using abstract classes so an
abstract class means that no object of
this class can be instantiated or
created but they can be used as base
classes so you can derive from these
classes but they cannot be used as
normal classes they can only be used as
base classes okay so let's see how we
can declare abstract classes first of
all so for declaring abstract class you
just declare a normal class so just
public and with a keyword abstract
abstract and then your class and the
class name for example mito okay and
then just close these curly braces and
that's the declaration of your class
okay so you can declare a abstract class
by using the keyword EPS right now
whenever you create this abstract class
it can contain abstract method like this
so you can write
abstract but first of all we will give
access modifier public s tract void or
for example print meter one okay and
whenever you declare a abstract method
inside abstract class you cannot provide
the definition to this method right for
example if you want to provide some
definition to this method like this and
when you compile your program it will
not be compiled and it will show an
error because abstract method inside a
abstract class can not have definition
this is just an declaration or you can
only give a prototype of this method and
not the actual definition but on the
other hand abstract class can also
contain normal method okay for example I
want to declare some other method which
is not abstract and this method is for
example print meter - I can provide
definition to this method okay and
compile fine in solution when succeeded
okay so if you provide an abstract
method inside a abstract class then you
cannot provide definition to this class
to this method on the other hand if you
provide a normal method inside the
abstract class you can easily provide
the definition to this class and it's
not necessary that your abstract class
has to contain some abstract method you
can even use a abstract class which only
has normal methods it's totally fine to
use normal method inside your applet
abstract class is not necessary that you
has to use abstract method inside
abstract class now how can we do or how
can we you
this abstract class in our program so I
told you abstract class says can be used
as a base class for example I have the
class called example one in which I have
main method in here I can just derive
from this meter class which is a base
class and this base class or this
example class is deriving this or is it
this is inheriting example one is
inheriting this meter one class then
what you can do for example you want to
provide the definition of print one
because print two definition is already
there right so let me give this
definition console thought white line
and I can give any message here okay for
example we are in meter print - okay but
this we cannot define the definition of
this method inside here so we can
inherit this class and then we can
define the definition of this class how
you can do this you can do it normally
just use the signature of your method so
just copy this here and instead of using
abstract you'll need to use over and
over right okay to give the definition
to this method and now you can give the
definition to this method like this
console.writeline this is you meter
print one okay and you can just use
these abstract classes like this
the book to your main method and you can
define an object of this example one
plus e x1 for example is equal to new
example 1 and then you can use this x1
object for example to print this message
dot print one operand to write so you
can print one like this and you can use
print 2 like this print
- okay and when I run the program you
can see both the messages which I've
written in method print 1 and print - ok
so there are some properties related to
abstract + and what are these properties
first property is abstract class cannot
be seen with class so there is a keyword
called seen so when I use this keyword
seal this sealed keyword means that this
metre class or this class which is
sealed cannot be used as a base class
and that's not true
you cannot use sealed and abstract at
the same time because on the first hand
the sealed means this metre cannot be
used as a base class and the definition
of abstract says the class cannot can
abstract class can only be used as a
base class but this and this keyword
will contradict so you cannot use sealed
keyword with this abstract class okay
the second rule is you cannot have the
method in effect class which are private
members
so for example
for for example you want to declare this
method inside your abstract class as a
private member try with okay and let's
compile this and see what happens
it says virtual or abstract member
cannot be private okay so you cannot
have a private member inside your
abstract class the third rule is an
abstract method cannot have virtual
method modifier called virtual okay so
for example we use when you when we have
learned polymorphism we were using
virtual keyword to declare a method
prototype so that it can be defined
somewhere else so for example I want to
write something like this virtual public
abstract virtual void it's not allowed
when you use this abstract classes and
when I run this program it will give me
an error and which says this method
cannot be virtual so abstract class
method cannot be virtual okay and the
last thing is you cannot define a method
inside your abstract class as static
okay suppose you want to declare a
method like this public static public
abstract static then you cannot do this
this is also not allowed okay so when
you compile this program will give you
that your method you cannot declare this
method as static so what are the
conditions we have learnt that pub your
abstract class cannot be sealed your
abstract class method cannot be private
and your you cannot
use a modifier virtual in the definition
of your or in the prototyping of your
method in abstract class and you cannot
even use the keyword static in the
prototyping of your method inside your
abstract class so in this way you can
use abstract classes in c-sharp and just
remember those properties of abstract
classes which will be useful in your
application so I hope you have enjoyed
