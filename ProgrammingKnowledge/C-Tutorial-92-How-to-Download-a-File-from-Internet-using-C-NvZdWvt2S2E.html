video I will show you how to download a
file from a website using your c-sharp
windows form application so it's very
simple to write a code to download a
file from a website and let's see how
can we do it so here I have a text box
and a button in this text box I'm going
to give the URL of the file or URL of
the website from which I want to
download the file and this button when I
click it should download the file to my
designated folder so just take this text
box and a button from the tool box and
arrange it like this and I have named
this text box as text box underscore URL
and just you can rename or re give our
new text to this button once you have
done with that just take these two
things just click your button and double
click it and then we reach to the code
of this section and here first of all we
are going to add one new using
directives right using system dot net
because we are going to use Internet
directory or Internet library and after
that go here and write web client WC is
equal to new web client and then in this
button click event we are going to write
our code to download app file but first
of all we need to write one more
function so
just go below this button click function
and just we will make a new function
which is very small so you don't need to
write of a big code for that so write
prime private sorry private void file
download complete and
just close the function and in here in
these bracket we will pass two arguments
one is object sender comma async
completed event args E and inside our
function we will just show the message
that our file download is completed so
right message box dot show and we will
write download completed so this is the
function and now in this button click
event we are going to write our code so
first of all just copy this web client
object here and paste it here dot
download file completed and then plus
equal to
and once again we write here new I think
completed eventhandler and just close
this and in here we will give the
argument this function as arguments or
just copy this file download complete
function and pass it here okay so this
is done and now what we are going to do
is in the next line we are we declare
the URL object so we are right we will
write you are I and we are going to
download our image that's why I will
give the object name as image image URL
is equal to new URI and in the bracket
we are going to pass the URL from which
we don't want to download out the file
so we are going to paste our URL in this
test in this text box so just copy the
name of this text box go to your code
and in this bracket pass this text box
named as argument dot text and in the
last line we will write WC dot download
file async and then we will pass the
argument in this function as first
argument will be the URL so just copy
this URL or URI object here comma the
second argument will be the string or
the name of the file you want to
a download and give it to give it give
that pile a name for example I am
downloading the image so I will give my
file the name my downloaded image dot
PNG so this is the name you can give any
name here to the file and now our code
is complete I think so just write this
and make this function and write these
three lines and you are done and where
this file will be downloaded so this
will be downloaded wherever your binary
file of the executable file for this
program is there so just go to your
solution explorer just right click it
and click open folder in windows at aura
and go to bin and debug and you can see
here there is no PNG or image file right
now but after I run the program there
will be a file called my downloaded
image dot PNG here so let me just run
the program first
and the program is running and I want to
give the path from the my website and I
want to download this image from my own
website the website name is www
programming knowledge dot o-r-g and I
will copy the link of this image file go
to my program I will open this folder
also so you can see the file being
downloaded I will copy the URL here in
the text box and I will click this
download bug button and just see in this
folder if the new pile comes or not so I
have a download I click download button
and it shows me download completed and
you can see a new file called my
downloaded image comes here and when you
click this image you will be able to see
that it's the same image that I have
downloaded so in this way you can
download a file it can be any file type
it can be PDF jpg text file or any other
file format which can be downloaded you
can download it from this code so I hope
you have learned something new this time
