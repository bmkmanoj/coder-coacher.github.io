tutorial on android app development for
beginners in this video we will see how
to use notification manager in android
so for example I have this running app
and I'm going to show you how this will
work and then we are going to see how we
can write the code so for example this
is my app which is running and this has
only one button which says notify me and
when I click this button it's going to
give me um notification something like
this and when I drag this down I can see
this notification which has some content
title notification content and some
extra features which we are going to see
so this kind of notification how we can
you know initiate these kind of
notification in Android let's see so
first of all I have this blank project
and as you may have guessed we are going
to use a button here and I'm going to
change the button text as notify me okay
and the button idea I am going to leave
it as default which is button and now
I'm going to go to my main activity dot
Java file so in here I'm going to
declare a button variable so button BTN
for example and I will give alt enter to
include the button imports and now I
will take this button variable and I'm
going to cast it inside my on create
method so button is equal to
now after casting this button we can use
this button object and we can call set
on click method on it so button dot set
on click listener and inside this set on
click mix now we are going to call new
on click listener and inside this on
click method first of all I'm going to
create an object of intent so intent
intent object name is equal to new now
I'm going to create a object of pending
intent here and I'm going to tell you
what pending intent is in a second but
let me create this object pending intent
is equal to and then take this pending
intent and then call a get activity and
the first argument which it takes is the
activity itself so main activity here
dot this and the second in argument is
zero third argument is your intent and
the fourth argument is zero okay now
what this pending intent does so this
pending intent is a token that you can
give to another application for example
notification manager which we are going
to use in our case and this will allow
this application to use the permission
of your application to execute a
predefined piece of code okay so that's
why we use pending intent here now I'm
going to create my notification object
so notification and I'm going to include
my import and I will name it as no T for
example is equal to new notification dot
builder and this builder will take the
context so I'm going to just copy this
main activity dot this and then you can
add some attribute to this object for
example dot
set ticker and this is your ticker name
for example ticker title okay and then
you can set some more properties like
set content title and set contain text
so for example set content title for
example and this is my content title and
then I'm going to add dot set content
text and this is the text for your
content okay so for example the content
text and I can add as many as text as I
want something like this and this if
this will be the text which will appear
here so when I drag this and this is my
notification content okay so after this
we want to add icon for example so we
will we can add our icon like this dot
set small icon and this icon you can
take it from your drawable so you can go
to your re s folder and in here you have
your drawable folder and in here you
have some default pictures if you want
you can add your own custom picture for
your notification but for now I'm using
the default pictures okay
so you can drag and drop your picture
here and use it if you want but for now
the default picture will be okay so in
here r dot drawable dot IC launcher okay
this is my default picture name and then
at the last you can add the content so
dot set content
and we will pass our p intent here and
then we will call get notification on
this notification object okay and here I
think it should be set content intent
because we are passing intent here right
so just change it to set content intent
and pass your appending intent here and
in the next line we can add some flags
to our notifications so for example note
e dot flags is equal to notification dot
these are all the flags which we can add
here but the flag we want is this flag
Auto cancel okay so this flag whenever
we click the notification it will cancel
our notification okay
now in the next line we will declare our
notification manager object so just
right notification manager I am going to
name it as an M is equal to and we are
going to cast notification manager
and then we will get services so get
system service and in here we want to
call notification service okay and then
we are going to take our notification
manager and then we will call our notify
method on it so just take your
notification manage your object dot
notify and first argument will be zero
and second argument is your notification
object which is no t in our case okay so
this will be the code to generate
notification on button click so let's
run our program and let's see what
happens so I'm going to run my program
so now my program is running so when I
click this notify me button it's going
to give me the second notification first
notification is from the earlier
app so when I drag this I can see this
content title which is this one and then
the content text which I have entered
some random text here and when I click
this this notification is gone okay now
in order to add some more features to
your notifications something like these
icons and some more content or some more
actions what we need to do is let's go
to our code here and in here in your
code after this set small icon you can
call some more method like dot add
action and first argument it takes is
the icon if you want to give any so I'm
going to give the default icon second
argument is the text for example action
one and the third argument is your
pending content object so this one okay
in the same way you can add as many
actions as you want just paste it below
this and add any number of arguments
like this now when I run the program so
my program is running now so when I
click this notify me button I can see
the notify icon and in here I can see
action 1 and action
two here okay so in this way you can use
notification with your Android app I
