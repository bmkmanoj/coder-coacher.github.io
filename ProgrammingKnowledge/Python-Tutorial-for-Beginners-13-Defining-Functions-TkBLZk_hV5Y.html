video I am going to show you what is a
function how to use a function and why
we use function in Python so first of
all what is a function so let's see what
is a definition of function a function
is a group of statement that together
performs a specific task so basically we
write a function to do a particular task
again and again without rewriting the
same code again and again and functions
make your code readable and you know
maintainable maintainable means if you
want to you know change something in
your code by writing functions it's easy
to maintain your code okay so always
remember whenever you want to write a
specific logic or code again and again
or more than once use a function instead
okay so let's see how we can define a
function so in Python you can define a
function like this you need to use our
keyword which is def and then you give a
space and give a function name and then
in the brackets you give a something
called arguments okay so whatever you
give in the brackets these are called
arguments and there is no limits to
arguments arguments you can define any
number of argument which you want to
pass to a function and then a semicolon
and then comes the statement statements
are the piece of code which you write
inside a function now suppose I want to
make a function to print a hello to some
name so either I can do print as we have
been seeing that I can use print and I
can say hello hello and the name for
example I want to say hello mark
right so and I can print it but for
example I have 25 names or hundred names
which I want to say hello and I would
don't want to rewrite this print again
and again by the way this print is also
a function and we are passing the string
as an argument to this print but print
is a built-in function which I have
shown you in the previous video what our
built-in function and how to use
built-in function now let's make our
function and what function we define are
called user-defined function so we will
define a function for example call we
will call our function def and then name
our name of our function will be hello
for example okay and what we are going
to we are going to pass a variable so
you can name your variable or any name
you can give any name to your variable
for example name or X or Y or whatever
you want to give an argument you can
name your argument depend of depending
upon your wish so I will name my
argument as name because it's more
logical because I want to print name
right
and then I give this : okay now after
this :
inside the function we write statement
so what we want to do we want to print
hello and the name whatever we pass in a
function right so we will say hello
print and then we pass this argument
whatever argument will you will pass we
will pass this argument to the free
print function and then what we want
that we want to print hallo and whatever
name we will pass ok now I will just run
this function or how we can use this
function so function is defined now ok
now how we can use this function we can
just call this function hello and then
we can pass a name which is a string
right so we want to pass a function
which takes our string
ok so for example I say mark ok and I
press ENTER and it says hello mark ok
and once again I can just once again
called hello and this time I pass a
different name for example John and save
hello John and in a similar way you can
pass any name it will print other names
also so what this function has done for
us it makes our code really you know
readable because we are not Rita writing
this piece of code which is print for
example suppose you want to perform you
know 10 or 20 line of code in one go and
this these 20 line of food perform a
particular logic and you don't want to
you know Ryrie write these 20 line of
code again and again so you can use a
function instead to enclose these 20
line of code and then you can use this
function so that you don't have to write
this 20 line of code again again again
and again you can just call a function
by its name if it takes an argument you
can pass the argument and then it will
give you the result
right now it's not necessary that you
always has to pass any argument you can
define a function without any argument
also right so always remember a function
can have zero argument or any number of
arguments minimum is 0 or no argument
and maximum is depending upon you okay
now there is a yo and one more thing I
want to say here is function don't take
only strings they can take numbers so
let's make a little bit useful function
to add two numbers so I will just define
a function by d EF and I will name my
function as ad function okay and this
will take two argument for example x and
y so I will just separate my arguments
by a comma and then I will give a give
this poll in here and then I want to
print the result okay so what I can say
is I can return and return means giving
the answer
okay simply giving the answer and what I
want to return I want to return the
addition of X plus y okay and now I will
press ENTER two times that means my
function is defined now I can use this
function to add two values so I will
call this function add and I want to add
for example 100 and 500 okay and what
will what this will do it will add 100
and 500 and it will return the answer so
if when it returns down so you can save
your answer in some other variables for
example I can define
a variable called sum and I can save
this sum in this variable okay so for
example I define a variable called sum 1
is equal to add 100 comma 500 and I can
press ENTER now my sum is in my some one
variable so I can print by someone like
this someone
it gives 600 what this function has done
for us add function it has taken x and y
so X is assigned or 100 is assigned to X
and 500 is assigned to Y and then it
adds the value of x and y which is 100
plus 500 and it gives the result return
the result and when a function returned
any result you can save it into another
variable okay so it has saved this
result into the sum variable and it
returns and same thing you can do again
and again so for example you want to add
some other numbers for example 234 and 3
3 3 you can do it like this and you can
call some to add give will give you the
result okay so in this way you can use
functions in Python I hope you enjoyed
