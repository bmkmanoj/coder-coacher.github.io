Java programming tutorial for beginners
in this video we will see how we can
read a text file using Java now there
are many ways of reading a text file
using Java but we are going to see the
most common way of reading file so first
of all we need to import some classes
which are from Java io package so first
of all let's import those classes so
first class we need here is the buffer
reader class and this class we are going
to use to read your data okay now second
class is the file reader which will read
the file and third is the i/o exception
which we are going to handle some
exceptions if it's thrown by this file
reader so first of all in my main method
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create an instance of buffer reader for
example BR and I will initialize it by
null okay now I'm going to create a
try/catch block here and this block I'm
going to use to handle some exception
for example if I'll read through some
exception then I'm going to catch it in
the okay so catch and I'm going to catch
IO exception here okay
so just take this IO exception II and
then we can catch this and for now this
is going to give you this error bubble
and when you hover over it it will say
unreachable catch block for IO exception
this exception is never thrown from the
try statement body which is true because
we haven't written anything in our try
block so let's write some code in our
try block so what we are going to do is
we are going to initialize Br
is equal to new buffer reader and in the
constructor of this buffer reader we are
going to call a file reader so file
reader and inside this we are going to
give the name of our text file okay so
for now I have a text file which is
present in my project folder if you know
don't know how to reach to this project
folder you just need to right-click your
folder go to the properties and in the
location here you will be able to find
the path of your project okay so this is
the same path of my project and this is
the file inside my project folder okay
so I'm going to open it and this file
contains some lines which I want to read
from this text file and I want to print
it for example so I will give the name
of the file so if your file or if your
text file is in your project folder you
don't need any extra path so you just
just write file name with the exact you
know spelling of the file name and then
txt okay and then in the next line we
can read it from this file so for
reading this file first of all I want to
store it somewhere right so I will
declare a string variable string line
for example and now I'm going to create
a while loop to read every line okay so
while and inside this while loop we are
going to read our file so just make one
more bracket here and we are going to
assign the value which we read from our
file using this BR so line is equal to
BR dot readline okay which will not be
equal to
null then we will get the value of each
line okay not equal to here so what we
are going doing in this while loop in
this while loop we are assigning the
value of each line which we read from
the file to this line variable and we
are checking whether it's null or not
and if it's null we are going out of the
loop and if it's not null we are going
to print this file so I'm just writing
this out and line okay which is this
variable okay so I'm printing this line
if this line is not null okay now once
everything is done and you are done
reading your file you need to close it
so I'm going to use finally and if you
are watching my videos you know that
this finally is called when you want to
perform some action whether you're trike
block throws some exception or not this
code is going to happen definitely ok so
we are going to use BR dot close and
this will close your file ok and in here
you will see it's also going to throw
some exception so we can surround it by
try-catch block inside this finally
block okay so just surround with
try-catch block and it's going to
surround it by try-catch block so I
think we are done with the code one more
thing if you want you can just use this
e dot print stack trace and it's going
to print your exception details whenever
this code throws okay so let's try and
run the program but before this let's
save this and I'm going to run this
program so run it and you can see it
reads all the lines from the file
so this was my text file which has seven
lines as reading all the lines from the
text file okay now if you are wondering
you want to read a file which is not in
your project folder right and you want
to give some path to this file here how
can you give it you can give it like
this so just copy the path from here
like this and paste it here and with the
slash backslash and this will not work
because Java will find it difficult to
read this single black slash so if you
want you can just use double backslash
instead of single backslash everywhere
where this backslash is used and this
will give the path of your text file
okay so you can give the path of your
text file from anywhere from your
computer like this okay now I'm going to
save this and I'm going to run this
program and it gives me the same result
because it reads from the same file so
in this way you can read a text file in
java using bufferedreader and file
reader classes I hope you have enjoyed
