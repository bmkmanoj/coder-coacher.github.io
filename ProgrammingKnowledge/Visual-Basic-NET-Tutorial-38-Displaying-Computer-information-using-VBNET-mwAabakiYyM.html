show you how to show some of the key
system information of your computer
using your visual basic windows form
application so for example you want to
show the computer name or computer user
name or OS type or OS version or how
much memory is available in your system
and things like that related to your
system you want to show this information
on your form how can you do that I will
show you in this video it's just an
example so I will show you some of the
key information but you can play with
those codes and find your more
information about the computer so I will
take a button from here and I will take
some labels label one two three four and
five for now I have taken five labels
and now I will change the text of this
button as load system info for example
and I will double click this button and
in here will write first of all label
and I have five labels so I will write
label one dot text is equal to my
thought computer dot let's see what you
want to show now so my computer name so
it will show the name of your computer
and once again I will copy this code and
paste it here and in
second label I want to show for example
the OS information of my computer so I
will write computer dot info dot OS full
name and this are we copy and paste it
here and in third label I want to show
oh s platform and I will just copy it
once again and I want to show in the
fourth label I want to show oh s version
now in the fifth label I want to show
the user name of my computer so write
label five and instead of this I will
say system information dot username okay
so for now we are going to show these
five information about our computer so I
will run the program and I have five
labels and when I click this button it
should show all the information which I
wanted to show so I click this button
and you see my computer name is Windows
7 and the over oh s full name is
Microsoft Windows 7 home premium and the
platform is Windows 32 NT and the
version is 6 point 1 point whatever and
the system user name is whatever my
system user name is so it's showing all
the information about the system so for
example some more information if you
want to show I will take some more
labels from here
so I have this sixth label seventh label
and eighth label okay and once again I
will click this button and I will copy
these labels once again and Table six
label seven and label eight so and in
the sixth level label for example I want
to show my let's see what I can show so
I want to show no I want to show primary
monitor size dot height for example and
I want to show primary monitor size dot
width okay and in the last label I want
to show for example the available memory
in my computer so I will write my dot
computer dot info dot available physical
memory and virtual memory so for example
I want to show the available physical
memory so I will just click this and now
I will run the program and when I click
this load system input it loads the
other information so this will show me
this fixed label is showing me the
height of my monitor and this seventh
label is showing me the width of my
monitor and this eighth label is showing
me the available physical memory which I
have so in this way you can show with
this computer dot
