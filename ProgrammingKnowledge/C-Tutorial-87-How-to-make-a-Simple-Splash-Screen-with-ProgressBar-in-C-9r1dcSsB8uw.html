video I will show you how to make a
splash screen with your C sharp windows
form application so let me show you what
I mean by splash screen so for example
in the last video I have made a simple
application called text to speech
recognition and when I run this program
first of all I want to show this splash
screen which loads and when the progress
bar completes then my actual program
starts so once again I want to show you
today this splash screen how can I
create okay so let's get started I will
make a new project for that new project
windows form application
splash screen 1 click okay
my project is created now now this is
from one of my project I will add a new
form so I will right-click my project go
to add new item windows form and form -
I will click OK
so I have two forms now form 1 and palm
- I will select form 2 first and I will
select this form and I will go to the
properties and first of all I will
disable this form border style so go
here and click none so it will disable
this borders of my form second thing I
will do is I will go a little bit up I
will go this go to this background image
and I will set a background image to my
form so just click it make it a local
resource import and you can choose the
image of your choice
for example this image and I will click
OK so now my image is set in my form but
you can see the full image is not
showing so what I will do is first of
all I will say background image layout
is stretch so click this stretch and now
your whole image is stretched into your
form now I will go a little bit lower
here and I will say start position so
what I want to start my form at the
center of my computer screen so I will
say center screen start position is
equal to center screen and I will
disable this show in taskbar also so I
will say false okay so now we are done
with this form now we will go to the
tool
and I will drag and drop up progress bar
from you resize it a little so okay now
I will take a timer from a drag and drop
to into a form and it looks like this so
here you can see the timer one just
select your time and set it enable go to
the property and click enable is equal
to true and set your interval you need
to see what interval fits your timer for
your splash screen I make it as interval
32 just try different intervals and
watch suit your app suits your
application just give the interval here
now I will click this timer 1 and double
click it and I will reach to the time
would take event here I will write
progress bar 1 dot increment I want to
give an increment of 1 with every time
word trick and then I want to set this
timer stop when so I will write if my
progress bar dot value is equal to 100
so my progress bar reaches 100 well if
my progress bar reaches 100 I want my
timer to stop okay so we are done with
this form - and now we reach to the main
form which is our form 1 here this is
this will be our main window which we
want to show after our splash screen so
maybe I will show some message
I will take a label and I will change
its text as this is the main form for
example and I can change the font so
that it's visible on let us see 26 okay
so I resize it and this is our main form
now I will go to the form dot CS so I
want to go to this form one dots CS to
the code of this form so I will say just
double click it and I will go here at
the top and I import one spine so I will
say using system dot
threading and then just here just below
your main form function of class just
say
so we will make a function called splash
start and we will say just run our
application so I will say application
dot run bracketing bracket closed new
form two so we want to start pump two
from here so we make this function first
and now go to here and your main form
constructor and just above your
initialize component we will start a
thread or we will create a thread so I
will write thread T is equal to new
thread by K term like it closed and then
then we say new
read sorry new thread start and in the
bracket we will pass our function this
splash start functions copy it and paste
it here so we created a thread now we
will start our thread so we will write T
dot start and now we will give the
interval or sleep to our thread so that
our splash screen form can load
completely so I will say T dot
one second so I will say thread dot
sleep and I will give an interval for
example 5000 here and then just after
your initialized component function I
will abort thread so I will write T dot
abort and close so this is the code for
splash screen and I have made it a
little bit larger so that you can see it
I just made this function called splash
start and I start my form - splash
screen from here and then in here I have
created a tread and I started this
function from here and then I start the
thread and I gave a sleep of 5,000
milliseconds and then after my
initialized component is about this
thread so if you want just pause the
video and copy the code and now I will
run my code so let's see if it works or
not
see here it's working ok so in this way
you can create a simple splash screen to
your C shop windows form application
project I hope you have liked this video
