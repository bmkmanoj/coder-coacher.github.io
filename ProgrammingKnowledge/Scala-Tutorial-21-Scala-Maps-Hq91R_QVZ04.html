Scala - told for beginners and in this
video we will learn about maps in Scala
now first of all what are maps so in
Scala map is a collection of key-value
pairs and the keys are unique in the map
so let me give you an example so for
example I want to save a students name
according to his ID and let's say
student studies in class 8 and his ID
starts from let's say 8 0 1 and
according to this his idea or her ID ID
I want to save the name let's say it 0 1
is max and let's say it's 0 2 is Tom and
let's say 8 0 3 has dog dropped out of
the school so we have 8 0 4 and let's
say some name associated with this aid 0
for ID right and I want to save this
kind of pattern in some kind of
collection so this kind of collection
can be saved into a map so let me show
you how we declare maps and how we can
use map now maps are also of two kinds
one is mutable and second is immutable
so by default when we declare a map
let's say I will declare a map with this
declaration so well and then I want to
give the name to my map so let's say my
map is the name to my variable and then
the map keyword so map and then we need
to specify the key data type and the
value data type so in this square
bracket we will just write the key data
type in our case we want to save the
student ID which is a number based upon
his name so first of all
Eydie has the data type int and the name
has the data type string right so we
will just give in the square bracket the
first keys datatype and second is the
values data type right and then we will
just initialize a map like this so we
can just write map and then we can
initialize a map let's say I want to
give a 0 1 ID and then we use this arrow
symbol and then we use let's say the
name which is max let's say okay so this
is the first key well value pair and the
second key value pair is let's say this
one it's 0 2 and Tom let's say and the
third key value pair so let me just make
it like this so we can see the third
let's say it's 0 4 and the name
associated with this ID is this one okay
so we have three students associated to
their ID in the class in the same way we
can add multiple number of entries for
student ID and the name so let me just
print the math values first of all so
I'm going to just try use print line for
that and then just run the code and you
can see it prints the map values like
this whatever we have declared now let's
say we want to access the student name
whose ID is 8 0 2 so what we can do is
we can just write print Ln and then the
map name which is my map and then in
these parentheses you just give the key
of the map so key of the map is 8 0 2 in
our case right so the first thing here
is the keys and the names associated
with them is the
values so we want to know the value of
the map whose key is 8:02 let's save the
code and let's run the code it will
print Tom because it's zero to is
associated with the name Tom similarly
we can just use this notation so this ID
is not there right 8:03 is not there
this key is not present inside the map
so what will happen it will throw us the
exception so if we try to access the key
which isn't present inside the map then
it's going to throw an exception now
what happens when I just give same ID or
same key two times so duplication of key
is not possible in map so let's say I
just provide eight zero four and eight
zero four two times here the key two
times here then it's not possible so let
me just just do is zero one here and let
me just run the code and when I run the
code you will see that there are only
three ID present here 8:01 8:02 and it's
zero four even though we have given four
entries here but the problem here is we
have given two similar keys inside the
map and as sets the maps key also cannot
be duplicated so the keys in map should
be unique okay so when you just give the
duplicate keys then it will take the
last key value here so it will overwrite
the last entry so you can see we have
given it zero for two times so last
entry is 8 0 for 4 j u ly double y and
this is shown here so the duplication of
key is not possible as
now let's say I want to just print out
the keys all the keys of my maps so I
can just use my map dot keys right and
it's going to give us the keys
associated with the map which are IDs in
our case if we want to print out all the
values associated with the map then we
will just say my map dot values and it's
going to give us the values of the map
which is associated with the map right
and then we can also check if the map is
empty or not using is empty method so
let's run the code and let's see what
happens so you can see here that the key
are 8:01 8:02 and it's 0-4 and it's a
set right and we have learned in the
last video that in a set all well use
must be unique that's why all keys in
the map must be unique now for the
values you can see values are printed
here so max dorm and chilli is printed
here which are the values of my map and
then lastly it has printed false because
map is not empty now let me show you how
you can iterate over the map using a for
loop so you use the map name which is my
map in our case and then you will just
write keys which is a set and then you
write for each which is going to iterate
over all the keys and then instead of
parentheses we are going to use the
curly brackets here and then we will
just write I for keys so this is all
let's just say key here ok so just write
key here and then this notation arrow
notation and then inside the print
method or print line method we are going
to just print the key first and then we
are going to print the value so first of
all we will just print the key and let's
print the key value and the value is
print Ln and as we have seen in this
print line the value can be printed on
the basis of key also so the value will
be and then we will use the key inside
these parentheses which will give us the
value associated with that key and let
me just use plus here and plus here also
okay and let's run the code and let's
see what happens when I run the code so
you can see this is the result so first
it has printed the key key is 8 0 1 and
the value associated with this is max
right then we have the key 8 0 2 and the
value associated with it and then we
have the key 8 0 4 and the value
associated with this so in this way you
can iterate over the map using key and
value now let's say we just want to
check whether some key is present inside
the map or not so we will we can just
use this method which is the contain
method so map name dot contains and the
key name for example 8 0 1 which is
there inside the map so it's going to
return us true which is this one but
let's say if we provide the key which is
not present inside the map then it's
going to give us false so this contain
can be used to avoid the exception so
let's say when we give this kind of
notation it will give us the exception
right it gives us the exception so to
avoid this exception we will we can just
use contain to check whether this is a
valid key or not and then perform some
operation on that key now let's say we
want to concatenate two maps so what we
can do is I'm going to declare a second
map which have the
signature and I'm going to name it as
map - and let's say we have one more
student which we want to add to our
student list so we can just say student
is zero five here and then we can just
give the name of the student and we want
to just concatenate these two maps so we
can just use this notation so you just
use the first map and then you use
double plus operator or method double
plus method and then you use the second
method so which is my map - okay
and it's going to give us the
concatenation of these two map so let's
run the code and you can see the result
here which is the concatenation of first
map and the concatenation of the second
map now if you want to know more method
associated with Maps you can always use
this dot operator here and then you can
just select whatever method you want to
use from this large list so these are
the method lists which are associated
with map so you can use one of them you
can see had a method we have used in the
last video or I'm sure there must be a
tail method also here and then you can
see the size of the map so let's print
out the size of the map which will give
us the size of the map which is three in
our case because the map contains three
key value pairs so in this way you can
use maps in Scala I hope you enjoyed
