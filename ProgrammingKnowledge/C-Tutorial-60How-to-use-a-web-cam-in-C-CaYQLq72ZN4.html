video I will show you how to open a
webcam with your c-sharp application so
for that we are going to need one dll
file which we are going to download from
the internet so just go to a browser and
in your browser type this link it is
called easy webcam dot CodePlex comm
CodePlex
I think is a Microsoft website which
hosts open source software's and so it's
open source software which we can use in
our projects also and for more license
information you can always click here so
what you need to do is just go to this
download button on this website or the
link link is called easy webcam code
flexkom and just click this download
button and a zip file will be downloaded
I will click this download button and my
zip file will start downloading yes
starts and when you open this zip file
it contains 4 projects in different
languages windows form c-sharp project
is there windows form Visual Basic
webcam project is there WPF c-sharp
webcam project is there and WPF Visual
Basic webcam project is there so just
extract it in your desired folder and
when you extract it the folder looks
like this it also has this DLL for add
reference zip file which I will extract
in the folder only so I right click and
extract here and this
webcam capture DLL can be very useful
for opening the webcam in your
application so I am just opening there
provided c-sharp application windows
forms eShop this first one because we
are working on windows form application
in our videos just double click it and I
will open this project from here this
project
and this project if you can see contains
these four files so just to open this
form CS and it has all the buttons for
starting stopping continue for the video
and you can also capture image save them
mange and change the width you format
mvto source but you need to add the dll
file before running this program so just
right-click your project and go to add
references add reference and go to
browse and browse for this dll file
which we have recently extracted so
webcam underscore capture dot dll file
just extract and press ok and in your
resources you will see this webcam
underscore capture dll is added now when
you run the program it should run and
when you start this or when you press
the start button the video should start
capturing let's see i press this start
button and press ok and it's showing me
some error because there is a problem
with my webcam but when you start your
when you press your c shop application
this button when you press the webcam
should start because i have checked this
and this worked 100% so this is the
standalone project in itself you can add
this same project in your application
also so what you need to do is just
whatever you project you are working on
just right click
and just add references and browse for
the same dll file so on the desktop this
and just browse for this dll file from
there and extract in your resources okay
as I have done in the window with app
cam application and once again just
right-click this your project and this
time go to add existing items and you
need to add the files which is there in
this project which are webcam dot CS and
this helper dot C s these are the two
already made files which has the code
for capturing the webcam so just you
need to copy these file into your
project so what I have done is once
again I will right-click it ad and go to
existing items and then browse for those
two files in your system so I have
extracted in this folder go to the
project and I will just select this and
this helper and webcam dot CS file and
add this is will add these two files in
your project okay and when you add this
webcam dot CS or when you have opened
this webcam dot CS you see the namespace
name is Vinh form care chart oh sorry
when form shop webcam so this namespace
you can call it in your project for
example when you go to your your forum
and double click it or when you go to
the code you can call that
winform sharp webcam namespace in your
project so right
using winform sharp webcam just like
this and now what you need to do is just
copy and paste what are there in the
code so just take these picture boxes
and in the same way in your form also
you can drag and drop picture boxes and
button for starting and stopping the
videos and you can just copy whatever
code they have used and in the page load
or main form load event there this code
so I copy this code and in my code I
will go to my code and I will paste it
here in initialize below my initialize
component function in my form definition
or so on here and it's showing some
error because I haven't declared what
they have declared here webcam dot
webcam variable so copy this and paste
it into your application of project now
you have to change this picture box name
so just select your picture box copy the
name of picture box and just go there
and just change the name so you can do
this and you can change the names or
text for this and press Start
and double-click it and whatever they
have provided in for starting the webcam
so this is the code for starting so just
copy this and paste it in your button
click event so in this way you can use
this or in your application and you can
open the webcam in your application also
so when I run this it should run in your
PC my webcam has some fault that's why
it's not running but it will run in your
PC ok
so I hope you have learned something new
