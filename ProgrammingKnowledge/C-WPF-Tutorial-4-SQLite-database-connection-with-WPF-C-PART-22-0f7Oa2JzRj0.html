SQLite underscore data reader dot read
and in here they have provided this code
so instead of this code I will comment
this code here and I will declare a
string variable so I will write string
and not this string but string with
small s and I will name it as data for
example is equal to I will copy this
SQLite data read of it is there in this
while loop paste it here dot get string
and in square bracket I will provide
what I want so I want the first column
of the database I want to show it in the
message box so I will write 1 here and
then what I will do is this is showing
me error I think this is this round
brackets not the square brackets and now
I will show it in the message box so i
will write message box dot show and the
bracket i will pass this data variable
which is a string type so what it is
doing is I will explain this codes a
little bit so so when you go at the up
above your code here at the starting
they are declaring the connection the
command and the data reader variable
from SQLite and then
they are making a database they are
giving their own database name here and
these are the version of SQLite and new
version and compress is equal to true so
this makes a database called database
dot DB and your project and then they
are creating some tables into your
database and then they are inserting
some data into your table so just wait
for some moment and you will come to
know how this program is working so now
I will run this program
so my program is running now and when I
click this button it will create a
database where in my debug folder of my
project wherever my SQLite these SQLite
the DLL files are there so see here I
will click this and you will see here so
I click it and click OK and it shows me
the values so here it has created a new
file called database DB in my debug
folder and what this code is doing is
just giving me the values from the
database so when I click this test
button it gives me the first value which
is in the code you see test text1 this
is the value from the second column of
my table called the text and the second
value text test text - which is this
test text - value so click OK once again
like this so what this code has done is
it has created a database in my debug
folder here now how can I see what data
is there in this database for database
the DB file so there is a SQLite manager
tool which is used to see whatever data
in this DB file so how to use it I will
show you so just go to your Mozilla
browser
this requires Mozilla browser because
the SQLite manager we are going to
download is a mozilla plug-in so you
should have this Mozilla
install and then go here add above this
Firefox button and click add-ons so I
click add-ons and in here in the search
box here right SQLite and such and here
you can see X collide manager is here
the first link is Forex collide manager
you can just click this install button
and it will start installing and when
its installed it will ask that you or
you should restart your Firefox I will
say yes restart my Firefox now and it's
taking some time to restart and now it's
restarted so my SQLite plug-in is
installed in my Mozilla Firefox browser
so how to check its installed go this go
to this Firefox button once again and go
to web developer and then you can see at
the bottom SQLite manager so just open
it
and it opens this Escalade manager now
for more information you can just go to
my SQLite videos which I have shown you
at the starting that you I made this
SQLite tutorial
earlier there you can see how I made
database inside this SQLite manager
right now I am just going to browse for
my database and see whatever content
since they're in my database DB this
file here so I will just copy the path
of the link and I will click this
connect database this button or I will
go to this database here and click
connect database and I will copy the
path of this folder where my database
file is there and it opens the dead
folder but you notice here there is no
file which is not recognized here that
is because here it's searching for dot
SQLite file which is also a file
extension for the SQLite database but we
are searching for the dot DB file so we
click all files here and you will be
able to see your database dot DB file
here click this and open it and now you
can see here there is a database dot DB
database here and inside this there is a
table called test and when I go to
browse and search it has created a table
and it has content ID and text here ok
so now we are ready to begin our SQLite
database application using WPF so this
was the tutorial how to connect
and how to establish your connection
with SQLite database and from the next
video I am we will start coding for the
login page and other applications so
stay tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
