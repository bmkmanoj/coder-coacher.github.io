video I'm going to show you how you can
create a bootable USB for installing
Ubuntu operating system on your computer
so for example you need open to
operating system on your computer and
you need to create a bootable USB for
that for the installation how you can do
that I'm going to show you in this video
so it first of all you need to have open
to operating system ISO file so you need
to download Ubuntu ISO file before
making this USB or bootable USB so I
will give the link in the description so
that you can go to this Ubuntu website
and from there you can download this
open to ISO file here you can choose
your flavor of the of your window
operating system you can either choose
32-bit or 64-bit ISO file whatever you
wish to download you can download it
from here once you select your flavor
you just click this download button here
and once you are in this download
section it will give you the option to
download and it will show you some
donation if you want to make some
donation but otherwise you can directly
go to the download by just sliding the
slide bar to zero so now you will be
able to see this download link here you
just need to download this ISO file and
you will be able to see this kind of ISO
file here so I will go to the property
and you see here it's a dot ISO file so
make sure you have downloaded the dot
ISO file and once this file is
downloaded you are ready to create a USB
installer or you bootable USB for this
open to ISO file now second thing you
need to have is a tool for converting
this ISO file to a bootable USB right so
this
- we'll we can find it from this link I
will post this link in the description
also this is the link from pendrive
linux.com
what you need to do is you just need to
go to this link and go to the download
section below just go down and whenever
you go down you will be able to see
download link and why we are downloading
this to convert our ISO file to a
bootable CD so just go down and click
this download uui link it's not a big
executable file so it will be downloaded
with really fast and once this is
downloaded you just need to click this
and start this executable file and you
may need to agree terms and conditions
and just click I agree and now you are
ready to convert your ISO file to your
bootable USB here you can find some of
the options but the option we are
looking for is the open - option right
we want to convert our open to ISO file
to the bootable CD so select Ubuntu from
here and then the second thing is the
location of the ISO file you have
downloaded so we have downloaded this
ISO file here so you just need to give
or browse for the location for your ISO
file which you have downloaded so just
select this aisle so file you have
downloaded and click open now the third
step is to choose the USB Drive right so
I have plugged in my USB and the you
will be able to see this USB is in my F
Drive or this USB is plugged in my F
Drive right so make sure that this is or
just remember this folder because we are
going to need or use this folder and
make sure that you don't select by
mistake any other folder which are in
their computer like C
folder or I can see a folder e local
drive in mind computers make sure you
don't select this you just need to
select this USB Drive folder which is F
in my case but it can vary on your
computer ok so once you are sure that
this is the folder you need to choose
just go to the third step and choose
this F folder which is for the USB Drive
ok now you may have some already
existing files or folders in your USB
file so it's a better idea to click this
checkbox and what will what this
checkbox will do is it will format your
USB Drive first and then it will and
then it will make your a USB to a
bootable USB ok so just make sure that
you checked this checkbox and now you
are ready and click start and you will
be able to see this kind of a message
you just need to click yes and now the
process of making your ISO file to
bootable USB has been started you may
see some terminal opening and closing
just leave this process until and unless
it's complete you don't need to touch
anything and until and unless it's
complete this post process is complete
ok so I will wait for this process to
complete and once this process is
complete I can continue the video ok so
let's wait and now once your process is
complete you will be able to see this
message that your process is complete
and installation has been done you just
need to close this or you can just close
this because you don't need it anymore
now once you have this
USB you can go to the USB drive once
again and open it and you will be able
to see this kind of a folder structure
inside your USB now created right it has
this dot disk and boot folder and other
folders so make sure that it has the
same kind of a folder structure and once
you have this folder structure you are
ready to remove the USB Drive and you
will be able to plug this USB to the
computer on which you want to install
open to so I will just eject this USB
Drive from here and once this USB Drive
is successfully ejected you just need to
go to your computer on which you want to
install Ubuntu just plug this USB inside
that computer and start your computer ok
so just plug in here this USB and then
start your computer right so once you
start your computer you what you need to
do is you just need to continuously
press f12 button to load the boot menu
ok so whenever you start your your
computer with the USB plug then you need
to continuously press this f12 key to
startup the boot menu once you see this
boot menu here you will see this boot
sequence here and by default the boot
sequence starts from the SATA Drive
but for now you want to start this USB
Drive which has your Ubuntu operating
system right so you need to select this
USB option from this boot manual ok so
make sure that you select this boot a
USB option from this boot menu in the
next
you will be able to see this kind of a
menu which will show these kinds of
message and you need to choose one
message which is the message for start
or install Ubuntu okay so once you will
be able to see this message start or
install Ubuntu you just need to click
this option or you just need to press
ENTER to start the installation once you
press the enter your Ubuntu installation
will start and then it's the normal
procedure to you know install Ubuntu
operating system right so in this way
you can create a bootable CD for your
open to operating system I hope you
