video I am going to show you how to
declare and use multi-dimensional array
in your PHP code so for example you have
some situation that you need to print
out or you need to make a list of
students according to name the student
name age and his weight how can you do
it using your multi-dimensional array so
let's see how we can achieve this and
let's see how we can declare the array
for this multi-dimensional kind of area
so the declaration will be the same I
will just change this as students is
equal to array and then bracket and
bracket closed but in here you need to
change this because what how will be
your approach if you make this as a key
how will you provide the value for age
and weight at the same time right so the
approach can be a different for example
I can include array inside an array s
for example I can declare array not here
but here so array inside an array and
this then this will be called
multi-dimensional array and I will show
you how to use this and I can add mark
the name so I can add mark and the age
and the weight age is 15 and the weight
is 46 for example and the same thing I
can do for this name for John I can just
give John and the age is 13 and the
weight is 65 and same we will do for
the name Tom right so you can do it like
this
Tom the age of Tom is 14 and weight is
56 comma 14 and this will be comma 14
comma 56 right this should be also comma
right so in this way you can declare a
kind of re end to make it a little bit
clearer I can just rearrange this like
this okay so you can declare an array
like this and it will be a completely
valid so when I just save this and run
it
I will not see any error that means this
is not throwing any error now in order
to print this kind of array what you can
do is you can just write echo and then
you just need to provide two square
brackets because it's a
multi-dimensional array so we need to
give the row and column index or column
key of this array for example I want to
print mark and row and in column starts
from a row and column key start from 0
soon the key of this row is 0 this is
Row 1 and this is Row 2 and in a same
way this is column 0 column 1 and column
2 right so the the key row of the mark
is 0 right and the column of mark is
also 0 right but you also need to give
the name of your array like this so you
know that which array you are using
let's try to print this and you will see
the mah name mark in a same way you can
print out
all the values like this and you can do
it like this okay so I'm going to do the
same for three names and just notice
here I have provided a semicolon here so
they will not clash all right so I can
say I will also give this concatenation
symbol and give a break here so that
everything is printed in this different
line BR and I will do the same for every
every code right so we have one two
three four five six seven eight nine
values so we can also provide one more
here for example 3 is here and we have 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 &amp;amp; 9
okay so let's print all the things 0 0
and then the row here is 1 and the
column is still 0 so Row 1 column is 0
in the same way Row 2 and column is 0
for the name Tom once again if you want
to print the age the row is 0 and column
is 1 throw 0 column 1 right and in the
same way Row Row 1 and column 1 Row 1
and column 1 and no 2 and column 1 Row 2
and column 1 in the same way you want to
print the value of weight you just need
to change it to 2 2 and this will be 0 1
&amp;amp; 2 and when I save this and I run it
I will be able to see all the all the
names and all the ages and all the
weights you can concatenate and make
your own string I'm just printing or
these names and ages and weight in a
random way but you can just arrange them
side by side and you will be able to see
all the names like this
so let's arrange this so now I have
arranged them in a way that it will show
in this format okay so I will just save
it and run it I will show the name and
the age and the weight right now for
example you can have a different kind of
array
the second approach of using
multi-dimensional array is the like this
so let's see so you can use associative
array property right now it is a normal
array and how you can use associative
array property to declare the same array
so for example we can do it like this I
will just change this like this let me
make it a little bit clearer so I have
told you in the last video an
associative property you can define your
own key so the key for this name can be
name right I can just write name and
then this equal to sign and then this
greater than sign in a similar way I can
provide the same key for other names
drawn and Tom and in a similar way I can
provide the key for the ages and the
weight but I need to change this to age
age age and age and this is wait wait
wait and wait so you can define the
arrey like this using associated
property this should be named here and
this should be wait here right so using
associative property you can just define
these array like this and this is also
purely valid right but in order to print
this what you need to do is you need to
give the draw number of this and the key
of this right
so row 0 and the key is the name if you
want to print this okay and once again
row 0 you want to give the age for
example right I will just write page
here and row 0 and you want to print the
weight so just instead of column value
you just need to give the keys okay so
same we can do it here and here and we
can do for age we can do here and here
and for the weight we can do like this
and this I will make it a little bit
smaller so you can see all the text at
the same time like this okay and this is
also totally valid let's check it and it
will print the same values right so in
this way also using associative array
property you can define
multi-dimensional arrays okay the other
way I think I've included both the
whales arrays and associative arrays
okay so that's it for this video I hope
