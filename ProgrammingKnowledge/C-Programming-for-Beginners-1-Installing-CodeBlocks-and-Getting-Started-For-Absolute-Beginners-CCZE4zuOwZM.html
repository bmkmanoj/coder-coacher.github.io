tutorial on C programming for beginners
now the first question which may come
into your mind is why you should bother
about learning C or why should you show
the care about learning C the simple
answer is C is the most popular language
in modern times so you may know or you
may not know that C is the most commonly
used programming language for writing
operating system in fact the first
operating system which was written is
written in C which was UNIX and the in
the later you know years of C the
Windows operating system and Mac OS or
Linux operating system all written in C
now in modern days all not all but most
of the machine are programmed using see
for example microcontroller or
microprocessor all are programmed using
C so if you are a beginner and you don't
have any programming knowledge earlier C
is best you know best language to learn
because C is you can say the mother of
most of the languages even most of the
other languages are written in C for
example PHP Perl or Python are all
written in C so if you know the C
language you may you know it will be
easier to understand other language if
you have basic understanding of C
language now once this introduction is
over the second thing is what you need
to program C now there are two basic
things you need to program C
one is the editor editor helps you to
write your code right and second thing
is called compiler compiler is a small
program or you can say it's a small tool
which converts your program to the
machine language right because the
program or whatever your computer
doesn't understand this C program you
which you write this C program is just
the interface of which you were right
and it's easier to understand
you know programming when you program in
C but your computer just understand
zeros and ones so this compiler will
convert your program which you write and
C into the machine language so that it
can execute your program so these are
the two things which you require now in
order to get these two things there they
can be you know obtained free in
different ways there are different I des
IDE stands for integrated development
environment which helps you to write
your code and I'm going to show you how
you can install this IDE which is free
to use and let's see you how to install
this IDE first so just open your
favorite browser and just search for
code blocks and the first link you will
see here not this but only the code
blocks so search for the code blocks and
the first link here you will find is
www.kickstartcart.com
program called cold code blocks and it's
a IDE so you can see the open-source
cross-platform free C C++ and Fortran
IDE so C is included in this and why I
am recommending this code blocks to you
because it's cross-platform that means
you can get this on Windows Mac OS or a
Linux operating system and it's open
source so you can get it for free right
now how to download this you can just
click this downloads button here or
downloads button here I will click this
download button here and there are some
options which you can download there are
there is option to download binary Lee
release download the source release or
retrieve source code from subversion SVM
what link we are interested in right now
is this one download the binary release
just click this link and in here you
will find this few options because I
will be showing these tutorials on
Windows I will install this version
windows 2000 / XP / Vista 7 or 8 just
click this link and then you will see
these three options to install one is
only code blocks which is the IDE which
will help you to write your code second
link will provide you the compiler also
so just search for the link which has
mingw in it okay which is the center
link code blocks 13 and when at the time
of making this video code block 13 is
the newest version and just search for
this word min ji bu min GB is a compiler
which will help you to compile your
program as I have said so it's including
your compiler and
Aneta both and we want this version
right so just click this one link either
this or this I will just click
sourceforge.net link and then it will be
downloaded in few seconds and download
will be completed in few minutes because
it's not a small file it's 97 mb file so
it will take some time to download so
just wait for this to download and I
will pause the video and I will continue
once this file is downloaded and I will
show you how you can install it so now
this download is complete so we are
going to install this acro code blocks
in our Windows operating system I will
just click this executable which I have
downloaded and then the install will
start and say is welcome to setup just
click Next and you just read document
and have you agree agree just click I
agree and click Next and this is the
location where code blocks will be
installed just leave it as default click
install and the Installer shown will not
take much time to be installed really
fast you can see the a code blocks icon
here which you can click to open code
locks IDE and you can see it's
installing really fast so I don't think
it will take so much time to install
this IDE
and this codeblocks IDE you can use it
for programming other languages also
like C++ or Forte Fortran also so in
this way it's really good now if you
don't have a Windows operating system
you can download this IDE on Linux also
or Mac OS also it's available for all
these three major major operating
systems now it says the installation is
done I think and we want to run code
blocks yes I want to run and it will run
code blocks and say is something I will
click OK
and here the installation is complete so
I will click Next
and I will finish and you can see here
code blocks is currently not a default
application for C and C++ do you want to
make it what D as default if you wish
you can make it as default or you can
leave this so I will just close it for
now
I don't want to make it as default but
in this way you can install it now in
the next video I will show you how you
can create your first C program using
this code blocks so stay tuned and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
