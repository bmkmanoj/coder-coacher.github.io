tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video you will see
what is do-while loop in the last video
we have seen how to use while loop like
this do-while loop is also a kind of
loop but it's slightly different from a
while loop and I will show you the
difference once I show you how to use it
so I will leave this code as it is which
I have shown you in the last video so if
you don't know how to use while loop
just see the last video and this I will
leave it as it is to show the difference
between while loop and do-while loop and
just below this while loop I will
declare one more variable int B whose
value is also 0 okay
I have initialized a in the last video
as 0 and now I am neutralizing B as 0
and let's see the syntax of the while
loop now so first of all you write the
keyword do and then you write these
curly braces and at the end of your
curly braces you just write while and
then in this round brackets comes your
expression which you want to evaluate
and this will be the boolean expression
let's say in the last video we have
given this condition I will copy the
same condition in this while loop
expression but this will be B we are
evaluating the value of B right so this
is our basic syntax for do-while loop
and I'm also going to print the value of
B and I will increase the value of B by
1 as I have done in the last video so
here I am printing the value of B and I
am increasing the value of B by 1 now
let's see the
basic difference between the while and
do-while loop that print some line or
something in between so that we know
that while loop ends and do-while loop
starts so this will be the separator
between the two lines right
so let's try to run the program and now
the program has successfully run and now
the result is this one so for the first
time when you see it you know shows no
difference between the results right but
the basic difference between the while
loop and dowhile loop is that while loop
first evaluates the condition and then
executes your statement and do-while
loop executes so it do first so execute
your statement first and then evaluates
your condition right so for example I
want to check if the value of a is for
example -1 here ok which is not and here
also value of B is minus 1 Here I am
checking if it's less than or equal to
minus 1 and in while loop also I am
checking if it's equal to all less than
minus 1 and then I run the program what
it does this while loop will not be
executed because we are evaluating this
condition and in here the value of a is
equal to 0 and this condition is false
because 0 is not less than or equal to
minus 1 so this will not be executed at
all right
and then our line prints so this line
prints so above
of this line there is nothing as result
as you can see here but below this line
we have a result zero so why this is
printing zero here because it first
executes your statement so the value of
B is zero and it prints your statement
and then increase the value of B by 1
and then it evaluates the condition
right so even if the condition is false
the do-while loop at least once it will
be executed due value statement at least
once it will be executed and then your
condition will be evaluated so this is
the basic difference between while and
do-while loop while loop first evaluates
the condition and then if the condition
is true it executes the statement and
do-while loop first execute your
statement and then check if the
condition is true or false and then once
again it will a you know execute your
statement if the condition is true
so do-while loop at least once it will
execute if the condition is false so
this is how you can use 2 while loop and
this is the difference between while and
do-while loop I hope you are understood
the basic concept and hope you enjoyed
