last video I have shown you how you can
make the attach button and the table
update function for uploading the CSV
file into your database and now in this
tutorial I will show you how you can
write the code for uploading the CSV
file into your database so go to your
upload CSV button right click it and go
to its event action action perform so we
will come to the action perform method
of this button and in this button first
of all you have to write try catch block
so I will bind my catch
leave this catch block empty you know
what to write here so I may not show you
and this in this try block now you have
to write
before
meda and for its Mary William I will
take its abbreviation so before reader I
will take its variable name as be R so I
know it's variable so VI is equal to nu
once again copy this and paste it here
before reader and bracket and bracket
close and in this bracket it new PI
reader and bracket
in this bracket you need to provide your
path so I have already written this code
of path in this attach button and I will
show this path in this text field so I
will go to its action performed the
third and my path will be copied in this
global string variable called filename
so I will copy this and paste it here
this file name would be like C slash
desktop slash so you know what is this
after that what do you do is
declare a string called line and which
we will use to insert a value line by
line now right why
and in the why you have to write or take
another bracket and in this right line
which is this variable line is equal to
VR VR is or buffered reader variable dot
read line and
after this bracket you should write this
exclamation mark is equal to null and to
this these brackets and in these while
loop bracket what you have two ideas
string square bracket because this is
going to be our an array so I have taken
the square bracket value is equal to
nine dot split
and here you have to provide our line is
split by which symbol so in our case
because it's a comma-separated file so
our variables are separated by commas
this comma this comma so in my code I
will write double quote and in between
this comma so this is your separator you
can see some white separator and in next
line you will write query string SQL as
we always write is equal to W codes and
this ends and this in this SQL query
query we will write insert
into your table name so my table name is
table data you can see that so I will
copy this and go to my program and I
will paste it here and after that I will
write a bracket and oh my database I
will copy all the values which is first
is this I am NOT going to take because
it's the primary key which increments
automatically so I don't need to provide
this value so I will take the values
from serial number item ID so I will
copy serial number here and paste it
here comma once again go to my doctor
base and I will copy item id which is
this item id second column name and
paste it here and like this you have to
paste all the column so I pasted all the
columns
and after your columns you will write so
I will write here the space is not
enough here so I will press ENTER and I
will write my code in the next line so I
will write here I take this and I will
write values I will provide the values
here so first of all how we can provide
the values we have to insert this
variable as well use because this is an
array so I will write single quote
double quote and in between this double
plus and here I will copy this array
variable which is value and I will paste
it here and this is the first or zeroth
element of my array right so in this way
I mean
right a comma and I copy the first code
and paste it here and this is my first
Riveria bill which is item id 0th
variable is my serial number first
variable is my item ID so like this I
will paste 11 times and our we name them
2 3 so I will paste it all the values so
I pasted these 11 values and now I will
write my next code by the way this is
this values 0 1 2 is this array variable
so one by one it will take these values
and just insert into your database and
now go here and we will write our
connection which is PS T is equal to con
dot
too bad statement and this is my SQL
query it is this here and after that I
will write P st dot execute update okay
after that after our while loop which is
this till here go outside your value and
you have to write BR dot close BR is
this variable buffered reader which I
have copied here and dot close so you
have to close your buffer reader and
obviously if we want the catch block you
can write the option pain dot show
message dialog so it will show ever
if any error so I think my code is ready
you just have to write this code and you
will be good to go and now I will run my
program run
so this is my attach button I will
attach my file from my document which
would be a CSV file so I will search for
my CSV file so this download one is my
CSV file so I will select it and press
open and my past path will be copied in
my text field and when I press upload
CSV look what happens it will take some
time because it's a big data and one
thing I want to tell you here is the
table is not updated automatically here
because we haven't added our update
table method into our upload button
actionperformed so we will upload or we
will add our update table method in this
and then it will be shown as soon as
this data will be uploaded so this time
I will refresh my table or I will close
my program and open it once again so I
will right click run
once again and here is my data all data
of the CSV is I can see here CL number
item ID fluctuation date day month and
all things so let's go and add our
update table method so our data is
uploaded or updated automatically so
what I have to do is I just have to copy
my update table method and I will go to
its upload CSV action perform and below
my code after catch block I will paste
this update table so when I run the
program once again and I will attach the
same file
which is downloading download one CSV
and open it this path has could paste
copied here now I will press upload CSV
and you can people see you can see your
table is updated as soon as your data is
loaded so in this way you can upload
your CSV file into your database I hope
you have enjoyed this tutorial and learn
something new so please rate comment and
