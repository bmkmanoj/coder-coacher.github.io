scarlet roller for beginners in this
video we will see how to use currying in
scala so first of all what is carrying
so currying is the technique or the
process of transforming a function that
takes multiple argument into a function
that takes single argument this is the
simple definition of carrying okay and
the current is applied widely in
multiple functional languages like Scala
okay so let me give you an example so I
have a function here which is this add
function which takes two arguments okay
and what it does it just adds these two
arguments and gives us the result and
here I'm just calling this add function
with two arguments inside our print line
function so it returns me the addition
of these two numbers which is 30 right
now let's say I want to transform this
into a curried function so I can just
define add two function let's say and
what currying says what we want to do
here is we want to transform this
function which takes two argument or any
number of argument into a function which
takes a single argument so how we can do
this so first of all let's just define
argument list here which takes only one
argument in our case so just X and it's
off type int let's say and then what we
are going to do is we are going to
return a second function as a value of
this function add two right so we are
going to return a second function and
this second function also takes an
argument which is y and then the
argument type is int once again and this
function returns the addition
of the two numbers which is x and y so
we can just write x plus y okay and by
doing this what we have done is we have
carried this add function so we have
transformed the function which takes two
argument into a function which takes one
argument and then returns a function of
one parameter which itself returns the
results okay so now how we can use this
of curried function so I'm going to just
write print Ln and this time I'm going
to write ad 2 and then we just use this
like a normal function but with two
parentheses so in first parentheses we
give the first argument which is this
argument and in the second bracket or
parentheses we are going to give the
second argument which is taken by this
function inside the add two function so
let's say I'm going to just pass 10 here
and now the error is gone and now we can
just run this code it's going to give us
30 result 13 okay so this is how you use
the curried function so in first bracket
the first argument and in the second
bracket
the second argument or the multiple
number of argument which we want to pass
him now the interesting thing about
cutting is that we can apply the partial
application on the curried function so
how can we do that so let's say I'm
going to declare a variable and I'm
going to name it as some 40 let's say
with no space here and then what we are
going to do is is equal to we will just
call add to function and then we will
just give add 40 here so add 2 as a
function and then we will pass one
parameter which is 40 okay and we have
declared this variable and then we can
call the some 40
variable so I'm going to just print a
Len once again and now I'm going to just
call this some 40 function and then I
can pass one more argument to the some
40 function let's say I'm going to just
pass hundred here which is going to add
100 to 40 and then we will get 140
results so I'm going to just run the
code and you can see we are getting 140
as an result right so here what we have
done is we have defined a function with
a single argument which is 40 so this is
passed as the first argument here let's
say it's the value of x and then the
next time whenever we pass 100 to this
sum 40 function then this 100 will be
passed to the second argument or as a
second parameter so this will give us
the sum of 40 and whatever number we
pass here so let's say we pass 50 here
then it's then it's going to give us the
result 90 now this was the function
which we have transformed into a curried
function but by default Scala also
provides us the simpler text or simpler
signature for a curried function and
that we can do by using this kind of
signature so we are going to just use
the function add three let's say and
then we will just pass the first
argument X and then int the type of it
and once again in the bracket we can
pass the second argument which is y and
then its type and then we will just
simply return the sum of these two
values which is X plus y okay and this
is somewhat simpler a text for the
curried function and how we can call it
we can just call it
for example print Ln and then this time
add 3 and then as we have done earlier
let's say a hundred and then the second
argument in the second bracket
200 and this is how we can use this
simpler text for the curried function
and once we run it
the result is 300 here okay this is how
also we can use this curried function
now there's one more way of using this
curried function and that is by using
the partial application so let's say I'm
going to define variables once again and
I'm going to name it as some 50 this
time and then I'm going to just write
equals add three and then I'm going to
just pass let's say 50 here okay and you
can see it still gives us the error and
the error is the missing argument list
so earlier we have used this syntax for
the curried function and this was
totally valid but when we use the second
syntax which is this one which is
provided by Scala for us Scala want us
to provide all the argument which is
argument 1 which is X and argument 2
which is why ok and if we want to do the
partial application we want to use this
underscore here which completes this
function so this is basically saying
that here we want to pass any other
argument which we are going to pass
later ok and then what we will do is we
are going to print a Len and then we are
going to just call some 50 here and we
want to add something 250 for example so
we will just pass for example 400 here
let's say as in second argument and I'm
going to run the program and now we will
get the result 450 right so this 400
will be added to this which is 15 so
this is how you can do the partial
application on the curried function
using the second signature which is this
one so this is how we can use curry
