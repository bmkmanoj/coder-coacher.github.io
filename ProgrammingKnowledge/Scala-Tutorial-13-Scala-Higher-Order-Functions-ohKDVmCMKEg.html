scholar tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn how to use
higher-order functions in Scala so first
of all what are higher-order functions
higher-order functions are those
functions which are able to take
functions as arguments and are able to
return functions and these types of
functions are called higher-order
functions so higher-order functions are
able to take functions as an argument
and are able to return function as a
result so let's see how we can define a
higher-order function so let's say I
want to declare a function which is able
to do some arithmetic operations for
example plus or multiplication or
finding the minimum of two numbers or
three numbers for example and so on so
let me define a function and I'm going
to name it as a math function and this
function takes three argument first two
are relatively straightforward first
argument is X and the data type of it
will be double the second argument will
be Y and the data type of this will be
also double and the third argument is
interesting so the third argument which
we are going to pass here will be a
function and it's going to decide which
are automatic operation we want to
perform here okay so to pass a function
as an argument you just define the
function name for example or argument
name as you do with your variable let's
say I name it as f and then colon and
then first of all what are the argument
which is taken by this function which
you pass as an argument so let's say
this function which we pass in as an
argument is going to take two parameters
both are doubles so I'm going to just
write double comma double so this is the
input of the function and to define our
output you can just write this rocket
symbol and return data type so that the
return data type will
also be a double okay and then we are
going to define the return data type of
our math function so this is also going
to be a double and then what will be the
output so what we want to do here so we
want to just write equals here and then
we want to call this function which we
have passed as an argument so we will
pass this function and then we will
perform some operations using this
function so as an argument of for this
function we will pass x and y as an
input okay so this function we are going
to use and we are going to pass x and y
as an input so I'm going to just write X
comma Y so now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to call this function and pass
the result into some arguments so let's
say I will define a variable result and
then is equal to and then we will call
our math function which takes three
arguments so the first argument will be
our double value let's say I just want
to pass 50 and then I just want to pass
20 here so what we can do here is we can
just pass a anonymous function X comma Y
like this which is going to give us the
addition of these two numbers
something like X plus y something like
this so we have provided three arguments
to this math function first two our
numbers and third is a function which is
an anonymous function which takes two
argument which is the signature of this
function and then it just returns the
addition of these two numbers okay and
then I'm going to just print Ln the
result let's run this program and let's
see what's the result and you can see
the result is 70 which is the addition
of these two numbers right let's say we
want to multiply these two numbers so
instead of plus we can just write this
Asterix here
okay and let's run the program once
again and now the result is thousand
which is the multiplication of these two
numbers right now let's say we want to
just find the minimum of these two
numbers how we can achieve this is there
is a function called min here and this
min is going to find the minimum of
these two numbers right so let's run the
program once again and it returns 20
which is the minimum of these two
numbers similarly we can just pass max
function which is going to give us the
maximum of these two values which is 50
here okay so now what's happening here
is you can use this math function
according to your needs so you can use
it for addition or multiplication or
even subtraction of the two numbers or
division or anything you can do with the
same function which is our math function
now let's say I want to pass 3 arguments
into this math function so X Y and I'm
going to just add one more argument
which is going to be easy okay so that
and the data type of it will be also
double right and then what I want to do
is I want to find the addition of these
three numbers or the minimum or
multiplication of these three numbers so
how can I achieve this so here where I
call this function what I can do is
because it takes two arguments so the
first I will just enclose this function
into the same function so function
inside function I'm calling the save
function as an argument and then I'm
going to pass Z as a second argument
right so because F takes two arguments
1st argument we are going to pass the
function which is the same function
which is going to give us the result of
for example addition or a multiplication
of these two numbers and once again we
are going to apply the same function on
the result of the function ok
so let's see how we can do it so here we
are going to pass the third number let's
say the third number will be 10 and then
let's say this function is going to just
give us the addition of these two
numbers so I'm going to just pass this
function as a fourth argument which is
going to give us the addition of the two
numbers and I'm going to just run this
program and now it gives me the addition
of these three numbers right let's say
we want to find out the multiplication
of these three numbers it's going to
give us the multiplication let's say we
want to find out the minimum of these
three numbers and let's run the program
and it gives us the minimum of these
three numbers and for example max of
these three numbers when we run the
program it's going to give us the max of
these three arguments now in scala you
can write this function in a more
comfortable way and this is by using a
wild card called underscore so you can
just write underscore plus underscore
which means we want to add something
with something
okay so underscore here is a wild card
so something and then we have this plus
function and then we want to add
something plus something so this
underscore notation makes this function
really easy to write and when you are
comfortable with this notation you will
enjoy writing this kind of notation
right so this underscore here is a wild
card and this means we want to add
something with something right so we
will run the program and then let's see
the result and result is 80 which is the
addition of all these numbers if you
want to find the maximum you can just
write max here with the space and then
run the program and it's going to give
us the maximum of these three numbers so
this underscore is called wild card and
this underscore is used in different
ways in Scala which we are
going to discuss in the future videos so
I hope you have understood the basic
concept behind higher-order functions
and I hope you have enjoyed this video
