cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how to use
status bar in QT so let's get started
I'm going to use the project which I
have created in the last two videos
which is my login app right and in the
last two videos we have seen how we can
create this login design and how we can
you know implement the code for creating
this login app right now in this video
I'm going to show you how to use status
bar so as you may have observed that
status bar is already the part of your
main window so whenever you create your
main window klass widget then you will
be having status bar by default so it's
the part of your main window class which
is this one right now you can see the
status bar here and on the frame here or
window here this one at the bottom is
your status bar which is almost
invisible right now now how we can use
it as a name suggests status bar is used
to show some statuses right so for
example whenever we log in we have
written the code to you know check
whether user name and password matches
our you know custom PHA username and
password or not and whenever I click
login it checks and shows the message
using the message box but for example I
don't want to show the message using the
message box but in the status bar so I
can do this so you can see here the
status bar object name is status bar
itself so I'm going to use this name and
I'm going to go to my edit view and go
to source and go to main window dot CPP
file here right and this is the code
which I have written last time to check
the user name and password and if the
username is equal to test and password
is equal to test I was showing this
message in the message box that username
and password is correct this message you
can instead of showing in the message
box you can use a status bar to show it
so how you can show it so what you can
do here is I'm just commenting this
message box code here also I am just
commenting it and let's comment this
code also for the opening of second
window because we don't need it right
now so I will just comment this code for
now so what I'm going to do here is I
will just call UI and I can call this
status bar widget by its name and then I
can call a method called show message so
just call this method called show
message and this can take one argument
at least or and it can take two argument
if you want to provide so first we will
take how to use this show message with
one argument which is the message itself
so I just want to show here that
username and password is correct in the
status bar right in the same way I want
to show the message when the username
and password is not correct that
username and password is not correct
this message to my status bar right so I
can just do something like this and then
I will run my code and see what happens
when I give my username and password so
when I give username test and password
test and click login you can see it says
username and password is correct in the
bottom status bar you can see here right
when I give the wrong password it will
give me username and password is not
correct right so this is how the basic
functionality of status bar works but in
here in the show message function you
can add this
a one more argument which takes the time
out you can see by default it's set to
zero but you can give the time out here
and it takes the time out in
milliseconds right so for example you
set 5,000 here then this means five
seconds right so let's add at this time
out here and here also as a second
argument of this function and let's run
it once again so what it's going to do
is it's going to disappear this message
so let's give the test and test once
again
and I'm going to just click login button
and you can observe after five second it
will disappear so just wait for five
seconds and you can see the message is
disappearing after five second and this
is what this timeout is doing so it's
waiting for five seconds and then it's
creating the status bar message once
again you can wait for five seconds and
then it will disappear okay so you can
see this right so this is how you can
set the timeout on your status bar now
for example you want to add some custom
widget to your status bar you can do
also these things so what I can do is I
can go to main window dot UI and in here
I can just drag a label here not in the
status bar but anywhere in the login
window main window right and for example
I can just choose a progress bar here
also okay and I'm leaving the name of
these text box or a label as label three
and you can see the progress bar name is
progress bar
okay so label three and progress bar for
example I want to add these widgets to
my status bar what I can do is I can go
to my code and go to Main
CP file and in here I will go to the
constructor and once again I will call
you I status bar and then I will call a
method called add permanent widget and
then you can give the name of your
widget so I want to add the text and the
progress bar here right it can take
second argument also which is the
stretch we will see this little bit
later but right now you can just add
your label here my label number is 3
right and same you can do for the
progress bar so I can just use this add
permanent widget for my progress bar so
just write UI dot progress bar ok and
now whenever you run the program you
will be able to see this progress bar
and text bar box in the status bar right
so you can see this text box and
progress bar is fitted at the right-hand
side of the progress bar so whenever you
use this function which is add permanent
widget then it will add these you know
progress bar and the text or any widget
from the right-hand side right and the
normal message in the status bar comes
on the left-hand side so whenever you
click it you see this normal message
comes on the left-hand sides right so
these widget will be set on the
right-hand side ok
now whenever you give the stretch here
you can give the stretch one and one and
then let's see what happens here so when
you give one and one then this text box
is on the one end and the progress bar
is on the other end right so the ratio
of this stretch of this text box and the
progress bar will be divided by one by
one okay or you can do here for example
to buy one or three y1 let's see three
by one ratio here or stretch here and
now whenever it runs you can see the
ratio of your text label and your
progress bar will be three by one okay
so this is how you can you know divide
the proportion which will be covered by
these visit in the status bar okay
so for now I'm going to just remove this
ratio but this is how your status bar
works right and later whenever you are
doing some you know operation which
involves this progress bar of status bar
you can just use them right so for
example you can just use this label to
show the same text right so dot set text
for example and then you can just give
the same message here okay like this and
also in here also in the case of not you
valid username and password and whenever
you run the program
it will show you the message also in the
text box here also right so you can see
two messages one in the text box and
other in the status bar okay so I hope
you have understood the basic concept of
status bar and I hope you have enjoyed
