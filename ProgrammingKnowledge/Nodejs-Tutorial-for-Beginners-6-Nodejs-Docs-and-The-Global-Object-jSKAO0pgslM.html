node.js tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can use the
node.js documentation effectively and we
will see how to use global objects in
node.js so let's get started first of
all let's see how to use documentation
and where to find documentation so just
open your favorite browser and we will
go to the node.js website which is no
js' dot o-r-g and in node.js dot o-r-g
website there is a section called docs
so just click this tab here and here you
will find the various documentation on
node.js different motions of node.js and
recently the newer version of javascript
is also released which is es6 and beyond
and some of the new concepts are also
you know released under this new version
so you may want to use or see at least
these new concepts and if you want to
adopt them you can do it but for now I
want to show you the node.js
documentation so in here for example I
will go to this version which is LTS
which is long term version so I will
click this version which is 6.9 2.1 at
the time of making this video and in
here you can see there is a lot of
documentation here on the left-hand side
you can see different modules and
different type of sections here so what
we have done till now is we have used
this HTTP module which is a built in
module right and you can find
documentation on this here under HTTP
right and when you click this and go
down a little first of all these are all
the functions which you can you
with this HTTP module and when you go
down you can see the stability so
stability is the thing which you may
want to see before going inside the
documentation and if you see that this
module and this documentation is stable
then you can proceed further so first
look at this thing
if it's stable or not for the
documentation and then go down and see
whatever you want to see for example how
to use this get function with HTTP or
how to use even this HTTP module how to
require and then a lot of documentation
you can find here right so whenever you
are in doubt just come here and see the
documentation now let's talk about the
global objects now in this documentation
when you go to this section which says
Global's
and click here you will see JavaScript
or in particular no J's have some global
objects so if you are coming from
front-end JavaScript on the browser side
you may know that there is a global
object in JavaScript which is called
window object and under this you may
have seen the console object or set
interval or other you know functions
related to this window object something
like a lot or different kind of global
object in the same way node.js also have
these global objects which you can use
in your node.js code and let's see how
we can use them so I will go to my code
editor here and I will remove everything
and let's start from the beginning for
example and let's see which
function we want to use so for example
I'll use the set timeout function yeah
okay
and as the name suggests it is used to
set some time out and it has a argument
which is a callback function and a delay
whatever delay we want to give here okay
so we can just write set timeout and
then we can call a function so just
write function and this will be
anonymous function so just write this
blank bracket and then the curly braces
something like this okay so this is our
anonymous function here and then the
timeout for example I want to give the
timeout 300 milliseconds so you can give
the timeout in milliseconds here the
second argument is the millisecond or
timeout right and inside this function I
can perform some tasks for example
printing on the console so I can use
console.log
function for this you have already used
this console log in our previous program
and we will do the same here also right
so what we can do we can just print for
example 3 seconds have passed for
example something like this okay and
then save your program and I will open
the console and in here I will just run
my for example node Abdur cheers and run
it and when you run it it will just wait
for 3 seconds and then it will print
this message which we are printing using
console.log ok so once again run the
program will make for the 3 seconds and
then it will print the message and then
it will come out of the event loop for
example
and it will close the program right in
the same way you can use save is or set
interval function to set some interval
so instead of set timeout you can use
this function which is used to set
interval now for this set interval what
we can do is we can define a variable
for example and we will say this is our
time variable and we will assign the
value of zero to it right and then what
we can do here is inside this set
interval function we can just use time
plus equals two because our time timeout
or time interval we are using here is
2,000 milliseconds right and for example
we can just print the value of this time
here and we can say this much amount of
time has passed or second half passed
okay and save your code and run your
code once again and let's see what
happens here so two seconds have passed
four seconds have passed six seconds
have passed so it will increase the time
the value of this variable by two again
and again and this function will enable
your noches program to run in a loop
kind of thing so it will never end until
you have some condition to end it okay
so what you can do to end it you can
just press control C to come out of the
program okay so let's say we want to
come out of the set interval function
when some condition is met so for this
we can define a variable called some
other variable for example timer which
is equal to set interval and then we can
clear this time when some condition is
met
so for example if the value of time so
if the value of time is greater than for
example seven then we want to clear the
interval so just use a global object
called clear interval and then we can
pass this time variable here and it's
going to clear this interval okay and
then let's run the program once again
and let's see what happens so two
seconds have passed four seconds have
passed six second half passed and then
when the value has become eight at this
time it is going to clear the interval
because when this condition is Matt this
function is called which is going to
clear the timer and it's going to come
out of this function right now I'm going
to also show you some of the other
important objects which you can use in
low chairs which is their name and file
name so we know that we can use a
console.log to print anything on the
console and there is a global object
called their name so just write double
underscore and then write their name
here it's going to give you the
directory name you are currently in so
I'm just going to once again run the
program and you can see it's going to
print the directory name right now for
example I want to print the file name
I'm currently in you can just write
underscore underscore file name right
and then you can run your program once
again and now it first prints the
directory name which is pi this object
their name and then we have the file
name here you can see AB dot J's file
right
and you can go through this
documentation once again how they work
so for example I go to their name it's
basically showing the same example which
I have shown you and here also file name
and the explanation of this function or
object you can find in this
documentation so this documentation is
going to help you a lot whenever you are
developing in node.js so please keep in
mind whenever you are developing your
server or any node.js application just
go through the documentation whenever
required so I hope you enjoyed this
