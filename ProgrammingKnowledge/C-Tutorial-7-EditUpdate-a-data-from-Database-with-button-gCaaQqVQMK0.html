video I have shown you how to save your
data from your c-sharp application into
the MySQL database in this video I will
show you how to add it or update that
data in the database with the help of
your c-sharp application so let's get
started first of all I will take a
button from my toolbox and I will change
its text to update update
and when I click this button and
whatever dot I have updated in these
text field this this should be updated
in my MySQL database so just select your
button and double click it and we will
reach to our button click event for
update once again go to your form and
select save button which I have shown
you in the last video how to save a data
and double click it and copy the whole
code in between the event function from
string to the ending of catch copy all
the code from there because we are going
to use this code we just need few
changes so I have copied and pasted all
the data here so you know how to write
the starter or how to write this code if
you don't know please go to the last
video and see how did I write this code
in here I am going to change the query
so last time we are passing the query to
insert data in the database and this
time we are going to update data so we
are going to pass the update query so we
are going to add it this query so just
delete insert into and write update
your database name thought table name
and then white set and give a bracket so
right update database dot table set and
just leave this for column names like
that only and I will delete this values
okay and now I will copy this employee
ID which is my first column name if you
can see here employee ID name surname
and age I am going to add it these four
field so I will go to my code and I will
just copy this column name which is a ID
and paste it here and give equal to sign
okay so we have to write update database
dot e data set we are going to leave
this or delete this column I am just not
deleting it because I will copy the name
and paste it here
so once the query is complete I will
show you now once again poppy this name
and paste it
here and equal to certainly copy and
paste it and copy the edge and paste it
before your age and equal to sign when I
will delete this so now our query looks
like update database name dot table name
set e ID which is my first column name
is equal to single code in between
double code in between plus sign here
also
plus the because single quote and in
between that I am passing this dot E ID
text which I have declared last time the
text box name of Eid which is this dot
text so for the first column for to edit
the first column write this and now to
add it the name we are going to write
name is equal to same but just change
the name text box instead of Eid we will
we are passing name textbox string into
the name column okay in the same way we
are passing the surname is equal to
single quote double quote plus this dot
surname dot text
and enough same way we are passing the
age also okay
yeah
and after your bracket is closed for
your
we're here just delete this because we
have deleted the values bracket and
right here where and copy this Eid is
equal to this dot e ID text dot text we
just copy all the code before this plus
sign and paste it after this we're okay
sorry once again I will copy all the
string before this comma sign so because
this is also the part of this text so I
will copy this hole and paste it up to
where where your employee ID is this so
once again the query is update database
dot your table name set e ID which is my
column name is equal to single quote
double put plus this dot e ID text which
is my textbox name dot txt plus in the
same way we will write name name is
equal to single quote double quote plus
this dot name textbox name dot text plus
and single quote double quote and I mean
complete the single quotes in double
quote from here and comma surname is
equal to once again the surname text
field and same is for the age we are
doing and after this set we are writing
where your employee IDs so your database
needs to know which row has to be edited
so I am taking my employee ID as a basis
to change my data in the row so whatever
my employee ID will be it will change
the same row of the employee ID so
that's why I have written where employee
ID is
two single go double coat Plus this bot
e ID text dot next plus your codes
complete okay now we are going to run
this program and see if it runs or mouth
I think I need to delete this bracket
because I haven't used this bracket here
also now we are going to run this
program and I will give my username and
password for example
and my second form is open now suppose
we see our database in the my scale so
suppose I want to change employee ID to
data so right now it's to John Dell and
33 is a age now I will changed here to
instead of John I want to give him the
name mark and then last name and his age
55 for example now right now is age is
33 and I will click this Update button
and my data is updated I haven't changed
the message box message so it's coming
saved but my data is updated so I will
close this and I will refresh my
database to see if it's really changed
and yes it's changed mark
del and age 55 I will just change this
message from Save to update
so
updated and now when we run our program
give the username and password which is
connect we reach to the second form and
now we are going to change some other
data so suppose I want to change the age
of this employee ID 3 so I will change
it employee ID 3 name is same now I will
also change the name because it's strong
Patrick and and I want to change the age
to 22 right now it's 50 employee 3 age
and when I press update it shows me the
message updated and now when i refresh
my database the data is changed in this
way you can update your data in the
database
with the help of your c-sharp
application I hope you have enjoyed this
