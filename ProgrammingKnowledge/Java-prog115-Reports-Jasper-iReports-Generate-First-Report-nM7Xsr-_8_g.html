last video I have shown you how to
connect your database with your I report
in this video we are going to generate a
new fresh report with the help of our
database so what you need to do is go to
your files click new and new file window
will open here you can see so many type
of templates are given you can choose
any one now I will choose Cherry and I
will click launch report wizard here and
here it will ask me to give a name so I
will give a name to it so I will write
first
first report and I have to give some
path generally it's a good practice to
save your report file or any other file
you are using into your project folder
so you don't need to search for it so I
will do that and I will click Save and I
will click Next here you can see
connections database right now it's
connected to SQLite connection which I
have created in the last video so I will
click this escalade connection and here
you need to write any query related to
your connection so I have connected this
database which is called project 1 2 3 .
s collide with my I report so I will
suppose I want to execute or show all
these names surname in the form of table
so I will just copy this query select
star from my table name and I will paste
it here
and then click Next it will ask for the
password I don't have any password for
my database so I will click ok and it
will come here
to the fields so here you can choose
what fields you want to show in the
table if you click this module all
fields will come here and all field will
be shown in the report or in the form of
table so now I just wanted to show
employee ID the name then surname and
then age I don't want to show my
username or password or image or gender
so I just want to show these four table
values or four columns so I will click
them and then I will click Next I don't
want to group my fields so I will leave
them as it is and I will click Next and
it will say congratulations you have
successfully created a new report and
then you need to click finish and it
will take some time and to generate a
new report for you
waiting waiting waiting one thing I want
to tell you that whenever you are
running your I put dishonor it takes lot
of memory of your CPU so sometime it
makes your computer a little bit slow so
you can see here you have added employee
ID name surname and age and this is a
default template for our report in the
future you can change this picture or
whatever so for now I have just added
four columns into my report and which
are employee ID name surname and age and
I can tribute my report how it will look
when I generate the report so click this
preview and it will show you the preview
click OK for the password and you can
see all my table will be shown like this
my report will be seen or shown like
this
okay
so in this way this is the simple report
I have created with the help of my
SQLite database and I report and in the
next video I will show you wait a second
I just what I want to do is we click the
save to my spend oh I have already saved
my file so I don't need it I will just
see that it has really generated my
report or not which is first not report
dot JR XML file into my project file
folder it's not opening
so I directly go to my folder and see it
is already generated or not
no I can't see in my file so what I will
do is I will click this Save button and
generally it should save my file but I
don't know yeah now I can see my report
here first report previously when I
looked at it I missed some of this just
by report in my folder so it has created
this JR XML file into my specified
locations I do need to save it once
again so in the next video I will show
you how to open this report with the
help of your NetBeans Java program so
thanks for now and please rate comment
