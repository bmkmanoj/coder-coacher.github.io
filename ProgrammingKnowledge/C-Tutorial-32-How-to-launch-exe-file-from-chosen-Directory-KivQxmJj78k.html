video I will show you how to launch any
executable file with the help of your
c-sharp application so first of all let
me show you what I mean by launching the
exe file so I have this button open exe
file so when I click it and I tell my C
sharp application to open for example
Chrome so just select it and press open
and it will open a Google Chrome browser
in your computer or for example I want
to open this text file so I will just
double click it and it will launch a txt
file for me so in this way any
executable file which is present in your
computer it will be able to open for
example this X el XML file so it has
opened this XML file ok so anything you
want you could be able to launch now we
go to the code section of this button
click event so just take a button from
your toolbox drag it here and rename its
text according to yourself and double
click this button and go at the top we
need to import one file for that which
is using system dot diagnostic so at the
top of your program just declare this
wherever your all using files on it
there so just add this one also
and once again go to your code and in
here I have written the code for opening
an exe file the first few lines are
known to you I think it's a for opening
a file dialog so write open file dialog
and give it a variable name is equal to
new open file dialog break open bracket
closed and if open file dialog which is
this variable dot show dialog bracket is
equal to system dot Windows dot forms
dot dialog result dot okay then in your
if condition you will write string in
which I will copy the path of the
selected file so right string your
variable name file path is equal to open
file dialog which is this variable dot
file name so what this will do is it
will copy the path of the file which you
do select from your open file dialog and
it will place it into this string
variable and then write process dot
start and path this variable so this is
the main code for opening the egg exe
file so just try process dot start and
the path here and when you run it once
again and you want to open any file once
again for example this video and this
will open ok so it has open wide or
any PDF file also if you want you can
open it has opened a PDF file so any
executable file which you can open with
the double-click in your computer I
think you will be able to open with this
button so I hope you have enjoyed this
video please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
