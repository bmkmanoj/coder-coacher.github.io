last video I have shown you how to open
a folder by clicking your table so I
click my table and my folder containing
my specific file is open now today I
will show you how to open a web page in
your web browser using a button or using
your menu item or anything so let's get
started so I have taken a button for
opening my web page I mean name it as
open web page and now I will right-click
it event action action performed and
here I have already taken all already
made my try-catch blocks so you can make
a type try-catch block first and then in
the try catch block you have to write
string you whatever your string name is
I mean limited URL because in this we
are going to type our URL so
for example if you want to open I want
to open Google search by clicking a
button so I will copy my URL from my web
browser this is my URL HTTP
www.google.com and I will go and paste
in between my double quotes so you can
do that and in the next line you to
write Java dot a WP dot
X stop not get desktop dot
Brow's so you write Java dot a WT but
text or not get desktop dot browse and
in browse the racket
you have to write once again job dot net
dot you are I
God create and in create bracket your
URL variable name so this I think this
and paste it here it doesn't come
automatically so believe it or not this
is a tube line code from this you can
open your web browser
whenever click your button so let's try
and run our program this is my open web
browser page or button so I will click
it and see my Google page is open Google
search page is open automatically so so
you can try this code and this code can
be used in many applications for example
you want to show your website in to the
software to your software or you have a
web page or forum you can just add it in
the menu items or by in the button
action perform also you can add it and
this is very useful for various
applications so I hope you have learned
something new today and please rate
