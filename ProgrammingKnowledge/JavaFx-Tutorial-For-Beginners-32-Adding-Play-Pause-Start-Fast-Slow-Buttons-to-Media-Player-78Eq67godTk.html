Java fixed roll for beginners in the
last video I've shown you how you can
create a media player using Java effects
now in this video I'm going to show you
how we can add some more functionality
to your media player for example you
want to add some buttons like play pause
want to play your video in a faster rate
or slower rate or you want to reload
your video how you can do it I'm going
to show you in this video so let's get
started first of all go to your main
controller class which we have created
in the last video so you need to you
know go through the last video in order
to catch up with this video okay so in
the last video we have written this code
to load our video and then auto play our
video right now we are going to create
some methods to a play pause and other
functionalities right so first of all we
are going to create these methods so
just right public void and let's say our
method name is play and just add a
action event here and just add an
argument event and inside your method
what we want to do is we want to play
our video so just take your MP or media
player object and then just call a
method called play here okay now in the
last video I have shown you how you can
auto play or enable the auto play
functionality for your media player now
you have your play button so you may not
use this auto play functionality or you
may not wish to use this auto play
functionality so I'm going to comment
this if you want to use it you can play
use it right now in the same way I'm
going to create some more methods one
two three four and the second method
I'm going to name it as pause third
method I'm going to name it as fast and
fourth method I'm going to name it as
slow and the fifth method I'm going to
name it as reload
and I'm going to create two more method
to you know move your video to the start
and the last so the second last method
is start and the last method is lost
okay now for the pause functionality you
just need to call pause function on your
media player object to make your video
fast or run faster what you need to do
is you need to call a method called set
rate which takes a double value so if
you provide here a value of one then
your video will run in a normal speed
right and if you write here too then
your video will run in the double speed
of your normal speed and if you write
here Oh point five then your video will
run in a slower speed which is half the
speed of your original size so this is
our fast function so we'll run it in the
double speed of the normal speed in the
same way we can set the rate for slower
speed so just write 0.5 here which will
run your video in the half speed and
then to load the video you just need to
call a method called seek here and which
takes an argument which is duration
right so you can just call your media
player and then call a method called get
start time so this will you know move
your video to the start right and in the
same way you can just pause the same
function here then your video will be a
move to the start
and for reloading we will add this
function which is play so that your
video will be moved to the start and it
will start playing so just write MP dot
play okay so this will be your read load
function and this will be your start
functionality which will only move your
video to the start but it will not play
right now the next and the last
functionality is the last so we want to
movie do to the last so you just need to
call MP dot seek and as an argument you
just need to write MP dot get total
duration which is the total duration of
your video now in order to stop your
video you can call a method called the
MP dot stop so we can you know in the
method start we can just move the video
to the start and then after this we can
stop our video so just write MP dot stop
here okay so you can add one more button
for this stopping but I am going to just
add this in the start function so you
know I there is a method called stop
from which you can stop the video also
so these are our functions or method
which we want to use now let's open our
main dot F XML file and we will call
these method in the button functionality
so right click on your main dot F XML
file and open with scene builder and in
the scene builder we are going to go to
the containers and we are going to take
the horizontal box and drag and drop at
the bottom of your modern model pane ok
and then we will go to controls and we
will take some buttons one two three
four five and six let's see how many
methods we have one two three four five
six
and so we need one more button so just
take one more button from here and then
add the method name so first button is
play second button is pause third button
is fast for the button is slow fifth
button is reload sixth button is start
and the seventh button is stop okay
now let's add these method to these
buttons so select your first button and
then go to the code property here and
then in on action method here or an
action event here just choose the method
called play from here okay for the pause
just choose pause for the fast just
choose fast and for the slow just choose
the slow method and then for the ly
reload choose reload for the start
choose the start and for the stop choose
the stop stop we don't have right so we
need to name it as lost right we have
the last method so just choose the lost
method okay and then save your code and
then refresh your projects right click
and refresh and then run your
application once again and now you can
see you have buttons in your you know
applications right so for example I want
to play my video I can just
press the play button so it will play my
video and now I'm going to pause it so
this is going to pause my video now if
you want to play the video in the faster
rate we will see this functionality in a
moment but let's reload the video so
just click this reload button and it's
going to reload it and play it now let's
press the start button and it's going to
you know place your video to the
starting position and let's press the
last button is going to place your video
to the last position right let me
minimize my volume a little and once
again play it and now it's playing okay
now in order to play your video faster
you need to press this button so let me
increase the volume and let me press
this button and you can just hear it so
it's playing faster which is 2 times
faster than the normal rate and now you
can press slow button and now it's
playing slow okay but when you press
play once again here is also playing in
the same rate so this time in the play
button you need to add the functionality
to set the rate to the 1 or original
rate so you just need to go to your play
button and here you just need to write
MP dot set rate and you need to you know
add one here which will play your video
in the original rate ok and run it and
you can check the functionality once
again so in this way you can add these
extra functionalities to your media
player and maybe I will add one more
video to you know add volume bar and
other functionality
I don't know if I'm going to make this
video or not but stay tuned and please
