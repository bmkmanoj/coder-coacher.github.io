last video I have shown you how you can
connect a combo box from your C shop
windows form application to a column or
database table column values and
populate your combo box with the column
values in your database table so I have
shown you this how to populate these
values from the database in the combo
box now in this video I am going to show
you for example you select some name in
the combo box for example Paul his
employee ID his name Paul his last name
and pay should come here and same will
happen for other names also so I want to
show you how you can select any name
from the combo box and show the
corresponding values in these text boxes
so let's see how we can do it so we have
this combo box what we don't need to do
is if you haven't seen my last video to
populate the combo box you can just see
it and you will know how I populated
this okay so I will select this combo
box which I have taken from the last
video double click it and we will reach
to the combo box one selected index
change event ok now in here I'm going to
paste my code from the last video
because most of the code will remain
same so I will just go to this form load
email event which in which we have
written our code in the last video and
once again I will go to this combo box
and double click this combo box and in
here I will paste all the code
and if you don't know this code just
partial the last videos and otherwise
you can just pause this video and copy
it
okay so I have explained this code many
times now so I hope you are till now you
have understood all these basic things
like connection commands and and the
query okay so if you don't even know
this then just copy it okay and my query
this time I will change it to select
star or Astrix from the database so it
will give me all the values from the
database table okay and this only led
the reader is equal to command execute
reader will remain same and in the while
loop we have this reader which reads the
value one by one right and we didn't
know what don't need this combo box
because we have already seen in the last
video now in the while loop what we need
to do is we will declare some string
variables so I will declare some string
variable so I will declare the string
variable for employee ID first name last
name and pay okay for write a I D is
equal to and similarly I will do this
for the first name first first name last
name and the pay okay now what I will do
now with these variable I will
call the values or I will take the
values from the database and transfer it
in these variables okay so what I'm
going to do I will write here my LED
will read a name and then this square
square bracket which will take the index
or the column name okay and then to
string so the first column name I want
to take is employee ID so let me open my
database and I will show you then and
similarly I will do this for the first
name last name and the pay okay so I
will open my database and in here you
can see the first column name is Eid
second column name is first name last
name and we want to show the page which
is this one right so I will just copy
these names or you can just write these
names here EW
column name for the first field then
here will come this okay okay and the
second column name is first name so this
will come here and last name column name
and the pay column name right we want to
show the paid column right so what we
have done we have transferred the values
which we read from the database to the
string all actually you can do it in a
better way you in which you don't even
need to declare these values but yeah
whatever result you will get from the
database it will be converted to the
string by using this two string and what
you can do here instead of writing
string
EW you can just copy the name of this
tech box in which you want to show the
employee ID when you select some
corresponding name you can just write e
ID text box name dot text okay and
similarly you can do it for the first
name last name and pay just go to your
form just copy the name of the first
name text box last name text box and the
pay text box right so this will make
your code a little bit simpler and
smaller so what we had done we already
know that this reader reads the values
from the database when it executes this
command because we are executing the
Select query we expect some data from
the database and this s Trix will is a
wild-card which will give us all the
column values from the table to us and
this Vida will read the value and in
this while loop we are reading the
values one by one until and unless this
reader dot read goo is false because
this returns a boolean value right now
it will read until and unless you you
you have these values from the database
now what we want here is we want to show
the values on the basis of the data
selected in the combo box right so in
here we will modify our query like this
select extra Costra from the database
where
where your name or first name which is
this one this should be first name not
the Eid so this should be first named
where first name is equal to then give
this single quotes and this double
quotes and this plus so this will
concatenate the strings and in here you
will give the name of your combo box
which is combo box 1 and dot txt okay so
what this will do is whatever value of
name you will select from the combo box
it will replace this value from this
combo box 1 dot txt and then it will
where from where comes this text page
this should be this first name right
okay so this first name is equal to the
combo box name whatever name you will
select from the combo box right and then
whatever value is in the combo box you
select it will be compared with the
first name in the database and then it
will give you the result so let's try
and run the program and I need to close
this otherwise we give us the problem
and now we give the username and
password it's correct and you see all
the names are listed here and let's for
example I will select some name here
and you see the values are listed here
okay let's compare it from our database
open so I have selected this name Julie
which whose employee ID is 3 and surname
is this Calais and the pay is $56 per
power and you can see it here the same
corresponding data right you can choose
some other name for example mark and you
see the employee ID this one and the
last name is this one and pay is $34
okay so in this way you can select any
name and it will give you the
corresponding values in these text boxes
so I hope you have enjoyed this video

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
