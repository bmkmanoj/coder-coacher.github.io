tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how we can declare a method in Java and
what is a method and why it's used now
in this video we will see some more
properties we can add to a method one I
am going to show you is called passing
parameters to the method and other is
called the returning values from a
method so this was the simple method I
have shown you in the last video now it
doesn't solve much of the purpose
because every time it's not flexible
it's only printing hello YouTube every
time now to make it more flexible we can
add an argument to this function we have
made in the last video so the
declaration remains same public static
is the access specifier void is the
return value void means we are natural
returning no value and the name of our
function is this one and in these round
brackets we will pass our parameter in
just a moment and in here in these curly
braces we write our statement so for
example we want to greet some persons
based upon their names so we can pass an
argument to this function like this so
we will pass the name in the form of
string variable so we just give the
datatype first and then we give the
value or a variable name which we want
to pass so we can say name okay so this
kind of declaration inside your round
bracket in the function is called the
parameter passing okay and this
parameter name which is a string you can
use inside your function so if you want
to say hello or whatever name is
to the function then it will you know
print that name so whenever we call this
function say hello to the main method
for example we call the name John then
it will greet hello John okay
so I will run the program and it says
hello John and this function can be used
to greet more than one function for
example John
Tom or for example some other name mark
for example and look greet all three
names hello John hello Tom and hello
mark
okay so this makes our function a little
bit flexible in a way that we can you
know use it according to our use okay
the other use of this function we can
use it to add for example of a with
integer so here you can pass any number
of parameter no it's not necessary that
you need to pass only one parameter you
can pass multiple parameters in here in
as in parameter right so how we can do
this we will declare one more function
for example public this should be public
static void because we are not returning
anything and now we will make a function
call ad which we want to add two values
in using this function okay and in here
we can pass multiple values whatever
number of values you want to add for
example in the a comma int B for example
we want to add these two values and
print the result what we can do is we
can just print these values by calling a
plus B so just to write a plus B okay
and what this will do whatever you pass
as an argument here and here that will
add these two values and print on the
terminal right so when I run this
program first of all I need to call this
ad function I will delete this say hello
from the main and I will call this ad
function and for example I want to add
two integers and this is hundred and two
zero one for example I want to add and I
will run the program and it prints the
result which is three zero one using
this code okay and now I want to add
some more integers for example I want to
add some values and some other values
and I can do it with the same function
so this makes your job really easy using
a same function you can add different
values or you can perform different
operations on different values right so
it makes your code really you know
readable and understandable at the same
time now you can add more in parameters
like in C and you can add this parameter
here and in here you can add some more
integer values like this okay so it
depends upon you how many parameters you
want to pass to your function and it
will give you the result okay so it's
totally dependent upon you the only
thing is you just need to give the
datatype and the variable which will
hold these values so indirectly whenever
you pass 100 as a first parameter
hundred is equal to 100 becomes a here
and it goes here okay
so the value of a becomes 100 and value
of B becomes to zero one in this here
and value of C becomes two one one here
so they will be replaced and they will
be called and the answer will be printed
on the console okay now to make it more
flexible this is called parameter
passing but you know we can only pass
the values and if we want to access the
result using these parameter passing we
cannot access the results so for example
we want to use this result 5 1 2 in our
main function
to you know do some other earth Matic
operation how we can use it ok so it's
using this function it's not possible
right but there is a way to do this and
the way to do this is by returning some
value so we will modify this add
function a little right now it's a
returning void void means it is not
returning anything but when we want to
use it inside our main function
when we want to use the result inside
our main function we can reserve return
integer value okay and this return value
will tell what kind of value you want to
return from your function and the same
you will return from here so just write
return and just write a it should be a
plus B plus C ok and in this way what
you are basically doing is you are
taking all the values with which you
pass from or in these in this function
and you are adding this and you are
returning from this
so let us take an example of this so let
us comment this system out for now and
right now what we are doing is we will
just add the values we are passing these
three values and we will return and
whenever a function return anything you
can store it in other variable but of
the same type so the data type of the
returning value and the value in which
you want to store the returned value
should be same so this is integer and
this is integer or int right and you can
call this add function and paste it here
and what this basically do is this will
add 100 or this will replace a as 100 B
as to 0 1 C as to 1 1 and will add these
two values and it will return this sum
and you can store this sum in some other
variable okay and then you can print
this value like this so you can call
some and this will give you or you can
access this value inside your main
function like this so this is due to
this and if you want to do some other
arithmetic operation on this sum you can
do it for example end result sum x for
example 15 you want to do you can do it
like this and this should be equal to
and you can call your sum like this and
you can just run the program it will
give you the multiplication of whatever
sum you will get from the add function
adding these 3 numbers and then you can
do some arithmetic operations on the sum
you get as a result
and you can multiply it by or whatever a
dramatic operation you want to do and
you can store this result in another
variable and you can use it so in this
way the function or methods made it
really easy to you know organize your
code and make it really concise really
readable really understandable and it
also makes your code you know prettier
so I hope you have understood the basic
concept of passing parameters like these
and returning values like these okay in
the same way you can make any logic
using this function for example
multiplication you can make a function
to make multiplication you can make a
function to you know do divisions you
can add two numbers to you can subtract
two numbers or any complicated you know
or thematic or logical or anything you
want to do you can do it inside a
function and you can take arguments or
parameters here and you can return the
results so that you can use it in your
main method so I hope you have
understood the basic concept of taking
parameters or passing parameters to a
method and returning values from a
method I hope you understood the concept
and please rate come in as a prime and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
