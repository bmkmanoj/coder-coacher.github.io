show you how to use switch cases in
c-sharp as we have seen if statement
switch statement is also a conditional
statement so if any condition is true
the code related to that condition will
be executed so let's see how we can use
switch cases for the starting code what
I'm doing is I'm making this code for
the students who got some marks and on
the basis of marks got by student I want
to show some messages so what I am doing
is I am just printing on the screen
please enter the student marks and then
what I am doing is I am taking the input
from the user and I am converting it to
the int value by this intered pass and I
am saving it in to this variable called
marks now on the basis of user entered
marks I want to show some messages so
let's see how we can use switch state
switch statement to perform our task the
switch statement starts from the keyword
switch and with this bracket and in this
bracket your condition comes now in our
case our condition is marks on the basis
of marks we are going to print messages
right now after this brackets you need
to give these two curly brackets
brackets to open and close switch case
statement and inside these curly braces
we write this cases which can be
possible so for example case 90 if
student get 90 marks then I want to
right on the screen on console dot right
and I will print this message on the
screen
excellent okay now after every switch
case we can use an optional break so all
right break here so this break what this
break does is it whenever some condition
is true then this code is performed and
it breaks out of the switch statement
and it goes directly here and it
performs the other code which is written
after this switch statement okay so in
this way I will just copy this switch
statement and paste it three more times
and if the student gets for example 60
marks I will say very good and if the
student gets 30 marks then I can write
need improvement okay so if the student
will get the 90 marks I will just show
this egg's excellent message if the
student gets 60 marks I will show very
good and if the student gets 30 marks I
will show need improvement and what this
break does is if the condition is true
it immediately print this message and it
will break the switch cases so break we
can use to go out of these switch case
now for example the user has entered
some values which is not ninety sixty or
thirty then for dealing with such cases
we use default default and what this
default does is it catches all the
exception or all the values which are
not in these condition which are not
provided in these cases okay so this is
the default case for us and in the
default case I will just write for
example I will just copy this paste it
here and default case I will say please
and valid value okay so in the default
case this is the default case and in
this default case whatever which is not
in this case is whatever condition which
is not followed in this case or this
case or this case or any other case will
fall into this default okay so now let's
try and run the code and I will enter
the students marks for example 90 and
press enter it shows me the message
excellent right for example I will enter
the marks
60 it shows me very good and as in the
same way when I will enter 30 it will
give me needed improvement but let's see
what happens when we enter some value
which is not belonging to these cases
for example 75 and it says please enter
the valid values okay so any value which
is not 90 60 or 30
or whatever you enter in this cases will
not be followed and it will directly go
into this default case and this message
will be printed and in here in a similar
way you can write some function or you
can call some some functions you can
perform some calculation some some code
you can write so it's not necessary that
you should only print the value you can
perform some calculation you can do some
maths you can call some functions so
anything which you would like you can do
it inside this switch cases now for
example if you don't want to use break
it's also okay but what will happen then
is it will not break here your program
will not break here but wherever it sees
or your your switch case see is the
first break and whenever the condition
is true it will show this message so for
example I will just remove this break
and this message and this break in this
message then what do you think what will
happen in this case because we don't
have problem why did the break and when
you enter 90 it will directly show this
message which is need improvement
because it doesn't see break here it
doesn't see break here and it will see
that first break comes here then it will
just show need improvement so this is a
small thing which happens in switch
statement if it doesn't see this break
point it goes to the next case now for
example I want to print the same message
I can write like this
whatever is the mob okay so now I can
write mark entered and when I run the
program and for example I will and
ninety
it says marks entered ninety which is
this message right because it jumps to
the next case sixty and it sees there is
no break it jumps to thirty and it sees
yes
here is a break so I need to print this
right so switch case box like this it
goes to the next case if the break is
not provided so in this way you can use
switch cases in c-sharp I hope you have
