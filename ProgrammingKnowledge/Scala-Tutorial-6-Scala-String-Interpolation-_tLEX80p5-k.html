Scala tutorial for beginners and in this
video we will learn how to use string
interpolation in Scala
so in Scala string interpolation means
that we want to replace a defined
variable in a given string with some
value so let's get started and let's see
how we can do it so for example I will
define a constant variable here so let's
say the variable name is name itself and
I will define a name called mark for
example okay and I will define one more
variable and the variable name will be
age and the age will be for example 18
so I want to print the name and age of
this person using print line there are a
few ways of using this variable inside
our print line function and we will do
this using string interpolation so the
first way of doing this is by
concatenation so you can just say for
example name the variable name and then
is and once again the this plus symbol
which means concatenation and then age
and then once again last symbol and then
double quotes use oh so there this is
the first way of using these variable
inside this print line function so you
can use this concatenation plus symbol
which means just do the concatenation of
this variable plus this constant string
Plus this age variable and then plus
years old and let's run this code and
let's see what happens and it prints
mark is 18 year old right I can give her
space and once again run it and it will
print mark is 18 year old so this is one
way of printing your variables using
print line but Scala support three more
types of string
interpolations and we will see this
right now so the first way of string
interpolation is using s before your
strings so for example I just used this
s character before these double quotes
and then I can just write the dollar
symbol and the name variable name and
then I can just write is once again
dollar symbol and then age and space
years old okay so this is called as
string interpolation and using this kind
of interpolation we can directly use
these variables using dollar symbols
inside the string so this is called s
string interpolation and when I run the
code let's see what's the result is and
result is the same the second way of
using string interpolation is by using f
string interpolation so this one this
above interpolation is not typesafe so
we are using the string variable here
also an age variable here also right but
for example if you want to construct our
string in a Steiff safe manner we use f
string interpolation so you use f before
your string and then your variable name
dollar and then the variable name and
then you provide the type of that
variable for example name is of type s
so we provide this percentage s symbol
after it after the variable name and
this kind of string interpolation you
have seen in C programming also so
basically by this percentage s we mean
that we want to provide string variable
before this dollar as symbol now in the
case of age because age is an integer we
can just provide for example dollar D
here so just write dollar D for integer
and then we will run the code once again
and it will show us the same result
right so this kind of a string
interpolation is called F string
interpolation now let's say this age
would be for example eighteen point five
right so this becomes the decimal value
or a float value and now this notation
will give us errors so it will not even
compile and it says type mismatch found
double requires and for double or float
we can use F symbol here and then you
can see this error is gone so this one
is type safe so we provide specifically
what type of variable we want to print
here okay now the next type of string
interpolation is called raw
interpolation so let me give you an
example so I will just write print Ln
and then here I will just write for
example hello world and I want to print
world on the next line so I will just
provide backslash and for the next line
and here I will just write s so this is
as string interpolation but for example
I will just use the third kind of string
interpolation which is raw string
interpolation which we can write it like
this so you just use this raw keyword
before your string and let's see what is
printed in both the cases so I'm going
to run the code and let's see what
happens so you can see in the result in
the case of raw string interpolation
this backslash n is not escaped so it
just print this string literally in a
raw form so it doesn't print on the next
line this world keyword it prints all
the string literally but in the case of
s string interpolation the escaping do
takes place that's why the world is
printed on the next line so this is how
we can use string interpolation in Scala
one more thing I just want to tell you
here is how to
menti Oh God so you can comment your
code as in Java you can use double
forward slashes here to comment your
code or you can use this for slash
Astrix and at the end
Astrix forward slash to comment your
code so this double forward slash is
used whenever you want to comment one
line of code for example and this
forward slash Astrix a strict forward
slash is used when you have multiple
lines of comments if you want to comment
multiple lines then you can use four
slash Astrix Asterix forward slash so
that's it for this video please rate
