show you how you can use arrays in C++
so let me show you how you can declare
array in C++ but first of all this is a
good question what is an array an array
is a variable which can contain more
than one values or as the name suggests
it can contain an array of values now
let's see how we can declare array if
the declaration is same as the variable
declaration for example int my array the
name of the array and then you need to
give how much or how many elements the
array will contain so this square
bracket the square bracket in this
square bracket you need to define how
many element this array will contain so
for example I will define 3 here then
C++ code will know that yeah I have
assigned the 4 I have a place or I have
this of the 3 element array in the
memory so it will assign 3 spaces in the
memory to your array right now in order
to initialize array or in order to
initialize array with the values what
you can do is you can initialize arrays
in different forms but the most basic
form is called array initializer list
okay so I will show you how you can
initialize a river with array
initializer based just give equal to and
then these curly braces and in this
curly braces you can give the value of
the array element by element now for
example I will give the values 36 45 64
and we close it so this means that my
array contains 3 values and the elements
of the array of values of the arrays are
36:40 5.64 so these three values are
called
elements of the RN and there is
something called index of the array
which is the position of element in RN
and the position of element in arraign
start from zero not from one so index of
this array is or index of this element
is zero index of this element is 1 and X
of this element is 2 now in order to
print array what you can simply do is
see out or in order to access the value
of an array you just copy the name of
the array give the square bracket and
give the index of the value you want to
print right so now this means we have
given here the element 0 we want to
access the element 0 from the array and
from here we can we know that 0th
element or element with index 0 is 36 so
this should print 36 ideal let's fill
the program and let's see what happens
I'll run the program and it gives me 36
that's true now for example I want to
print 64 here the index of 64 is 2 right
so I will write 2 here tell the program
and run it and you can see 64 is printed
here now in order to assign values to
array in a different manner what you can
do is
you can just assign values like this so
you can just copy the name of the array
just give the switch square bracket TM 0
and you can provide the value of another
for example 34 in this way also you can
initialize the element of our array so
this means that assign on the Z index 0
the value 34 ok so you can do a copy and
paste it three times and on the index 1
and on the index 2 we will assign some
different value 45 64 and now for
example I will run the program it will
works as same as before you can see 64
is printed by pub now if you are array
will contain more elements for example
10 elements and 20 elements then you
cannot assign your array like this and
you can also it will be tedious for you
to initialize all your array with an
array initializer list so what you can
do is you can initialize your array with
3 routes also so how you can do it just
give a for loop as I have shown you how
to use for loop and just declare
variable int is equal to 0 and the limit
of the array for example my array will
contain 15 elements okay so I will
initialize my I from 0 because index of
array starts from 0 right and then I
will say if I is less than or equal to
14 because this is 15 and our index
start from 14 then the value will go up
to fifth 14 okay including 15 we have
including 0 we have
values right that's why I have written
14 here one less than this because we
are starting from zero and then I will
say if I plus plus and then I will give
these curly braces and in here I will
say assign value of x so I will say X
not X but I is equal to some value so
what you can assign for example 67 and
in order to print this value you can
just write C out I and then you can just
give some string and you can just care
you can print the I element of the array
like this and now when I run the program
build it and run it to see here it's it
has assigned some values I have forgot
to add the end L and line so now it will
be more clear when I run the program now
you can see here we have assigned 67 to
each and every value in M in the array
so in this way also you can assign value
to the array so I hope you have
understood the basic concept of array
how you can initialize already and how
you can assign values in the array so
that's it for now please wait for minute
stripe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
