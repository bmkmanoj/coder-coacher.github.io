tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use autocomplete textview in
android auto complete text you is just
like normal edit text
but the main advantage or main feature
of this textview is it will give you
some suggestion while typing some text
inside this textview so let's get
started
first of all I have this blank project
and in here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to search for autocomplete text
view in the export category here so this
is autocomplete text you just drag and
drop into your activity and then you can
in change the ID or you can even change
the text inside this I'm going to leave
this text as empty and I'm going to
leave this ID as it is okay and if you
want you can just change the property of
this autocomplete text to you as a
layout width I will change it to match
parent okay so that it fills the parent
right so just change the width layout
bit to match parent and it will be
resized now what we are going to do is
we are going to go to our main activity
Java folder here of a Java file here and
in here first of all we will define
autocomplete textview instance so just
write auto complete text view and then
just give the in name of this variable I
will name it as AC text
view for example and then for showing
some lists inside this autocomplete text
view for the list of suggestion what you
can do is you can define a string array
so I will define a string array and for
example we want to enter some country
names inside this text view and we want
some suggestions okay so depending upon
the characters we insert in this text
view we want to match them to the
country name characters and then give us
the suggestion okay so I will name my
variable s and I will initialize this
string array by some values so I'm not
going to take every country name just
some country names which start from a
okay you can extend this array by taking
you know each and every country name or
array of your choice and then what we
are going to do is we are going to take
this auto control text view and we will
just find the ID of the auto control
text view from our activity main dot XML
you
now of what we are going to do is first
of all we need to create an adopter or
re adopter which we can you know set to
this autocomplete textview
so let's declare this array adopter
variable array adopter adopter is equal
to new array adopter and this takes
three argument first is the context
second is the style so we will take the
style from Android Android dot r dot
layout dot
simple dialogue item okay and then the
third argument we will pass it as our
array string array and now once our
adopter is created or our dr. instance
is created we just need to set two
things one is we just need to set so
just take your array adapter instance
from here dot set threshold and what
this threshold does is it you know it
takes an argument which is an integer so
for example we give argument as 1 so it
will wait your arrow area dr. textview
will wait for one character to show the
hints right if we enter here - then your
array adopter text view will wait for
two character to be entered and then it
will show the suggestion or hints okay
so it depends upon you how many
characters you want to enter to get the
suggestions okay and the second thing is
we just need to set this adopter so just
use your use this variable textview
autocomplete textview dot set adopter
and we will set the same adopter which
we have created here okay
so this is the code now we are going to
just run our program so now our app is
running and we just need to check
whether it works or not so let's check
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
enter some country name with start from
a for example a it shows me this hint so
because we have set here
set threshold as one so we will get the
suggestion whenever we enter our first
character like this okay and for example
I want to search a are I get the two
countries suggestion Argentina Argentina
and Armenia for example I want to search
for a you
it gives me two options or I can search
for a said it gives him one option so in
this way you can create a autocomplete
text view and you know you can provide
the hints according to your array and in
this way you can use Auto compute
complete text view in Android so I hope
