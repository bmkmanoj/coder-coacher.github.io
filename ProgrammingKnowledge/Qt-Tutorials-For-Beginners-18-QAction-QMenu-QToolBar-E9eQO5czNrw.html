cutie tutorial for beginners and in this
video we will see how we can use cue
action class in cutie so what is cue
action class first of all the cue action
class provides an abstract user
interface action that can be inserted
into widgets so for example you want to
make a menu so what is a menu menu is
something like this so you can see file
and then you have some menu item in the
menu right and then you also have the
toolbar toolbar is something like this
you can see this welcome I can add it or
design or project all this kind of you
know bar is called tool bar right now
sometimes you want that some action
should be present here also in the menu
item and also in the tool bar for
example and you are performing the same
action by both the bars tool bar and
menu bar but maybe you need to write the
same code two times but cue action class
provides this abstract interface for you
so that it can be used in both the
places and the menu and in the toolbar
so let me give in a you an example so I
have created a sample project which is a
blank project and I'm going to open a
main window dot UI file and in here you
can see you by default I have this main
window class and you have the option for
choosing the menu bar so whenever you
create a project with main window then
you have automatically this menu bar
here and also the tool bar here right so
here you can just go here and type
something in this space which says type
here so I'm going to type some menu item
for example
file and click enter and then I can
choose some menu item for example new
and press ENTER and then I can choose
for example open and press enter and
let's say I choose exit right and press
enter here so this is how you can you
know add menu items to your menu bar
right now as soon as you add these menu
items you can see in this little space
here there are some actions created
whenever you create these menu items
right so the action for new is this
action new and action for open is action
open and action for exit is action exit
right now what you can do here is you
can also add it the menu actions from
here so you can just double click here
and you can see the text for the menu
then the object name for word about menu
and then this is the tooltip you can
even choose the icon here so let's add
some resources and let's add some icon
so I already have shown you how you can
add the resources so you go to your
project and then right click on your
project and then go to add new and in
here go to QT choose QT resource file
and then click Choose and then give the
name of your resource folder for example
resource itself and then click Next and
we want to add it to our projects so
just click finish ok so this adds this
resource folder here and then first of
all we will add the prefix here prefix
can be for example re C for example and
then press Enter
and this is your prefix and I want to
add some images here so I have already
some images in the project folders when
I am right click on any of the file here
and I will click show in Explorer you
can see here I have created this image
folder which is created by me and I have
some images here so you can find some
images online and you know create this
folder and place your images there right
so in here I'm going to just add those
files so I am going to just say add
files and I'm going to just go to my
image folder and choose all these three
files right click OK and these files are
added here right and then I'm going to
go to my main window dot UI and in here
I can choose the icons once again I'm
going to go to these actions and I will
go here in the new and I will click this
and choose resource and in the images I
can choose the icons here so for nunu
and click OK
so this icon is added once again for
open also I'm going to add the icon this
one is the icon for open and then for
exit so let's choose the icon for exit
which is this one okay
and now when you see them automatically
these icons are added to your menu items
right now the same actions you want in
the toolbar also so this action class
makes it really easy so what you can do
is you can just choose this new action
and drag and drop in your toolbar here
you can see right here and just drop it
here
right so this this is the same action
which we can see here in the new right
so second action which is for open and
the third action which is 4x
right now in order to provide some code
for the action what you can do you can
just right-click on any action and then
go to slots just click go to slot here
and by default it will select triggered
so just choose this triggered slot and
click OK and in here for example new
triggered let's add first of all some
message class so just add hash include'
queue message box ok so just write queue
message box so that we can use this
class so just write queue message box
and let's say we want information so
just choose information and then it
takes three arguments first is this
second is the title and the third is the
message so I'm just going to say new
here you can perform any message or any
code here I'm just going to show you the
demo right so the third is the message
right in the same way I can go to open
and go to its slot triggered and in here
again I can just show the message open
and in the third case which is exit I
will go to the slot triggered and here I
can just say cue application for example
cue application and then I can just quit
the application by this write something
like this okay so let's run our app and
let's see what happens so I'm going to
just compile it and run it and when it
will be build we are going to see what
happens when you choose the toolbar
items and menu
our items right so our project is almost
running so you can see here I have this
these menus new open exits when I click
new it shows me this message new and
when I click this toolbar item also it
shows me the same message right and when
I click this open icon here it shows me
open and from here also from the menu
bar also it shows me the same you know
message here right and when I click this
close it's going to quit the
applications when I click this one our
application is closed right so in this
way you can use to action class in QT I
