on Microsoft Access database tutorial
for beginners in the last video I have
shown you how to create a database and
how to create table and how to design
your table with different column types
now in this video I'm going to show you
how to use some properties in Microsoft
Access and I will also show you how you
can create your form using Access
database so let's get started so I have
filled some data in my database this is
the database which we have weighted last
time so our database name was employee
info and the table name was a employee
data and this contains some data now you
have some properties by which you can
manipulate this data for example you
want to arrange this data for example
this first name column in ascending
order starting from a and ending to the
say Z right so how you can do it just
select the column and click this button
ok to set ascending and then your names
will be ascending it will be in
ascending order okay you can do it
descending order also led to a just
click this button and you can do it for
any column so for example I want to
order my column in ascending order
just select the column and click this
button and there is something called the
filter so for example you select some
column and press some it press this
filter
you can filter these column values
according to the Sprinter for example
you whatever rows you want to see you
just check them and other rows you can
uncheck them and click OK and you can
see here your data is filtered according
to your filter and when you press this
toggle filter and your poll data will
come there's also if here some little
buttons if you are able to see here here
also you can filter your data right you
can order your column ascending or
descending and you can just filter your
data like this ok and toggle this you
can also find and replace the data for
example I just select some column and
some low for example this employee ID 7
and I want to change the name of this
column so for example employee ID 8 this
starts with a small letter or so I want
to start the name with a capital letter
so I will just select this row and I
will go to find and replace just I take
this replace button here and I want to
find
Javid and I want to replace it with
capital letter garbage right so and I
will say replace
and it says it can't find it so what you
need to do is here in this look in you
just select employee data which is the
data table name okay and so it will
select the whole table and it will
search in the whole table and not in the
column itself okay and just find it
first and you find this name and you
replace it okay
and once you replace it just close your
window and save your data like this okay
and yeah you can find these values and
there are some advanced stuff also which
you can play with and how you can
discover new properties in this form in
this table now there is something called
forms you can create with the start of
this so what you can do is once you have
saved all this you can close this window
and you can go to this tab called create
and you can create forms with the help
of your a dot out tables which you have
so what you can do is you can take this
form design button and it will give you
this form design so this is for
designing but we want our former to
contain the data table columns which we
have so what you need to do is you can
just select this form here and just
click this form button here and in here
you can see you have this title employee
data
at the table name and you have these
text boxes and labels here it looks like
a form and you can navigate through your
data by these buttons so these are the
buttons you can navigate your daughter
and if you want to punch in new data
what you can do is you can just click
this small button it says new blank
record so when I click this I can enter
a new record so for example I want to
enter a new record but when I want to
enter a new record I need to go or I
need to click this button then only I
will be able to enter the new bottom
there is a form view layout boom and
design.you so inform you you will be
able to enter the data and save the data
in layout view you can change the layout
of your form so in the form you we are
in the form you right now and for
example let's enter some data and
surname and date of birth and the
country you can see here because we have
given a drop-down menu you can use the
top down menu here also and you can give
the phone number here and once you are
done with this you can save this and
click OK and click OK so this is the it
will ask you to save your form and you
can give the name to your form so for
example I can give my form there
employ data form okay and when I click
OK here it will create this form here
for me and I can toggle to this employed
at a table and employ data form so when
I click this I want to close this first
and I will just right-click my employee
data table and I will say open and in
here you see you will have this new data
which you have entered in the form so
once again I close this table and I can
go to the form right click it and open
it and I can click this button new blank
record and I can enter the name record
okay so for example from new record and
the date of birth and the country let
the drop down menu and the phone number
and just save this data and once again
go to the table open it and you can see
this new data right there in the table
also so you can create this form you can
create this table I hope you understood
the concept of this form making form and
in the next video I will show you how to
query your database and reports so stay
tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
