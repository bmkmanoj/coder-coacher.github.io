last video I have shown you how to use
pointers in C++ and how you can declare
pointers in C++ now in this video I am
going to show you how you can use
pointer with regard to functions in my
earlier videos I have shown you how you
can pass arguments in functions and that
specifically is called passed by a value
so what I have shown you in the earlier
videos for example you create a function
pass by value for example and you are
passing some variable here well and for
example you have well is equal to
hundred okay and whenever you declare
one more variable X is equal to 20 here
and when you call this function here
pass by value and we pass X in this
function and we try to print X here what
happens is whenever you pass X here the
value of x is passed in this function
but the not the address of the X or
address of this variable that means you
are not passing this variable itself you
are just passing the value contained by
this variable so whenever you try to
print this X once again even though here
we are assigning well is equal to 100
what happens is the value will remain
same so let me compile the program and
run the program and the value is still
20
even though we have passed this X here
and we have assigned 100 is equal to
value so ideally what should happen is
the value of X should be 100 but because
we have passed the value of X and not
the X itself or not the not the address
of X's itself it just cannot change the
value contained inside X it just sends
the copy of the value and that's why the
value of this X remains same now for
example you want to show all you want to
change the value of x itself when you
call it inside the function what you can
do is I will declare a variable called
the Y first is equal to xx itself and
I'm going to just declare one more
function which I will call pass by
reference and how you can pass by
reference just pass the address of the
variable and what I have shown you in
the last video what is the definition of
a pointer a pointer is a variable whose
value is the address of another variable
so this will contain the address of
another variable pool whatever variable
you will pass here right so now what
will happen is once again I will copy it
and paste it here pass by reference this
is passed by reference now and what I am
going to do is I will pass Y here
not why but the address of Y by Y
because a pointer always takes the
address of the variable right that's why
I have written and here and this
together means that we are passing the
address of Y and not the value of y but
the address of Y and once again when we
try to print Y this time let's try to
print Y this point this should be
pointer because I am copying I forgot to
give pointer here and once again I will
we compile the program and I will run
the program and now you see what happens
in in the first case when we pass the
value the value of x did not change and
it remain 20 right but when we pass by a
reference that means we have passed the
address so this address will never
change and we have passed the address
when and we are changing the value
inside that address so that this value
in the same address will be hundred now
so will be replaced by hundred instead
of 20 so now this will show you hundred
here so whenever you change want to
change the value of the variable
whenever you pass it in the function you
use passed by reference and whenever you
want to just give or just give the copy
of the value you just give or you just
pass it by a value so I hope I am able
to clear this to you and I hope you
