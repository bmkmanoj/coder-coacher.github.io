you about basics of variables and I have
also shown you how to declare the
variable and how to use variable and in
this video I am going to show you how
you can use those variable more
efficiently and we are going to make a
simple calculator using these variable
concepts so if you have watched the last
video you may ask that if you want to
initialize these value for example this
and this why do we even declared X and Z
here we can directly we would have or we
could have written this and this and it
will be the same right so why do we even
declare these variables if we can do it
like this so let me give you an example
of the simple calculator and you will be
able to understand why we have declared
these variables so in this video I am
going to show you how user can enter
their values and these values will not
be constant user will be able to decide
what values you want to add and subtract
ok so let me add it this first and then
I will show you the example so in the
first line I have declared two variables
X and Z and then second line I will
write C out insertion operator and I
will say please enter first
number equal to okay and I will say and
L and in the second line I will write C
in I haven't told you about the earlier
this C in so what this C in does it it
takes input from the user so C out
prints output as the name suggests out
means output and in means take the input
okay and here I will say this C in
insertion operator X so whatever user
will enter the value it will be placed
or it will be contained in the variable
X okay in the same way I will just copy
it and paste it below and I will say
sorry so I will say please enter the
second number and this time we will hold
the second number in the variable said
okay and now once we have those two
values which is entered by the user we
can subtract it or we can just sum it
sum is equal to X plus y that's X plus y
or X plus said sorry and you can make
the product also so you can write int
product is equal to X multiplied so how
you write expression for multiplication
just give this Astrix here this s tricks
and just say set so this
astrick or star will multiply these two
variables so we don't write
we don't write X into X or so we can
write X star or s tricks said to
multiply and in the same way we can
divide these two numbers but the
division when you divide two numbers it
can be a float value or it can be a
decimal value so in this time for
division we are going to declare float
because it can be decimal value and we
can say divide is equal to X and this
backslash said okay and now we are going
to print these values so we already have
some and the subtraction I am going to
just copy it and paste it here and just
add it these values so I will say
multiplication is and the vision is this
okay so so this is our whole program
okay I will make it a little bit smaller
so you can see and this will act as a
simple calculator when the user enters
first and second number that spilled our
program built and hopefully there is no
error yes there is no error and now we
are going to run this so just click the
screen button and it says please enter
the first number which is this line it's
printing so I will enter the first
number as
b5 and I will press ENTER and now it
says please enter the second number so I
will enter the second value which is
going to be 34 for example and I will
press Enter
and now you can see the sum is 79 45
plus 34 is 79 the difference or
subtraction is 11 45 minus 34 is 11 the
multiplication is 45 into 34 and the
division is more more interesting is
division is it always when you use this
/all symbol or divide symbol here it
will always divide the values and it
will not show you the remainder okay so
it will only show whatever is the
multiple so 34 you can only divide the
divide it by 1 or and there will be a
remain remainder and remainder will be I
think 11 right so one point something
it's not showing because this only shows
the whole values okay and if you want to
show the remainder let me show you how
you can do it so first of all let me
show you the calculation so when you
divide 45 by 34 you have you divided but
once so this is 1 1 times and you have
the remainder 11 right so right now it's
showing one because 35 times 1 is equal
to 34 34 times 1 is equal to 34 and
remainder is 11 now if you want to show
the remainder you can just write int
remainder is equal to X and then you
need to give this Pleasant a sign and
then said and this expression will show
you that they may endure okay so once
again just I will just copy this and
paste it and I will say this remainder I
will show it here which should be if you
enter 45 and 34 once again then
remainder should be 11 right so I will
build my program and and run it once
again and the first number once again I
am going to enter 45 and 34 and you can
see this time the remainder is 11 so
this will show you the multiple and this
will show you the remainder okay so in
this way you can use this slash symbol
and this percentage symbol so I hope you
have understood this basic calculation
the application and I hope you have
enjoyed this video please rate comment
