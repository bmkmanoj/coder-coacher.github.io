video I will show you how you can
download install and run sample program
from log for CPP so what is lock for CPP
lock bus for CPP is a C++ library from
which you can prepare login files and
sometimes it's really good an essential
for your application to have lock for
CPP so let's get started
and first step you need to do is go to
log for CPP dot
so swash dotnet there you can find
information about log for CPP and what
are the capabilities and how you can
download and install a lock for CPP so
first step is to download the lab
library so go to downloads and click
download page and you will be directed
to the SourceForge repository and you
can download the latest zip file for
lock for CPP so click download and
download in your system there is
something I want to say that I will
install and compile this log for CPP on
my Ubuntu 12.10 operating system so all
the step will be specific to open to
Linux and you can
take a tip from these instruction and
implement on your own operating system
also different operating system so what
you need to do is to download this tar
file and extract it to the folder of
your choice so I have extracted this log
for seed cpp in my home folder of my
Linux operating system ok and now we
once again go to the log for CPP website
of Apple CPP sourceforge.net and here it
says the step steps to configure and
make and make install for the open to
sorry for the c-loc for c++ library so i
have followed these steps and from my
experience what i have faced and what
experience I have with lock C for CPP I
have written this documentation in my
blog my blog name is www dot programming
knowledge block blocks spot not the or
what come and here when you go to the
labels
just click log for CPP this one and it
will open these this procedure what
procedure you need to follow in order to
install and run your first sample
program from lock for CPP so let's get
started from the first step which is
going to the directory of law for CPP
and we will open our terminal and here
we will go to directly which is C D law
for CPP because it's in my home
directory and then type second step is
to configure these this every so I will
write dot slash slash dot configure and
press enter
and it will start configuring this file
into your system
while it's configuring let's see what
next we need to do so I will come to my
long entry on configuring you need to
make this file and make check and make
install okay
so the configuration is done and now the
third step is to make the program so
once again and the terminal type make
and press enter and it will start making
your program
so now your make is also done so next
step is to perform make check
so I will write sudo make check
and press ENTER I will ask for my
password and press enter
and it'll start chicken body of me
so our make Tech is also performed
successfully if our main tech is
performed successfully you can see this
alton test passed the next step is to
install so write sudo make install and
press
and you install block for CPP file into
your system and this is complete also so
our first stage of configuring and
making block for CPP file is complete
now what we will do is we will make a
sample program which is given on the
lock for CP peds website and then we
will compile and run that program so
what I will do first is I will go into
my home folder and I will make a
document length document
and
I will name it as log for cpp dot
not CPP file and
and so this will create a CTP file for
me and then I will open this file and it
must be blank and what I will do is I
will go to log for CPP website
yeah
and
and the bottom have given a sample
example for LA for CPP so we will try to
compile and run this example I will just
copy this sample example
and copy and paste into my blank log for
CPP file which I have made recently okay
and then I will save it my file is saved
now
once again and we go to night ramen and
different CD because my love for CPP
file is my n Mac and folders it and
perform the other steps Anja and clear
the screen and I will go to my blog
entry
for www.premierlawgroup.com the
compliation method and
yeah okay
soon
to compile this love for CPP file or
sample example you need to copy this
command from there from my blog or I
will just show you what to write compile
this law facility and paste it here so
to compile this program you need to
write g + + space - GS ta be s plus
minus w space
- i had us space your log for CPP file
name space
- your log for CPP executable file names
which you want to produce and then space
and log for CPP space - l PT touch read
ok
and then I mean press enter to compile
this CPP file
and yes it's compiled successfully but
first of all I will show you this is the
executable file my program has generated
by compiling this demand g + + command
which you can copy it from my blog and
now we will execute our executable file
which is generated and when you execute
this
is equal to will file it will show an
error which shows that your error while
loading share shared library Lib log for
cpp dot s o dot v cannot open shared
object file no such file or directory
this error will come this error you can
eliminate by this line which is simply
you need to set one environment variable
and then it will compile without any
problem
so you need to write export LD - library
- part this - is under school keep in
mind is equal to slash USR slash bin
slash library so this is the environment
variable you need to set in order to run
this executable file so I will paste it
here and just press Enter and my
environment variable is set and then
once again I will execute my executable
file and and yes it gives me the desired
result
one more thing I want to share with you
is this export-led library - part is
equal to user slash local Lib is a
temporary setting of environment
variable if you want to set permanent
environment variable you need to edit
your bash RC file which also I have
shown you in my blog so for that what
you need to do is
execute this G added slash not bash RC
command and it will open in your bash RC
file and at the bottom of your mesh RC
file you need to write export LD library
path is equal to use a local Lib and
well after that you save that bash RC
pipe and execute this command source
tilde slash dot mesh ah see so it will
set your environment variable
permanently so once again when you open
a new terminal and you want to execute
this log for CP p exe it will not show
this error again ok so I hope you have
learned something new this time about
lock for CPP and I hope you will rate
comment and subscribe and keep watching
these videos thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
