show you how to link a combo box with
your MySQL database using your Visual
Basic windows form application so
basically what I want is I want to
populate a column from my database in
the combo box so let me show you what I
want to do exactly first of all I will
take a combo box from my tool box and I
will change the font size of this combo
box so that we can see the text clearly
and now what I want to do is let me show
you my database first for example this
is my database and I want to show all
the names which are there in the name
column so all the names from people to
whatever all the names which are present
in the my database this one column all
the items from this one column I want to
show in the combo box so how can I show
it in my combo box or how can I populate
this data in my combo box I will show
you now so what you need to do in order
to populate your combo box directly when
the form loads what you need to do is
just select your form so just select
click anywhere in the form and just
double click it and you will reach to
the form load event so this event is
called whenever your form is loaded so
that this is the first event which our
form is called right
and in this form load event I am going
to write a code to populate all the
names from the name column of my
database to the combo box
so what I'm going to do is I have shown
you how to delete a data from the
database in the last video so I will
just double click this but delete button
and I'm going to take all the code
inside my delete button click event I
will copy all the code from here and I
will paste in this form load event
because most of the code is reused in
this code for populating the combo box
if you don't know the code you can see
my last videos I have been showing you
how the this code or this skeleton of
code works and if you want you can pause
the video and just copy the code from
here to the last right and so the first
line will remain the same here we in the
first two line we are connecting the our
visual basics to our MySQL database by
giving our server mysql server
credential in here and in the try/catch
block we are writing our code and in the
catch block we are catching if any
exception occurred during the execution
or off of our code and finally when
everything is done we are disposing our
connection right and in the try block
what we are going to do is we are first
first of all we are opening the
connection with the database with this
code and in the second line we are
writing a query so we will declare a
string in which we will pass the query
to query the database right so this is
the string variable I'm declaring and
Here I am writing the query to query the
database this query will change for
populating your combo box so in here I
will write a query select your database
name dot your table name
so my database name is database here and
my table name is edata
right so I have written select this star
or asterisk from my database name dot my
table names so just write this query and
this will be sufficient and then I am
passing this query to the MySQL command
and then I'm executing my command using
this execute reader code okay and this
message box I am going to delete and
before my connection is closed I want to
have all the data from my database which
is name the name which is loaded to the
combo box right
so I will write while
Rheda dot read so in the while loop what
I am going to do is I am going to
declare a string variable once again so
I will write them as name is equal to
and then I will copy my reader variable
here which I have declared here right so
I will copy this once again dot get
string and in the bracket I will write
the name of the column from which I want
to extract the data so I want to
populate all the names so the column of
my or the name of my column is name
itself so I will write name here so this
name is exactly this name column this is
the name of this column which is name
right and what I'm going to do next is
I'm going to add this all the names to
the combo box so I will write
combo box 1 which is the name of my
combo box dot items dot add and I will
add all the names which I am
transferring to this string and pass it
to my combo box and hit enter and this
is the code to load your combo box with
the MySQL data columns now I will run my
program
and first of all I will give username
and password connection is correct and
now as soon as my form is loaded here
you will see all the names from the
database is listed or populated in this
combo box because we have written our
code in the form load event right so let
me show you the database these are all
the names in the database let's check
whether these matches to the database or
not so first let me show you the first
name so the first name is John second is
mark you can see here John Mark E I jail
and all the names from this name column
is populated in the combo box so in this
way you can populate your combo box with
your database column items using your
Visual Basic windows form application I
