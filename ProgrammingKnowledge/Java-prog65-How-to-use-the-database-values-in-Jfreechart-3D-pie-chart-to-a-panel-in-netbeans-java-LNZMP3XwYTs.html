I showed you how to make a pie chart now
I will show you how to make a pie chart
with the help of or taking the values
from the database so for example you
want to show these values into your pie
chart or represent these values with the
help of pie chart which are in the text
field and which comes from the database
so for example I want to show pressure
temperature volume flow and rotational
speed with the help of pie chart and
whatever Daved with respect to
particular date I want to show the
values of the pressure temperature
volume flow and rotational speed so
every time I change these value my pie
chart should also change so today I will
show you how to do that so let's get
started
what you do first is go to your pie
chart button right click even action and
action performed and this is the code we
have written last time for the pie chart
go above it and we have to declare four
values we will take them as double so W
is equal to W first of all I want to
take the pressure so I will name my
variable as pressure and which is equal
to go to your design frame right click
your text field of your pressure field
and click change variable name whatever
is the variable name of your pressure
text field you will copy and paste it
here dot
get
don't get next and semicolon
this will show you some problem because
this is our variable name is double and
we are declaring it as text so what you
can do is here instead of double you can
take string variable I will show you why
we are taking string in a moment first I
mean make my code copy and paste it four
times for pressure and second variable
you will define this temperature third
variable we will define this volume flow
and both by
- rotational speed and go to a design
frame and take the variable name of the
respective text field and paste it
respectively and rotational speed and
paste it yeah so now I will show you why
I have taken this variable string
because in our code we are already
converting or we are already seeing this
value as integer so for example if you
copy your pressure variable from here
and paste it instead of they are value
and the place of your value in the code
of the pie chart it will not show error
because our program will take these this
value as integer so it will not show any
problem so when we change here also its
name suppression
temperature
volume low and rotational speed and I
will copy the respective variable name
which is strength variable name and I
will copy instead of the values yeah
so basically what you have done is
whatever value is in your text field you
are taking them as string variable here
and these string variable you are
extracting in the dot in your data set
here as an integer and these are the
names or labels for your respective
values you can change it according to
you you can also change the name of your
title so I will for example I will write
parameter pot pie chart here and J free
chart chart is equal to chart factory
dot create pie chart 3d after that here
you can give the title if you don't know
this code hole code I have shown this in
the last two videos so you can see that
and if you are confused where this come
from and now let's run the program and
see it will show the respective pressure
temperature volume flow and rotational
speed or not running my program
and this is my pie chart when you click
this you can see pressure is equal to
two puh-puh-puh temperature is equal to
three three three three
while you flow this and speed is this
these are some random values I have and
third you can enter some logical values
in the database and see in the pie chart
so when I press pie chart
it's not showing anything let's see why
so when we go there and it's not showing
anything because in our database I
defined the this pressure as double
temperature and this all as double and I
am taking them as integer so I have to
convert them as into double so I will
write into instead of integer double so
my pressure string variable name is
converted into double so I think this
will solve my problem
this copy and paste it on all four
locations here this I have done because
I have taken all four variable pressure
temperature volume flow mm and
rotational speed as double in my
database so do remember that what is the
variable type of your data so I have
changed this now and now I will try to
run the program
and once again I will try and click this
rose
so all the respective value for that
date comes here and when I click my
chart my pie chart comes here and you
can see when you have our particular pie
block you can see its value 3 3 3 and
it's 33 percent volume flow 4 4 4 and
it's 44 percent pressure it's 2 to 2 and
it's 22 percent and rotational speed is
2000 and it's 2 percent so in this way
you can even link your database to the
pie chart also once again if I change
this the text field value for example I
will change click this row this value
this value will change and when you
press pie chart once again here you can
see all value have changed because my
paw chart is taking values from the text
field so for every different value in
the text field it is taking from
database and you can see different kind
of pie chart for the respective date so
in this way you can link your database
to pie chart and in some next video I
will also show some bar charts graphs
and all so thanks for now and please
