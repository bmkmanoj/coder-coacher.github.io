video I am going to show you how to use
comparison operators and logical
operators in Python in the last few
videos I have been showing you how to
use if-else statement in Python and this
is the continuation you may say but
these comparison operators and logical
operators you can not only use with
these ifs and statement but in general
also you can use them so first of all
comparison operators comparison
operators as the name suggests we use
for comparing values now there are these
comparison operators which are available
in Python which are less than and which
is indicated by this symbol second is
less than or equal to which is which are
implicated by less than sign and equal
to and greater than greater than equal
to double equal to indicates that you
want to check the equality and this
exclamation mark equal to means that you
want to check the non Equality okay now
there are some logical operator
operators which by which you can perform
some logical operations between some
values for example you want to check you
have two variables and you want to check
for two conditions and you want to check
both the condition and you want that
both the conditions has to be true you
use and condition and using and
condition it means that you are checking
for all the conditions in this case we
are checking this condition has to be
true and this condition has to be true
otherwise it will say false in the
opposite or the opposite of and is or
not exactly opposite but the logically
opposite of and is our
and or means either one condition is
true then it will give you true so let's
see how we can use it so first of all up
for example you want to check the less
than condition I can just copy this and
in my shell I can run it and I can print
I want to print if this is true print
true okay and I will press ENTER two
times and this true has to be enclosed
in double quotes right press ENTER and
it says true because 9 is less than 10
right in a similar way I can check these
functionality but this time I am not
going to use if condition but here you
can use all these operators with if
conditions okay so for checking less
than or equal to we can just try as wide
directly right in the shell and press
ENTER and it gives true okay so this
means less than or equal to so 9 is less
than 10 so this condition is true so
that's why it's giving true to us and
always remember that you have to use
less than first and followed by this
equal to let's see what happens when you
say 9 equal to less than 10 and gives
syntax error so always use less than
first and then equal to sign in order to
avoid any problems in a similar way you
can just check the greater than so if 9
is greater than 10 which is false so it
will give us false right 9 is greater
than equal to 10 which is also false and
now we are checking the equality which I
have shown you in the last video which
is false
9 is not equal to 10
and let's check if 9 is not equal to
then this exclamation mark and equal to
checks for the non Equality so it will
be true yes and if 9 is left then we
have already checked it okay now we have
end the condition right so for example I
want to check whether 9 is less than 10
and 9 is not equal to 10 so I want to
check whether these two conditions are
two at the same time okay and I press
ENTER and it gives me true and let's
let's check for some other condition so
this condition is true in this case
which is 9 is less than 10 and this is
also true because 9 is not equal to 10
so it gives true for example I delete
this not equal to n right equal to here
so one condition is false here which is
9 is not equal to 10 because we are
checking for two condition to be true at
the same time it will give me false
because this condition is true but this
is false right so whenever you use an
operator your program expects that both
the conditions or whatever conditions
you are giving are true so you can even
give three conditions for example I want
to check the non equality and so it's
not necessary that you only can only
give two conditions you can even give 3
4 5 or whatever conditions okay and it's
totally fine okay in a similar way you
can use all to check whether either of
the condition is true if this condition
is true or this condition is true in
this case both the conditions are true
so it gives true but when we give this
a statement where one condition is true
which is nine is less than trend which
is true but nine equal to equal to or
equal to 10 which is not true it will
still give you I have I must have used
or here right because we are checking
for or so it gives us true right so in
this way you can use comparison
operators and logical operators there is
some more things you can check and these
are is an inn conditions or is and in
operators whatever you want to say so
for example I want to check I have a
string string equals to equal to what
you can say a b c d e okay so our string
equal to a b c d e and i want to check
if a is present in string 1 also a in
string and gives us true so what this in
operator does is it checks whether this
variable contains this value or
character or not in in such way right so
in a similar way you can search for B or
C or any conditions okay so for example
you want to check where the a B is
present it gives us true but whenever
you give a C it will give you false
because a and C are not together present
here now suppose you have to list one
list is called a is equal to 1 from
to form a tree and be equal to same list
okay be and there is operator called
if so whenever you use a is B it will
give you false but for example you would
declare a list C equal to D equal to 1 2
3 will give you true because it checks
whether these 2 or 2 2 values are equal
exactly equal or not these are these a
and B are equal Y values but they are
not logical equal that's why it will
give you false but this we have already
you know assigned or assigned C equal to
D or we have assigned D to C equals this
value that's why it will give us a true
so let's check C is D and it will give
us true okay so in this way you can use
logical operators comparison operators
and is in operator in Python I hope
