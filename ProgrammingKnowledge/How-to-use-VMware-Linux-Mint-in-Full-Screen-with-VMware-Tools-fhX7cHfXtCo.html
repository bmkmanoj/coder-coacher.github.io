last video I have shown you how to
install Linux Mint on your VMware Player
and after installing Linux Mint on your
VMware Player the first thing you want
to do is go into the full screen mode so
let's try to go into the full screen
mode just after installing the Linux
Mint one would say just click this
maximize button and it will go into the
full screen mode but you can see here
it's not going into the full screen mode
so maybe let's try this and pull screen
mode and this will help and once you
click this and this will also not help
and the other option may be one can try
is maybe we can stretch this VMware
screen from here and this doesn't help
either so in this video I will show you
how to make your Linux Mint screen to go
into the full screen mode so for that we
need to install VMware tools so what you
need to do is first just go to this
layer combo box at the top and go to
manage and just click this install
VMware tools so I click it and once you
click this install VMware tools it will
show at the bottom if you can see here
it will show some help tab here and it's
showing that make sure that you are
logged in as a super user and your CD is
mounted and yeah this is something help
tip to you to use VMware Player and how
to install them and in the meantime you
will see here VMware tool will be
mounted here as our DVD and you will be
able to see this yeah
we're tools automatically here so first
thing you need to do is extract this zip
file somewhere
so just double-click it and just click
this extract button from here and you
need to provide the location wherever
you want to extract this so for example
I want to extract this in my downloads
folder so just click this download
folder and I click extract and it will
extract this VMware tools and whatever
is the version of these tools it will
extract this into my download folder so
I will wait while it's extracting and
let's see in our download folder whether
it's there or not so I will go to my
download folder and you can see it here
so once the extraction is complete you
will be able to see this quit or show
the file in the folder so what I will do
is I will click this show the file
wherever my file is and I will click
this and you can see my extraction is
complete and this folder is there which
is extracted from VMware tools just go
inside this folder and you will be able
to see this VMware install dot PL
executable file here so we need to run
this file in order to install VMware
tools
and if you are installing it for the
first time this documentation for
install installation will also help you
so just go to the documentation and read
the documentation and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to install or execute
this executable file so I will open my
terminal so you can open your terminal
by clicking here also or go to your menu
and click this terminal from here and
this opens my terminal and first of all
I will go to my downloads folder so i
will write CD d.o and press tab and you
can see it's in here so write the o/w
and click tab and hit enter so now you
are in download folder and click write
LS and you will be able to see this
VMware - tools here so I will go one
folder in c d vm and press tab and press
enter
so now you are in this vmware tools'
distribution folder right LS and you
will be able to see this vmware install
dot PL so what you need to do is just
write sudo to give super user
permissions and just write dot slash and
write vm and press tab and automatically
this will come here and what you need to
do is just press enter and give your
password and press enter
and
whenever it asked for your permission
just hit enter it will ask for your
permission several times so just hit
enter every time what I'm going I'm
doing is just hitting enter when I it's
asking for my permission and this will
happen this can happen more than I mean
three or four times and you can see it's
initializing all the tools here and once
it will initialize it will install
VMware tools and once again it's asking
me for enable some feature I will hit
enter so once your installation of
VMware tools is complete you will be
able to see at the last and just go at
little bit up you can see here the
suggestions it will say manually start
user when been VMware user or log out
and log back into your desktop or
restart your session so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to restart my session
once again and hopefully it will start
as a full screen then so I will go to
menu and click quit from here and I will
say shut down so after
shutting down my Linux Mint operating
system I'm going to restart my Linux
Mint so I will select Linux Mint once
again and I will say play virtual
machine and it will restart my Linux
Mint now I will give my username from
here
and click OK and I will give my password
and hit enter and hopefully when this
time Linux Mint operating system start
we will be able to see it in this
full-screen mode when we click this
button on this maximize button so now
let's try and turn our Linux Mint this
screen as a full screen so I will click
this maximize button and now it's in the
full-screen mode you are able to see
this in the first full screen mode so in
this way you can see this Linux Mint
screen in a full-screen mode by
installing this virtual or VMware tools
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
