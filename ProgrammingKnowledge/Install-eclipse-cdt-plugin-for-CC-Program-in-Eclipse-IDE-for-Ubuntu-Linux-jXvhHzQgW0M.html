last with yours I have shown you how to
install eclipse into your Ubuntu 12.10
operating system but by default if you
want to program C or C++ program into
your Eclipse platform it will not
provide the default project
configuration for C and C++ so you need
to add C and C++ plugins to your Eclipse
in order to make and compile the program
so I have already opened the Eclipse
platform and now I will show you how to
add those Eclipse C and C++ plug-in that
are called CDT plugin for C and C++ so
go to your Eclipse and then right left
click your help menu bar and click
install new software click it and it
will open a new window to install the
new software
it's got available software and in here
work with in this text field write CD T
and it will automatically give you the
available link for CD T in my case it's
this link this is the link for
c and c++ plugin and then when you
select it then press enter and you can
see all the list of CDT plugins are
shown here and here you can see C and c
plus plus development tool as decayed
CDT optional feature if you want you can
add these features and these are the
additional features if you want so for
our purpose we need main features of
Eclipse C++ and I will also click for
additional or optional features these
two features and just click Next and
start calculating the dependencies and
requirement for download of that
software this will take some time
and
you see select of
so then click Next
once again and it will ask to accept the
terms and condition and if you agree
with the terms and conditions just click
I accept and click finish and it will
start downloading the CDT
plugin for your Eclipse you can see it's
installing it may take few minutes to
install and once your plug-in is
installed the Eclipse will ask you to
restart your platform in order to make
the effects so click yes and it will
restart your Eclipse platform
so I have restarted my IDE once again
and on the start welcome window you can
see your CFCs plus plus development
itself so you know that your CDT plug-in
installation is successful so go to
files new project and you can see here
the C and C++ project will appear here
so if you want to make a C++ project
then select it and give any name for
your project
I will give it the name and for example
I choose hello world C++ project and
click Next here you can write the name
of author and click Next
click finish
and it will open your first C++ project
which is hello world projects
so in this way you can download and
install C and C++ plug-in for your open
to 12.10 Eclipse IDE I hope you have
learned something new this time and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
