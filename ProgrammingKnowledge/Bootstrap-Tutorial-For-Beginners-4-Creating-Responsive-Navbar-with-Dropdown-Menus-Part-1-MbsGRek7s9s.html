bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use a nav bar
or navigation bar on our web page using
strap so first of all what is a nav bar
or navigation bar so whenever you open a
web page you will be able to see some
kind of navigation bar at the top like
this where your brand name will be there
and some category or navigation options
are there like home about or some other
options and you have this drop down menu
here and when you collapse your web page
like this it should become responsive so
you will be able to see this button and
when you take this button we will be
able to see your menu item like this so
let's see how we can create this
navigation bar so I have dated all the
content from the body and right now I
have nothing inside my body here so I
will start from the scratch here and
first of all to add a navigation bar we
need to add a element called nav like
this and we need to include this class
called nav bar and this nav bar minus
default is one kind of navigation bar
there are different you know version or
different types of navigation bar and
default is just one type we will see
some other types also and this nav bar
fixed at the top we will see let's add
this element to our body first and I'll
just remove this and you know what this
container does I have explained you in
the last video what is the purpose of
this container right so let's save it
and let's run it on our browser
so this will add this kind of navigation
bar on your browser
okay now this default navbar default is
the feel or look and feel of this
navigation bar here okay and navigation
app bar fixed top means that your
navigation bar will be fixed on the top
even when you scroll down you will
always see this navigation bar your
content will be you know up and down but
this will always you know visible to the
user now there is there are some options
like nav bar inverse and what this does
once we refresh the page you will see
this nav bar changes to some dark theme
okay so if you want this dark theme you
can use nav bar inverse okay right now I
will use this default and when you do
instead of fixed here you can use static
and what this will do is whenever you
scroll down your webpage this nav bar
will also scroll and it will disappear
once you go down to see the content
right so for fixed it will be always
visible and for static it will be scroll
down okay now in order to add this
button which I was talking about so when
we collapse this and we will be able to
see this button let's add this button to
our navigation bar okay so inside the
container we need to add this button and
this button we can add it like this so I
will just add it and explain you what
this button is doing in a moment
so just add this button element here and
type of this element is button
itself will add a class called navbar
toggle okay so this represented navbar
toggle and we add two more things here
one is data toggle which will reference
to collapse and data target which will
be navbar collapse and this we are going
to create okay so once we explain this
webpage you want to see these items and
this collapse and navbar collapse will
reference to these items once we expand
our webpage so for now let's leave them
but we are going to use them in the
later section okay so let's save this
and let's see how our page looks right
now so refresh the page and when I
collapse it it will add this button but
we are not seeing any bar here three
bars right like these so what we need to
do in order to add these three bars
inside your button you need to add this
span so this is the recommended span you
need to add which is span class SR only
which is screen reader only and then you
can give any name for example toggle
navigation and then you can add this
icon bar I can you can say to your
button so when i refresh this page it
will give me one bar okay so one span
gives me one bar and I'm including icon
- bar class here okay and if I
just paste it two more times then when i
refresh this page I can see three bars
like this so this is my nav bar toggle
or button okay now we want to add our
brand name for example first and then
the items here on the right right so to
add the brand name just below this
button item you can add this like this
here and what this is going to do is
it's going to call this nav bar brand
and you can give any reference to your
you know whenever user clicks your this
item here this will reference to this
web page for example WW dot program
acknowledge dot o-r-g right something
like this okay and this is the title
which will appear there okay so once we
save it we are going to refresh our web
page and we can see this programming
knowledge brand name here right now our
brand name is added now we want to add
some navigation menu items okay so to
add those menu items first we add a div
tag and if you remember I was talking
about this collapse toggle data toggle
and data target we are going to add this
now so just below this brand name item
here you add this div element just below
this and this will add your navigation
you know collapse so you see this
collapse will reference too
this one and this navbar collapse with
referencing this right and inside this
div element we want to add our unordered
list which will be aligned on the right
so we will add this line and just close
this unordered list and what this is
going to do this is going to align your
list on the right hand side so nav nav
bar minus nav nav - right and if you do
it left it will align your nav bar to
the left and inside this unordered list
we need to add some list item so for
list item you can add this element
called
L I okay and you need to include this
class called active and what this is
going to do is it's going to make your
menu item active and we will see in a
bit what effect it adds and then you can
add a H ref here and right now I'm going
to add a blank reference or this hash or
otherwise you can add your website name
here slash home so this will reference
to the home web page of your website and
then your home menu name so just home
for example and this add this reference
and then just add and this unordered or
list items sorry okay
and what this is going to do let's save
it and let's refresh our page and this
is going to add this home menu item here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
