you how you can download and install
putty on your Windows operating system
and use putty to log into a remote
operating system using SSH right so
let's say I have a virtual machine which
runs OpenSSH so on it and I want to log
into that Ubuntu operating system using
my Windows operating system using putty
how can I do this I'm going to show you
it can be your remote server or remote
machine which you want to log into it
can be anything right so let's see first
of all how to install putty so first of
all just search for putty on your
favorite browser and then first link
which will appear here will be from
Patito ah gee just click on that link
and download is really easy for put the
putti so you can just see the download
put the page here and then just click
here on this link and here you will be
able to see this friend kind of
executable file which you can download
and install right so what we are going
to do is let's say we are going to just
install the first option for the 64-bit
for Windows right so I'm going to just
click this which is pretty - 64-bit MSI
installer and then I'm going to save it
and once it's saved we are going to just
run this MSI file so I'm going to just
click OK and then minimize my browser
and then first of all let me install
this putty so just click Next here and
this is the default location where putty
will be saved so if you don't have any
good reason to change the location just
leave it as it is click Next and then
just click install so now the putty is
installed on my system I'm going to just
avoid a reading readme file and then
click finish and now I'm going to open
the putty by so
Ching booty in my search bar so just
write booty and you can see this booty
icon is here so just open booty and then
we will try to connect to our remote so
in our case this is my virtual machine
but it can be anything in your case so
first of all what we need to know about
this remote server we need to know the
IP address of this remote server so we
just write if config here and then press
Enter and then you can see this is the
IP address of this server for example it
can be different in your case so just
you need to know the IP address and
whatever the IP address is you need to
just copy this and paste it in here
right so just paste it where it says
hostname or IP address so just paste it
here and the default port for the SSH is
port 22 so by default the SSH connects
to the port 22 so if you haven't changed
the port on the server side then just
leave this port 22 as default and now
you can just click open and now I'm
going to just press open which is going
to open this kind of terminal in my case
and then here I'm going to just say no
and then it asks me the login username
so login as so the username here is code
mine in my case you can see the username
is shown here but in your case whatever
username you want to connect to you can
give your username so in my case I will
just give code bind in your case just
see whatever username you are using ok
so log in has code bind and the password
for this open to operating system or the
server whatever you are using so the
password of that service so for example
I will give my password and now I will
be connected to this
open to operating system in my case
remorse over in your case most probably
so you can see it shows code by an
adroit code bind which is same as this
terminal right so I will just write PWD
to know in which folder I am I and I'm
in my home folder and here also I can
write the same so P W D and then it will
give me the same result right so I will
do LS to list out all the files in my
home folder you can see these are all
the files and the same it will show me
here because I'm connected to the same
machine and I'm logged in to the same
machine right so you can see the same
folder structure and files are listed
here also so basically now you can
control your remote server which is this
virtual machine in my case from your
appetit terminal right so in this way
you can download and install putty on
your Windows operating system and
connect wire SSH to a remote server I
