video I am going to teach you about
variables so what is a variable or what
are variables variables are the
placeholder for some data so for example
you want to hold some value in side some
variable how you can do it I will tell
you right now so this is our basic
program which we have written
last time and how you can declare a
variable for example you want to declare
a variable of data type integer
so just declare the data type of
variable first just write the int for
declaring integer and then declare the
name of the variable so in our case we
can name our variable as X for example
and then you can just give a semicolon
and this is the Declaration of the
variable the another way of declaring
variable is to initialize the variable
with a value so the way you can
initialize the value or variable with a
value is just write the name of the
variable and just write equal to and
just give some value to it for example 9
and just give semicolon here or you can
initialize your variable at the time of
declaration like here at the top just
give equal to here and just give the
value of the variable so this and this
declaration is same there is no
difference so you can either initialize
your variable like this or you can
initialize the variable like this okay
or you can if you have to
to initialize multiple variable there
are is there is there are two ways to
declare dual variable for example have
one to declare a second variable so I
will write in Y or said is equal to ten
and just close it with semicolon
so this is second variable in the second
line or you can declare this variable
second variable by a comma and just
write Z equal to them so this and this
declaration is also same so in this way
you can declare variables so if you want
to declare multiple variables you can
just give a comma and declare multiple
variables also okay and initialization
you can do it like this now there are
some basic type of variables there are
so many types of variables that this
page or this whole page will not be able
to show all the types of variable you
can define your variables also but the
few basic variable I am going to talk
about here so first variable data type
is int which is very basic type of
variable you can declare care which
holds that character so I will name my
care variable as CH r for example is
equal to it holds a single character
right so just give the single quote and
then : and it can hold a or B or C just
a single character so this is another
type of variable
called care and by the name itself it
shows that it can hold a character but
only a single character it can be one or
two it doesn't matter but it just has to
be one byte okay the second third type
of variable you can declare is bool and
you can give your name as BL is equal to
true or false okay so you can initialize
but you can give the value to the bool
variable as true or false okay so you
can just write true here or false here
it and then it will be initialized or
you can give 0 or 1 so 0 for false and 1
for true so you can declare this
variable as true or false or 1 or 2 also
ok
so true ok now the fourth type of
variable there are lists of variable you
can declare but this is also very
important where you do data type which
is called float and this what will do it
too is let me declare first that will
contain a decimal point values so for
example you want to define 6.32 then the
full float will come handy so what is
the difference between integer and
floral use integer you can just define
the whole values not points or anything
else and the float value will hold the
decimal points also ok and there is one
more type of variable called
double and the distal you can hold even
much more decimal values than load so
you can say that double is a big brother
of this float okay so you can declare if
you have a very big value you can hold
it in double or if you have a small
floating point value then you can use
load so these are the some of the basic
variables you can declare now I will
show you how you can use these variables
okay so for example I have these two
integer which have some values and for
example I want to show the sum of these
two variable so I will declare a third
variable called sum and I will say yes
semicolon and sum equal to X plus Z okay
and what this will do is it will learn
see what is the value of x which is nine
and what is the value of said they just
ten and then it will add these two
values and place it into a new variable
called sum and let's print this value
now so I will write C out and then this
insertion and then I will say the sum is
is and then once more this insertion and
then say some and once more insertion
operator and I will end the line so I
will say e and DL okay so what this will
print is it will print the sum is and
let me add equal to
is equal to the sum which is 99 plus 10
right let's build our program just build
it and I will run it and you can see the
sum is 19 here okay
you can change the value here for
example 5 6 5 7 6 or from value here and
build it and run the program and it will
show the song in the same way if you
want to subtract the values you can say
subtract is equal to but you need to
declare it with a data pipe and you can
say X minus Z okay so this will hold the
subtraction of X minus y so this will
minus X which is for its for 7-5 7-6 and
once again if one two so the show the
subtraction you can say the subtraction
subtraction is just copy this variable
and place it here and I think the
spelling is wrong here but who cares the
spilled your program and run the program
and now you can see the sum and the
subtraction of your x and y so in this
way you can use variable to hold the
values right so variables are very basic
concepts in C++ and you need to know
what are variable in order to learn
further in the C++ so I hope you have
understood this basic concept of C++ I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
