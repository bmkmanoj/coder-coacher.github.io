video I will show you how to install
Apache web server on your Ubuntu Linux
operating system so let's get started
first of all open your terminal and just
type in here sudo apt - get update and
press enter and it will update all the
required repository if required in by
ubuntu so let's wait for the completion
once you're up
sir complete I will clear my screen
first and now I will give the command to
install Apache web server so write on
your terminal sudo apt - get install
apache2 and press enter and if you have
the permission just write Y here to
allow it to install and start the law
installing a patch a on your open - it
will take some time
basically few minutes to install Apache
in your system so let's wait for that
once the installation of Apache is
complete you will be able to see a
message like ok here and you will be
able to see that this web server is
configured as 127 dot 0 dot 1.1 ok so
let's try and see whether it's really
working or not
our boy webserver so I will open my
browser
and in your browser just you just need
to give a command called localhost which
is the local host of your computer and
if you are able to see that this writing
or this this message then it's installed
Apache 2 is installed in your system but
you still need to add some content right
it's saying this or one more IP address
you can use it with this is your local
host IP address which is 127 dot 0 dot 0
dot 1 and we still give you decid or one
more IP address you can use it with this
browser and it will show the same result
which is your IP address of your
computer so I will clear my screen once
again and once again I will write here
IP config and press enter and oh that
was a wrong c'mon IP config we use it
with Windows operating system and with
our Linux operating system we use the
command called ifconfig right so I will
delete IP config and I will write I of
config and press enter
and now you can see your IP address of
your operating system which is 172 dot
16.8 e dot 128 so I will when I enter
this IP address also it will show the
same message so I will open the new tab
here and I will
right the IP address of my computer and
by app press enter and you still get the
same message that means you can check it
on localhost or local host IP address or
if the IP address of your computer and
it works now suppose you want to stop
your your web server how can you stop it
once again I clear the screen and in
here I will write sudo and give a slash
etc' flash in it dot d / Apache - so
this is where or this is the part where
your Apache - is residing in the folder
and when you give any command with this
path for example I will give stop and
press ENTER it will say ok
stopping web server appacha - so it has
stopped our web server and let's check
now our web server is working or not by
going on the browser and just refreshing
this localhost web page once again and
this time you will be able to see this
message that means that our web server
is no more working because we have
already stopped the web server right so
once if you want to start it just give
this start command with your
- and when you press ENTER now it says
starting web server Apache eh - so now
when once again I reload my page I will
be able to see this message so in this
way you can start or stop your web
server but there is one more command
which can be useful and which is used
generally is reload command so you can
just write this message sudo and the
path to the Apache web server which is
ET c / in it dot B slash Apache - and
then write restart restart and when I
press ENTER it says restarting web
server so whenever you make any changes
in your web page for example and you
want to start your web server without
stopping it then you need to give this
command and your web server will keep on
running it will just restart the web
server once again right now suppose you
are seeing the the default message which
is generated by Apache a folder Apache
index.html so let's see where we can
find this code for this HTML file on
Apache on our Ubuntu operating system so
this file you will be able to find in
your so I will write LS slash var slash
www and press ENTER and you will see
here is a file called index.html which
is the index file of your Apache web
server so if I want to open this file I
will just write for example sudo
get it so get it
this Kadett is a editor a name you can
use nano or em with this I'm using gedit
editor to edit my index.html file and I
will write the name of my index dot HTML
so I will write index dot HTML right and
I will press ENTER I should have given
the path to the HTML file so I should
give it give here slash var slash four
slash
www
index dot HTML because there are index
dot HTML resides right you have seen it
from here
and now when I give enter sign or enter
command you will be able to see the HTML
file here and now you can add it your
file from here ok so we have the body of
our HTML file and we have some
paragraphs which are exactly F these
paragraph suppose you want to add it
this file then what you need to do is
just have some HTML code and add it this
file with your HTML code for example I'm
added adding our table of two columns
here and I will press save and now i
will restart my web server right or i
don't need to restart let's try to
refresh our localhost
and now you can see this table which I
have entered or which I have edited in
my HTML file so now using this HTML file
you can show your web pages and website
on your web server right I hope you
learn the basics of installing and using
Apache web server on your Ubuntu
operating system and I hope you have
learned something new this time please
