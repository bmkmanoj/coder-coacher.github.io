tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how gestures words in android
so there are some common gestures like
tab double tab scroll fling long press
and other gestures which can be used
with our android screen and let's see
how you know these are gesture events
work and we will see how we can call
these function - you know record these
gestures so first of all I have this
blank project and in here what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take our long text
and drag and drop here okay now what I'm
doing going to do is I'm going to go to
my Java folder and in here minja main
activity dot Java file and in here first
of all I'm going to add some libraries
for gesture so I'm going to add these
three libraries the library names are
import Android dot view dot motion event
first is this second is import Android
dot gesture dot gesture okay and the
third library is import static Android
dot view dot gesture dot Asterix now
once you have imported all these classes
we will implement this gesturedetector
interface to our class so this is our
class which is public class main
activity which extends or inherits
action or Bar activity and in here we
will implement so implements and what we
are going to implement is one is the
gesture listener so gesture dot
just a listener so on gesture listener
and the second we are going to add is
gesturedetector dot tap DoubleTap
listener okay so once you add or
implement these two interfaces to your
class you will be able to see some kind
of squiggly red line which shows that
this method or this interface has some
you know classes or functions which are
not implemented okay
so just click on this red bulb here you
will be able to see this red bulb and
just click here or alt enter and in here
I just click the first option which is
implement methods okay so click
implement methods and in here this box
will show you all the method related to
this gesturedetector on double tab
listener which is on single tap confirm
on double tap confirm on double tap
event so these are the three events
which are included through on double tap
listener and some of the method are
included through on gesture listener
also which are on down on show press on
single tap on scroll on long on on fling
these are all the gesture methods so
each you know method is related to one
gesture okay
so just click OK and you will be able to
see all the gestures gesture methods
will be automatically included in your
you know class okay so these are some of
the common gestures okay now what we
going to do is first of all we will
declare these variables one is about
text few variable
and other method is private gesture
detector combat which detects the
gesture and then we will declare the
instance of it for example gesture D
detect okay and you know it will show
error because we need to include this
library so just click or alt enter and
import the class okay so now the class
is important which is this class Android
dot support dot v4 dot view dot gesture
detector corn pad okay
this class is imported now we will cast
this textview first in our on create
method
and we will also create an instance of
this gesture detect instance okay so in
here so gesture detect is equal to new
gesture detector compat and this
constructor takes two arguments and
these arguments are if you can just see
here these arguments are the context and
on gesture listener so both we will
define as this so the context is this
class itself okay and once again we will
use this instance and we will set set
DoubleTap listener to this gesture
detect and the context will be this for
this also
okay now what we are going to do is
let's use this text view to show the
method which is called so for example we
you know add or we perform some gesture
for example double tap or show press or
on scroll you know gesture this method
or these method will be called whenever
we you know perform any gesture on our
android screen okay so what we want to
do is we want to print which method is
called in this textview so just copy
this textview variable from here and
just go little bit down and for each
method which is created by these gesture
listener and on DoubleTap listener we
will add one method to each you know one
you know text view to each method okay
so text view dot set text
and inside this method or as an argument
of this set text we will pass the name
of the method simply okay so we know
that which method is called and it will
be printed in this text box the same
thing I'm going to do for all the method
so on double tap
you
so we have just added the set text
method to the text view so that we can
print the method called on the textview
okay you can even call these motion
event method in your text set text view
okay so for example I want to add the
you know motion event for this I can
just add a concatenation operator e dot
to string okay and this what it's going
to do it it's going to print the you
know motion event string here so you can
add this to you know every method but
you know it's not necessary but you can
do it to get the extra information about
your you know method which is called
okay
same you can do for on scroll II won and
e2 and you can call a 1.2 string plus e
2.2 string okay
so e 2.2 string okay same you can do for
every method where motion event method
is there okay now what we are going to
do is once we have added this text view
dot set text to all these methods we can
call or we just need to call one more
method okay and that method is on touch
event okay so go here just before the
Declaration of all these method related
to gesture detector and gesture on
double tap listener all the methods are
implemented here so you can call this
method above all this method or below
all these method
you know doesn't matter I'm going to add
this one touch event method above all
these method which are created by on
double-click listener and on gesture
detector okay so in here go here and
just press alt insert okay
so just press alt+ insert and then you
will be able to see some auto generation
code options and we are going to choose
override method from here so just choose
override methods and in here
there are so many methods and the method
we are searching for is on touch event
so just make sure that this filter is
set here from you know which adjust the
alphabetical order so it's it will be
easier to find this method so in here
you just need to scroll down and if you
don't find just close first two
categories here and then search in the
third category and search for on touch
event which is this event okay so search
for on touch event here and click OK and
this have created us this on touch event
and inside this ontouchevent just before
this return on touch event we are going
to just use our gesture detector
variable or gesture detector object
which is an instance object gesture
detector compat inside this on touch
event what I am going to do is I am
going to call this gesture detect dot on
dot on touch event and just pass this
event as an argument
okay and I think our code is already so
read let's run our code now so now our
app is running and you can see there is
nothing inside our text view right now
but once you scroll here or tap here or
long tap here all the method will be
recorded for example I scroll and you
can see on scroll method is called and
you can also see the details of this
motion detection which is the
coordinates here the action performed
the time event time and other features
which are you know called by this event
e to string right so you can scroll tap
or fling and on fling you can see or you
can long press or you can double click
double tap or you know you can play with
this gestures and you will be able to
see all the methods are called one by
one on each gesture and if you want if
you don't want to see all this extra
information just remove this e dot to
string and you will just be able to see
this method which is called so I hope
you understood the basic concept of
gestures I hope you enjoyed this video
