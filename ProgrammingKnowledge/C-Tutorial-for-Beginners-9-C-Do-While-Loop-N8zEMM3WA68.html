last video I've shown you how to use
while loop in c-sharp
now in this video I am going to show you
how to use do-while loop in c-sharp
so first of all what is a difference
between while loop and do-while loop the
basic difference between while loop and
do-while loop is a while loop first
checks the condition and then performs
the code but the do-while loop first
performs the code and then checks the
condition so let me give you an example
I am going to just use the example I
have used last time to print 10 values
and I have also shown you how to print
10 values using this while loop right so
while this count was less than whatever
we entered as a number for example then
it was been printing the values right
and for example I will just increase
this count to 10 so now I have
initialized this count variable which
then then what happens is I will run the
code and for example I enter the number
9 and press ENTER and you see nothing
happens because our condition is not
true then is not not less than 9 which
we have entered so our code is not
executed right now let me just rewrite
this code using 2 while loop ok so let's
see a do-while declaration is like this
you first write do and then you give
this to curly braces and then what you
do here is you write
while and your condition and this sonic
column okay this is the basic structure
of to while loop and I will just give
the same condition yeah in the while
loop so I have the condition count is
less than this number and I have the
same statement which I was performing
last time and once again and let's see
what happens now to differentiate this
print message I will write here while
and I will write here do while so we
don't we will know that which message is
printed this one or this one now let's
run the program once again once again we
will give the value 9 which will be less
than 10 so we give 9 and press enter and
you see here the message printed
do-while number 10 right so this message
is printed this one do-while message and
while message is not printed so this
means that while loop first of all check
the condition and then execute your code
and do-while loop first execute your
code so it will just because there is no
condition in you initially right it says
to so you do this and then it sees ok
this is the condition if this condition
is true I am going to go to do once
again and print this now let's give the
valid conditions for to both of them
okay
so I will just run the code and I will
give 10 and I will enter this once again
and it says while one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten that says
do-while is equal to ten
okay so you see why this is happening
because all the because this is this
variable and this variable is same right
so this has already increased to ten and
at the time of reaching this code this
value is already 10 right so this code
will be perform and it sees that 10 is
not less than 10 it is equal to 10 right
so it will not repeat it once again but
when you declare another variable you
can call it count 1 and just copy it and
paste it with this do-while loop what it
will do is just run the code once again
and I will press and then and press
ENTER and you can see it has printed in
the while loop also while 0 to 9 and in
the do-while loop also 0 to 9 same
values right but the basic difference is
do-while loop perform support first
perform the statement first and then the
checks the condition and if the
condition is true it goes to the
statement once again and if the
condition is true it goes to the curve
statement once again and on the other
hand the while loop checks the condition
first and then performs if statement so
I hope you have understood the basic
difference between you and do-while loop
not do and do-while loop but while and
do-while loop and I hope you enjoyed
