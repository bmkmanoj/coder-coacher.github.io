video I will show you how to add an R
code to your I text report so first of
all you need to understand is bar code
are of different type and we are just
going to use one of them so if you go to
the Wikipedia page there are so many
types of bar codes and you can learn
about them from the Wikipedia what I am
going to use is UDC
a bar code whose full form is universal
product code and which looks like this
so now let's get started
I will go to my report section perform
and this code or the report I have shown
you in the previous tutorial just go
there and wherever you want to show your
bar code for example I want to show my
bank would at the top so after I open my
document which is document dot open
after that I will write my bar code code
you can show your bar code at bottom so
if you want to do that then you have to
go and the bottom of your code so now
the code
first of all right pindy
content might and the variable name see
me
is equal to
right
not yet
that it contained and racket closed
after that
good evening because we are going to use
this bunker
and we define the variable first after
that we will copy this code variable and
paste it here dot and in the bracket you
can write your code so for example I'm
right now code one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten and after that
I will write sorry paragraph yeah this
is
mr. teen vicodin breaking close and
after that it will copy your document
variable name which you have to create a
document document is equal to new
document here in the bracket you can
write your description so I am white and
I will copy my code and variable and I
will paste it here
put code not UDC a because UDC a type of
after that I mean one months again copy
this variable and paste it here dot set
code yeah you have to provide another
set of number which will be shown under
your bar code ten nine eight seven six
five four three
copy my document and paste it here and
inside ad will copy your code en
not create image would barcode and in
here this CB automatically comes which
is this variable name PDF content bite
and in the second place you will write
leave default values
some mistake instead of create template
create image with and here this is CB
which is this variable P dependent these
are the default values are not going to
change them and after that you will
write cop in this variable and paste it
here and your paragraph VAR a variable
which I have declared earlier this comes
here so now this is the code for bar
code which is of the UDP a type so now
we try and run our program and see which
works or not report
and it saves me string.index out of bone
11 so I will see what is the problem
so I found out and that here I have to
provide 13
values so I have one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten eleven values
are to provide two more venues here so
we'll provide one one yeah and here also
I have one two three four six seven
eight nine ten eleven
I will provide two more values yes this
when you must be thirteen thirteen
places and now I'm drawing my program
and then same metaphor time report is
saved and you can see my code bar code
is generated here so this is a UDC a
kind of mark code you can show on the
top or at the bottom anywhere in your
report this looks like this so I hope
you have learned something new today
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
