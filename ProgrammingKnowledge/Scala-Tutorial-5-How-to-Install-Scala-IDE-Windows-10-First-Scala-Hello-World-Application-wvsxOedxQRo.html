Scala tutorial for beginners so now we
have some basic understanding of how
Scala rapid works and how datatypes and
variable works in Scala using Scala
Apple now in this video I'm going to
show you how you can download and
install Scala IDE to develop your Scala
code so let's get started
so just open your favorite browser and
search for Scala IDE now Scala is an
eclipse based IDE so you need to have
Java installed on your system before
installing Scala IDE so I'm hoping that
you have already installed Java on your
system so just go to the first link
which is Scala - IDE dot o-r-g and once
the website is open you will be able to
see this kind of download button here so
I'm going to click this download button
and on the downloads page I'm going to
just scroll down a little and here I
will be able to see three options one
for Windows other for Mac and third is
for Linux operating system so we want to
install this scale IDE on our Windows
operating system so I'm going to choose
this option windows 64-bit so this is
going to download the Scala zip file so
I'm going to wait for this zip file to
download and once it's downloaded it's
really easy we just need to extract it
and start using Scala so I will wait for
that so now this zip file is downloaded
so I'm going to go to the folder where I
have downloaded this zip file so this is
the zip file which I have downloaded and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
right click and extract this zip file so
I'm going to right click and extract and
then let me extract it to my desktop for
example ok you can choose any folder of
your choice where you want to extract
this file ok so in this case I'm
choosing my desktop folder and I will
just say select folder and then extract
and I will wait for the extraction to
complete so now the extraction of that
zip file is complete and that zip file
will be extracted as this folder so this
folder will be named as Eclipse ok so as
I told you that Scala IDE is an eclipse
based IDE so the folder which you
extract will be extracted as the folder
named Eclipse so just open this folder
and here you will be able to see this
Eclipse icon you just need to double
click on this and I'm going to minimize
this and for the first time when Scala
IDE starts it asks you to give the
workspace path so this workspace is a
directory where all your project will be
saved right same as eclipse so I just
want to check this option which says use
this as a default folder right and I'm
going to just click OK now so now this
Scala IDE has been started I'm going to
maximize it and let's create a project
and then I'm going to go to the file
option here and then choose new and then
choose Scala project and now I'm going
to give a name to my Scala project for
example Scala sample and for now leave
everything as default so we will choose
this option which says use an execution
environment GRE and then this option
creates separate folder for the sources
and class files ok and now I'm going to
just click finish here so now on the
left hand side I can see my project has
been created and there is a folder
called source here right so here I'm
going to create an object file so before
writing any code we will go to the Scala
website and we will see how the hello
world program can be written using Scala
from the official website ok so this is
the official website Scala - Lang dodgy
I'm going to press on documentation here
in the document section you will be able
to see this kind of documents page I'm
going to select this option with say
Scala for Java programmers and on this
scala for Java programmers page I will
scroll down a little and here I can see
the basic hello world code which I can
execute using Scala okay so what I need
to do
I will create a Scala object file and
then use this code to print hello world
so on your scala project just
right-click on the source folder here so
SRC right-click on that and then select
new and then select scala object okay so
we don't want to select Scala class you
want to select Scala object and I will
explain you what Scala object is in a
moment but for now let's give the name
to this object so for example or we give
the name HelloWorld to this object and
then I will just press finish which is
going to create this HelloWorld object
file so you can see this hello world dot
Scala file is created and we have some
code here right now let's increase the
font size of this code so you can see it
in a better way so I'm going to click on
window here and then press preferences
and in the preferences just select
general and in the general just select
editors and on the editor just select
text editors and under text editor you
will be able to see at the top colors
and font so I'm going to just click this
option colors and font and then I'm
going to just select text font here and
then I'm going to edit the font here and
right now the font size is 10 so I'm
going to make it 16 and click OK and
apply and then click OK
so now the font size has been increased
so let's copy the same code from the
Scala website this code so we already
have defined this hello world object we
just need to copy this method under this
hello world object so I'm just going to
copy this method on the Hollow
object and then paste it here and now
I'm going to save my code and let me
explain you this code first of all so
you may not be familiar with this
keyword object so what is object so
object is a class but it already has an
instance so you cannot call a new
keyword on this object right so as you
have seen in Java whenever you create a
class in order to use it you need to
instantiate it so you need to create an
object of it and how you create an
object of it using a new keyword but
this object which you use here in Scala
this keyword this is already
instantiated so we can say the object
keywords create a singleton type which
is like a class that only has one named
instance so you cannot create another
instance of an object now if you are
familiar with Java objects serve the
same purpose as static method with some
additional features so you use this
object keyword and then give a name to
your object and then inside your object
you have this method so in scala you
define methods like this I'm going to
discuss about them in detail
later and then as we have seen in Java
every Scala project must have at least
one and only one main method and this is
how you can pass arguments in this main
method and print line method you can use
to print any message now to execute this
code you just need to right click on
this file and then choose run as and
then choose Scala application okay so
once again right click on this file and
then choose run as and then choose Scala
application and once you do this it's
going to build your Scala project and
then it's going to print this message
you can see on consoles HelloWorld is
printed okay so this is how you can
create your first dollar project
okay now if in case you want to use
Scala interpreter Scala Apple what you
can do is you can right click on your
project so select your project name and
right click on it and then select Scala
from here so just select Scala and then
choose this option which says create
Scala interpreter in Scala sample ok so
just select this option which says
create Scala interpreter in Scala sample
and now it's going to open this Scala
interpreter here ok
so for example we want to execute the
same code in Scala interpreter so I'm
going to just copy this code from here
and then paste it here and then I'm
going to press ENTER so now it says
defined object hello world so when you
paste this code it has defined the
object called hello world so we can use
this hello world object here so just use
hello world object and then dot your
method name so our method name is main
here ok so inside this object we have
only one method which is called main so
we are going to just use it like this so
the object name dot the method name and
what argument it takes it takes an array
ok so we will just pass an empty array
here so I'm going to use this bracket
and then I'm going to just use these
double quotes here and once you do that
just press ENTER and you can see it
prints hello world once again so in this
way you can use Scala interpreter or
scholar apple inside your Scala IDE also
so in this way you can download and
install Scala IDE on your Windows
operating system I hope you've enjoyed
