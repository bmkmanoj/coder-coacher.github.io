show you how you can download and
install Python on your Mac so let's get
started open your favorite browser in my
case I'm going to open Safari but you
can use any other browser you want and
search for Python and the first link
most probably which will appear here
will be from Python or G so just click
this link which is python.org G and here
you will be able to see this kind of
interface now in order to download the
Python on your Mac you just need to go
to downloads and then this website will
automatically recognize that you are on
Mac OS so it's going to give you the
downloads for your Mac OS now there are
two versions so you can see here one is
three point six point zero which is the
latest version and one is the legacy
version which is two point seven point
13 right so what we are going to do is
we are going to download the latest
version which starts from three point
any number if you are watching this
video in the future it can be three
point seven eight or nine or any version
so we are going to download and install
this version which is it starts from
three ok just click download button here
and it's going to start the download and
some time your download will be
completed so just wait for the download
to complete and once the download is
complete we are ready to run it so just
go to the download section here and then
click this option which says python 3.6
mac OS dot PKG version right so just
double click on this python file which
you have downloaded and i'm going to
minimize the browser and you can see
this kind of installation wizard start
ok so you just need to click continue at
this step and then you just need to read
the license terms and condition and if
you agree with those license terms and
condition just click continue and in
here also once
click continue and save you need to
agree to the license so just click agree
and then in this step you just need to
click install and in between you will be
asked to give your password so you just
need to give your password and then
click install software and then the
installation of Python will start on
your Mac and you just need to wait for
some time until this progress bar
reaches to the hundred percent mark and
once it's completed we will see how we
can you know open Python and then how we
can use it
so now python is installed on our Mac
you can see the installation is
successful so we are going to close this
window and then we are going to see
whether it's really installed on our
system or not by writing some test code
for example hello world code so whenever
you install Python it comes with an IDE
called
idle and to search that idle IDE you can
go at the top and just click this search
icon here which will open the spotlight
search and then search for idle so I'm
going to just type ideally for idle and
after typing idle you will be able to
see this first option which says idle
and you will also be able to see this
Python icon here right so just click on
idle which is going to open your idle
IDE and you can see it's opening and now
our idle IDE is open so you can see this
kind of interface will open whenever
idle IDE starts right so it's going to
give you the version of Python you have
installed and then it's going to give
you this kind of warning whenever you
start idle for the first time just press
ENTER once and you will see this kind of
arrow here right so in order to print
something you just need to for example
use a print method so just write print
and then inside paranthesis you can
write a string to print it so for
example I want to print hello world so
I'm going to just write hello world in
between codes so just try to print and
in parentheses and inside double quotes
just the right hello world and then
press ENTER and then it's going to print
hello world right so very simple and
python is installed and working
successfully on your Mac computer now if
you want to use Python from your Mac OS
terminal you can do that also so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to minimize
this idle IDE so I will open the Mac's
terminal now and here first of all you
just need to type python in order to
start fighting so just type python here
and then press Enter which is going to
give you the Python terminal and then
once you see these three arrows then you
can use your Mac terminal as a Python
terminal also so you can just write for
example print here and the parent is
here and in the double quotes you can
just write the same code you have
written in your idle IDE so I'm going to
just print hello world and then I'm
going to just press ENTER and it prints
hello world so either way you can use
Python from your terminal also and you
can use Python from this idle IDE which
comes with Python installation also so I
hope you've enjoyed this video please
