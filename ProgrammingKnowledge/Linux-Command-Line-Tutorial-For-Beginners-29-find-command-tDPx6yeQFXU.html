you how we can use five command in Linux
now first of all what is fine command
fine command is used to search for files
in a directory hierarchy so for example
I'm in my home folder I can just use PWD
command to know this and in this folder
I will just use LS to list all the files
and other things here right and for
example I want to find some file here
which I have made few days ago which I
don't know in which folder is it right
right now I know that this file is here
but for example I don't know the file
location and I just know that it's in
the home folder of my you know operating
system so I can use find for this so
just use find and then the directory in
which you want to find right so it can
be a root directory it can be a TC
directory or any other directory in
which you want to search this file in so
right now I want to find this file in my
home folder right and then comes the
file name so you give the flag name here
and then you give the file name which
you want to search you can do something
like this test dot sh for example I want
to find this file name or you can do the
wild-card with these fine names so first
of all let's you know get the full name
of the file and press Enter it's going
to search in all the directories and all
the files in this home directory and
then it's going to search where is this
file located and it has searched and I
can see the location of this file in a
second example you can use for example
you just know that this file is called
test but you don't know the extension
wit so you can use dot Asterix as a
wildcard and this means that whatever
comes after test dot then it will it is
going to search for all those files
right so I'm going to press ENTER and it
searched this file again right for
example you just want to search for dot
txt extension the files which have txt
extension so you can just give this
Astrix dot txt and press ENTER and you
see we have seen bunch of you know
result which have txt extension right
you can see this dot txt list or PSD txt
so every is the result which have txt
extension is going to be you know listed
here now for example I want to search
for this particular file file1 dot txt
so I can do something like this I just
want to you know right here file and one
and I just want to you know just write s
trick here this means that whatever file
name which will start from file one is
going to be searched and listed in our
result so press ENTER and you can see
all these result have the file name file
one okay so there is a directory also
called file one there are you know files
also in different directories with the
same name so in this way you can search
for the file in your whatever directory
in which you want to search so for
example I will clear the terminal for
now and let's find some more things so
for example I want to find in the root
directory so this is going to start from
the root and it's going to search the
file everywhere else and then I'm going
to give the name of the file so I will
use this flag
name and then I will give the name of
the file so in the last video we were
you know talking about the message files
so I can give the name of this file here
and then I can just press ENTER and it's
going to search for this file but there
is a problem here right and you may
recognize by this permission denied
warning that it cannot search for this
file because there are some directory
which we don't have access to so we can
use this command with the sudo in front
of it so I'm going to clear the terminal
once again and I'm going to just write
sudo in front of this fine come on and
then press ENTER and give my password
and then it's going to search for this
file so you can see this file is in
sidebar or slash log and the file name
but there are some other directory in
which this file is also existing for
example in bin folder also and then this
folder location also and in this field
folder location also okay so this is how
you can use this find command but there
are more things you can do with this
fine command so for example you have
created a file and you just know that
you have created this file a few days
ago but you don't know the name of the
file and you don't even know the
location of the file so you can use this
command called fine
and then you can use the location so
just give the location in which you want
to search in and then give this flag
called - M time and then whatever you
write after this for example minus 1 is
going to look the files which are
created one day ago till now ok so this
can be minus 2 for 2 days - 3 for 3 days
and this can be plus also so you can you
know know that
from this time this will be created or
something like this way it can be a plus
or you exactly know that this file is
created exactly one day ago so you can
give the one here instead of minus one
okay so just give minus one and press
ENTER and it's showing all these you
know result to us so this is how also
you can use this fine command so I hope
