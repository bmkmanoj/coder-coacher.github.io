Moody's tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how we can
perform basic routing using no chairs
now if you want to do more routing stuff
and other stuff if you think of this it
can become really difficult whenever you
want to add a few more files here you
need to write lots and lots of code here
in order to perform your stop and this
can be easily done by third party module
and there is a repository called NPM or
food package manager which allows us to
include third party module which are
created by experienced developers and
they were already you know invested
their time to create these modules and
these are publicly available so similar
to these modules for example HTTP or FS
module these are built in module in no
chairs now these third-party modules can
be included in your project using node
package manager or NPM so let's go to
the NPM website and let's see you what's
there so whenever you will search NPM on
any browser you will see the first
result here will be from NPM chase.com
just click this link and BMJ is calm and
in here you will be able to find the
many package modules or node modules
which you can use in your project so
approximately there are around
I have lost read that there are around
280,000 node modules available in this
repository right so you can search this
module for example if you know the
package name for example this kind of
routing can be done using Express right
so we can such Express here so you can
see you have the intellisense
here and you know you can see various
options you know are listed here so just
search for example Express and you will
search for it and the first option here
comes is Express Fred flash but we do
not want Express flash we just want to
express so you can just search for
Express once again and here you can see
the first option here is Express right
so just click this link and here you can
see the documentation of for this module
so it says fast uh opinionated
minimalist web framework so you can use
you know Express to do exactly we are
trying to do in our stop for example the
routing stuff and you know restful api
if you want to create you can do it
using Express on the right hand side you
can see the status also so stats here
you can see over three hundred thousand
you know installs or downloads of this
modules are done previously for example
yesterday last date over 300 thousand
this month itself have 1.8 million I
think downloads here so from these
download you can already recognize that
this module is really popular and this
is the one of one of the most popular
modules in no J seconds tell you right
now how you can install this Express or
any other module
out of our 280,000 modules in your
project so you can do it using command
line and let's open the command line in
order to see how we can install it so
first of all you need to be in your
directory wherever your project is and
then you can use NPM command to install
these modules so whenever you have
installed a node in the first or second
video I have shown you how to install
node with that and p.m. module has also
gone so you can just know the version of
this by just writing NPM - me and it's
going to give you the version of p.m.
now in order to install this express
module we just need to do NPM install so
just write NPM install Express right
which is exactly you know documented
here also so installation and p.m.
install Express right so whenever you
find a module the solution procedure of
this module will be given here the
documentation of this module will be
given here and QuickStart also you know
so you can come to this website to know
more about any using right so I have
just given this NPM install expressed
and I will just press ENTER which is
going to take some time to download and
install this Express module and you can
also here there will be a directory
created with the name would underscore
modules so this module is downloaded in
our project you can see and now there is
a folder called mode modules is created
here and when you open this some more
modules you can see many modules are
downloaded in
folder but the main package we have
installed is this Express module and all
the other you know modules which are you
know coming with this Express module are
its dependencies okay so for example
debug or destroy or any other module
which is installed with this Express
module is its dependency so it will also
be installed with Express for example ok
now this is the way to install any
module in your project but this is not
the preferred way of doing it
we will do it using a package manager
using you know NPM command which is the
standard command which is like this NPM
in it and this we will see in the next
video but for now I want to uninstall
this module so don't worry if you want
to uninstall a module also you can do it
using NPM come on
so let's uninstall and that command is
really simple and p.m. uninstall instead
of install you just need to write NPM
uninstall and the package name and then
press Enter which is going to uninstall
the module so you can see the process is
going on and then whenever you go to
your node modules folder there is only a
dot been pulled a left here and every
other module is deleted because we have
uninstalled this Express module right so
using these modules is also simple you
can just you know add them like this so
VAR HTTP require and then once your
module is installed you can just give
the name of the module right so this is
just the introduction of no chase the
standard way of using NPM is you
package or JSON file which is kind of
you know a file which have all the
records whatever modules are there in
your you know project and this can be
given to other developers also who can
use this project with your package dot
JSON file and then they can install
these modules and they know which
version of you know any module you have
installed using this package dot JSON
file so this is exactly we are going to
see in the next video how to use package
dot JSON file to create and maintain
your approaches so this was the brief
introduction about NPM and we will see
how we can use NPM and third-party
modules from the next video so I hope
