show you how to use date/time picker
with your visual basic windows form
application and I'm also going to show
you how you can format the string which
you get from the date/time picker to
your custom string or custom date and
time so what I'm going to do is first of
all obviously I am going to take a
date/time picker so I will drag and drop
this date/time picker control from this
toolbox plus I am going to take a button
and I am going to take our text box okay
and I will change its text of this
button as format and now I will just
change the font size so that you can see
them clearly bold and 18 okay now
everything is done now just
this button and in here I will write
text box one dot text is equal to date
time picker one which is the name of
your date time picker control dot text
okay
and what this will do is it will
literally transfer all the text from
this date time picker to the text box
let's see what the result is so I have
this program when I click this format
button it transfers the date and time or
only whatever you can see here the day
and the date and the month and your here
it will transfer it here so it will
literally transfer this date here now
suppose you want to show that date and
time also to your text box using your
date/time picker just change this code
to date time picker dot value and when
you run the program once again and when
you click this format it will show you
the date and show you that current time
right so it will this is the long format
of the date time date and time right and
sometimes you only want to show the date
using your date/time picker so how you
can do it just add to this code dot
short to short date string okay and now
when you run the program and when you
click this format button it will only
show you the date in the same way you
can only show the time by just changing
the code to two
short time string and run the program
and now it will show the time now
sometimes you want to custom form it
your output from the date/time picker so
what you can do is I will just delete
this code and I will write format and
then in this format I will write the
name of my date/time tipica dot value
and the second argument I will pass here
as a string what I want
Oh what format I want this date to be so
I will just give double quotes and for
the example I want to show the dates in
the format like here first and then the
month capital m and then the day okay
and now when I run the program and when
I click this button it will show me the
date in the format first the year then
the month and then the date right you
can also show change this
in between whatever character you want
to use for example I want to use this -
instead of slash and when I run the
program and when I click this it will
show this slash here or you can use dot
also or whatever you please to do okay
so now I am using comma instead of - a
minus sign and when I run the program it
will also show the date in the same
format so in this way you can format
your output from which you are getting
from your date/time picker in the
desired format you want so in this way
you can use date time picker using your
visual basic windows form application I
