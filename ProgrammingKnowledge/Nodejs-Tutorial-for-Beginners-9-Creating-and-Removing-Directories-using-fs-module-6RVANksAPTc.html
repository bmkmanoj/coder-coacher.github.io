no deus troll for beginners in the last
video we have seen how we can use FS
module to create file read from file and
write to a file now in this video we
will see some more functionality of FS
module and we will see how we can delete
a file and how we can create and remove
directories in nodejs
using FS module so the first requirement
is this one you need to you know require
this module which is an inbuilt module
right now first functionality your first
thing we will see here is how we can
remove file so in the last video I have
created this test dot txt file right and
for example I want to remove this file
so I can just write FS dot on link and
then I can just give the path of the
file with its name so my file is in the
current directory so I don't need to
give the path but I just need to give
the name of the file which is test dot
txt right and when I run this app let's
run it and what happens is this text dot
txt file is gone right
so this unlink method you can use to
remove a file but be careful here
whenever you will you know run the code
if the file doesn't exist then let's see
what happens now this time it shows an
error which will be due to the file not
existing okay so in FS module you can
also go to the documentation and check
how you can first check for the file if
it exists or not and then delete it so
this can be your home or just search for
how to check if the file exists
then try to delete it okay now let's
move ahead and let's see how we can
first of all for example create a
directory so to create a directory first
we will see how we can create a
directory synchronously so if you are a
little bit familiar with command line
you know terminal commands then you know
how to you know create a directory so in
terminal whenever you
type mkdir then it creates a directory
right and in node also whenever you just
call a method called mkdir after FS and
then gave the name of the directory for
example the name of the directory I want
to give here is for example node itself
okay so note directly I want to create
and here I want to create it
synchronously so don't forget to write
sync here right and save your code and
I'm going to run my code again and let's
see what happens so I just run my code
and you can see there is a new directory
created which is called node right now
in order to remove a directory you just
need to replace MK by RM so RM dir is
going to remove the directory so
synchronously for synchronous removal
you just need to add this suffix like
sym C sync right and save the code run
it again and just see here the directory
will be removed so this directory is
removed right now in order to create a
file asynchronously what we can do here
is for example instead of using this
sync we can just write something like
this so FS dot and k dir
then the name of the directory once
again for example node and then you can
create a callback function here so I'm
just going to write function and then
inside the callback function I can do
whatever I want to do after the
directory is created right so for
example I want to create a file after I
have created a directory something like
this ok so inside my callback function
what I can do is I can just write FS dot
right file write with a capital F and
the name of the file so for example I
want to create this file inside my new
directory which is created which is node
now in order to you know create this
file inside this node directory you just
need to write dot slash to indicate that
you need to go inside this node
directory and then the name of the file
for example my node dot txt ok so this
will be the name of the directory and
for example you want to write something
I'm going to just write random text here
and this is going to you know write this
text to this file for example right so
just save your code and run it again and
let's see what happens so run the code
the directory is created inside the
directory the file is created and inside
the file this random text comes ok so
this is how you can make a directory now
let's just say that you want to delete
this directory once again which also
have some file inside it so I'm going to
just remove it and I will just write FS
dot RM dir and the name of the directory
so the name of the read directory is
node right and
if you do this it's not going to delete
this directory because we already have
some file inside it so whenever we run
this code what it gives is it gives the
error because you cannot remove a
directory if it contains a file inside
it so what we will do here is we will
first remove the file and then remove
our directory and this is very simple we
have already seen it so just write NFS
dot on link and then you just need to
give the path of the file you want to
remove so this is because it's in a node
folder so you will just write dot
forward slash node and then you just
need to give the name of the file so the
file name is my node dot txt and then we
can add a callback function here so just
add a callback function and inside a
callback function once this file is
removed we want to remove the directory
right so you inside the callback
function you can call a method to you
know remove the directory right and just
save your code and let's run it again
and let's see what happens so I'm going
to just run my code again and you can
see the file is deleted first and once
the file is deleted this callback
function is called and then the
directory is removed ok so in this way
you can use FS module to create
directories and remove directories and
remove files also so I hope you have
