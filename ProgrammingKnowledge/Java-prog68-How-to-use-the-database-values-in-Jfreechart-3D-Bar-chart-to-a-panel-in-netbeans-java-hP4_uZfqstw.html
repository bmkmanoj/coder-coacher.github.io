I have shown you how to change some
properties of your bar chart and now I
will show you how to link it with the
database so for example in here in this
table I have pressure temperature volume
flow and rotational speed so when I
click it my values for the respective
date is shown into my text field so I
will show these values as my bar bars of
my bar chart and this pressure
temperature volume flow and speed as my
x-axis names and my values as Y axis
variable so let's get started I will go
to my code which I have written past I'm
going there and now I will declare a
variable string which is pressure
pressure is equal to I will go to my
design field and here the text field for
pressure in which my pressure value
comes I will right-click it and I will
copy my variable name for that and I
will paste it here dot get
texts and semi go so I've taken my
pressure values from my text field into
my pressure variable in the same way I
will copy this and paste this four times
and this is for temperature this is for
you flow and this is for rotation speed
and I will go to my design
and I will click the respective variable
name of the text kill and I will paste
it here this again volume flow text
field variable name and fixed it here
and once again rotational speed
maybe then copy and paste it yeah
so I have taken four values which is
shown in my text fields and I
transferred them into some variables
here also instead of student name I want
to show pressures student 1 will be
displaced by crashes into place by
temperatures student 3 will be replaced
by blow all your flow and stream 4 will
be replaced by
okay so these are my x-axis variable
names Russia and here we write my values
so copy the pressure where you will name
and paste it here sorry
done sums and copy my pressure variable
name in case instead of pressure and
because my pressure variable name is
string so here it will show some error
so I have to convert it into double
variable first so so you can do what you
can do is write here new double and
pressure will be enclosed by columns my
brackets so you have in order to convert
your string variable into the double
variable you will do this new double and
inside this pressure so I will do copy
it and paste it four times here three
times maybe and I will copy my variable
names temperature and paste it to be
theta and a Lim flow here and rotational
speed so I'm showing pressure
temperature volume flow and rotational
speed on my x axis and on the y axis I
want to show the value values for
example so when you also give also this
must be same and my pie chart name will
be
but chuckling will be sorry parameter
menus x-axis I want to show the
parameter and on the y-axis I want to
show values and so you have done here JP
chart chart is equal to chart Factory
not create much or 3d and after that you
have changed your title X exit title and
y axis title and I am so shown in the
last video and then in the frame chart
frame frame is equal to new chart frame
here you can change your title of your
frame so I will change it as bar chart
for parameters for example and now I
will run in the program
and go to my bar chart and when I click
this row my values for pressure
temperature volume flow and rotational
speed comes into my text field and when
I press bar chart my values of pressure
temperature volume flow and rotational
speed will be shown here this is my
title this is my y-axis title this
exercise title this is my claim title
and I will close it and I will click for
example this value number 10 row and
this will shows the respective values
for from by D 10 and then once again I
would like my bar chart and you can see
the change value for that so whenever
the well using the text field changes
your bar chart will also change like
this so that was the tutorial on how to
link your bar chart with the database I
hope you have enjoyed this tutorial
