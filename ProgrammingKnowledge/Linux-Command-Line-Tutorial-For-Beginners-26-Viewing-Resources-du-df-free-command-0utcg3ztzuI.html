Lennox come online tutorial for
beginners in this video I'm going to
show you a bunch of commands which you
can use to view the free resources and
use resources in your Linux operating
system so let's get started the first
command which I'm going to show you is
the DF command and this DF command
reports the amount of available disk
space being used by your filesystem okay
so for example I'm in my home folder
right now and here I just gave this DF
command and now it gives me this kind of
output right so I can see that my root
partition have this vast amount of used
memory and this much amount of available
memory but what are these numbers these
numbers doesn't have any units on it and
we cannot you know easily understand
what amount of you know disk space is
being used and what amount of this space
is available so for make it human
readable there is a flag with this
command so just write DF once again and
there is a flag called H here and this
stands for human readable right so when
you give this - h flag with this DF
command and press enter you will be able
to see the human readable form of the
output so now I can say that 12 GB is
used on my system and 5 GB is available
and all these are other you know root
systems which I'm not you know bothered
about right now right so important is my
dis one
this file root file system right so
let's see the next command now so I'm
going to clear the terminal so the next
command I'm going to show you is
the D you command and this D you command
is used to estimate and display the disk
space used by files okay
so for example right now in I'm in my
home folder and I want to estimate the
displace used in this folder called
download so I will just go to the
Downloads folder so just right download
CD download and then I can use this
command so just write D U and then press
Enter
so it's going to you know give you all
this output and at the last it's going
to give you the amount of space used by
this folder right now this is also not
very human readable so we can just write
D U and the flag H for zoom the human
readable you know form so just give D u
minus H and then press enter once again
and now I can see that this folder is
using four hundred and sixteen megabytes
of disk space right I can do the same in
my home folder but it has lots and lots
of files so these files has to be you
know it prints these files first and
then gives you the memory disk space
usage here right so in my home folder
there are lots and lots of files and I
just want to see this output not all the
output related to files so for that I
can use D you command and then I can use
the S command for summary so this s flag
is for summary and then I can also use
the H for human readable right so d u- s
h and then press enter and then it's
going to calculate the memory and in few
seconds you are going to see all the
memory used here so you can see my home
directory is using 2.5 gb ok
and now you
can see these you know warnings kind of
things and says permission denied
permitted and denied and permission
denied because it's possible that I
don't have permission to access these
files right so I can use with this
command do you - SH I can use this
command with sudo okay and then I can
give my password and now it's going to
give me the direct output without these
warnings okay so this D you command will
help you to estimate and display the
disk space used by files
now the third command which I'm going to
show you is the free command okay and
this free command displays the total
amount of free and used physical and
swap memory in the system as well as the
buffer used by the kernel okay so we can
just use free here and then press ENTER
and then it's going to give you the used
space here and then the free space here
and the cache space which is used by
your kernel right but important in your
case is this line of code which is this
one and this one so this much amount of
you know memory is used by your system
and this is the amount of memory which
is free in your system but this is also
not human readable so there are from
some flags which you can use with this
free command and these flags are for
example - B for byte - K 4 kilobyte - M
for megabyte - G 4 gigabyte and - Tara
for terabyte right so - Tara Tara for
terabyte so we are going to just see the
values in megabyte first and then we are
going to see the values in gigabytes
okay so - M for megabyte with this free
space
and then when you give this command now
I can see in a more better way that
around 1.1 GB is used at around 0.8 GB
is you know free and for example I can
use G flag and now it gives me this
output which is one is used and zero is
you know free because it's not taking
the in consideration the points decimal
points right so it's better to use the M
command for megabyte and you can read it
easily here okay so these are the some
of the command which you can use to view
the memory usage in your system let's
recap these commands once again so I
will clear the terminal first of all and
the first command was DF command right
and this DF command was used to report
the amount of available disk space being
used by your file system right and you
can use minus h4 with it to you know
view the human readable form then the
next was the D you command right so this
D you command will help you to estimate
and display the disk space used by the
files right and with this you can use
the S flag also to view the summary
right and you can use even the folder
named after these flags you can for
example you want to know the disk space
used by etc' folder you can even give
the folder name here after these flags
and then it's going to give you the you
know disk space used by etc' folder and
for these permission denied you can use
this D you command with sudo so these
warning will not be shown right then we
have seen the free command
and this free command is going to
display the total amount of free and
used physical and swap memory in the
system right and then we can use some
flags with it for example B for byte and
K per kilobyte and for mega by G for
gigabyte and tariff or you know terabyte
and you can even use minus H for human
readable form okay so once again I can
do this and you can see now it gives
these values and human readable forms
and this is one point one GB and this is
864 megabytes
okay so in this way you can use the
memory in your system I hope you enjoyed
