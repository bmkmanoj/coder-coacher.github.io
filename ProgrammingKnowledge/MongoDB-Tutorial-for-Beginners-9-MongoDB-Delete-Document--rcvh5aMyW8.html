MongoDB database tutorial for beginners
in this video we will see how we can
delete a document or remove a document
using MongoDB so let's get started first
of all we will just print all the
documents we have so I will just write
DB dot student not find and execute it
and it's showing all the documents we
have now to remove a document we need a
command once again DB dot
student dot you guessed it right remove
okay and remove function or this method
takes a few arguments which we can
provide so we will see a one by one how
we can use this remove command
so the basic command remove if you
execute this command without any
argument then it's going to remove all
the documents ok so just you know handle
this command with care otherwise it's
going to remove all your documents if
you don't pass any arguments here
otherwise when you pass some arguments
so first of all I will give these curly
braces and inside these curly brackets
what we can do is we can give some
condition so the condition can be for
example first of all which document we
want to remove so we can remove a
document based upon a unique identifier
and in here we have this unique
identifier called ID which is created by
a MongoDB for us right so we can use
this one let's use this ID let's remove
the last document which we have inserted
which is this one and just paste it in
here ok and I'm going to just execute
this command and it says removed one
right so I'm going to once again
find all the documents so we can see if
it's removed or not and you can see our
document is removed from here right
because there is no ID which is
something like this 9f at the end right
so this is one way of removing the
document the other way of removing the
document for example on the basis of
parameter which can affect multiple
document so for example we want to
remove the document of a student whose
age is 16 and we can see here there are
two student whose age is 16 here right
so we can just give this parameter age
is equal to 16 and then it's going to
remove both these documents right but
first of all if you don't want to remove
both the document if you want to remove
only one document then there is a
parameter which is something like this
if you provide a number one after these
curly braces so just give comma and then
give a number one something like this
okay and this will tell MongoDB that we
just want to delete only one document
even this condition is matching multiple
you know documents but we just want to
delete one so just right after this
curly bracket comma and one and it's
going to remove only one document okay
otherwise if you don't give this comma
one here is going to remove these both
the documents so let's give this command
first and let's see what happens and it
says removed two documents and then we
can print this
documents and you can see all these
documents which has age 16 is removed or
are removed okay so if you want to
remove only one document just give comma
one otherwise you can you know remove on
the basis of some condition like this
okay so I hope you you have enjoyed this
