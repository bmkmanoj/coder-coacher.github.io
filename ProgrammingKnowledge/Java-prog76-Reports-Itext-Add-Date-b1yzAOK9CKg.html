video I will show you how to show date
in your I text report so let's get
started
for example you want the show date on
top of your report after your hello
world title you want to show the report
so this is the code I have written in
the last video and go to here I have
written document dot open after that I
have written my title which is hello
world and in between my title and my
line I am going to write the date so
just I will add one more paragraphs or
document dot add this is closed and here
add new paragraph and in brackets so and
here I will write my date so for example
I want to show my date in between my
title of my line so I will write here
new the a te8 dot
to the string I am right that and it's
showing some error so what I have to do
what you have to do is I have to add the
import file for my date so what is the
import file for my date is go to the top
of your program and in here where you
add all your imports just import one
more file which is import Java dot util
dot date this file you have to import
and hopefully my error will be gone so
let's see if my error is gone or not now
go to my design I will take report know
my ever is not good it's because after
this to string I haven't provided the
brackets and after date also provided
the brackets so you have to write this
in order to show date into your reports
what I have done I have added one new
paragraph in and in here I have written
new date brackets dot two strings
brackets to the just this line and I
have included and import file Java dot
util dot date so these two things I have
and glass let's see my date is included
in my report or not so right-click in
one file and this is my J Prime I will
click report and report is saved and I
will go to the location where my report
is saved so here my report is saved I
will click my report and you can see the
date today is Saturday August 11 and
this is time this is the time zone and
this is the year so in this way you can
add date to your report so this was the
tutorial and I hope you have enjoyed and
learn something new today and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
