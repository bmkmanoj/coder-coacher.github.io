bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use panels in
bootstrap a panel is kind of a box which
is bordered and you can add some tables
or any component inside this panel so
for example we want to add a panel just
below our Jumbotron here how we can do
it let's see so first of all go to your
HTML file and inside your container just
below the Jumbotron
we can add one more dev element here and
this will be our row so class is equal
to row okay and inside this row we are
going to add one more div tag and in
here we will add a class called panel
space panel - default okay so this will
be the bare body of our panel now inside
a panel you can add a body of a panel
heading of the panel and the footer for
the panel so first of all we will add
the body of the panel so just add a div
element like this and in here just add a
class called panel - body and this will
be the body of the panel and in here you
can add your content for example body of
panel ok and you can save it and run it
into your browser and the basic panel
will look like this now we can add some
header and footer to our panel and how
we can do it we can add just above our
body div element we can add one more
development for the header so plus is
equal to
panel heading for the heading and just
below the body you can add the dev
element for adding the footer so class
is equal to panel - footer okay and in
the heading you can add some heading for
example heading and for pull footer you
can add something like this okay save it
and refresh your page and this will be
the heading of your panel and this will
be the footer for your panel
okay now for example we want to add some
more attractive component for example h3
through tag or h1 tag or some tables or
something else inside the body so let's
see how we can add our title for example
here in the heading so once again I will
just make a space here and for example I
want to add h3 tag so I will just add
this h3 tag and I will add a class
called panel title ok and in here
whatever title you give it will be
displays ads displayed as a panel title
so refresh your page and it will be like
this ok or for example you want to add
some paragraph inside the body instead
of this content you can just copy a
paragraph and in the body element
develoment
just add this paragraph tag and add your
paragraph save it and refresh your page
and this paragraph will look like this
in the same way you can add other
components like lists or tables or any
HTML tag okay in the same way you can
modify the footer also with the element
or component of your choice now panel
also has different you know taste and
styles so let's see how we can add
different styles to panels so I will
just revert this paragraph and I will
just add my previous body of the panel
which is very small and what I am going
to do now is I will just copy this panel
from this panel panel - default just
copy this code from here and just paste
it below okay one two three and four for
example so first kind of panel was
default right second kind of panel can
be primary as we have seen there are
different kind of buttons like default
primary warning success or info in a
same way we can give styles to panel in
the same way default primary third can
be success fourth can be warning and
fifth can be for example info okay and
save it and refresh your page and you
can see different kind of panel this is
the default one this is the primary this
is success panel this is warning panel
and this is our info panel so these are
the different kind of panels you can add
to your bootstrap web page now in order
to add this panel in alongside each
other what you can do is for example we
want three panels in one row and three
panels in the second row okay so what we
can do is we can add this div tag and
this will be our class for the
column right so call sm- for okay and
just close your column they've tagged
from here and in the same way you can
just do the same for the other dev
column so here and and it here and once
again copy this and end it at the end of
your panel okay so this is our one row
right and we can and our row instead of
here here right and let's say we just
want three columns and we don't want
this to other panels save it and refresh
your page and it will be three panels in
a row okay in the same way you can add
one more row of three panels and in the
same way you can add multiple rows of
panels so I hope you are understood the
basic concept of panels in bootstrap and
