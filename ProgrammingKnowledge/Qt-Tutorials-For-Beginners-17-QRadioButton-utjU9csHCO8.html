cutie tutorial for beginners in the last
video we have seen how we can use check
boxes in QT now in this video we are
going to see how we can use radio
buttons in QT now the first question is
what is the difference between radio
buttons and checkboxes so let's see so
I've created this blank project and I'm
going to go to my main window dot UI and
in here first of all I'm going to take
two radio buttons and I'm also going to
take two checkboxes this is to show the
different behavior for checkboxes and
the radio buttons and I'm not going to
do anything I'm going to just run this
app for now okay so when this builds and
runs we will be able to see the
difference hopefully so when I click
this radio button it's selected and when
I click the other radio button you can
see the first radio button is unselected
and the second is selected so in a group
you can only choose one radio button
right but when I choose the checkbox you
can see I can choose the both of the
checkboxes
so the basic difference between
checkboxes and radio button is whenever
you want to ask the user to choose
multiple options then you can use
checkboxes but whenever you want to
allow the user to choose one option out
of many then you can choose radio
buttons right so this is the difference
between checkboxes and radio buttons now
let's see how we can use them so I'm
going to remove these two checkboxes and
now I will just just add two names here
for example mark and John okay and we
will ask the user which they name do he
like he cannot choose obviously both the
names because we are using radio
buttons right and we can use this push
button which say check okay now I'm
going to just right click on this push
button go to the slot and click choose
the clicked option and click OK and in
here we can just check it so first of
all we will add a cue message box class
which are because we want to show some
message when this check box is or radio
button is selected right so we can just
add this cue message box class first of
all so just choose this and in here on
push button clicked method we can just
write if the radio button is check so
you can use UI then the radio button
name so for example radio button 1 so
let's see which radio button is for
which one
so this radio button is radio button
right you can see in the property here
and the second radio button here is
radio button 2 for John right so we can
use these radio buttons in the source
file here so first of all this is for a
mark right so we can just choose is
checked which will give us the boolean
value as we have seen in the last video
and then we can just add a cue message
box and we can show the information here
and then this takes 3 argument as you
already know probably that this is the
title and the third is the message we
want to display here right so for
example we can just say mark here ok and
if the other radio button is selected
then we will display the other name so
we can just use UI and then the second
radio button name which is a radio
button 2 dot is checked and then if it
gives us true then we can say the other
name is selected which is John right so
let's
run our app and let's see what happens
so let's build our program you can see
it's building and now it's running so
when I choose marker and press check it
says mark and when I choose John here
and press this check button it says
strangely mark and then John let's see
what I have done wrong here yes this
method is checkable I wanted to use this
checked is checked method but I by
mistake used is checkable which is
obviously true because we are checking
from this method if the radio button is
checkable which is true right so we can
just use this is checked method and run
our app once again and let's see what
happens
once again so mark shows mark John shows
John right so in this way you can use
radio buttons now for example you want
to use multiple groups of radio button
so if you want to ask the user multiple
questions right so you want to ask the
user what is his favorite name and also
you want to ask the user that what is
his favorite Pat for example Freddy
favorite el animal and when you do this
here and let's say I will write cat and
dog here and when you do this and when
you run the program you cannot ask these
two question in a single container I
mean this main window widget right so
when you choose this and when you choose
cat you can see it's unchecked but this
is these two radio buttons for different
questions right and these two are four
different questions so how we can
differentiate them so whenever you just
select these two radio buttons and add
it inside a container for example this
vertical layout something like this and
this also in a vertical layout then they
are in a container
then when you run the program and let's
see what happens now so now when I check
this and when I check this both had
checked because in a container they this
is a kind of group so these two radio
buttons are the part of this container
and these two radio buttons are the part
of this container so this is kind of a
group right so you can differentiate
these questions like this okay
so I hope you've enjoyed this video
