Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to give you a brief
introduction about SPT so first of all
what is SPT so SPT which stands for
Scala build tool and which is formerly
used to be known as simple build tool is
an open-source build tool for Scala and
Java project now first of all we need to
understand what is a build tool so a
build tool provides a facility to
compile run tests and package your
projects and SBT is such tool now in the
category of build tools you may have
previously known Java maven or ant and
SBT falls in the same category now if
you are familiar with C make is such a
build tool also now SBT is a modern
build tool while it is written in Scala
and provides many Scala convenience it
is a general-purpose build tool so you
can create for example Java projects
also with SBT and it's really popular as
a build tool for creating and
maintaining Scala projects that's why it
is a de-facto build tool for Scala now
when you will visit Scala official
website also they recommend SBT as a
build tool and when you will install SBT
on your operating system you don't need
to install Scala separately so if you
have as bt installed then you will be
able to build and run Scala project
automatically on your operating system
now let's talk about some of the most
important features about SBT so SBT have
native support for compiling Scala code
as you already know that SBT is written
in scala SBT uses apache IV for
dependency manager
and that means it also can support the
Maven format repositories so if you want
to use maven format repositories in your
scala project SBT will enable you to do
that now SBT works on the principle of
only update on request model that we
will see later when we will create our
scala project using SBT now SBT has full
scholar language support for creating
tasks and also if you want to create
mixed Java and Scala projects SBT
supports that also now when you install
SBT it comes with apple or read eval
print loop now wrapping is a simple
interactive computer programming
environment that takes a single input
evaluates them and return the result so
if you want to test any small
functionality about Scala rapid or read
eval print loop will help you immensely
so these are some of the most important
features about SBT now in the next video
I am going to show you how you can
install SBT on your operating system so
stay tuned and please rate comment
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
