video I will show you how to share your
Ubuntu guest files and Windows host for
files or folder so if suppose if you
have some folder in your Windows 7
operating system and your VirtualBox
installed and in that you have Ubuntu
installed and you want to share some
files from Windows in to open to
operating system how can you do this I
will show you today so go to your
VirtualBox
as you can see here and go to the
settings this one and go to other
folders here last one
this is a German but the last option you
need to click the folder one and in here
you will click this plus sign but before
that let me make a folder so I make a
folder called Windows 7 share in this I
will I have placed some one or two files
which I will share and over to system so
just make a folder and name it
according to your convenience and now go
to this other folders and go here this
plus sign and
go others and choose your folder which
you have made I can see this folder
windows 7 share okay and you can give
the name of the folder also okay and you
need to click this permanent option in
order to share your folder permanently
and automatically recognized so check
these two option and press ok and press
ok once again now go to your Ubuntu
operating system
and open a terminal for this in Ubuntu
you must have guessed edition of
VirtualBox installed in order to see
that shared folder if you don't know how
to installed VirtualBox guest additions
in the last video I have shown how to
install this VirtualBox guest guest
addition to improve the appearance of
and resolution of your Ubuntu so just
install guest a PA guest VirtualBox
guest so after that after installing
this guest version of VirtualBox in your
terminal you must go to media CD media
and press enter
sorry I spelled it incorrect so
I'll correct the swelling
see the media
before this slash okay so we are in
media folder and here are going to do
PWD command to see yes we are media
folder and in here you will write sudo
make directory sudo mkdir Windows 7
share this is the name of the folder
which we have created in our window so
here
when you take this
this name you have to write their
windows 7 share so make directory in
those seven share and press Enter
and the password
and it has made the directory into your
media folder
after you are done with making the
folder you need to type the command
SoDo mount - t BB o x SF and here is
your instead of this you need to write
the name of your folder which you have
created so I I will write Windows 7
shell
okay
so this is the name of the folder which
I created in the virtual box which I
have shown you earlier and then I will
press Enter
and yes because the command has been
executed successfully and now when you
go to the media folder or if you can see
in the dominant box Tommy come on here
and you right yeah LS you can see one
new folder has been created which is
called Windows 7 share so I will go to
Windows 7 share share
and I will write CD Windows 7 share I
will go to that folder when I write LS
to list out the content of this folder I
can see two files which I have kept in
my Windows 7 folder which I have created
in Windows you can see choice question
on screen XPS and when I see the same
folder here Windows 7 share I can see
the same two files here so in this way
you can share your directories for
example I want to share one more file
like this and then I will go to the
terminal and I will tell us once again
let's see if it's there or not and yes
it's there the third file is added here
so in this way you can share your files
between Windows 7 post and window guest
on VirtualBox so I hope you have learned
something new this time please wait a
minute and subscribe and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
