scholar to troll for beginners in this
video we will talk about two method
which we are generally using with the
collections in Scala and those methods
are map and filter method so let's talk
about the map method first of all so the
map method we typically use to iterate
over a collection it can be a list or
array or a set or any other kind of a
collection and then apply a function to
each element of that collection so as
you can see I have a variable called
list and this is the list of some
numbers and I also have a second
variable called my map and this is the
map of a number versus a name map let's
say so let's say I want to apply a map
method on the list so I'm going to just
use my list name then I'm going to use
dot map and as I said the map method
will iterate over every element of the
collection in our case it's a list and
then we can apply any function on it so
let's say we want to just double every
element of my list so what we can do is
we can just use underscore Asterix -
which is going to just double every
element in the list and gave us the new
list with the double number right so I'm
going to run the code and you can see
the list elements are now doubled but
this will not change the content of LST
is going to give us the new list with
the each element which is doubled now if
you want to be more specific you can
also write something like this so X then
this rocket symbol and then you can just
write x
Astrix - which will also perform the
same operation on every element of this
list which is going to give us the same
result so either you can use the
underscore or you can use this explicit
function to you know apply on your each
element of your collection let's say I
want to just add two to each element
then you can see two is added to each
element of my list
I can even just let's say divide and
then I want to divide it by 0.2 so I'm
going to run the code and you can see
every element is divided by 0.2 and
result is given to us now we can also
apply this map function with a string
also so let's say we just want to add hi
so I'm going to just say hi and then
plus and then on each element so I'm
going to just write X here and I'm going
to run the code and you can see it just
up ends hi before each element of that
list now let's say I just write
something like this so hi
and then Astrix what this will do is I'm
going to run the code and let's see what
happens so in the result you can see it
will just print hi the number of time
which is given in the list so if the
first element in the list is 1 then Y
will be iterated one time if the element
is 2 then it will be iterated two times
or three times or five times and so on
now let's use that map method with our
map also which is a collection map so we
can just write print Ln and then we will
just write my map which is the variable
name dot map and let's apply the map so
we will just say
a X rocket and then once again let's
print high so high and then plus X and
let's see what happens when we run the
code so when we run the code it appends
high to every element of my map so this
is essentially a tuple so every element
in the map or key value pair in the map
is a couple so it's printed as a tuple
and high is appended in front of that
couple now let's say we just want to
apply the map on the values of this map
so we can just write dot map and then
values which will apply this function on
only the values so not on the keys so
one two and three our keys here and Tom
Max and John are the values here so it
will only apply this method on the
values so I'm going to just run the code
and you can see the keys are unchanged
and hi is appended before every value hi
Tom hi Max and hi John now you can use
map with a string also so I'm going to
just write print Ln and then here I'm
going to just write hello in small
letters and let's say I want to just
print this hello in capital letters so I
can just use dot map here and then I
will call a method called two upper so
I'm going to just write underscore which
is a wild card of every element and then
I'm going to just call a method dot to
upper on every element of this string
which is a character h-e-l-l-o right so
I'm going to just run the code and you
can see it prints hello in capital
so what's happening here so this is a
string so this map will iterate over
every character of the string and then
apply to upper on every character of
that string and then give us the result
that's why we see hello in capital now
let's also talk about a flat turn method
on our collection so I'm going to just
write print Ln so let's say I have a
list which is a list of lists so let's
say I'm going to just write lists here
and inside this list we have some lists
so list off lists so like this and this
list contain 1 comma 2 comma 3 and then
comma the other list contains let's say
3 4 5 so 3 comma 4 comma 5 okay so we
have lists of lists here so our method
called flatten is going to just combine
those lists inside that list and then
give us the result so let's just print
that first and then we will apply the
flat own method on that list so the
normal result is something like this but
let's say we want to join those lists
inside the list and then we want to show
the results so we use the method called
flat turn and let's see what happens
when we call this method on our list of
lists so you can see now we have one
list which is the combination of the
element of the first list and the second
list which are two elements of the list
okay so flattened we'll just as the name
suggests flattens the content of this
list and why I have shown you this
flatten method because I want to
illustrate a
method called flat map and this flat map
method act as a shorthand to a map a
collection and then immediately flat on
it so let's say we have our list here
define so I'm going to first of all just
write print Ln and on that list what I
want to do is so LST I'm going to just
write LST and then I'm going to write
flat map here and in the parentheses
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
just say on every element of my list I
want to just give a list so let's say I
want to just return a list with that
element and that I'm lament' plus 1
let's say okay so let's run the code and
let's see what happens this should be
print line and let's run the code now
and you can see what happens here is we
have this list so 1 2 3 5 7 10 13 and we
got a list like this so what happened
here is this method is going to give us
the list of that element and then that
element plus 1 so this method is applied
to first element and then we will get
the first element which is X and then X
plus 1 is 2 so we get 1 2 then this
method is applied to the second element
so we have X as 2 and X plus 1 is 3 here
that's why we get these two result and
then same we have applied this method on
3 so we have 3 and 4 and then 5 and 6
and so on ok and because we have called
a flat map because flap map act as a
shorthand for map and then directly
flatten that list once again
that's why we are just getting the
flattened list here okay if we just call
the map here so I'm going to just call a
map method then what we will get then we
will get the list which we were
expecting so if we apply dot map then we
get a list of lists like this but we
apply a flat map here so it's flat and
then map that's why it flattened the
list and then we get this result now at
the end let's talk about the filter
method also so I'm going to just write
print Ln once again and then this filter
method is generally used with a
predicate so I'm going to let's say list
dot filter so what is a predicate first
of all so a predicate is a function that
returns a boolean value okay so
generally we give a predicate as an
argument of this filter so what that
means is we give a method as an argument
to this filter which returns us a
boolean value so I'm going to just write
x then rocket and let's say we want to
just check or we want to just get all
the even values out of that list so I
can just write x then modulus two equals
zero and I'm going to run this code and
then this gives us only the even value
out of this list which is two and ten
let's say I just want to get the odd
values so I can just write something
like this and then I will just get the
odd values out of that list so filter is
always used with a predicate and
predicate is a function which will give
you a boolean value so this is how you
can
use map flatmap flatten and filter
method with Scala I hope you've enjoyed
