teach you about class inheritance in
c-sharp c-sharp is an object-oriented
programming language and inheritance is
one of the most important concept in
object-oriented programming inheritance
allows us to define a class in terms of
other class which makes it easier to
create and maintain our application so
this allows us to reuse our code and
that makes our code error free and fast
to implement so let me give you an
example first so we have these three
squares as you can see here so suppose
you want to make the classes of polygons
so polygons can be a rectangle or a
square or a triangle and all are we can
say all our polygons right and some of
the properties in rectangle square and
triangle are same for example their
height and their width are same right so
rectangle also has width and height the
square also has built an ID and this
triangle also have with a knife and
suppose you want to calculate the area
of the rectangle square and triangle
using rectangle class square class and
triangle class then you need to define
the length and width of all these
classes but if you think that all these
length and width are same similar or
same in all these polygons as we can say
so we can define a base
last polygon for example which will
contain our two variables which are
length and width or height or and width
right and we can use this height and
width for rectangle also for square also
and for triangle class also okay so we
are going to define a polygon class
which we say or which we can say it's a
base class and we are going to define
for example rectangle class and triangle
class which we will call them derived
class so this is a base class or parent
class and these are the derived class or
the child class which takes some
attributes from your base class which is
a polygon class right now this kind of
implement on which this inheritance is
based upon is called or is a
implementation so rectangle is a polygon
right square is a polygon and triangle
is a polygon so whenever you use this
concept try to relate this is a concept
whatever is a base class then you can
apply them in inheritance I will give
you an other example for example we have
the base class animal right and we can
there we can define derived class like
dog dog is our animal right cat is a
animal so cat can be derived class or
any other animal
for example elephant is a animal okay
so animal can be your base class and the
dog cat and elephant can be or they
right class now
enough of this concept let's try to
write some code okay so we will go to
our video studio here and we will try to
make these classes so first of all let
me define a polygon class which will be
our base class I'll write plus polygon
and then I will give these tools curly
braces and inside this class we will
define two variable which are the member
variable of the this polygon class so I
will bind public and then this can be
integer value so I will say public int
width comma height okay so this is our
base class and suppose it we want to
calculate the area of the class so we
need to set the width and height first
right so we will also define a public
public method which will be void set
values for example that values and we
will set the values of width and height
so we will say in a comma int B or is
our parameters and in the implementation
of these parameters we can save this dot
width is equal to a and in the similar
way we can say this dot
height is equal to be right okay so this
is the definition of our base class and
this should be public okay now we can
define the derived class so how we can
divide the defined derived class form
this base class once again you will
write class and let's define rectangle
class rectangle and these curly braces
we will define for first of all I almost
forgot this so whenever you want to
inherit polygon so this is a base class
and this is a derived class so you need
to give this colon here and then give
the name of your base class which is a
polygon so this kind of implementation
whenever you write this colon and then
give the name of the base class then
your rectangle class which is a DR
derived class knows that you are
inheriting the values or the variables
of this base class to the rectangle
class okay
and now here we can create a method so
we can write public method called for
example in area okay so we want to
calculate the area of these polygons
rectangle and triangle right so we can
say here area can be what can be area we
can return return for rectangle the area
is the width
and the height the multiplication of
both right so you can say width x height
okay so if you have a noticed that I
haven't defined width and height in this
rectangle but whenever you provide this
base class as a inheritance class for
example to the derived class it inherits
all the values or all the members of the
base class so rectangle also have width
and height which is inherited from the
base class okay and I will once again
copy this class and I will paste it here
and this time I will define a triangle
class triangle okay and this also has
access to the polygon members which are
width height and set values okay so the
area of the triangle can be half of the
height and the width okay I will / -
right
so what you have done you have defined a
base class in which you have the width
and height as a public variable and we
have defined set values method in our
base class which sets the value of width
and height okay now we have defined a
derived class which is rectangle and we
for inheriting well for inheriting the
values from the base class we just need
to give : and the name of the base class
here so now your class rectangle knows
that I am inheriting from the polygon
class and I have the access to width
height and set value method in my class
okay similarly we have done the
for this triangle now to access these
classes or depth to define the instance
of rectangle and the triangle class we
can say rectangle
Rack is equal to new rectangle okay so
we have created the object in a similar
way we will create the object of
triangle triangle TR IG is equal to new
triangle okay so we have created the
instance of triangle class and the
rectangle class or object of both these
both class now for example I use this
rectangle object from here and whenever
I press dot you see here I have the axis
to set values which is the method in the
polygon class so because rectangle was
inheriting the venues from the polygon
we have the access to the methods in
polygon class so we can say set values
and we can set two values for example
ten and second value is also for example
20 the same thing we can do for this
Draycott triangle object dot set values
so this has also the access to set
values and we can say this time also
this is 30 and 20 for example okay so
whenever you create this derived class
and base class you have that the derived
classes object always have the public
member axis
from the base class right now to
calculate the area I can say console dot
write line write line and in the console
I can I can print the area of both
classes so I I say rectangle area is
equal to and in the placeholder we pass
the rectangle area which is rectangle
which is our object rect dot area we
have the number function area in
rectangle right here is our area okay
and we will give the semicolon in the
same way we can do this for triangle
type I can say triangle area and I will
copy this triangle object and paste if
you and because this area is returning
integer this way this function will
return an integer and will be printed
here right now whenever I run my program
you will be able to see the area of the
triangle and rectangle see here
rectangle area is 200 which is 10 into
20 right and the triangle area is 300
which is 330 into 20 which is 600
divided by 2 okay so in this way you can
define base classes and derived classes
and in this way you can implement the
concept of the inheritance and what are
the uses of in the inheritance
it makes your code smaller because this
width and with this height and set when
you you have defined only at one places
and you can define multiple class
rectangle triangle square and or any
other polygon and you can use this width
and height in each of the class using
this inherit inheritance right so it
makes your code smaller it makes your
implementation faster and it will
whenever your code is smaller it's easy
to read and it will be more error-free
right and one more important thing is
whenever you define or declare the
object or instance of your derived class
you are based loss will be automatically
initialized right so once again whenever
you define the object of a derived class
your base class will be initialized
automatically so to prove this concept
or to understand this concept I can
define
the constructor for example
public polygons constructor okay which
takes nothing and we can print something
yeah so I will just copy this control
dot write line and paste it here and I
can say here that we are in base class
okay in a similar way for example I can
define the constructor for this
rectangle I will just write public
rectangle and I can say once again I
will control dot write line and I can
say we are in derived class or derived
rectangle class okay
and for example I can comment this code
to demonstrate my example so I will just
comment this and here also okay so we
have just declared our object rectangle
right and when I run this program you
see here whenever I created my object of
my derived class it calls VR in base
class so first it initialized the spawn
polygon class and then it shows we are
in derived rectangle class so then it
initializes your derived class so
whenever you declare the object of type
class your base class will be
automatically initialized okay
the other important thing to note is a
class which is a derived class can only
inherit from one class so for example if
you create some other class I will
create some other class here for example
like this like this and I will say this
is my rectangle one for example and I
want to inherit from rectangle one and
polygon at the same time so come up
rectangles one this is not possible okay
and this will give you an error right
because you cannot inherit from to play
base classes at the same time okay so
when I try to run the program it gives
me an error okay but you can have
multiple inheritances so I have this
rectangle one right and what I can do is
I can inherit from rectangle class here
okay so what this will do is let me copy
and paste it below my rectangle class so
what this is doing our rectangle class
is inheriting from my polygon and my
rectangle one is inheriting from my
rectangle class so inner indirectly it's
inheriting also from the polygon so for
example I will create an instance of
rectangle one class rectangle re c1 is
equal to new rectangle one and then
whenever I use this rectangle one and
see you after dot when I
we use this dot here I have the access
to area which is apart or which is a
member function are in our rectangle
class we have the XS to set values which
is a class in our polygon class right so
this also we have the axis we have the
access to width and height which is in
our polygon class right so indirectly we
can inherit from the polygon like this
okay so this is multiple inheritance so
I think that's it for this video I hope
you have understood the concept of basic
concept on inheritance and I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
