tutorial for beginners using html5 now
the first question you may ask yourself
is what is HTML now HTML which stands
for hypertext markup language is the
language for specifying the static
content of web pages now what does this
mean for example whenever you open any
web site for example I'm using Firefox
browser and this is the default page and
any web page which you see on web
browser has a code behind it and it's
written in HTML along with some other
languages like JavaScript PHP or some
styling sheets like CSS and other stuff
but the static content which you see for
example some paragraph or some heading
or some other stuff like tables and
links it's all HTML now whenever you
open your web page any web page you just
right click on it and just click on view
page source it's available on any other
browser like Chrome or Safari you just
right click and just click on view on
source and here you will see all the
HTML code which is responsible for this
page right so this is all written in
HTML now what is the meaning of static
there are two kind of web pages one is
dynamic web page and other is static web
page so static web page is a page in
which you can only see the content for
example you can see tables paragraphs or
some article headings and other stuff
and a dynamic page is a page
in which you can interact with the web
page for example you can submit your
username and password to your gmail
account or Facebook account and then it
authenticates this username and password
with the server-side scripting and then
you get your login F access right so
this kind of pages are called dynamic
pages okay but all the you know web
pages which you see on your browser have
this kind of code and the static content
of all the pages are due to this HTML
now what is the history of this HTML
language right so in the year 1991 the
first version of HTML came which was
really basic and it doesn't include any
multimedia like video or audio or any
other content and then it was you know
in 1995 the second version of HTML came
which was HTML 2 in 1997 the third
version which was HTML 3.2 came and in
1999 the fourth version came which was
4.0.1
and in the year 2000 came the version
called XHTML and recently in the year
2014 came the newest version of HTML
which was html5 now what are the new
features in HTML 5 so in html5 it came
with new tags features and api's now
this is the list which is non exhaustive
list of features that tend to be labeled
as HTML for example new structural
elements like header footer nav which
stands for navigation bars and other
tags are introduced in this version
then the new form came which was called
forms 2.0 and the client-side validation
came in html5 then native browser
support for audio and video also was
introduced in html5 using this tag
called video and audio and then one more
thing which was introduced is canvas API
and SVG the other thing is web storage
offline applications geolocation
drag-and-drop and web workers are also
introduced in the new version and the
last but not the least is the new
communication API which was service and
events and WebSockets are also
introduced in html5 right so html5 came
with these new features but these are
not only feature which came there are a
huge list of new feature which came with
html5 and that we are going to learn but
in this video series we are also going
to learn all the basic concepts in HTML
itself like how we can create our first
web page and how to you know start from
the beginning by creating your web page
to creating a full-fledged web page with
interactive things right now to get
started with HTML what do we need we
don't need much we didn't just need our
text editor which can be any editor for
example notepad plus plus added last
Dream wavered text made and there are
some advanced IDE s
for developing your website using HTML
which can be Eclipse NetBeans Visual
Studio also supports HTML and other
advanced IDE s
IDE stands for integrated development
environment which can which you can use
to develop HTML pages now second thing
you need to
test your web pages is the web browser
it can be any web browser for example
Firefox Internet Explorer Chrome or
Safari okay so we can test on any web
browser right now let's see how we can
create a simple HTML web page okay so
I'm not going to explain the content
which I'm going to use inside the HTML
page but we are going to create how we
can create our HTML page so just go to
your any folder in which you want to
create this file right click on it and
then new and click text file and in here
delete everything and just write the
name of your HTML page for example index
dot HTML and then just click yes and
it's going to become a HTML page now you
can open this HTML by varieties of
editors for example notepad plus plus as
I said or native notepad which was
available in Windows so you can just
right click open with and you can just
choose for WordPad or notepad from here
ok so just open it in word pad for
example and in here you just write your
code for HTML right now the basic code
in HTML looks like this and this I'm
going to explain you everything each and
every thing what this is and what this
head is and what the body is everything
I'm going to explain in the later videos
but this is what you can say a basic
HTML page now you can save this by
clicking Save button and it will be
saved and once your document is saved
what you can do is go to your HTML file
and right click on it and then you can
open with any browser here so I am going
to
on it with Firefox and it's going to
look like this so we have the heading
and the paragraph and here it's called a
page title these are the things I'm
going to explain you in details in the
later videos but the basic web page will
look like this on your browser right so
just be ready to develop our own HTML
web pages hello guys welcome to the next
video on HTML tutorial for beginners
using html5 in this video we will see
how to download and install few editors
for developing HTML web pages now in
this video I'm going to talk about two
editors one is really simple and easy
which is notepad plus plus and second is
Eclipse IDE which is really advanced but
easy to use ok so first of all how to
download and install notepad plus plus
you just need to search for notepad plus
plus and the site here will pop up will
be from notepad minus plus minus plus
dot o-r-g just click this link and if
you want to read more about knowing that
plus plus Lu you can read it from here
but otherwise you can go to download and
in here you have this notepad plus plus
installer just click this it will be
downloaded in the form of Exe file just
run it it's really simple and it will be
installed in one minute I can say so
once you have installed notepad plus
plus you just need to click this icon
here and it'll look like this and for
the first time when you want to create a
HTML file you can just click new from
here or go to file and click new and
then save it as so just right click on
it and save as and choose the folder
where you want to you know you want to
create this file and in the extension
you need to choose HTML from here and
then you just need to give the name to
your file for example
dot HTML and save it and it will be
saved in the form of HTML and you can
start writing your HTML code like this
ok so once you have written your code
you can save it and then just go to run
and then you can launch your code in
Firefox Internet Explorer Chrome Safari
or other browsers right so this is
notepad plus plus now in order to
install Eclipse IDE it can be a little
bit overwhelming but I can guarantee you
it will help you in the longer run so
for installing Eclipse IDE first of all
you need to have a Java JDK installed on
your system and Java you can install it
by going to the Oracle website so just
search for Java JDK and the first link
which will pop up here will be from
Oracle comm and then some extension just
click this link here and you will see
Java here I will put the link in the
description of the video which I have
made to install Java JDK on your windows
operating system so you can see it and
see how we can install Java JDK on our
Windows operating system including the
environment variables ok so just click
that link and then you can see how I
have installed Java JDK once you have
installed Java JDK and set up your
environment variable for Java JDK
then you can go to install Eclipse IDE
now in order to download eclipse ID the
simple thing is to do search for Eclipse
download and the first link which will
pop up here will be from Eclipse Auto g
slash downloads and go here
and in here you will see variety of
Eclipse IDE for developing Java for
developing C++ PHP and other languages
but what we want is Eclipse IDE for Java
EE developers ok so we want this first
link which says Java EE okay and if you
read it carefully it says tool for Java
developer creating Java EE and web
applications we are going to develop web
applications that's why we want to use
this right now in order to download it
you need to know which operating system
you have you have 64-bit operating
system or 32-bit operating system in
most of the cases you will be having
64-bit but just be sure which operating
system you have I have 64 so I will
click 64-bit operating system here and
then you will see this download link for
from the mirror which is closest to you
mine is this mirror which is closest to
my location or you can see other
download links when you scroll down
right and they even have some links
which are faster for example IBM you can
click this link and you will be able to
download Eclipse IDE really fast from
these sites and in order to download it
you just need to click download 64-bit
right and click Save okay now it's
relatively bigger file it's around 270
megabytes so you need to wait for a few
minutes to download this file I have
already downloaded this file so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to this
folder where I have downloaded this zip
file so this will be a zip file with the
extension zip you can see here in the
properties right now you need to extract
this so right-click on it extract all
and give the location where you want to
X
this file okay so I'm going to give the
location where I want to extract this
which is inside this folder which I have
created and I will click OK and I will
click extract and this extraction also
going to take some minutes because it's
a big zip file right so this extraction
is going to take few minutes in a
meanwhile you can grab some coffee or
some tea for you
while it's extracting right so once your
Eclipse zip folder is extracted it will
look like this so there will be a clips
folder and when you go inside this
Eclipse folder you will be able to see
all these files and what you need to do
is you need to choose this Eclipse which
has this Eclipse icon here and right
click on it and you can see these option
you can pin it to your taskbar this will
pin this Eclipse to the taskbar and you
can even make a shortcut for eclipse and
you can drag and drop this shortcut to
your desktop here and then you can open
eclipse from here now double click on
Eclipse
and for the first time when you open
eclipse this is the common error if this
error doesn't appear to you then it's
really good but this is really common
error which says JVM terminated exit
code is equal to two and if you face
this error then how to solve it you can
solve it really easily so what you need
to do is you just need to go to your
search option and search for system here
and in the system you just need to click
advanced setting and in advanced setting
go to environment variables and in
environment get variables go to path
here ok and in the path you will be able
to notice here that there is a wrong
Java path which is by default added by
Windows 8 I do
how it's added to this path variables
you need to remove it right so it will
look like this this path is something
like C colon slash program data slash
Oracle slash Java slash Java path you
just need to remove this with semicolon
okay so in my case it's at the first
place I will remove it from here and
make sure that the real Java path is
already provided in your environment
variable which is which will be
something like C colon slash program
file slash Java slash JDK slash bin and
JRE slash bin ok and click OK and click
OK and click OK
and then once again when we run our
Eclipse it will run ok so double click
it and now it's running ok so this is
the simple way of solving this problem
now for the first time when eclipse
starts it will ask you or for choosing
your default workspace the workspace is
nothing but the location where all your
project will be saved
ok and it will give you the default
option also so just choose the default
option from here and click OK now you
will be able to see this kind of
perspective in Eclipse so this is for
the first time when you open your
Eclipse IDE it'll look like this now
creating your project you just need to
go to here files and go to new and here
you will be able to see so many options
for creating projects right so let's
create a quick project in Eclipse for
developing HTML files so what you need
to do is you just need to go here new
and choose static web projects so just
choose this static web project and
give the name to your project for
example my test project and you can
click Next to see what are the other
options this will be your content folder
name and then click finish and click yes
and once you click yes what you need to
do is you just need to go here at the
left hand side and just below your file
there will be a small button which says
restore you just need to click this
button here and then you will be able to
see your project here ok and here you
can see the welcome screen you can just
resize it or you can just close it from
here like this and then you can go to
your project and in here you will be
able to see this web content folder
right now it's empty so you can
right-click it and you can create a new
HTML file so just go to new and then
click HTML file option and give the name
to your HTML file for example test dot
HTML ok click Next and these are the
default options and then click finish
and it's going to create our HTML file
with some default content for you right
now in order to run this I will just
quickly run this but I will describe all
this code in the next video
line by line let's run it once now to
run this HTML file what you can do is
you can go to your project once again
and go to this web content folder and
here is your test dot HTML file so you
can right click on it and then you can
just click open open width and click
open with web browser ok and it's going
to open your HTML file in the web
browser which is in built in Eclipse ok
and if you change some something here so
this is my test file for example you
write something save it so you to save
it you just need to click this button
and then once again when you refresh
this web browser page you will be able
to see your message here right so right
click on it open with and in web browser
and you will be able to see your file in
web browser okay so this is the output
of your HTML file so in this way you can
install Eclipse IDE for developing your
static HTML pages in Eclipse IDE hello
guys welcome to the next video on HTML
tutorial for beginners using HTML 5 in
the last video I have shown you how you
can download and install Eclipse IDE and
notepad plus plus code editor in order
to write your HTML code now in this
video we will look at the basic
structure of HTML code in detail and we
will see what every term means in HTML
so we are going to create a new project
in Eclipse
which will be static project and I'm
going to name a project as my HTML or
you can name it anything click Next and
this will be the default folder in which
your HTML document can reside which is
web content and click finish
it's going to create you a project now
if you have already opened a project you
will see two project in your Eclipse
project Explorer now if you want to
close your previous project you just
need to select your previous project
right click on it and you can just close
it closing just means that this project
is closed and it will not be taken into
the consideration
Eclipse but if you want to delete it
from this project Explorer what you can
do is right-click it and just click
delete and it's not going to delete this
project from your computer unless you
check this checkbox it's going to delete
this project from your project Explorer
here right so now we have our project
here now in the web content we are going
to create a new html5 which we will name
it as for example test dot HTML and
click finish and it's going to create a
basic HTML page for us and Eclipse gives
us this default HTML code to us all so
now let's go in detail and let's see
what each term means in HTML so first of
all we will start with the comments now
in order to write some comment you just
need to give this angle bracket and then
this exclamation mark and then two -
symbols like this or - symbols and then
- - and this this angle bracket and
whatever you write in between it will be
taken as a comment now comment are not
the part of the code but they help us to
read the code in a better way so they
help us in code readability right now
what are these things so first of all
there are three terms you need to
understand in HTML first is called a tag
and a tag is just these two angle
brackets and you can see here every
element in HTML has this angle bracket
right so this and this now whatever you
write in this angle bracket is called
tag name
okay so this is a tag name and generally
we have starting tag and closing tags so
tag name and this is called starting tag
and this is called a closing tag and the
difference between starting tang and
closing tag is this forward slash so
whenever you add this forward slash in a
tag it's a ending tag otherwise it's a
starting tag and there is one more term
which we call element
so starting tag and ending tag and
whatever you write in between for
example some content inside the tag it's
called the element so element has
starting tag some content and a closing
tag right now there is one more term
which is called attribute now an
attribute is something which you can add
to the starting tag for example some ID
and then you give the description of
this attribute for example description
okay so this is called the attribute
okay so we have understood what is a tag
what is an element and what is an
attribute now let's get started with our
code okay so in here first line you can
see here is called a doc type and in
detail it's called a document type and
this helps the browsers to recognize
that it's a HTML page right so this is
just like a preamble for an HTML page so
first of all you need to add this
doctype in every HTML page as a first
line of every HTML file
okay now I'm going to delete everything
and let's write it everything once again
so first thing is the document type and
document type start with this symbol and
then just write doctype and then write
HTML okay HTML is a non case sensitive
language so it doesn't matter if you
write this word in capital or mixed
letters or small letters it will
interpret as same right so you can write
it like this or you can light it like
HTML it will be the same right now every
HTML code start with these HTML tags
okay and this tells the browser when it
interprets it that this is the starting
of your HTML code and this is the ending
of your HTML code and in between
whatever you write will be the content
of your HTML now in the HTML document we
have two main tags or main categories
one is called a head and other is called
the body so a head is something like
this and in the head you can add the
title of your HTML page and some
metadata which you don't want to show
but it's a part of your HTML page right
now just below this head comes the body
tag right and in this body whatever you
will write it will be the content of
your web page so it will be shown for
example you want to add a paragraph
heading or tables it will be enclosed in
the body now the main tag or main
element inside the head you can write is
a title for your HTML document so just
write title and whatever you write here
will become the tight
so you can see my title okay and you can
save this and you can just run your HTML
page by right-clicking on it and you can
just open with the web browser okay and
you can see right now you don't see
anything but here on the top you can see
my title and this my title is due to
this text okay or you can just change it
my HTML save it and when you refresh it
from here it becomes my HTML here right
so this will become the title of your
HTML web page now you can open this HTML
page from your web browser also which is
not the native Eclipse but for example
Firefox or Chrome browser you want to
open your HTML what you can do is you
can just go to the location where your
project is and most probably it will be
in your computer name then workspace
then your project name in my case my
project name is my HTML then go to web
content folder and here I can see this
test dot HTML you can just right click
on it and then open with Firefox okay
and it's going to open it like this and
you can see the title is my HTML right
now inside the body whatever you write
it will become the body or it will be
shown here right so for example there is
a tag called paragraph and you can add
it like this and inside this whatever
you write it will be considered as a
paragraph so for example save it and
refresh your webpage and then you will
see this paragraph in the body of your
web browser right now there is one more
popular tag which you can use here is
the heading tag and there are
different type of headings but for now
let's add h1 tag here and you can say
heading ok
and refresh your web page and it will
become your heading right now there are
two more main thing which can be used in
an HTML document one is the language you
want to use in the HTML document and
this is an attribute you can add to your
HTML tag so for example you can add this
tag in the starting of your HTML tag and
this attribute is called Lang okay and
then you can add different languages to
your HTML tag attribute for example most
commonly used is English but there are
many languages which are supported here
and this you can see when you google for
list of iso 639 - 1 codes and here you
can see each and every code of every
language which you can use here now
second important thing here is metadata
tag called meta ok and here you can add
an attribute called care set and most
generally we use utf-8 but you can use
other type of characters at encoding
also but this is the most widely used
character set in HTML okay now you will
notice here that this meta tag only have
starting tag it doesn't have ending tag
so it's not necessary to have in all
cases the ending tag some tags are okay
with the starting tag also and with an
attribute also so what we have learnt
today what are tags what are alum
what are attributes and basic structure
of HTML documents hello guys welcome to
the next video on HTML tutorial for
beginners using html5 in this video we
will see how to use meta tags in HTML
now first of all what is meta data a
metadata is something which shows you
the information about your real data
right so a meta data will not be
displayed on the page but will be
machine possible so for example some
search engine wants to pass your webpage
they will look at your meta data and
pass your webpage and even index your
webpage on their search result on the
basis of metadata there are variety of
parameters on which this search result
depends and metadata is one of them okay
now what can be a metadata a metadata
can be a description or a keyword or you
can add the author of this document or
you can add when this document was
modified or other metadata which I am
going to show you now how you add this
metadata so generally you add this
metadata using meta tag inside your head
so go inside your head and just write
meta and we have two or three attributes
for our meta tag one is name and name is
the name of the attribute we are going
to add the second one is the content and
content will be the value of the
attribute which is related to this name
okay so for example we want to add the
description we just add description
attribute name now for example I want to
make this page four
HTML tutorials so this description can
be HTML tutorials for beginners or some
other description related to the HTML
tutorials right and in the same way you
can add one more meta tag and this can
be the keywords so here you can add
keywords and these keyword are preferred
to be related with your web page content
so this is for HTML tutorial for example
so I can add keyword like HTML html5
tutorials CSS or HTML acts or Java
Script for example so these can be some
example keywords you can add to this
page right now the maximum length is not
limited for the description or the
keyword but the preferred length for
description is about 160 characters
because after this Google search or
other search engines cuts your
description and pass only up to 160
characters of description in the same
way for keywords you can add around 200
characters of keywords you can add any
number of keyword but you know it's
preferred to have 200 characters right
now in the same way you can add one more
meta tag which is the author of your
content for example now there is one
more kind of meta tag which is called
robot so just write robot and what is it
related to the robots meta tag provides
directive for search engine crawlers and
you can have archived no archive as a
content or follow or nofollow as a
content or image or no image index as a
content or index or no index so if you
use archive or no archive it indicates
that whether or not the page should be
archived by the search engine or not in
case of fall
or nofollow this indicates whether or
not the robot should continue to crawl
over pages referenced in the hyperlinks
on the page in a similar way image index
and no image index works and it
indicates whether or not the page should
appear on the referral for images for
your search engine for your webpage
write and index and no index indicates
whether or not page should be included
in the search engine index or not
okay so generally we use index and
follow as our robot meta tags now there
is one more meta tag which is called
HTTP equivalent and here if you write
refresh and if you set any content for
example one second and you save your
code and refresh your webpage then it'll
load after every second okay so it will
refresh after every second you can see
here it's refreshing okay and here you
can give one second or two second or 10
seconds or 30 seconds so whatever number
you give here it will be refreshed after
these many number of seconds okay so
these are some of the most used meta
tags which you can use in your HTML web
page hello guys welcome to the next
video on HTML tutorial for beginners
using html5 in this video we will learn
about paragraphs headings pre formatted
text and HTML text formatting tags in
HTML so let's get started we have
already learned how to use paragraph tag
in HTML in our previous videos like this
right and when you want to add the
multiple paragraph you just need to add
them like this and when you save your
code and refresh your page to look like
this now each paragraph element is
separated by other element by the line
break off too right now for example you
want to break this paragraph in two
lines what you can do is you can add
this tag called BR and it will break
your line into two so save your code and
refresh it and it breaks this paragraph
in two lines but you can see there is no
line space in between these two lines
but this paragraph and this paragraph is
separated by one line space here right
so in this way you can add multiple
paragraphs and breaks in HTML now let's
talk about heading tags in HTML so there
are basically six type of headings you
can use in HTML and which are like this
so the biggest heading you can use is h1
and the smallest heading you can use is
h6
so h1 is the biggest font size and h6 is
the smallest font size and when you go
to H 2 s 3 as 4 and at 5 it will
decrease your font size when this
heading tag number increases so save
your code and refresh your web page and
you can see the heading 1 or h1 tag
creates the biggest heading and that 6
tag creates the smallest heading now
let's talk about pre formatted text tag
so you can use a tag like this for pre
formatted
tags this means the spaces and your line
breaks are preserved whenever you add
some text in between these pre tags so
for example you want to display some
code something like this I have this C
hello world code and I want to preserve
these spaces between the code and the
line breaks so I can do something like
this so I can save it and I can refresh
my web page and it'll look like
this it'll look like a code but if you
use a paragraph tag here see what
happens it will not preserves your line
breaks or spaces and it will show you in
the straight lines so if you want to
preserve the line breaks and the spaces
you can use free tags something like
this okay now let's talk about HTML text
formatting tags or elements so basically
there are 10 text formatting elements in
HTML which are bold tag emphasized tag
italic tag small strong sub sub for sub
scripted tags and su P for a super
scripted tag I ns4 inserted tag de L for
deleted text and mark for mark text now
let's see how we can use them and how
they look like when you use them so I
will delete this and I will add all
these tags so you can use these tags for
example bold tag or emphasized tag
inside your headings or your paragraph
tags or any other tags like lists and
tables which we will learn in the later
videos right so for example you want to
show a paragraph with bold text then you
can use this bold tag something like
this so just add this bold tag here and
bold ending tag here and it will be bold
okay so similarly you can use eeehm tag
or emphasized tag like this to emphasize
your text for italic you can use I for
strong you can use strong itself for
small text you can use small tags
something like this for deleted text you
can use de el and deleted means it will
give you a cross or it will give you a
line on you
text right you can use a ns4 inserted
text you can use sub for super scripted
text marks for marked text and sub-4
superscripted text now let's see how
they look like when we see em on the
wave webpage so refresh the page and
this is our bold text emphasized text
italic text this is our strong text and
this is our small text this is our
deleted text which you know gives you
this line on your text this is our
inserted text which will give you this
line on the bottom of the text this is
the super scripted tag something like
little bit below the normal text this is
our marked text and it will give you
this yellow mark on your text and this
is our super scripted text which is a
little bit above from our normal text so
in this way you can use paragraphs
breaks headings and text formatting
elements in HTML hello guys welcome to
the next video on HTML tutorial for
beginners using html5 now in this video
we will learn about quotations and
citations elements and additionally we
will also learn how to use computer code
elements in HTML so let's get started so
here are some of the tags which you can
use as quotations and citation elements
and first tag which you can use is
abbreviation or abbr
and this abbreviation element represents
an abbreviation or optionally provides a
full description of your text
okay now second type of element which
you can use is this address and as the
name suggests you can use it for
describing some address of some old
location third type of element which you
can use here is BDO
or bi-directional override element and
using this element you
decide the direction of your text from
left to right or right to left right the
fourth type of element which you can use
here is the is the block quote element
and this type of element you can use to
quote a section of your paragraph which
is taken from some other source okay the
next type of element which you can use
here is site element or citation element
and this element you can use to
represent a reference to a creative work
for example you want to you know show
some ISO or code or something like this
which has something to do with creative
rights then you can use citation element
and the last element which you can use
is this quotation element which helps
you to show a quotation on a line of
text okay so let's see how we can use
them in real life HTML code so in here
you can see I have a paragraph and I use
here quotation element here so inside
the paragraph you can use this quotation
element and this will provide the double
quotes around this text which is inside
your quotation element right the next
type was the block code and if you want
to quote some text which you have taken
from some website or some other source
you can do it inside this block quote
element right for example you take this
content from the web site then you can
use the site attribute and then you can
provide the link where you have taken
this code from okay so this is block
quote now the next type is abbreviation
right now for example you want to show
the user that this is an HTML text but
when
here hover so was your HTML text you
want to show some description of it or
you want to show the full form of HTML
which is hypertext markup language then
this abbreviation element will help you
for this now the next type is the
address element and as you can see you
can show the address of some place
inside this address element the next
type is the citation element now you can
see here I have a prank paragraph here
more information can be found in ISO 0-0
or whatever ISO number it is right so
this is some creative content which I
can use inside my web page but I can
provide the citation so the reader will
know that it is cited from somewhere
right now the last type of element which
you can use as BDO
right so normally when you write a
paragraph you will include in this
paragraph tag and it will be shown from
left to right now in some cases there
are some languages which you know start
from left to right then you can use this
video element inside a paragraph element
and you can provide the direction by
this attribute called di r is equal to r
TL RT L stands for
right-to-left so then your text will be
shown from right to left so for example
T will come at the extreme left then H
then I then s from the left right so
let's save our code and let's see how
they look on the webpage so I will
refresh this webpage and you can see
first was the quotation element and you
see double quotes here this paragraph is
enclosed by the double quotes second was
the block quote and this is was the text
which we wanted to show inside the block
code so it gives you this quotation now
next was the abbreviation element and
when you hover over this HTML you can
see that the
description of HTML which we have
provided right so it will show you the
full form or whatever description you
want to provide for this text now next
was the address element and this will
look like this the next was the citation
element and we have included this text
inside the citation element and it will
look like this the next was the video
element or bi-directional override and
you can see this text starts from left T
starts here then H then I then s so it's
from left to right okay so these are
some of the citation elements and the
quotation elements you can use in HTML
now let's see what are the computer code
element which we can use in HTML so the
first element which you can use for this
purpose is the code element itself and
this element you can use to include some
programming language code right now
second element which we can use is KBD
element or keyboard input element which
we can use to show the keyboard inputs
right the third element which you can
use is the sample element and this
element intended to identify the sample
output from the computer program okay
the next element is the variable element
and this you can use to represent a
mathematical variable okay and the last
element we have already seen is the pre
element and it preserves your line
endings and spaces inside your text okay
now let's see how we can use them so I
will delete all this code from here now
first of all the code element you can
use like this so you have the code
element and then you can include your
code inside this code element now
remember that this code element will not
preserve your spaces or line endings
okay so
or that you need to include this code
element inside a pre element in order to
preserve the line endings and text and
that we will see later the next is the
KBD element so for example you want to
show some keyboard input you can include
this inside this KBD element for example
you I want to show that I want to press
ctrl s then I will include this ctrl + s
inside this KBD element and then it'll
look like a computer input okay next is
the variable element and you can include
a variable name for example X is equal
to y plus 2 for example you can include
every letter inside this variable
element and it will look like a variable
the last is the sample element and we
will see how it looks like it will look
like a computer output when it's
included in this si MP element save this
and refresh your webpage and now we can
see this here so first was the computer
code element and you can see here it's
not preserving your spaces or line
endings right so first of all we need to
include this code inside a pre element
right so just include this inside a pre
element like this and then save your
code and refresh your page and now it
will look like this okay now the next
was this KBD element and it'll look like
a computer input like this the next was
the variable element and this these
variables will look like this and the
last was the SI MP element or sample
element and the output of this will look
like a computer output okay so in this
way you can use quotation elements and
computer code elements in HTML hello
guys welcome to the next video on HTML
tutorial for beginners using html5 in
this video we will see how to use links
in HTML so you may have seen links on
almost every web page whenever you visit
some web site so for example you want to
navigate from one page to another you
click some link and it will redirect you
to the other page so how to add this
link the basic tag which we use for this
link is this a tag okay or it's called a
link tag and to add a URL or your file
name what you need is you need to have a
reference called H ref and it's
attribute we want to add and in these
double quotes you give a URL name or a
file name okay and in here you can
provide the description of the link
right so for example I want to give some
website path here for example this is my
website part HTTP colon and then the
website part you want to you know
redirect this page to right and here you
can give the description to your link
for example easy online converter okay
save your code and when you refresh your
page you will see this link easy online
converter this is the description but
behind this when you click this link it
will redirect you to the website which
we have written in the edge ref ok so
like this you can replace this by
google.com or any other website and in
here you can give the description now
you can also add some file name here so
for example I will create a new HTML
file inside my web content folder so
html5 and this I
name it as file - for example dot HTML
and I will finish it and this creates my
second file and I will just add some
description area file - for example ok
and I save it and this is name of the my
file file - right
so when I want to add here the file name
I can just directly write file - dot
HTML right same name as your file name
ok and here you can write Open File -
and save it and refresh your web page
and say is open file - and when you
click it it's going to open your file -
like this ok so you can see file - dot
HTML is open okay now if this file is
present in some folder for example I
will create a folder inside my web
content folder so create a folder and I
can name it as dir and it's going to
create a dir folder and I'm going to
drag and drop my file to a dot HTML in
my dir folder and it's going to transfer
it inside my dir folder so now I can
give the path dir forward slash file -
ok save it and refresh your web page and
once again open the link and it's going
to open the same file right so if you
have some directory structure you can do
it something like this ok now for
example when you click this link it's
going to open your any link or website
in the same tab in which you are working
on and for example you want to open it
in some other tab for example here you
want to you know let this website be
opened but when you click this link you
want to open your website in the other
tab how can you do it you can do it with
tribute called target and as a target
you give a value underscore blank okay
save it and refresh your page and when
you click this it's going to open your
file to dot HTML in second tab right so
you can give a target like blank or by
default it's self so this is the default
target and you can also give a target
like top which opens the linked document
in the full body of the window okay now
you can also use a link as a bookmark so
how you can use it for example you have
a web page which has many topics topic
one two three four and for example
hundred topics on a single page and you
want to jump from one topic to another
topic for example from topic one to
topic six directly when you click a link
so how you can do it you can add a
paragraph first and inside the paragraph
you can add this link tag and as an
attribute here at schref you can give
something like hash and the ID which you
want to give it so for example T five
okay and then the description for
example jump to topic five okay and same
ID you just need to give in the heading
here for example ID is equal to t five
so t five something like this so this is
the reference and this is the ID so
whenever you click this link it's going
to see where this T five is and it's
going to search this ID and it's going
to jump to this topic here ok so let's
save it and refresh our page once again
and here we have talked
pick one two three and five is not even
visible from here right so when I click
jump to topic five is going to jump to
topic five here okay so you can use
links as a bookmark also hello guys
welcome to the next video on HTML
tutorial for beginners using html5 in
this video we will learn how to use a
CSS or cascading style sheets in HTML
now CSS is whole different topic and it
requires you know many videos to learn
CSS but I'm going to give you a brief
introduction how you can use CSS in HTML
so there are three ways in which you can
use CSS in HTML one is internal second
is inline and third is external so first
of all let's see how we can use inline
CSS with our HTML element so for example
I have this h1 tag and I have some text
inside this h1 tag and I want to change
the appearance of this text so right now
it looks like this right so for example
I want to change the color of this text
so what I can do is I can add a style
attribute here and as a style I can add
a color and color can be for example red
ok I will save it and I will refresh my
webpage and now it looks like red right
you can change it to some other color
and save your code and refresh your page
and changes to that color so this is how
you can add inline styling to your
element now let's see how to add
internal styling to our HTML tags so go
inside your had
element and inside the head element you
just need to add style element here and
in here in the inside style element
right now we don't need this text
attribute so just inside your style
element what you can do is you can
choose the name of your elements for
example I want to change the font size
of this h1 element right so I will just
write h1 and then inside the brackets
these curly brackets I can provide the
attribute for example I want to change
the font size
I can choose font size and then I can
choose my size for example 100 px which
stands for hundred pixels okay I save it
and I will refresh my page and now the
font size is changed 200px right now for
example I want to transfer this property
to this internal style so how what I can
do is I can just choose this color colon
and then just below this I can add this
property and at the last I and need to
add this semicolon here and now I can
remove this style from here and save it
and it will be same style right so we
can use these Styles like this now for
example I want to change the background
of my body so I can take the body
element from here something like body
and inside these curly braces I can
change the background color for example
background color and I can choose any
color here for example yellow okay
and save it and refresh your page and
the background becomes yellow here okay
now let's see how we can add our
external CSS file in our HTML
so first of all we need to create a CSS
file so I will go to my web content
folder and I will create a new and I
will choose a new file here and this
time I want to create a style dot CSS
file source just write style dot CSS and
CSS stands for cascading style sheet ax
as I already told you and just save the
CSS file here and in here you can just
transfer your style which you have
provided here like this just copy this
and I will delete this style element
from here and inside your CSS file you
just need to give these Styles like this
so for h1 tag same as you have given as
an internal style you can give it here
right now to add the CSS file in our
HTML file what we need to do is we need
to add our link tag here so add a link
tag and as an attribute here we add
attribute called arielle and whose value
should be equal to stylesheet right and
the second attribute we want to give
here is H ref as we give in our link and
then is equal to give the part of your
CSS file so it's in the same directory
as in my HTML file so I can directly
write style dot CSS okay now this will
add the CSS file in your HTML file and
then once you refresh your page it will
look like the same okay and when you
remove some property for example this
background color and save it and refresh
your page will remove your property
right so these are the three ways you
can add a CSS file in your HTML file now
there are two more important things in
CSS you need to know one is called a ID
attribute
and another is called a class attribute
okay so I'm going to remove all the
styling code from my styling sheet and
once again I will go to my HTML file and
for example first of all we will learn
how to use ID attribute with CSS okay so
for example I add our attribute called
ID here and I can define my own ID for
example my ID and then I can go to my
style dot CSS file here and then here
first of all I will give the name of the
element in which I want to add this
style so h1 is the name of the element
so just write h1 and then write a hash
and then write the name of the ID so ID
name is my ID right so write the name of
the ID and then add these curly braces
here and then you can provide your
property which you want to change for
example color and I want to change it to
red color right like this and save your
code and refresh your page and becomes
red okay so this is how you can use ID
attribute with CSS now there is one more
attribute called class so for example I
have delete this attribute ID from my h1
tag and I add a attribute called class
here and I can define my own class so
for example my class and once again I
will go to my style the CSS file and
instead of using this what I can do is I
can write something like this so first
of all I can take the name of my element
which I want to use so for example h1
because this class is in the h1 tag
right and then dot my class name which
is my class right and then these curly
braces and inside the curly braces once
again
the for example color attribute I want
to change and this time I want to change
it to blue right so I will save my code
and refresh my webpage and it becomes
blue so in this way you can use class
attribute in CSS and HTML okay so that's
it for CSS I hope you understood the
basic concept how to use CSS in HTML
hello guys welcome to the next video on
HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
in this video we will see how we can add
an image to our HTML page using IMG and
what are the various ways we can use IMG
element in HTML so let's get started to
add an image to your web page you need
an element called IMG and this mainly
has two attribute one is alt and other
is source so alt is just like a
description for your image for example
my sweet image and source is the
location where your image is located so
for the location let's create our folder
inside of a web content folder so I'm
going to create a folder and I'm going
to name it as IMG and inside this IMG
folder what I'm going to do is I have
this image for HTML logo I'm going to
drag and drop into this image fold right
and just say copy file and click OK and
it's going to place my image inside this
image folder now to give the source path
here I will just write IMG / my image
name so HTML dot PNG right so the name
of my PNG file right so I will save my
code and refresh the webpage and I can
see this HTML logo here on my
Paige right now there is one more
attribute which we can use here is the
size attribute right so you can give the
width and height to your image something
like this so there are two ways of
giving width and height or to your image
one is you just need to give width
attribute and give the number of pixel
you want for example 600 pixel as a
width and same for height for example
600 pixel for height okay save it and
refresh the page and it will look like
this okay
the second way of giving the width and
height is using style attributes so just
add a style attribute and then just add
width here and as a width you just need
to add 600 px and then semicolon
and then the height and once again give
600px okay and it will result in the
same way right so when you refresh the
page it will be same because it was
early a 600 pixel for example I do it
something like 400 by 400 and save the
page refresh it as going to become 400
by 400 pixel image okay now you not only
can use the local images you can also
use the images which are on some server
for example you have some image on some
website and you have the URL of the
image you can directly add as a source
of your image in here so for example I
will just give the source of the image
which I have on my website and I will
save it and I will refresh it and it's
going to show this image which is on the
website
now let's see how we can add image with
a link okay so to add our image with a
link what you can need
do is you need to add a normal link tag
and inside this link tag you just need
to place your image something like this
okay so your image tag and as reference
so h re f you can give the location of
the file which you want to you know
redirect to so for example I want to
redirect to this file to dot HTML inside
my directory folder I can just locate
something like this dir and then the
file name file to dot HTML and save it
and refresh your web page and once you
click this image you will go to the page
which you are linked to so the HTML page
which you are you know targeting it will
go there okay now let's see how we can
add a background image to our HTML page
so I'm going to remove all this and to
add a background image there are two
ways one is just give in your body give
an attribute called back ground and give
the location of the image which you want
to set as background for example I want
to set this image itself as a background
so I just write I am G slash HTML dot
PNG and save it and refresh your web
page and it's going to set this image as
a background and if this image is of
smaller size then your you know web page
size then it's going to repeat okay so
it's going to repeat something like this
to cover your web page okay the second
way of adding this background image is
using a style element so just add a
style element and inside your style
element you just need to write body
and inside these curly braces you can
add attribute called background image
and as a value you just need to give you
our L and then inside the bracket you
just need to give the location of your
image so just copy the image from here
and paste it here and I'm going to
remove this attribute from here and save
it and refresh your web page
and it will be the same okay now suppose
if you don't want to repeat this image
you just want to show it once what you
can do you can just add our tribute
called background repeat' and as a value
you can give no-repeat okay and save
your web page and refresh it it's going
to look like this so it's not going to
repeat okay now suppose you want to use
your image with a paragraph so for
example I'm going to add a paragraph tag
here and I'm going to add some random
paragraph here and I will save it and
refresh it and my paragraph looks like
this so my image and below this my
paragraph but for example I want to use
this image beside a paragraph what I can
do is I will just copy this image
element and inside my paragraph tags I
can add this image element inside the
paragraph element right so just inside
the paragraph element I will add it now
when I save it and refresh it the
paragraph will still remain on the
bottom and not on the side of the image
now to solve this problem what we can do
is go to your image element and in here
with the style you just need to add one
more attribute called float and with
float
you can add float right or
float:left okay so for example for float
right and save your code and refresh the
page and now your image is on the right
and your paragraph is on the left okay
now if you do just opposite of this
for example float left and save it and
refresh your webpage now your image is
on the left hand side and your paragraph
is on the right hand side okay
so in this way you can use image element
in HTML hello guys welcome to the next
video on HTML tutorial for beginners
using html5 in this video we will see
how to use lists in HTML so there are
two types of Lists you can use in HTML
first is unordered list which is
something like this which has no order
and second is ordered lists which has
some kind of ordering it may be numbered
ordering or it may be alphabetical
ordering or it may be any other kind of
ordering so let's see how we can use
these type of lists in HTML so first of
all we will see how we can create
unordered lists okay so to make an
unordered list you need the tag called
ul which stands for unordered list and
inside this tag you need to have list
items so just give Li and it will add a
list item and inside this list item you
can add your name of your list or
description of the list okay so I will
add two more items like this and then
for example I want to have a list of
names ok so then what I can do I can
just give the name
for example
something like this okay I will save my
code and refresh my web page it will
look like this so this is an unordered
list
okay now unordered list also can be of
different types
so you can add attribute called
style here and then inside the style
attribute value you can add this line so
just add a list - style - type and by
default the type is disc or description
which is like this by default when you
save it it'll look like this so it's the
default type right but when you change
this disc for example - circle like this
and save it and refresh your page then
you can see you have small bullets in
front of your list items right or you
can have a square here so Square and
save it and refresh your web page and
your bullet becomes squared okay or you
can have one more option here which is
none okay and when you give this option
and when you refresh your web page there
is no bullet in front of your list items
right so for unordered list you have
these items now to create an ordered
list first of all I will remove this
style attribute from here and to create
an ordered list instead of ul you just
need to replace it with Oh L which
stands for ordered list okay and the
default G type is numbered type so it
will look something like this so one two
three four right but this can also
change so when you add a attribute
called type here and for example by
default it's numbered so you can write
one here and it becomes numbered list so
it's like the same okay and when you
replace
number one by capital a let's see what
happens so I will save it and refresh my
web web page and now you can see my list
is ordered by capital letters okay
for example we want to order our list
with small letter you just need to
replace this capital a by small a and
refresh your web page and it will look
like this okay or for example you need a
Roman numbered ordered list then you
just need to write capital I and save it
and refresh your web page and it becomes
Roman letter in capital Roman letter you
can say right and same you want in small
Roman letters then you just need to
write I here and save it and refresh
your web page and your list becomes
small Roman letter ordered list okay now
you can also create a nested list so to
create a nested list for example my list
is ordered list right now and for
example I want to list out for each name
some favorites for example right so I
can go just below my list item where I
want to create a list once again and for
example I want this time unordered list
so I can just write unordered list like
this and in here once again I can add
list items right for example John likes
T and John likes coffee and save it and
refresh it and you see it becomes list
inside a list so nested list okay so you
can also have nested lists like this now
you also have one more type of list
which is called description list okay
and as the name suggests it starts with
DL so just write DL and becomes
description
list and inside this description list
you can have description terms so DT
which sent for description terms and
here you can have some terms so for
example term right and then you have a
tag called DD which is called
description detail and here you can add
the detail of this term right so
description of the term something like
this okay
and you can add multiple terms and
descriptions and save it and refresh
your web page and your term and
description of the term looks like this
okay so in this way you can use lists in
HTML ah hello guys welcome to the next
video on HTML tutorial for beginners
using html5 in this video we will see
how to use tables in HTML so let's get
started
first of all to add a table you need a
tag called table to add it and inside
the table you have some more elements so
for every table we have rows so we need
to add our table row element first so
just add TR which stands for table row
okay and inside the table comes our
columns right so four columns use a tag
called TD which stands for table data
okay
and here you can provide your content
for example we are making some table for
name surname and the marks scored by a
student for example something like this
so the first column here is the name and
the second column we are going to add is
the surname and the third column we are
going to add here is the maths code by
him so for example 90 marks right so TD
you can think of it as a column TR is
the table row and table is the parent of
all right so you can add in the same way
multiple table rows inside your table
something like this one row below
another right so right now we have a
table with two rows with three column
each right so we are going to save our
and refresh our page and it looks like
this now you will see here there is no
border in the table so to add a border
you need to add a attribute to your
table which is called border itself and
you can provide here one then it will
have the border so save it and refresh
your web page and it's going to give you
this kind of a border now if you want to
stretch your table to the width of your
browser web page what you can do here is
add an attribute called style and add an
attribute called width here so width is
equal to hundred percent okay so just
add 100 percent here save your web page
and refresh it and it will stretch 200
percent okay
now if you want to add heading to your
table what you need to do you can just
add one more row something like this and
instead of using TD which stands for
table data you can use th which stands
for table head okay
so th th th for column and here also
th th and th and here you can give some
heading for example name surname and
marks okay and save it and refresh our
page and we'll give you the heading to
your table okay there is one more
element which you can add to the table
which is called caption so just add a
element called caption and inside the
caption you can give the caption to your
table for example my name table okay
save it and refresh our page it's going
to give you a caption for your table
okay now to add more styles to your
table what you can do here is
in your head you can add a style element
inside the style element you can add the
style for a table for example so table
and include table head and table detail
here so th comma T D okay and for
example I want to remove the border from
here and I want to add it in the style
attribute here what I can do here is I
can add a border like this okay so the
width of the border is 1px and solid and
it's black okay save it and refresh your
page and you have the same border now
you can see here the border is of two
lines right now if you if you want one
line here you can collapse your border
so you can add an attribute here border
- collapse and then add collapse here
okay and save it and refresh your web
page it's going to collapse this border
like this okay now one more property you
can add here is the alignment for your
text so you can add text - a line and
you can align it to the left for example
so left and save your web page and
refresh it and it will align your text
to the left you can do the same for the
right so just add right here save it and
refresh it and it's going to align your
text to the right right so I will use
the left one for now now there are three
more special elements you can add to
your table element which our table had
table body and table foot okay and these
will give you the ability to have extra
styles to your tables
okay so for example for the table had
you can add attribute like T head okay
and just close it at the end of your row
or for your header right so end it here
and same you can have the body so just
add T body and it'll add a body for your
table and end it at the end of your body
content it can have any number of rows
right for the footer you can add an
attribute called T foot and end it here
and this is one not going to change
anything in your tables so when I save
it and when i refresh it it's not going
to change anything in the table but now
it's really easy to use them to change
the style for example I want to change
the style of table head I can just use
th for table head and then change the
background color for example background
color is equal to red okay and same I
can change the style for table body and
table foot so T body and color is blue
and T foot and the color I choose is
yellow okay and save your web page and
refresh it and your row color has been
changed okay now there is one more
property called column span so that you
can have one column in two column spans
okay so I will give you an example for
example I want to headings and not the
three headings so what I can do is I can
remove this middle heading from here and
I can add an
tribute called column span and I can
give the span of two so that it will
cover two columns at the same time right
and save it and refresh your web page
and you can see now marks heading is
taking two column spans like this okay
so in this way you can use tables in
HTML hello guys welcome to the next
video on HTML tutorial for beginners
using html5 in this video we will learn
how to use div element and we are also
going to see how we can create a web
page design with this div element in
HTML so let's get started first of all
what is our div element our div element
is element which you can use to contain
other HTML elements so let's create a
div element and let's see how we can use
it so just add this dev element and
inside this div element you can use
other HTML elements like for example I
will use this h1 tag and I will say this
is our tutorial and in here you can add
a paragraph also so for example this is
a paragraph and here you can give the
details about the tutorial now if you
want to change the style of these two
element which is h1 and paragraph you
can add this style to this dev element
for example I want to change the
background color behind the this h1 and
paragraph tag then I can add this style
to it so style is equal to background
color which is yellow and save your page
and refresh your page it will give the
yellow background to your header and the
paragraph right so you can use dev
element to divide your section of your
web page okay so using this div element
let's create our web page so for example
this
my tutorial webpage so first develoment
i created here is the tutorial now
second element I'm going to add here is
the dev element for creating my
navigation bar which contains some
tutorial topics for example C++ Java or
C sharp now I will add a third there
element here which will be the details
for the tutorial so I have a div element
inside this div element I have a h2
header and the paragraph tag here okay
and for the fourth dev element I will
just use this copyright message which I
want to use it as a footer so I have for
dev elements here first was the header
div element second is the navigation
develoment third is the section and
fourth is the footer I will use it as a
footer right now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to give the ID to every
development so ID for this header let's
say it's header itself and ID for this
navigation is navigation and ID for this
section is let's say it's section itself
and ID for the footer develoment
is foot for example okay so I have given
the IDS to each and every develoment
here now I will go to the head here and
I will add here style element so style
and inside this style my element first
of all I will add the style for this
header okay so for this header what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use this
hash had a property of the styles of
which will reference to this header ID
and in here I have given the properties
for the background color
background color of this header will be
blue then the color will be white which
is the foreground color and then the
text alignment will be on the center so
it will be some somewhere in the center
it will be shown at the center okay and
the padding for this I have given six
pixel now for the navigation let's
create a property for the navigation
something like this so just add a hash
and then navigation and inside these
curly braces just add these properties
so the first property I have added here
is the line height so this will be the
height of the side bar and then I have
this background color which will be the
background color of this navigation bar
now the height of this navigation bar is
500 px which is vertical and the width
of this navigation bar is 100 px and
this is floating to the left so this is
important because we want to show our
navigation bar to the left something
like this right this area okay and I
have given it the padding of 5 pixel
here now let's add the style for our
section I knee so for this area let's
add the style so just add this style
there which is hash section and inside
the curly braces just add the width
which I have given is equal to 350 pixel
and this section is also floating to the
left and padding is equal to 10 pixel
here okay and for the footer let's give
the same width and height as our header
so just copy this thing from here and
paste it just below here and instead of
giving the ID of the header just give
here the ID of footer which is foot ok
now
we need to add one more property here
which is called clear:both and what this
does is it makes the element drop below
your floating elements so our navigation
and section is our floating element so
our footer will be below these floating
elements right save your code and
refresh it and now you can see a header
here and you have this section here and
you have this navigation bar and you
have this nice little photo okay so in
this way you can use dev element and you
can design your web page using div
elements and styles in HTML hello guys
welcome to the next video on HTML
tutorial for beginners using html5 in
this video we will learn about the new
element which was introduced in html5
which are section header footer and nab
so these are the four new element along
with the other elements which are
introduced in html5 and let's see how we
can use them so in the last video we
have seen how we can create this kind of
HTML layout page with header navigation
bar and the section and the footer and
for creating this layout we have used
this div element along with some ID and
the Styles like for header we have given
some style for navigation also we have
given some style here and we have
segregated or divided our code in for
section or four divisions which was
header navigation section and foot right
now in html5 these four elements are
introduced which are called head
nav section and footer which we can use
instead of this div element so your code
can be more clear so for example in the
last video I've defined this develoment
and I have defined this ID header right
now instead of using this div element
you can use a header element like this
and it will still be same right and for
navigation
instead of using navigation we will add
a element called nav and in here instead
of this development and ID call section
we can add element called a section and
end it with section and for the last we
have defined a footer dev element so
instead of using this develoment
we can use a element called photo and
and your footer in here so instead of
using these develoment with the IDs you
can use these new elements which was
introduced in HTML files which are
called header nav section and footer
okay and for the styling of these
elements what you can do here is instead
of using hash header you can directly
use the name of your element which is
header and the second element was the
nav which is this element and then third
element was the section element and the
fourth element was the footer right like
this so you can use these four element
and these styles with them which we have
seen in the last video I'm not going to
change these styles just change the
element name instead of the ID of the
element right
save your code and refresh it again and
it will be same and what these elements
are doing here
helping us to define our style in an
easy way for header/footer and nav and
section right instead of defining long
div and ID you can directly use them and
then your code readability also is
better when you use these elements okay
so in this way you can use these four
elements in html5 hello guys welcome to
the next video on html5 tutorial for
beginners in this video we will see how
we can add and use video element in HTML
so to add a video element in HTML you
need to use this element called video
and this video takes the source of the
video so just go between these video
element and add element called source
okay and then you can provide the source
of your video here so to add a source I
have this video which I have made in the
last video I'm going to just drag and
drop into my web content folder and it
will copy this into my web content
folder so just leave this option copy
files and click OK and it's going to add
this inside my web content folder same
I'm going to do with a picture which I
have so I have a PNG picture and I'm
going to drag and drop into my web
content folder this also this picture I
am going to use as a poster for the
video in the later section but first of
all let's see how we can add this source
to our video element so to add this
video to the source you just need to
write the name of your video which is
html5 dot mp4 and you can also add the
type of video you are adding so just add
an attribute called type and in here
just write video slash and before so
it's a mp4 video
okay now you can refresh your page and
now you can see this video but it will
not start automatically because we
haven't added any flag for starting
right so let's add a flag for
automatically restarting this video so
in your video element just add an
attribute called Auto play and save your
code and refresh it and now your video
will start playing okay
now you will still not see the controls
to stop or pause this video so to pause
or to have more control for volume and
maximizing and minimizing you can add an
attribute called controls here so just
add an attribute called controls and
save your code and refresh the webpage
and now you can see these controls here
so you have this play and pause button
you have this volume button you have
this fullscreen button here right so
this control attribute as the control to
your video right now there is one more
attribute which you can add here is Lu
and what this does is it will provide
the loop to your video so for example
your video is finished here and then it
will be replayed again and again until
and unless you stops it now there is one
more attribute here which is called
muted so when you add this attribute
called muted and save your code and
refresh it then your video will be muted
when it will be loaded so you can see
it's muted when it's loaded right now
suppose you want to give the size to
your video so right now it's in its
maximum size now you want to limit the
size of your video what you can do here
is you can add an attribute called width
and you can give the width in
pixal so you can give for example 500
and same you can do for hide so just add
this height attribute and you can give
the amount of pixel you want okay save
your code and refresh it and now your
video will be resized okay so let's say
it's 600 by 300 okay so save your code
and once again refresh it and it resizes
your video okay now for example you want
to give the banner or poster to your
video so this is your video but whenever
your web page loads you want to show
some poster on your video so how you can
add it you can add it something like
this so just add our attribute called
poster here and give the location of the
picture you want to add here so just add
this for example I have this html5 dot
PNG I can add it here so html5 dot P and
G and save your code and refresh it and
you will see the picture but because
it's an autoplay mode so let's remove
this autoplay mode and save your code
and refresh it once again now you can
see this picture and when you start it
your video will be started okay so in
this way you can use video element in
