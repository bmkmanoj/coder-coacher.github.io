video I'm going to show you how you can
link a chart control with your database
and show it into your visual basic
windows form so let's get started
first of all what you need to do is go
to your toolbox and search for the
control called chart control it will be
in let's see if there it is will be in
this data section here so just
drag-and-drop this chart control from
here and place it into your form and
this is r dot chart control okay you can
resize your chart control because it's a
little bit bigger okay so this is our
chart control right now in order to
connect the dot of Base to this chart
control what you can do is just select
your chart from here and go to the
properties of this chart and search for
the property called data source by
default this property is none so just
click this combo box here and just
select your employee data binding source
because we have already binded our
database with our with this project you
will be able to see your database name
plus binding socia otherwise if you
don't see it if here you need to go to
this add data add project data source
and once again you need to add the data
source right so from here you can add
the data source as I have shown you in
the first video of the series so just
select this employee data source data
binding source or whatever database name
you have plus the binding source and
just selected now this next step is to
go further down and search for the
property called CDs here ok
so search for the property called series
and this series in here you can add a
new X and y-axis to your chart so I will
search for the data source here just go
to data source and in here I can choose
x value member and by value member so
for example I want to show first name on
the x value member on the x-axis and I
want to show the pay of the employee on
the y-axis okay so I will select this
and when you go further down you will be
able to or here in the chart section
here you can select the type chart type
whatever you want to select it has bar
charts takes chart line chart pie chart
and yeah all kind of possible chart I
will leave it as default as column chart
for now and I will click OK and now when
I run the program I can see the name
versus age chart and I can verify this
name versus age chart also and because
our name is liam length is more or or
greater than this bar chart so it's
hiding some names for now so what we can
do is we can just go to our property
once again so just search for the
property called
chart area here and in the collection
just click the small button once again
and in here go to axis and click this
axis collection once again and click the
small button here and you will see
x-axis y-axis secondary x-axis and
secondary y-axis so our names are on
x-axis right so select X access and
then search for the property called
interval here so in the interval
property by default it's Auto interval
is auto so what you need to do is just
delete this Auto from here and make it 1
so it will make your interval 1 and
click OK and click OK and now when you
run the program you will see all the
names in front of your bars so Julie
Paul local or whatever names are there
yeah they will be shown in front of
these balls so you can now play these
with these properties in this series and
you can just choose the type which you
want to show and you can play with the
properties in this chart area and you
can just customize your chart with these
so I hope you have understood the basic
concept and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
