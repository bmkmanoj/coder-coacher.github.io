show you how you can download and
install selenium IDE with your Firefox
browser on your Windows operating system
now what is selenium first of all
selenium is a portable software testing
framework for web applications and it
provides our record playback tool for
authoring tests without learning our
test scripting language right it also
provides a test specific language which
is called Cellini's to write tests in a
number of popular programming language
including Java C sharp groovy Python
Perl PHP and other languages ok the
tests can then be run against modern
browser for example Firefox in our case
we are going to install it on Firefox
and it can be run on any operating
systems like Windows or Linux or
Macintosh right now
the good thing about this is it's open
source so you can you know use it for
free right now let's see how we can
install it so first of all open your
Firefox browser and search for selenium
IDE Firefox ok and search for it and you
can see here first a second link you
will see here will be from selenium IDE
add-on for Firefox just click this link
and in here you will see in the add-ons
or this add-on button so just click Add
to Firefox and it's going to install
selenium IDE just click install and then
it's going to tell you to restart your
browser so just restart your Firefox
browser now after restarting my browser
I can see this selenium button on my
Firefox toolbar here right so you can
click this selenium IDE button from here
and it's going to open this
kind of selenium IDE right now I'm going
to resize my firefox browser for now and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open some website for example this
sample website and now I'm going to you
know record my actions using selenium
IDE when I you know browse some paths or
when I browse this website right so
first of all you need to know something
here you can see this red button here
and you can see it's right now it's
saying now recording click to stop
recording right so to record our website
for example you just need to press this
red button by default it's already on so
you don't need to do it but to stop it
you need to press this button okay so
for example I have this website and I
click first of all this link here and
now you can say see here it says command
open and it's going to open index.html
which is this URL and then it says
command click and wait right
is going to show this link easy online
converter calm right now I'm going to go
to one you know link here so I'm going
to click case converter for example and
in here I can just write some text for
example some sample text and I will
convert it to for example uppercase
right and this all actions are recorded
here so I have browsed through this URL
which is case converter and then you can
see I clicked to upper button and it's
going to convert this text to upper
right now I'm going to click lower and
the next button which capitalizes case
or a sentence case or alternating case
right so now
for example I have recorded these
actions there is many more things which
you can do in selenium IDE I just wanted
to show you the sample right so after
recording everything what you can do is
you can just stop the recording so just
click this red button here and then you
can open a fresh tab here and then you
can run your you know test which you
have recorded and first of all you can
save it so just go to file and you can
say save test case
and now you can click this green button
to you know repeat your test right so
when I click this button it's going to
open this website and then it goes to
this link once again and it repeats all
the actions right now the speed of this
you know test was very fast you can see
here it's fast so we haven't seen much
happening right but it perform all thus
these steps so we make it small and once
again we open the new fresh tab here and
once again we are going to click this
button play entire suit and now it
slowly goes to the links which we have
browsed you see the text changing and it
performed all the tests here right so
after recording these tests you can also
save these tests in your preferable
language which I have already you know
told in the beginning of this video so
what you can do is you can go to files
here and then export your test case to
these languages so for example I want to
choose this Python unit test using web
browser I can just choose this and I can
save this and I have opened this Python
file in a notepad and you can see here
your test you know cases are listed here
so for example we were testing this
website and then we went to the index
dot sth tml and then we went to this URL
or you know we clicked this button or
this button or other test cases right so
in this way you can you know install
selenium IDE on your Firefox web browser
