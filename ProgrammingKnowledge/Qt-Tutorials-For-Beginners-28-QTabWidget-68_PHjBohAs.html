cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn how we can use Q tab
widget in QT so those of you who don't
know what is a tab you can just go to
tool in your QT creator IDE and then go
to options and then you will be able to
see these kind of tabs here general kit
QT version compiler and debugger and see
make so these are called Tom which you
can switch interchangeably right and the
main use of tabs are they if you have
really too much content to show in a
window you can you know segregate them
using tabs so for example general tab
general information kids have the
information related to kids whatever you
know building kits we have for example
mingw or ms vc or QT versions or a
compiler so these are this is the simple
use of tab so if you have more
information which you want to segregate
then you can use tabs now what I have
done is I have created a sample project
and I will go to main window dot UI and
first of all I will search for a cue tab
here so just search for cue tab or even
you can just search for tab and these
will be the result and we want to drag
and drop a tab widget here okay and I
will add one more button here so that we
will use it later so I will just add a
button also here so push button okay now
I will just give them a horizontal
layout and then I will just provide them
some layout so
that it can be resizable right now there
are some properties of tab which we can
see so just select your tab and go to
the properties and we'll show you some
of the interesting properties here so
here you will be able to see in queue
tab widget the tab position properties
so by default the position of tab is at
the top which is north right now you can
change the position to South and the
term will go down or you can change it
to west and it will go left and you can
change it to East and it will go right
right and by default it's not so it will
be at the top so you can change this tab
position also not tab shape so by
default they are rounded but there are
some option for example triangular so
you can see the shape of tabs are now
little bit triangular right so you can
do this now you have the icons so you
can give the icons from here so you have
the icon size you can increase the icon
size for example we want 32 by 32 and
press ENTER and then whenever you give
the icon or whenever you provide the
icon to your tab then it will be bigger
right now the next property is current
tab text so whatever tab is selected
here the text of it you can change so
for example this is for example my Home
tab or second tab is for example
something as for something else for
example C++ or third tab is something
else right and you can also provide the
tab name tomm name is like this object
name so you have a tab widget which is
the object name of the whole tab widget
right but the single
the tab has its own object name which is
this one current term name okay
now current tab icon you can provide
some icon from here right now I don't
have any icon but you can you know add
the resources and then you can choose
the icon from there right
you can also provide the tooltip to your
tab so whenever you run the application
then it will show some tooltip for
example this is home and whenever you
run your application and hover over your
home tab it will show you the tooltip so
I will hover over here and it shows me
this tooltip this is a home right so
this is for that now there are some more
interesting properties here for example
you can check this option which says
tabs closable so just click this option
and you can see the close button comes
on the tab right and you can write a
code on what these tabs close buttons
and then they will be closed right and
then there is a one more option which is
moveable tab so whenever you check this
then you can move your tabs like this
okay so there is this option also so now
let's add the code for removing the tabs
for example so you can just right click
here and then go to slot and from here
we will choose a special slot from here
which is tab close request
okay so just choose this slot which says
tab close request and click OK it's
going to create us this function and in
here you can just right I will just make
this a little bit bigger so we can see
and then here you can just write UI and
then call your tab
and then you can just say remove tab
okay and then you can just provide this
index here as an argument and then you
will be able to remove the tab so let's
run the code and let's see if it removes
the TAM or not so our code is compiling
and it's running hopefully and when I
click this button it closes right and
when I click this button it closes right
now for example if you want to add some
tabs by clicking some button so we want
to add sometimes dynamically so how we
can do it
so I will go to the main window and for
example when I press the button I want
to add in the tab so I will just change
the text to add tab and then I will give
a slot to its right click go to slot
clicked ok and when this button is
clicked I want to add a tab so I will
just say UI and then tab widget and then
you can just say add tab okay just call
add damn it has a few you know overloads
so we will use the second overload which
takes first first argument as a widget
and second is the text so just write new
cue widget so just write new - widget
and the second argument will be the text
for example my third tab is Java tab and
you can add something like multiple tabs
so for example if I want to add multiple
tabs then static text will not work but
first of all let's see if the tab is
added or not so I will run the code and
then let's see if the tab will be added
or not when we press the button so when
I click add tab it adds this java terms
here right but for example I want to add
multiple term then
at multiple Java tab the text to it
which we don't want so how we can solve
this problem so what we can do here is
we can add a cue string so just write Q
string and then we will just say tab and
that this will be in the code so just
provide quotes around it and give a
space and then we will provide our
argument to it so just write mod 0 for
the first argument right and then you
can just give the argument so for
example argh and then you can give the
argument for example the index of the
tab so we will count how many tabs we
have and then we will add one more tabs
to it so just write count so it will
give us the tab count and then we will
just add plus 1 to it okay so let's run
the code and let's see if it works or
not for us so I will just click Add tab
and add stamp 3 and when I say add tab
it adds tab for top 5 times 6 something
like this now you may ask an obvious
question here that okay we have a new
tab but where is the content how we can
add some content to the tab so normally
when we go to the main window dot UI
from here you can add the content to
your tab for example something like this
some buttons or some added text or some
other you know other widgets from your
labels or any other widgets something
like this right and in the other tab it
has its own window so you can add
different tabs here also something like
this ok so these are the tabs which are
already present so this is easy to do it
we can drag and drop a widget and you
know place it here and do something with
it but we are also adding some tabs
dynamically here so we will
here and we are adding some time
dynamically so how we can add this push
button and everything to this so the
simple idea is you can create a tab
window and add it to your tab so you can
right click on your project and then
click add new and we will just choose QT
and then just choose designer from class
from here and then click Choose and this
time we will add or choose this widget
template from here so just choose widget
template and click Next and leave it as
default and click Next or if you want to
change this you can change it but for
now I'm not going to change it right so
next and finish okay so this is going to
create one more reform for us which is
formed form dot UI right so we will go
here and then we can you know provide
some widgets here and do for some
functionality I am NOT going to add some
functionality here I will just add some
widgets here so I will add text view and
for example I want to add some labels
here and I want to add a push button for
example right and I will select all of
them and I will give them a horizontal
new layout and then I will just give a
horizontal layout to all the window like
this okay so for example this is my
widget and I want to show this widget in
the tab when I add one term for example
right so I will once again go to my main
window dot CPP file and I will add first
of all include this header for form dot
H right to use this class so I will just
include this and I will just say form
dot H which allows me to use this class
which is
form class right so I can just copy the
name of the class and instead of this
qwidget I can just say new form so this
is the class name which we have created
which is this one right and when we run
our code and hopefully it will work for
us so the code is running and when I
click add a tab
it adds the tab with this you know the
widget we have created so it has this
text label and pull button and this
textview
right and I will add one more tab and
you can see it adds one more term for
example when I press this add tab this
tab is not selected automatically you
see the SAP tab is created but I want to
select it automatically also right so
what I can do here is I can just go here
and I will just write UI and tab widget
and then I will say set current index
and the current index will be UI time
widget count so just use count and then
minus one right and then run the code
and let's see what happens when we
create a tab it should be selected so
you see it's automatically selected
current index right so like this okay so
in this way you can use cue tab widget
class and QT I hope you enjoyed this
