Java effects tutorial for beginners in
this video we will see how we can use
lambda expression to perform our button
action event handling instead of using
this anonymous class which has only one
attract method so in Java 8 there was a
term introduced which is called lambda
expression which is made for this
situation which says that if you have a
single abstract method inside a class
you can use lambda expression to
directly call it right so let's see how
we can use it so for example I want to
add one more button here and I want to
press this button and exit from our
application right so what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to copy this button
object and instead of button I will name
it as exit okay and the text which I
want to show here is exit itself okay
and in the last video I have shown you
there are different kind of layout you
can use in Java effects and in the last
video we have seen how to use this stack
pane now let's say in this video we are
going to use v box which is vertical box
so just use V box something like this
and we will create a new V box and then
using this exit object or exit button
object we can just use it to call set on
action methods so just call set on
action and inside this set on action
what we can do is using lambda
expression we can just use E and this
arrow member and then you can directly
call your single line codes for example
you want to print something you can just
paste it here okay and what this does is
call this method handle because it's a
single abstract method inside this
anonymous class and then it will perform
whatever you write here right so it's
like performing this code inside this
handle method okay
now for example instead of this I want
to exit from our application so what I
can do is I can just use system dot exit
and I will set the status as 0 here and
remove this semicolon and this is how
you can use this lambda expression okay
and you can see in a single line of code
we have performed exactly the same task
which this class was doing okay we're
just calling this abstract method right
now one thing remains is we just want to
add this exit to our scene right so just
go here where we have called route get
children dot add and instead of add we
can use a method called add all okay and
this method allows us to call multiple
widgets for example we have two buttons
we can use two arguments one is button
and other is exit object right so in the
form of arguments you can pass multiple
object of widgets right so just call a
doll and it will add button one and exit
button to your stage now I want to show
you one more thing
using this primary stage object you can
set the title of the stage also so just
call set title and give your title which
will be shown on the stage so for
example my title okay and save your code
and run it and now you can see your
title is here my title and we can see
two buttons one is click me and other is
exit right and when we click this exit
button is going to exit our application
right so it's basically doing the same
task but in a single line now you may
ask if I have a multiple lines of code
for example I want to print something
and then exit what will I do right
so for performing the multiple lines in
the lambda expression what we can do
here is you can give these two curly
braces and inside these two curly braces
you can call your code okay
so just something like this and before
exiting for example you want to print
something you can print it so we can say
exit this app okay and save your code
and run it and when I click this exit
button it's going to print this and then
exit your code okay so if you have
multiple line use curly braces with
lambda expressions so I hope you have
