MongoDB database tutorial for beginners
in this video we will learn how we can
insert a document inside a database so
let's get started first of all we are
going to create a database and for
example we have a database called school
so let's create a database called school
and just execute this command and we are
switched to this school database now for
example the school has a number of
students and students can be collections
here right so we are going to create a
collection or like student and then we
are going to insert some document in
that ok so just give DB dot students
which is the name of our collections
write dot insert and then you just need
to give something like these round
brackets and inside these wrong brackets
MongoDB takes its data in the form of a
jason okay so if you don't know what is
jason you may probably want to learn
about it but i can just give you a brief
introduction that jason is a format in
which you can you know save the data and
it makes easier to pass your data and
you know save your data in the JSON
format now a jason can look something
like this so for example we are creating
the database for school which contains
students as a collection and the
document can be here this kind of a
jason element right so this is one jason
element in our case this is second jason
element this is third jason element and
they are separated by comma here okay
now a student can have different
attributes
something like to number first name last
name his age he can have other
attributes like what class he is in or
what subjects he likes so you can add
these type of things inside these
elements of a Jason right now for
example we want to insert this one
element of a Jason inside our MongoDB
what we can do inside these round
brackets you can just paste this data
something like this okay so this is for
inserting one document okay and when you
execute it so for executing this you
just need to select all this command
which is a one command right so select
this and then execute it and you can see
it has been written to our database okay
now the second way of inserting document
is inserting multiple documents so for
example in this JSON file we have
multiple student data now to insert
multiple student data what we can do is
we can just copy all these you know
elements from here which are separated
by comma so just copy the second student
and third student because first food and
we have already created right so from
the second student to the last student I
am going to copy these elements and then
to insert multiple documents you need to
add these kind of square brackets and
this is called a array in Jason
terminology okay so for example you want
to enter multiple elements then you need
to do it inside these square brackets
right and just paste your data so let's
see how our data looks like so in the
square brackets we have second student
data then comma third student data and
, for student data and so on and at the
last you can see there is no comma right
it's like a normal array of elements
okay now just execute it first of all we
need to select all this line because
this is one line we want to execute
right so just executed by this button
and you can see seven you know data or
seven documents are inserted into our
database right so in this way you can
insert single document or multiple
document in MongoDB in the next video I
will show you how you can query this
data in MongoDB so I hope you've enjoyed
