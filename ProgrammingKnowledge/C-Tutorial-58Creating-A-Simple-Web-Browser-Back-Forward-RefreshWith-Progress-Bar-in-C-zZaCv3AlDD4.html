video I will show you how to make a
simple web browser with your c-sharp
application so let's get started first
of all I will select a new project and I
will select windows form application and
I will name it as web web browser and
now in here I will take first of all I
will take a stool strip here and in here
I will add some component first of all I
will add some buttons but one two three
this is for going back if this is for
going forward this is for refresh and
one more button to hit Enter key and I
will think now a two text box to enter
the URL of your website okay so I will
take these things and then I will go to
tool box once again and I will drag and
drop a web browser from you okay and I
will anchor it from the other sides also
like that and then I will just resize it
now in here I can set any image from my
computer so I will just press import and
I will
give images to the buttons so first is
for arrow left second is for all right
this is for going forward third is for
refresh both is for
next for example this is the enter
button right and we will take some more
buttons one and two and this I will use
it for stopping the webpage and other I
will use for going forward home yeah
this I will use for home so I'm using 1
2 3 4 5 6 buttons and one text box and
in here I am going to give my URL ok so
now I will write the code for that ok so
first of all I will go to the this but
Navi place beside my
so I have placed this enter button at
the right inside of my textbox so this
is for going back this is for going
forward refresh stop home and in this I
will enter the URL and when I click this
arrow button it should be taken as the
input URL and in next video I will also
show you how to add a progress bar to
this webpage also first the basic code
you have just like this enter button and
double click it and in here just write
your web browser name so web browser 1
dot navigate in the bracket bracket
closed and the bracket just pass the
name of this text box which is textbox
to tool strip textbox bar 1 so pass it
here dot txt okay so this is the code
for non navigation so whatever you enter
in this text box
it will navigate for the web website or
URL which you enter in the text box and
it will show now go to your go back
button and double click it and in here
once again web browser 1 dot go back
getting back closed and now go forward
so web browser dot go forward and now to
the fresh web browser dot refresh and
this is to stop so double-click it web
browser dot stop and in next land home
so just double click this form and web
browser dot go home ok and by the way
these pictures which I have included
here you can find them anywhere on the
web web so if you search for icon in the
web you could be able to find these
pictures and I generally take my picture
from icon archive which is this website
www.hyken.com and in here you can find
lot of pictures which you want just
search for example home
and just click search and you can find
your pictures like it these pictures I
have taken from there and now let's try
and run our program so run and I will
enter some URL here first of all let's
make it bigger so you could be able to
see and in here we'll enter the URL for
my youtube channel so this is the URL
and now I press this Enter button or Go
button so it will navigate for the
webpage so I press it and it's open
so my youtube channel is opened on the c
shop web browser okay
and i can go here for example i win i
can navigate somewhere and now i want to
go back so i will press this go back
button and when i press it
it goes to the previous page I have
navigated and I press forward button or
go forward button it goes to the next
page I have soft okay so back and
forward and if i press this refresh
button it refreshes the page will
refresh once again so yes it refreshes
when I press this home button the
Internet Explorer Amazon site will open
I think because this C sharp is from
Microsoft and their default browser is
Internet Explorer so it will go there so
it's not opening any site right now and
go back and when I press this stop
button
the connection will stop
so this is your simple web browser now I
think I should show how to add a
progress bar to this web browser also in
this video itself so let's see how can
we add the progress bar to our website
so just go or just go here and take a
progress bar bar from here and this is
the progress bar okay so what I will do
is I will select this web browser here
just select this web browser and go to
its event and search for the progress
change event this one and just double
click here okay so double click it and
in here write this code so first of all
right our try catch block this is a
progress bar name and in my case the
progress bar name is tool strip progress
bar okay so I will just change it go to
the code this one and this one okay now
it looks okay and in here will show the
message box sorry
as a box dot show and I copy this and
dot message okay
so just write a try-catch block and in
the try-catch block write the name of
your progress bar dot value is equal to
convert dot to int 32 because this takes
interval U and this here will be a
string value so write convert dot to int
32 and just copy this variable I will
make it little bit bigger so you can be
able to see so just copy this Eve area
below and write it here e dot current
process and then write tool strip
progress bar 1 which is the progress bar
named dot maximum is equal to convert
dot to int 32 and the bracket e dot
maximum progress so write this code for
showing the progress of your page
loading so let's try and run the program
once again just make it a little bit
bigger and in here once again I will
enter the URL of my youtube channel page
so I have entered this URL and I press
ENTER this button and you see you are
able to see the progress yeah once again
somewhere else so it's showing value of
-1 is not valid or the value so let's
see what can we do for that
so the simple solution for that problem
could be I will just comment this
message box because it's throwing
unnecessary exception which I don't
think will affect my quote right now so
once again I will open and run my
program I will enter the URL of my
youtube channel once again and I press
ENTER and you see the progress shows
okay and I go anywhere the progress bar
is working for that C you just see this
progress bar so I go back once again
this was back so and now I go to this
playlist just see here the progress bar
is working on okay so in this way you
can also use progress bar with your web
browser so I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
