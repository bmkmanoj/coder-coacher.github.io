chart 3d it will create a 3d bar chart
and I have changed change my background
color into yellow and I have changed my
title into red and this is my grid color
which I have set like I will change it
as for example blue okay and now I will
run my program and let's see those
things changes on

it and you can see my background color
changes to yellow my title color changes
to red and my bars are shown in 3d so
