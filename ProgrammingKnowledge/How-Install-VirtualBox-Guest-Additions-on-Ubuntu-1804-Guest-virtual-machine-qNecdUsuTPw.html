you how you can install VirtualBox guest
additions on Ubuntu 18.4 desktop on your
VirtualBox so let's get started so first
of all before installing guest additions
we need to install some packages so just
click on this button and then open the
terminal from here and in the terminal
you need to give this command I'm going
to give this command in the description
also so you can directly copy this
command and paste it into your terminal
so this is going to install some Linux
headers and baled essentials on your
Ubuntu operating system so I'm going to
copy this and now I'm going to paste
this on my terminal and then press ENTER
and then I'm going to give my open two
password and then it's going to install
these packages and here I just need to
press Y to continue so now all the
packages are installed on my open to
operating system so let's just install
the VirtualBox guest additions so if you
open the VirtualBox here you can see on
the top there is a device option so I'm
going to choose the device option and
then you just need to click on this
option which says insert guest additions
CD image so I'm going to click on this
and this is going to give you this kind
of window so we just need to run this
image so I'm going to just click on run
which is going to run it and first of
all we need to authenticate so give your
open tools password and now it's going
to install this guest Edition on your
ribbon to operating system so now the
VirtualBox guest additions are installed
on my system and if you see this message
which says VirtualBox guest additions
starting press return to close the
window so we are going to press Enter
which is going to close this window and
once the window is closed the guest
additions are installed on your system
the next step I'm going to do is I'm
going to restart my virtual machine so
I'm going to first of all shut it down
I'm going to just power of this virtual
machine and then I'm going to go to my
virtual machine which is open to 18.04
and I'm going to go to the settings and
just verify that these two options are
enabled so shared clipboard'
bi-directional drag-and-drop
bi-directional so if these two options
are bi-directional so you will be able
to drag and drop anything to your
virtual machine and also you will be
able to copy and paste from your host to
your guest so now I'm going to once
again restart the machine and now I'm
going to do a small test to check
whether this drag-and-drop and copy and
paste is working on my ubuntu guest or
not so first of all I'm going to open
the text editor and on this text editor
I'm going to paste something which I
will copy from my windows host so this
is the browser which runs on my windows
and this is the Wikipedia page of Ubuntu
and I'm going to just copy some of the
text from here and then paste it to my
guest on Ubuntu and you can see it folks
so copy and paste is definitely working
so in this way you can download and
install VirtualBox guest additions on
Ubuntu 18.4 guest on your VirtualBox I
