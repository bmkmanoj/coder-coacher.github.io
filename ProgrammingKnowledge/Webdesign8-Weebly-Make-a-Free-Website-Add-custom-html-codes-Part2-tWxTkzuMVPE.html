I've shown you how I have to add the
HTML in my project in my website and I
have made a small coat in notepad plus
plus which is a web design editor for
HTML and JavaScript and this was my
small code and when I save it and run it
on the web browser it shows me a list
like this and whenever I click for
example this was my first video title
and when I click it it opens the link in
the YouTube channel of the same video
and I click with your number one it
opens the video number one in YouTube so
this is the small code I've written in
HTML and I will paste this code in the
YouTube video description also so you
could be able to copy this code and use
this code according to you it's very
simple you just need to give the name
and you just you need to give the link
right now I have only copied four or
five links I just want to check whether
it works in my Weebly website or not so
I will copy whole code and I will go to
my Weebly website and last with you or
last to last video I have dragged this
custom HTML here and when I
click in here it shows click to set
custom HTML and I will paste my notepad
plus plus port which I have copied from
here and here and you see it shows the
link and I will publish this and I will
see whether my code works or not so are
we open the website from here published
website and I will go to my video and
tutorial and when I click this NetBeans
Java playlist it should open my playlist
and yes it opens my playlist and then
when I click these playlists buttons or
these playlist titles it should open my
YouTube with your link and YouTube
channel channel itself so and I click it
it opens my first video and I click this
it opens my second video so till now I
have made approximately 120 videos for
and that means so I will copy and paste
all 120 video links here and I will
provide a list of my videos here vlog
probably I will do that and I will show
you all 120 video list here
maybe next time so this is how you can
add a playlist to your website I will
also once again I want to tell you that
I will also paste this on my youtube
channel description so you can copy
and based it in your project so it will
be useful for you also and you if you
have some suggestions I will welcome
them please suggest me how can I make my
website better and I think that's it for
this video please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
