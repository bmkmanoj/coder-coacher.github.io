how to install GCC compiler in your
Windows operating system so let's get
started
first of all I will go to my browser and
I will write code logs I'm going to the
code block site because if you want to
install GCC directly to your Windows
operating system it can be little bit
hard or complicated compared to the
method I'm telling you or I'm showing
you so just go to the browser and enter
here load blocks and open this site from
code blocks code blocks is a IDE to
compile C and C++ program mainly
but we are not going to concentrate on
the IDE but I will show you how to
compile your c and c plus program with
GCC and g+ + command line and in here i
will go to the download section and here
there are binary releases source code
and it eve sauce goes from SVN we are
going to this download the binary
release and in here there are options
for linux and windows and other
operating systems what I want is this
version of Windows so I want the version
with mingw mingw is a gee plus plus and
GCC compiler with code blocks is bundled
with so just select the executable which
have mingw set setup.exe and i am going
to download this link from here going to
the sourceforge.net fine
and it will give me some command I will
agree to it and will download code
blocks in my system it will take some
time because it's around 100 MB file and
once it's download I will show you how
to install this and then I will show you
how to run GCC and G + + program with
command line
now my Dian download is completed so I
will open the executable file from my
download and will start a code block
wizard and now I will install this code
block so I just need to give the
agreement and I will say next and here
is the path of the code blocks for a
file which where you want to install it
it's in Program Files x86 slash code
blocks in my C folder if you want to
change this path just change it I am
going to leave it by default and I will
say install and it make a minute or two
to install now the installation of code
blocks is finished I can say yes to
launch code blocks but I don't want to
launch code blocks right now so I will
say no and I will click finish on next
and finish once this is installed in
your system just go to the location
where you have installed the clone code
blocks so I have installed my code
blocks at C folder and C folder I will
go to the Program Files x86 folder and
here my code blocks folder is there
where all the install files are there
and in here I will search
for the mingw folder and I will go to
the binary of bin folder of that this
contains all the C++ GCC all the
executable which we are going to need
when we compile our program with the
help of GCC and G + + so what I will do
is I will copy this path from here and
now we go to the start and here we go to
my computer and I will right-click and I
will go to the properties and in here we
go to Advanced Studies and in this
system properties I will go to my are
meant variables here and in here in the
system variables I will search for the
variable called path and in this path
I'm going to click first of all I will
select this path row and then I will say
add it and I'm going to add it the path
so this path is by default all the path
which it sees your your executable table
sees to execute the programs so what I
will do is I will give at the the right
and off this this URL or links and first
of all what I will do is I will add a
semicolon here so just add a little
semicolon here and after that I will
paste the path of this min GB slash bin
so this is the path which I have copied
from the codeblocks folder codeblocks
slash mingw slash bin and I will click
OK
and once again ok
and okay so what this environmentally
able setting will do is when we run our
G+ Plus or GCC command from the command
line it knows or it links your C++ with
the folder in which this GCC executables
are there okay now that's done what I
will do is I will make a C++ program and
for that I am going to use this notepad
plus plus which is a free open source
notepad for writing different program
languages for example HTML PHP or C and
C++ also and in here what I will do is I
will make a new file and I will right
click here anywhere or what I will do is
I will go to the file and I will say
save as and I will save this file as
test dot CPP the CPP extension is
required in order to tell this notepad
plus plus that it's a C++ program and
see it's a CPP file ok and I'm going to
give the location for saving this file
so let me see where I want to save it so
for example I want to save it in in the
C++ CPP folder and I will say save and
now you can see the title of my CPP file
is test dot CPP right now what I will do
here is I am going to go to
my blog where I have a collection of C++
program so my blog name is programming
knowledge blog dot blog spot.com and in
here we copy a simple C++ sample code
for example this first C++ program for
making a simple calculator and I will
copy all the C++ code from here okay and
I will paste in this test or CPP and I
will save this file and now what I will
do is I will go to my start command here
and I will say CMD which will open this
command prompt so that's just like this
command prompt from here and this is a
Windows command from prompt and any
other I will write CD and the path to
this C++ file so this is in my file /
CPP so I will just copy or I will go to
the path itself which is C D and then
desktop and then CB file and in here I
will go to C D my CPP folder so this is
the path where my CPP test dot CPP is
there right so I will say LS to list out
my CPU or the file which are there in
this CPV folder and you can see there is
one file called test dot CPP so what I
will do is because it's a C++ file you
need to execute G + + command with this
CPP file
and if it will be a C file you need to
write here GCC but this is a C++ program
so we will write C++ and then we will
output executable file with - Oh or
slash o - oh and now we give the name of
the executable file which is theft only
and then I will say what is the name of
my CPP file soon so the name of my CPP
file is test dot CPP as we have defined
it and once you will click enter just
see here it will generate a new
executable file Here I am in the same
folder where my CPP file is there
so when I give this command and I will
click enter it will check for the
program and it will build the program if
it doesn't have any errors and I have
some errors here let me see what is
there
so we go to my CPP file and it says that
system board or system variable is not
defined so in here when I see here in
the program there is a code called
system pause which is not required by G
+ + command so I will delete this and
save it once again so you can see here
if your program contains any error the
compiler or GCC will give the
description of the error right and
otherwise if the program is Error free
and once again when you give the same
command which is G + + - OH
test which is the executable file named
test the CPP then and press enter it
will give you no error now because there
is no error and compliation is finished
and once this compilation is finished
you can see here there is a executable
file generated here so what you can do
is you can directly just click this file
it will run the program or what or you
what you can do is you can just right
click this and see the extension of this
which is dot exe file and you can go to
the same path and say
theft dot e XE and when you press ENTER
it will run the same program in your
command line also so this is a simple
program to simulate a simple calculator
so when I give some command for example
+ and I will give some number 125 is the
first number and 255 is the second
number and when I press ENTER it gives
me the sum of these two numbers and
accordingly it will give me the product
or division or subtraction of the number
so this is how you compile the C++
program now if you want to compile a
simple C program what you need to do is
you can create a new file called so we
create a new file and I will save it as
test dot C file and notice this is in
this time I am giving the extension C so
that he or notepad plus plus can know
that it's a C program and I will save in
the same location
and you can see it has generated a test
or C file and now in this test or C file
I will make a simple program which will
be a simple hello world program NC right
so I will add just had a file and I will
just write printf hello world in the
main and now I will save my file so it's
important to save the file before you
compile it and once again I will go to
my command line and I'm in the same path
where my test or C file is there so here
I will write earlier when you compile
your C++ file you need to give G + +
right but when you want to compile this
C file you will give GCC so write just
write GCC and - oh the name of your
executable so I will say the name of my
executable file is
test for see for example this is my
executable file which I want to give and
then my C file name which is test dot C
right
so I will write test dot C and press
Enter
and my program compiles without any
error and now when you go to the folder
in the same folder it has generated a
executable file called test for C
executable file when I double-click this
file you can see it goes immediately but
when I run the program from here so this
fine name is test for C so I will write
test for C dot e X E and when I press
ENTER it gives me the output hello world
here right so in this way you can use G
+ + and GCC command in your windows and
in this way you can install GCC and G +
+ in your Windows and compile your C++
programs I hope you will learn something
