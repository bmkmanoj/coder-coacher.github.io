constructor which only takes this
context okay and as you can see here the
superclass
we can just give the name of our
database so our database name is this
variable pass it here third is factory
we are going to pass null here and the
version for example version is equal to
one now whenever this constructor is
called your database will be created
okay now in order to create the table
inside your database we are going to
create a table whenever this on create
method of this class is called okay so
you can see the SQLite database class is
the argument inside on create right so
we can just take this DB which is a
variable of SQLite database dot execute
SQLite or exact XQ light or sq so take
this instance DB and call a method
called dot exact SQL and what it does is
it executes whatever query you pass
inside this method as an argument so it
takes the string variable or a string
query so here you can prepare your
create table query and then whenever
it's called it's going to execute this
query and it's going to create this
table okay so let's write our query for
example create the table name source
create table and the table name in our
case is this one so
you can use this concatenation operator
to concatenate this and then inside your
brackets your column names comes right
so first column name is ie D or you can
just take these these names column 1
column 2 column 3 and column 4 here so
inside double quotes + + + you can write
column 1 and then let's write our query
first and let's forget about these
variables so let's understand first how
this query is written and then we can
insert these variables here okay so just
write create table and your table name
and then in the brackets comes the ID
which is the first column name and then
comes the attributes of this column so
it will be integer and it's going to be
my primary key by primary key means the
unique key which you will be able to
identify the tail rows okay and then
it's going to Auto increment Auto
increment means it's going to increment
automatically even if you don't provide
any data for it okay the second column
name is name itself and the attribute or
the datatype for this is text for
example the third column will be surname
and the data type is text for it also
and the fourth column is the marks
column so marks and let's create it as
integer so we have created a table using
this query so this query is create table
and your table name
student table and in the brackets we
have provided four columns to it ID
which is a primary key and it's going to
auto increment name which is a text
surname which is a text and mark which
is integer datatype okay now one more
thing which we can do is in the upgrade
method we can once again call this exact
SQL so this is the object we can use dot
exact SQL and in here we can just drop
our table if it exists in case of
upgradation so drop table if exist and
the table name is this one so you can
just copy and paste like this okay and
once again we are going to create this
table so you can now directly call on
create here on create and pass this DB
instance now once this is done what we
are going to do is this is just for
checking we are going to write a single
line of code so that our database is
created and the table is created also so
just go to the constructor once again in
here and just create an instance of
SQLite database which is the same as
this and we will name it as DB is equal
to this dot get write table database
okay and what it's going to do is it's
going to create your database and table
and in next video we are going to remove
this line we have because we are going
to write our code to insert the data
into the database so this
just for checking now database helper
good is done I think just one more
little change which I would like to do
is this key spelling is wrong it should
be ke Y instead of ka Y and now what we
are going to do is we are going to take
this database helper class and create an
instance of this database helper class
in our main activity dot Java class so
copy this last name go to your main
activity dot Java file and create an
instance so write the name of your class
and the instance name for example my DB
and now in our on create method of main
activity dot Java file you can just
create a new instance so my DB new and
then new database helper ok and this
takes one argument which is the context
so you can just write this and
everything will be fine now once
everything is done what it's going to do
is it's going to call the constructor of
this database helper class and what we
are doing in the constructor in the
constructor we are creating the database
right and the table ok so once this
constructor is called
this code is called and it's going to
create the database and the table for
you ok so let's run our program now our
app is running so you can see this
activity which is blank activity and
it's not going to do anything right now
but what it has done is once this
activity is invoked it's going to call
your oncreate method in your main
activity and in turn it's going to call
this constructor and discuss the
constructor is going to create a
database and your table inside your
database now to check where your
database is created or not how you can
check
and where where is the location of this
database so let's see where can we find
this database so go to your Android
studio and in here go to this tab called
tool and then go to Android and click
Android device man monitor okay so click
Android device monitor and once your
Android device monitor is open you will
be able to find your project name in
here so my project name or my app name
is SQLite app and I can find my app here
you can see SQLite app okay
once you select this go to the right
hand side and in here choose file
explorer form from here okay and in this
file explorer go to the category called
data and open it and once again search
for the category called data so data go
to data and inside data there will be a
folder once again called data so go
inside that folder open this folder and
now you can find your app name here also
so my app name is SQLite app I can see
here and I will go open this folder here
and I can see a folder called database
and inside this database I can see my
database name which is student dot DB so
now I know that my database is created
now if you are more curious about you
know seeing inside this database and you
want to see if the table is really
created or not or if once we are going
to insert some data you want to see the
data if it's there or not I will show
you a simple trick which will help you
you can export this database to your
local PC ok so right now it's in your
Android device so you can explore port
this database on your
see and then you can you know query this
database or you can see inside this
database what's inside this database
okay so this is just what checking the
content of your database by transferring
this database to your local PC and see
what's inside it so just select your
database in my case student dot DB and
you will be able to see this small
button here which says pull a file from
a device so click this and it's going to
open a file explorer and then you can
select your choose chosen location and
save it on your chosen location for
example I'm going to save it on the
desktop and it's going to save it there
and then what you can do is you can you
know if you have SQLite installed on
your windows you can just open your
terminal and you can see inside this
database one more helpful a tool I'm
going to show you in order to see inside
this database and this tool is called
SQLite manager which is a Firefox
plug-in so if you have Firefox browser
it's going to help you a lot what you
can do is you can open your Firefox
browser and go to the settings here and
go to add-ons and search for an add-on
called SQLite and it's going to search
for this SQLite many the manager zero
point eight point three you just need to
install it just install it and then
restart your browser and once your
browser is restarted you can go to
settings once again and then go to
customize here and in here you will be
able to see this tool SQLite manager you
can draw a drag and drop this in to your
you know tools here and then exit
customize
and now you will be able to open this
from here so just open SQLite manager
click OK and now you can browse your
database so my database is on the
desktop and make sure you select all
files from here ok so you will be able
to see this dot DB file ok so select all
files from here and select your database
and open now you can see this database
and there is a table called student
table which we have created and this
table is containing four columns ID name
surname and marks code by the student ok
and you can browse the type integer text
txt integer which we have provided and
our ID is a primary key you can see so
the database content you can see using
this SQLite manager ok so this is a
simple little trick which you can use so
that's it for this video and in the next
video I'm going to show you how you can
insert data into your SQLite database
using Android I hope you have enjoyed
