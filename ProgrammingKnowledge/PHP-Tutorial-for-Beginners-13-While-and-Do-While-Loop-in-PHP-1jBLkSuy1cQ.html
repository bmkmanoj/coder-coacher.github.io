video I am going to teach you about
loops in PHP and in this particular
video I am going to teach you about a
while loop and do-while loop but first
of all what is a while loop by the name
self you can understand that why a loop
is a piece of code which will execute
again and again in loop until and unless
some condition is true or false okay so
loop is a piece of code which we use to
execute a piece of code again and again
until and unless some condition is met
so let's start with me by you for
example I want to print some string
again and again ten times without
writing the code of ten times right so
for example I want to print echo and for
example programming knowledge I want to
print it ten times but I don't want to
I mean repeat the code I don't want to
do it like this ten times I just want to
use the same line and I want to print
this ten times how can I do it so I can
do it using loops so for example what I
will do here is I will just first of all
I will declare a counter counter and I
will initialize it by one and let's see
how we can use file loop first what is
the basic skeleton of file so while loop
is declared by this keyword while and
these two brackets and here comes your
your code so this is the keyword to
declare while loop and this bracket
comes the condition which has to match
in order to
execute the code inside your while loop
so I want to print this whenever some
condition is true now in while loop
there is a number called zero and
whenever you give as an argument to
while loop your condition will never be
true because 0 is equal to false in PHP
whenever you pass is a pass it as an
argument for checking some condition and
on the other hand one is considered as
always true so if you give one as a
while loop and it will keep on running
forever without stopping so never
attempt something like this until and
unless you have some concrete reason of
doing this otherwise it will crash your
browser if you crash your computer and
you you know it can be harmful for your
program so never try it something like
this until and unless you have some
reason to do it okay okay so for example
I want to print this ten times how can I
do it I can provide a condition to this
while loop that until and unless the
counter is less than or equal to ten I
want to print this but we are not using
this counter anywhere right so it will
always be less counter we initialize
this counter by one and one is always
less than ten then this is the same
condition as giving one two over here
there is the same condition like this
which which will never be met right so
what we can do is we can increase this
counter every time we execute this code
we can increase it like this by this
increment operator and what this will do
let's see it will print out this 10
times
let's try to run the program it prints
this program knowledge ten times let me
provide this break which I always forget
so that will be printed in line by line
you see now for example I want to check
whether is it executing ten times really
or not what I can do is I can just
provide this single quotes here for
example and or even I can use double
quotes also and I can use a
concatenation operator so I can
concatenate this here counter and so I
want to just print the counter value not
the counter plus plus right and then I
want to provide the break okay
so space this counter and then the break
double quotes I will provide the break
and let's do it with the single quotes
for now single quote single quote in
quotation and single quotation and here
I should add my hand symbol otherwise it
will not recognize this and let's see
what is the value of counter one by one
okay I'll just rerun it and you see the
cup value of counter first of all is one
two three four five six seven eight
until 10 right so what's happening here
is you provide the value of count is
equal to one and it goes to this code
and here value of counter is one which
is less than 10 so it will execute this
code and the value of counter will be
printed one here and then you counter
will be increased by one so the value of
counter becomes two here it will go once
again to the loop it will check to is
less than or less than ten still
it will print this and the counter will
be 2 and counter will be increased to 1
more which is 3 and we'll keep on doing
this until and unless this counter
becomes 11 and this condition is false
11 is not less than or equal to 10 so
this code will not be executed and your
code will go out yeah okay so this is
how you can use while loop and what is
the basic thing here until and unless
this condition is true your code will be
executed now you can also use 2 while
loop to perform the same task but the
problem with 2 while loop is not a
problem that but the property of
do-while loop is it will execute at
least once even if your condition is
true so for example I will show you how
you can declare do-while loop you just
need to write do here instead of while
and it will include these curly braces
and after your curly braces you provide
while and you just give the semicolon
here ok so by the you skeleton itself
you can understand what it will do it
will do first
so do means do something so your program
will come here it will execute this
condition and it will check this
condition after executing this code ok a
while whether whenever you were using
while it was checking the condition
first and then executing but in the case
of do-while loop it will execute the
code first and then check the condition
for example I have do it like this or I
do it like this which is never to write
so our program should ideally
out of the loop right because this
condition is not true so whenever I run
this what will you expect it will run at
least once because do-while loop
executes your code even if the condition
is false at least once and then checks
the condition okay so this is the
property of 2 while loop it will execute
your code and then checks the properties
and if this is 10 and once again you
will run it will execute it like this ok
so remember this whenever you want to
check the condition first use while loop
and whenever you want to perform your
food at least once before checking the
condition use do-while loop so I hope
