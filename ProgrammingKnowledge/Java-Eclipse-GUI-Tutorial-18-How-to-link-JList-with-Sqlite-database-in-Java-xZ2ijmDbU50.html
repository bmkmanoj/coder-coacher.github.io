last video I have shown you how to use J
list in your Eclipse GUI application in
this video I am going to show you how
you can link your J list with the
database values and show it in your GUI
so we have been developing this small
little project and in here I am going to
add RJ list and I will just select - J
list and make a square here so to make a
J list in your form you need to have
this square
okay now once you have this cellist in
here what you need to do is you can
resize your jlist
according to your requirement so for
example I want to show the names all the
names in my database table column I want
to show this in the DJ list how can I do
this it is easy so I want to load this
these names from the database whenever
my form loads so as soon as my form
loads I want to see this these values
directly as we have seen in the case of
J table or these these combo box okay so
what I am going to do is I am going to
go to my source and I will go to the top
above my constructor of my class as you
know the constructor has the same name
as your class so this and this should
match so I will go just above my
constructor and I will make a public
method so i will write public void load
list okay and it will take no arguments
and
the method definition and in here we are
going to write the code so I will just
copy my sample code from anywhere and
till now you must have you know you must
remember this that how I am connecting
to the database and how I am preparing
the queries so in this first line what I
make is I make the query and in the
second line I am make the prepared
statement and I pass this query to the
connection using prepared statement and
in the third line I execute this query p
st dot execute through query and pass
the result in this result set and I go
through the result set in a while loop
write this I will remove for now and
then I need to close this so p st e p st
dot
close just remember if I also do not
tell you that you need to close it you
just always remember this whenever you
create your prepared statement just do
not forget to close this prepared
statement and your result set okay
so always remember this even though in
the tutorial in some of the tutorial I
forget to write these two lines but
always remember that you need to close
these things okay so now we need to load
our list with the names right so for
that we need to define our default model
as we have seen in the last video so I
will just below the Declaration of this
result set I will define a default tip
the list model by default list model and
this will be like this D LM the for
default list model is equal to new
default list model
and this will not take list but only on
an argument and then in the while loop
when I have the result I can use this
object default list model to add
elements so I can say dlm dot add
element and what element I need to add
whatever I get in the result so I use
this result set object dot get string
get string
and in here as an argument of cat string
I will pause the name of my column so I
want to populate the name column values
right so I will just write name as an
argument for get string double quotes
name okay now you have this method but
you are not using this method anywhere
so just copy this method and go to the
constructor as you know constructor has
the same name and go to the end of the
constructor so this is the starting
curly brace go to the end of the
constructor in here my constructor end
so just above the end of the constructor
just paste this method and why we are
doing this because constructor is the
first method which is executed whenever
you call a class right so whenever we
call this class the constructor will be
executed and then this function will
also be executed and then our values
will also be loaded okay so run the
program
and I do not see anything yes I know why
so I will just go to my method once
again and I forgot to set this model to
the list I am NOT setting anywhere this
model to some list so just copy the name
of your list whatever is the name of
your list I select in the list and I
name it as list name ok so just copy the
name of the list go to the source and in
your load list method you need to
populate this we have this load list
method and we have created the default
list model but we were not transferring
this model to the list so just copy the
name of your list dot so if this list is
not recognized and it will show you an
error that means your list is local
inside your constructor search for the
list wherever you have this list and
make it global and I think you know how
to make the list low global so just copy
this here the list declaration and
delete this.j list from here so and
leave this name as default and go at the
top of your class
wherever your class starts my class
thoughts here and just below this you
need to declare this list like this as a
private member right
five-eight member okay so now your list
becomes global if you see this blue then
list is global just check once again
that this becomes blue also okay so now
you have your list and then you can just
go to your method list name dot set
model okay set model and the model is
DLN right model is PLN so once again I
will run the program
and you see see the values in here right
in the list so you have successfully
populated all the values which are there
in the column inside the list you can
even properly employee ID column values
or surname column values or H column
values in the list and the procedure
will be same just you need to change
this column name from here okay so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
