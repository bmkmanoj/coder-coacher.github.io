last video I have shown you how to
transfer your data grid view values to
your PDF file using ITEX sharp deal in
your c-sharp application so what next
we have seen how to show pictures or to
show paragraph how to show list house to
show tables how to represent your data
grid view to the PDF file now what
remains is the charts so now in this
video I will show you how to transfer
your chart which is this chart from your
c-sharp application to your PDF file ok
so suppose I want to show this chart
into my PDF file using c-sharp and I
text sharp d ll then how can I do that
in this video I will show you so let's
get started I will close this
application and I come to my form and I
double click this button once again and
this is the code we have been writing
from last 3 or 4 videos in which I have
shown you how to create the PDF and how
to insert table lists and paragraphs and
images into the PDF now I want to add a
chart in that PDF so when you go into
the form this chart how to load this
this chart I have shown you in the video
number 14 and 15 so if you don't know
how to use the chart in your C shop
application then watch the video number
14 and 15 of this series and just select
your chart and just see the name of the
chart so my chart name is chart 1 so
just remember this name because I am
going to use this name in my code and
now I will just double click this button
once again
and at the bottom after my table I will
show or I will insert the chart so this
is the end of my table code which I have
shown you last time in the last video
and after my table code I will write the
code to insert the chart so write this
code so I will tell you what this code
is just I will okay so right where chart
image which is your where data type
variables name and is equal to new
memory stream bracket and bracket closed
ok and now for the next line you need to
import some namespace into your C shop
so just go at the top and just write
this line to your code using system dot
Windows dot form dot data visualization
dot charting so you need to add this
library or namespace to your c-sharp
application
at the top of your code where all other
namespaces are there so just add this
line and once again to the code and
write your chart name which is this
chart name which is chart one okay and
then chart name dot save image and in
the bracket this where variable just
copy and paste it here comma chart image
format form it which is a form it from
the library which we have just written
above namespace okay
so chart image format dot PNG so this
code will generate the image of the
chart which is PNG image of the chart
because here is the PNG and it will
place or it will transfer this image
into this variable which is where
variable okay and in the next line right
I take shop dot text dot image and write
the name of your image variable I named
it as chart image is equal to I takes
sharp dot text dot image once again dot
get instance and in the bracket right
chart image which is your war where
variable name chart image dot get buffer
and bracket and bracket closed and then
in the next line we simply add this
chart variable to our document PDF so if
you want you can just copy
code if it's visible in the screen and
now just we will run the code so right
username and password and right now I
don't have any charge so when I press
this load chart button the chart comes
okay
this load chart button click event and
how to use chart I have shown you in the
video number 14 and 15 so if you don't
know just go there and first of all
let's see our PDF how it looks so till
now it has some tables and now below
this table I will generate a chart so
when I click this button the chart will
be generated so I will click this create
PDF and now when I check this PDF file
and if you can see it has generated this
chart in my PDF which is the same chart
as this chart okay so I will try to
so both charts in the same screen so you
can identify them here so if you can
match them both charts are same so it
and just transfer this chart into my PDF
file and just if you are wondering that
you want to resize this chart because
it's not looking good inside the PDFs so
you can resize this chart also just go
to the video in which I have shown you
how to use images with your PDF
otherwise I will show you right now how
to resize this chart once again so you
will not so just go to this line and
below your declaration of your chart
image variable after this line we will
add one line more so just copy this
image variable paste it here dot scale
percent and break it a bracket close and
in here I will enter the percent
I want to increase this image so I want
to make this image 200% of its original
size okay so it will look bigger 200% is
just the double of the size of the image
so let's see now how the image looks
like and first of all I will load the
chart and I will press this button
create PDF
and now we'll see the chart and if you
can see the image is bigger now so it
looks good on the PDF so in this way you
can show the chart from your c-sharp
application into your PDF file using
ITEX shop I hope you have enjoyed this
