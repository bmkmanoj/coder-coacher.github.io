show you how to add a picture or image
to your I text report so for example I
want to add a picture to the PDF of my
report so what I will do is first of all
I want to choose one picture so for
example I will go to my folder and I
will choose one picture so for example I
want to show this Cherry image to my PDF
report what I will do is I will go copy
this image copy and I will go to my
project and wherever my report is saved
so my report is saved in my project
folder and wherever my report is saved I
will paste my picture there yeah so my
chavvy picture is saved
wherever my report is saved so I will do
that first and then I will go to my
project or my code
NetBeans code and now I want to show my
image to my PDF so for example I want to
show my image at the top of my file so
just after your document dot open go
there and right here image
I mean whatever variable name you want
to give your image I may give it an
image is equal to image not
get
sorry it's not image so what I will do
first is my image library is not
imported so I will right click on fix
import so my image file is imported and
now when I write image dot get instance
and here you have to give the name of
your image so double quotes and the
image I have saved here it's name is
cherry so I will copy the name of my
image and that is a jpg file so i will
write cherry dot jpg so whatever is your
the name of your image you want to show
just copy that and whatever is the
extension you just remember that and go
to your project and just write the exact
name and extension chichi for example
and then semicolon I forgot to say that
my NetBeans Java project doesn't support
jpg file somehow I don't know why so I
think this will not work for me so I
have to change this jpg file by a PNG
file which will suit my application more
some are not saying that all NetBeans
Java project doesn't support JPG images
but I don't know why my NetBeans doesn't
support jpg file so I will change this
jpg file by a PNG file which will be
more appropriate for me so I will go to
my folder instead of this jpg file I'll
search for a new file which will be a
PNG file so
such a small thing this this is a PNG
file so I will copy this copy and then I
go to my project and wherever my report
is situated I would want to be and paste
that image whose extension is PNG so I
will copy its name
copying its name
and then we'll go to my program and
instead of jpg file re write this image
which is a PNG file and after that you
will write document which is this
document you've declared document now if
you want to give any any name of your
image you can give it so give my image
name is image only why that what is the
error is okay I haven't defined it as oh
paragraph so new
brackets cover it so this is the title
only I have given to my image and then I
will write document dot and and image so
this variable I have taken in the
document so I will added these three
lines here and this image which is a PNG
image I have saved in my project folder
where my report is situated and now
let's try to run our program run TVA's
program is open so i will close it is
running so I will click report my report
is saved and let's see how my report
looks like now so I will click my report
make it a small so this image is shown
here which I have taken into my report
and this is my title so if you want to
show some title on your image you also
can show that and this is my image so in
this way you can show some image into
your I text report
so I think you have learned something
new this time and please rate coming to
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
