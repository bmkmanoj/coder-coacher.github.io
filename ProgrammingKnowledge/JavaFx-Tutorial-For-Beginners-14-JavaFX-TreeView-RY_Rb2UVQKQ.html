JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use tree view
in Java FX so let's get started so I
have created a project called tree view
in which I have this main dot java main
controller dot java and mean dot app XML
so I think till now you already know
what these are and how they can be
created okay now what I'm going to do
first is I'm going to go to my main
controller dot Java file and first of
all I will implement initialize Abel
here and then I have to implement one
method which is initialized right so I
will do this
so in this initialize I'm going to write
the code for the treeview
okay but first of all I have to you know
add a treeview in my main dot F XML file
so I'm going to select my main dot F XML
file and I'm going to open it with scene
builder now once your scene builder is
open go to controls and search for a
tree view and in my case it's second
last option in controls so drag and drop
this tree view into your anchor pane
okay and if you want you can resize it
okay and what I'm going to do next is
I'm going to give our ID to this tree
view for example tree view itself and
just save your code okay and now go to
your Eclipse IDE and in here first of
all in the main controller I am going to
define this tree view so first of all at
the rate FX ml and then tree view and
tree view is a less so you need to
provide the data type for the list which
is string and then just provide the same
name which you have defined in your F
XML file and import the tree view from
JavaFX scene control library
okay now next what we are going to do is
we are going to go to in the initialize
method here and inside this initialize
method I'm going to create some tree
items
okay so tree item which is also a list
and I'm going to name it as root okay is
equal to new tree item and it takes the
name of the item so for example this is
our root right now any tree view has a
root and nodes so for example I will
give you an example this is a tree view
so this BC in our case is a root and
these are all the nodes right and inside
this desktop these are all the sub nodes
right so tree has a node and sub node
right so in the same way we are creating
a root first and then we can create some
nodes okay so using this tree item
itself you are going to create some node
and we will name it as node a and we
will name the second as node B and the
third as node C okay and same you can
give here right so give the name here
node a node B and node C now after
creating root and node you need to add
the nodes to the root right so you have
two options one is just take the root
object and then call get children and
then you can just call add function
right and then you can add one note at a
time something like this so you can do
the same three times and then pass your
node like this using add function and
now one last thing you need to here is
you need to add this root
to our tree view right so just take our
tree view object and then call a method
called asset route okay and then you
pass your root object in here as an
argument okay so this is your code and
now one last thing which remains here is
we need to add the controller class to
this main dot F XML file so go to
controller here and add this main dot F
XML here and save the code go to your
Eclipse IDE refreshed your project and
save everything and run your project and
now you can see we have a route and
inside the route we have some nodes node
a node B and node C okay and if you feel
that this is little bit long code then
you can do something like this
so root dot get children and then you
can call a method called add all okay
and then you can add these nodes one by
one as an argument node a node B and
node C and you can remove this code and
just add a semicolon here and it's also
going to give you the same result here
so same result right now for example I
want to add some sub nodes to a node a
so what can I do I'm going to just copy
this code and just below this I'm going
to add sub node so node a one node B 1
and node C 1 for example and this here
also node a 1 and node B 1 and node C 1
ok and same thing I can do here but
these nodes I'm going to add to node a
right so there will be the sub nodes for
the node a ok and pass these node a node
B and note C as an argument so node a1
node B 1 and node C 1 ok and save your
code and run it and now you have your
root and then you have three nodes and
under node a you also have three more
nodes which are node a one node B 1 and
node C 1 ok so in this way you can
create root nodes and sub nodes inside a
tree view now let's see how we can add
icons or images to these roots and nodes
of the tree view so what I'm going to do
first is I'm going to go to my source
package and I'm going to create a new
package here and I'm going to name it as
IMG and inside this IMG a package or IMG
folder I'm going to copy an image so I
have this folder icon image so I can
drag and drop into this icon package
here and just say copy and it will be
copied to your image folder ok and now
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to create an image object so just write
image icon is equal to new image and
just close it and just import this Java
effects scene image library from here ok
and now you need to give some argument
to this image constructor so in the
constructor what you can pass here is
get class first and then get resource so
get resource as stream and in the
argument of get resource as stream you
can give the path of your image so my
image is in IMG folder so just write /
IMG / your image name so my image name
is icon dot PNG right and now I can copy
this image icon object and I can go to
this tree item
instructor here and after the name of
the item I can give the new image view
so just write new image view and inside
the image view constructor you just pass
this icon okay and save your code and
run it and now I can see this folder
image is set to my root okay and same
you can do for all the nodes so what you
can do here you can just copy this line
of code and paste it to every tree item
constructor okay and save your code and
run it once again and now you can see
this icon is added to every node of our
tree view okay so in this way you can
use tree view in JavaFX
in the next video most probably I am
going to show you how you can add some
action event to the tree view so stay
tuned and please recommend subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
