video I will show you how to use dialog
boxes with your visual C++ windows form
application so for example I have a
button and I want to copy the file path
I or I want to know the file path of a
selected file so how can I do it I just
press this button and this dialog box
will open so I will show you how to open
this dialog box and when you select a
file for example this file it will copy
a part of that file and show into this
message box so I will show you how to do
this so let's see how I have done it I
just have taken a button and renamed it
open file you can give your own name so
I just double click it and I go to the
method of the button action perform or
button click event here I have written a
small code which I will explain first I
have declared a stream and this stream I
have given the name my stream and this
stream I have used here to open the file
so and then in the next line I have used
open file dialog this is a component to
open a dialog box and then after a caps
sign I have given open file dialog one
this is a variable name is
will do GC new open file dialog so this
is the declaration of the dialog box now
I have given the condition first this F
and this F so I have taken two if
conditions in the first if condition I
have copied this variable named open
dialogue here arrow pointers show dialog
is equal to show double colon windows
double colon form double dialogue result
W :
okay so if this condition is true I will
go to the other condition if my stream
is equal to this variable name once
again or dialog box arrow pointer open
file is not equal to null pointer so if
the file dialog box will not point to
the null then we will go inside and we
will take a string variable is equal to
open dialogue or open file dialog one
which is this variable a row pointer
initial directory this will show the
initial path of your or directory of
your
chosen part Plus once again this open
file dialog arrow point of file name so
this will hold the file name of your
chosen parts this is the directory of
your chosen path and this is the file
name and this directory and file name
will go into this string variable and
now when we have copied that part we
will just call it in the message box and
show the path so this is the variable
which I have called him the message box
and then I closed the my stream stream
which is this one so I closed it so if
you want just copy this code and just
pause this video and copy the code and
when you are done you can run your code
so just pause it and copy the code
and when you are done just run your
program
this is username and password which I
have shown in the last videos and this
will open the second form and in here
when you click this Open File button and
select any file it will show you the
file path okay so this dialog box is
very useful in many situation when you
are dealing with the files so you need
this maybe in the some other video I
will also show you how to open a file
with this dialog box right now we have
just copied the path of the file but in
the other video I will show you how to
open that file with the help of dialog
box so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
