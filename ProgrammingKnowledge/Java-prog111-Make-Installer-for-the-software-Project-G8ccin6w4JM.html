video I will show you how to make the
installer for your project so in the
last video we have downloaded a software
called is tall creator so double-click
it and your installed creator program
will be running so in this first step
there are two windows that will open at
a time so on the top window window just
press next and then you have to browse
your folder or directory in which your
NetBeans project is located
so this is my project for this one - for
in this when we clean and build our
program this was the directory it
created automatically bist just select
that folder and press ok
so that whole folder will be selected
there and then press next you can name
your product so I will name my hood
checked as Java soft for example and
then press next you can choose here
whenever you will be installed or any
other user will install your installer
in the first step
it will open with the small screen or
the full screen so i will choose small
screen and press next and these are the
default setting so I will not change
them I will press next and here you can
write the description for your project
what are the use or whatever information
you want to give so I will write this is
my
project for example and I will click
Next in here you can give your license
agreement conditions so you can write
all right reserved for example and
whatever you want to write and then
press next this is the default generated
name for your projects press next and in
here
you have to provide the executable file
for your project or if you want to
provide some icon to your executable
file then you have to choose that file
here and you also have to choose some
icon if you have some icon so this you
can do is like this this is the dist
folder which we have created and go and
to all files here and then I will choose
my jar file whatever is your jar file
name is just do this and you can write
the name of few things we go to a pile
once again so I will name it as Java
soft and when you click this add desktop
shortcut so it will add as a desktop
shortcut and if you want to give your
desktop shortcut any icon then browse
for the picture and then choose that
icon
and it's a dot IC o---- file so you need
to have dot icon file in order to attach
it I don't have any icon file so I will
not attach any icon right now I will
click Next then and it shows if you
would like to use to be able to use
document file I will not choose anything
I will press next and by this you mean
it means that you want to create an
uninstaller for your file also so I will
ticket and press next and I will take
this and press finish so now you go to
your second window and in here you will
click Save and wherever you want to save
your file you can save it so I want to
save my file on the
Desktop and this is my Java soft file
save and we build it now and once again
I will name my of the Java so and if you
want you can create the folder I want to
create an extra folder for my software
so I will create a extra folder and my
software name is Java soft so all my
file will be there in John the Java soft
folder this folder and I will press save
see it will start generating your files
and completing 90 ok so your files are
now generating generated which is your
installation files this is the folder in
which I have generated my software files
and this is the installed label or
installer file for my project so when I
click it it'll ask me and it'll install
like an installer so you click it and
install this file and you can run your
project then after so I hope you have
learned something new this time and
