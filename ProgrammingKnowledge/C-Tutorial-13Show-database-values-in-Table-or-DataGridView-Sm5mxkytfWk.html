video I will show you how you can
populate a table with your database so
for example I want to show my database
table in my c-sharp applications all the
data I want to see in the form of table
in my c-sharp
application how can I do that
I will show you today by using data grid
view or table so I have made tables like
this and when I press this load table
button it loads all the data in the
database in the form of table in this
table so how did I do that I will show
you that right now so first of all what
I have done is I have taken a data grid
view this one from the toolbox and drop
drag and dropped here this okay and I
have taken a button and I have changed
its its text as load table so I have
this and this these two things I have
and the name of my data grid view is
that a grid view one which is a default
you can change it and now how can I do
this so I will select this load button
and double click it and this will lead
me to the code so
what I have written is if you are
following this video I will lead you to
the code first of all I have done the
connection
so string constraint this is a string
name and I have passed the collect
connection variables so data source is
equal to localhost then semicolon port
3306 username root password you would if
you are using if you are viewing my
videos you know how to connect MySQL
with your c-sharp application in the
next line I have made a connection so
MySQL connection Conn database is equal
to new MySQL connection and I am passing
this string in this box in the third
line I have written MySQL command
command database is equal to new MySQL
command and I have passed a simple query
select star from database dot table so
my database name and dot my table name
this is my table name okay and then
comma this variable I have passed here
so write these three line and then make
a try-catch block try and catch
exception e X and in the catch block
right message dot show X dot message so
this will catch any exception if you are
having in your code a while running then
in Prime bulk block I have written my
SQL data adapter this is adapter for the
data grid view I am making so my spell
data adapter SDA is equal to my SQL data
dr. and then I will
I have copied this variable and pasted
here dot select command and I am passing
this where you will here then I have
declared a variable data table DB data
set is equal to new data table bracket
then bracket closed and then once again
I have copied this variable and pasted
here dot pin and pass this variable here
the next line I have declared a binding
source B source is equal to new binding
source and then just copy this variable
here dot data source is equal to this
variable this one right and then once
again I have copied the name of my data
grid view this one from here copy sorry
change my daughter grid-view name yeah
now it's okay so I have copied my
daughter with grid view name and paste
it here dot data source is equal to B
source which is this variable name and
then at last I have written SD a dot
update in the bracket I have passed this
variable okay
so if you want just pause the video and
copy the code and now we are going to
test the code once again run the code
give the user name and password password
is correct and when I press this load
table button it loads all the columns in
my database and show it here but suppose
I don't want to show user name and
password and other columns in my table
and I just want to show only employee ID
name surname and age how can I do that I
will show you instead of this query
select star from database you just need
to write each column name which you want
to show so I want to show the ID comma
name comma so name comma age so now it
will show only four columns employee
names are name and age let's see try and
run the program and when I load this
table it shows only four columns so in
this way you can customize your table
also now if you want the table to be
loaded automatically when this second
form up years and you don't want this
button to load the table it and this
table should be loaded automatically how
when we achieve that I will show you so
just above your
this note table button click event you
can make a function called void load
table okay like it closed and in here
you can copy all the code which you have
written for loading the table so in the
event of the button click of this table
so now just double click it and just
copy all the code from here and just
paste it in your load table function
which you have currently made ok and
just copy this load table function and
paste it above your code wherever you
have your initialize component function
declaration or call so just go there and
paste it there and just close it so I
know I think you know what is this
because I have already explained you
what is this function so wherever this
function is there just call your load
table function and now when you run the
program
to username and password is correct
your table is loaded automatically
without this button right so in this way
you can load your table automatically
also now how to refresh your table so
for example I want to add some data this
safe data I have already shown you in
the previous video so for example I have
right now seven employees so I want to
add the eight employee so eight come of
age and I save the data by clicking this
button saved but you can see this data
is not refreshed automatically right but
you click when you click the slow table
button it is refreshed so this load
table button you can also use to refresh
your table otherwise you can also do one
more thing
just copy this load table function and
go to your forum and wherever you have
written your save data code insert into
the database just click in double click
it and go to the bottom of that code
just here of the cat block and just
paste that functioning here and now when
you run the program your data will be
refreshed automatically so let's see now
I have eight employees I want to add
nine nine
something hideous what is 3 and when I
save it just look at here right now I
have it and then I save it it's saved
and the table is refreshed automatically
so in this way you can use load the
table and customize your table according
to yourself I hope you have enjoyed this
