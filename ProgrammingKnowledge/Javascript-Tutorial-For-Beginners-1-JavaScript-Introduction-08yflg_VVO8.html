JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will learn what is
JavaScript and how does it work and if
the time permits we will also see how we
can write our first Java Script code so
first of all what is JavaScript
javascript is a high-level dynamic
untyped and interpreted programming
language and alongside HTML and CSS it
is one of the three most essential
technologies of world wide web content
production now if you are using HTML and
CSS most probably you are generating
only static pages for your website and
what is static static means there is no
interactivity in your web page you can
only produce text images tables and
frames but there is no interactivity
involved in your web page now javascript
is just for that so javascript allows
you to add interactivity with your web
page so for example you want to add a
user and you want the user to log in to
your website before accessing your
content so this can be added through
JavaScript right or you can use
JavaScript to manipulate the actions of
the user for example he clicks something
and he wants to calculate the values of
something for example addition of two
numbers you can do it with JavaScript
very easily now if you're thinking
javascript is a very difficult language
to learn it's not it's really easy to
learn and it was developed by nest
Netscape first okay now what is the
meaning of interactivity I will show you
by example so for example I have this
temperature converter let's see on the
actual webpage how it looks like
so this is a temperature converter right
now all this is right now HTML and CSS
and for example I want to convert a
Celsius value into a Fahrenheit and
Kelvin I need to use a JavaScript or in
fact I'm using javascript in this
webpage to calculate these values for us
so for example I add 5 degree Celsius
here and I want to calculate the
respective value of Fahrenheit and
Kelvin I can just click this convert
what button and JavaScript does it magic
it converts it and it shows it here so
this is the magic of JavaScript okay
now not only JavaScript calculates
something but it improves the appearance
of your web page especially if you are
using graphics or visual feedback it can
also make your site navigation easier
and interactive and as I already said
that it can perform calculations and
validation validation means just for
example login a page of your website
right so how does it work
it can be embedded into your HTML page
so you can directly embed script element
into your HTML code and you can use
javascript otherwise you can create a
javascript file and add it into your
HTML page
okay now javascript is executed on the
client side so it's fast and once it's
loaded no connection is needed from the
server to execute or to make it work ok
now it uses simple programming statement
combined with HTML tag and as I already
said it's an interpreted language now
there are two type of languages one is a
compiled language and other is an
interpreted language compiled language
is a 1 when you compile it first and
create a binary of it and when you
execute this binary it will work but the
interpreted means for example javascript
is an interpreted language so we don't
need to compile it but it can be used
directly on the browser and it can be
interpreted by the browser so you can
say browser interprets it and if it's
valid then it will be shown to the user
right now some people thinks that Java
and Java scripts are almost same but
they are not Java and Java scripts are
totally different languages okay so for
example what is Java Java is a full
programming language which is much
harder to learn and it's a compiled
language and it's independent of web so
you can use Java with web technologies
but it's not necessary that you have to
use web technologies with Java it can
you know do its stuff on its own without
any web technology right on the other
hand javascript is an interpreted
language which has its own syntax and
what we need to code JavaScript one is
the text editor and other is the browser
okay so you can choose any browser of
your choice and the text editor for
example you can use notepad or WordPad
which comes with windows or you can use
notepad plus plus which is a little bit
more advanced version of notepad or you
can use some IDE like eclipse or
NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA or there are
many IDE s IDE stands for integrated
development environment which you can
use to code JavaScript ok
now if you want to learn JavaScript most
probably you need to revise your HTML
skills right so because we use
JavaScript mostly
with HTML so you need to have some idea
of HTML also okay now this is a small
example of a JavaScript code so you have
HTML and you can add JavaScript code
inside this HTML page so let's see how
we can do it so I have this sample HTML
code and for example I want to add this
JavaScript code inside it what I can do
here is I can add a script tag here and
just add this type is equal to text
slash JavaScript so it knows which type
of language it is which is JavaScript
right and in here too for example I want
to print something on the web page I can
use document dot write so document dot
write and here I can just write for
example hello world and don't forget to
give the semicolon here and I will save
it and I will go to the web page on
which I want to execute it and refresh
my web page and so shows hello world ok
now for example I want to add some HTML
tags inside this document I can do it
easily just add for example h1 tag at
the start and ending tag at the last
which is same and save your code and
refresh your webpage and it's showing it
in the h1 tags okay so you can use
JavaScript like this now we will learn
more how we can use JavaScript and how
we can you know create interactive web
pages using javascript in the further
videos so stay tuned and please rate
