on cutie tutorial for beginners in the
last video I am showing you how you can
use a queue timer plus in QT now in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
use this queue timer class to create a
digital clock in QT so let's get started
I'm going to you know use the last
example which I have shown you in the
last video which was queue timer and in
that example what I have done is I have
created this sample project and in here
I have first of all included this to
queue timer class and then I have
created an object of queue timer which
is this one and I have created a public
slot function which was my function like
this okay so if you don't know this code
just watched the last video and I'm
going to continue this code in this
video okay
so I'm going to go to my main window dot
CPP file and this was the code I have
written in the last video right and this
was the function and in this function I
was just printing this string called
queue update right so instead of
printing this queue update to display
some time we can use a class called
queue date/time so you can just include
this class which is called queue
date/time okay so this is the class we
want to use and now we can use this
queue time here so just write Q time
like this and then we can just say this
is our time and this queue time can
return our current time so you can just
write our static you can just call a
static function using queue time which
is current time
okay and this will give you the current
time right and then first of all let's
add a label here so you can just go to
main window dot UI file here and in here
we are going to include a label so just
search for a label which is this one and
you can make it a little bit bigger and
you can even change the font size of
these fonts because it will be a digital
clock so let's make it bold and let's
make little bit bigger 36 okay something
like this right and I'm going to just
expand this and I will just provide some
layout here so I'm going to just provide
a horizontal layout to it and I will
just delete this text from here so that
we can print our text
okay now this label I will just name
this label as label for example
date/time so just write date/time okay
so we know that this is the label name
now I'm going to go to my main window
dot CPP file and in this function first
of all I will just convert this current
time into a string so just to find cue
string variable and then you can just
say time text ok so just write time text
and then we can convert our time to a
string by just calling our two string
function on it okay and we can even
format our time and date using some you
know keys so for example you if you
write H H here it will display hours in
two digits and then I'm going to provide
a space and then semicolon and then if
you provide two M's it will print
minutes
in two digits right and then a space and
then : and then for example I want to
print second so I will just write SS
okay so something like this and this
will give the string the output and then
we can set this string to our label so
just call a label date/time and then we
can just set this text so just right set
text and then just pass this time text
here okay so and here we want to update
our time every one second right so just
the right time start and as an argument
of start function you just need to give
one second which is 100 milliseconds
here right if you have followed the last
video you know how it works right so
let's compile our code and let's run it
and let's see if it works or not so you
can see our time is working so right now
it's 10 o'clock or 22 in the night and
then 52 minutes and you can see the
seconds are also updating here right now
if you want to make it a little bit more
fancy what we can do here is we can for
example we can give our if condition
here and then we can just call this time
object and we can just say time dot
second so it will give the second value
to us and then we will provide a modulus
of two so we will see if it's a modulus
of two or not and then we will equate it
to zero so we are just taking the
modulus and if the second is even we
want to for example
disappear these columns in between and
if this is a hard number we want to show
them for example something like this
right so you can just take this text
which is a string right so it has some
index so the index start from 0 so 0 1 2
3
right so the : index of : s 3 here so
you can just write 3 and then you can
just set a text here so for example I
want to just set a blank test text
instead of this : right and same we will
do for the next : so this was 3 4 5 6 7
8 ok so the index of second : is 8 and
we will do the same for the second :
here right and then let's run our code
and let's see what happens so now our
app is running and you can see these
colons
are disappearing every second and
showing every alternate second you can
see right it's more like a digital clock
right now if you want to show instead of
: something like this you can also do
this right so it depends upon you what
type of time you want to show here so
something like this or you can format it
something like this also and it will be
the same time will be same but it will
just add this /m okay so in this way you
can create a digital clock using cue
time plus and cue date/time class I hope
