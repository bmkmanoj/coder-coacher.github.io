show you how you can create a new
JavaScript project in Visual Studio 2015
now you can create projects in different
ideas like NetBeans or Eclipse or there
are many other IDE s which is just for
this purpose for creating JavaScript
projects and all stuff but if you are a
fan of Visual Studio and if you have
some small stuff to test in JavaScript
and you want to use Visual Studio then
you can use it for this purpose so let's
see how we can do it first of all open
your visual studio and go to file and
create a new website and in here we are
going to select our empty website okay
and it depends upon you if you want to
choose visual c shabbos Visual Basic but
because we are not going to use any of
those asp.net templates or any other
thing we are just going to create a pure
JavaScript file n HTML file so just
choose asp.net MD website and it will
create you a blank project now go to
your solution Explorer on the right here
and right click on your project and just
go to add and add a new item and in here
you can see many options so first of all
what we are going to do is we are going
to add a JavaScript file which is here
javascript file and if you want to give
any name to your file you can do it for
example my j s dot j s ok and add it it
will add this javascript file to your
project now in this javascript file you
can add any function for example
function add and this function we will
use it to add two numbers so number one
and second argument will be num - okay
and just close this and we will return
num1 plus num2 ok so this is a small
function we have created in JavaScript
now to implement this javascript
function what we can do is we can go to
our projects once again right click add
and add new item and this time we are
going to add our HTML page and I will
leave the name as default but you can
change it and in here in the head you
can first of all add your file so just
use script and then you can add your
script attributes for example first of
all type and type will be 'text slash
javascript and the second will be source
ok and source will be my GS GS ok so
just write my GS GS and close your
script and inside the body what we can
do is once again we can create a script
and once again we will give the type to
it and type will be once again text dot
JavaScript and just close it and in here
we can add an alert function for example
a lot and in here you can give a message
so you can just say a plus B is equal to
and then you can add your function here
so just right
and your function name which is there in
your javascript file which is ad so just
call ad and give two numbers as an
argument for example 50 and second
number will be for example 100 okay and
close these brackets and save your files
and once you saved your files go to your
project and click on your HTML file
which is HTML page dot HTML in my case
right click on it and you just need to
click view in browser okay and whatever
your default browser is it will open it
in that browser so my default browser is
Firefox so it will open it in Firefox so
click it and it will open your web page
in Firefox and you can see this alert a
plus B is equal to 150 which is true so
in this way you can create a Java Script
project in Visual Studio 2015 I hope you
