background and foreground colors in your
jframe so let's get started for example
you want to change the color of this
button you want to change the background
color of this button and also the
foreground what is background and what
is foreground foreground is the text
written on the button and background is
the West except the text so select your
button go to the properties click
background for example I want to change
it
a little reddish color okay you can see
the color change a little and once again
select the button and now I want to
change the foreground so go to
foreground click foreground and change -
maybe
navy blue so color will be changed and
if we want to change the color of our
text field just select it go to the
background select background and I want
to change it to light green so this is
changed and

how to use for the foreground colors and
background colors and jframe maybe in
next tutorial I will tell you how to use
these colors or how to set this color
