video I will show you how you can use
tab control menu strip and tool strip in
your c-sharp application and I'm going
to make a simple project for tabbed
notepad so I will make a tab the notepad
and with the help of your menu strip you
could be able to open new tabs and in
that tab you could be able to open a
text file and all and you could be able
to save files so see what I'm doing and
in at the end of this video a cool
notepad will be prepared so first of all
what I will do is I will go to the tool
box and I will drag and drop menu strip
into my form and I will just make a
little bit bigger and this menu strip
here is like this menu strip so we're
file added and you this is a menu strip
where you could be able to open a new
file and add so like this so here I will
first of all i will make a menu item and
in here first of all i will change it as
file and then i will enter first menu
item which is called new this i will use
to open a new tab okay and second I will
make it as open and third I will make it
as okay this I will do it in second tab
so first menu strip and in second I will
add add it and here I could be able to
cut copy and paste and in this file I
just will add save also okay so I have
this menu strip from which I could be
able to open new tab open the document
save the document and here I could be
able to cut copy and paste now I will
take our tab control and drag and drop
here and I will just first of all delete
these tabs so just click in the middle
and just press delete a middle and press
Delete so I have a blank tab controls
with no tabs and I will just select it
and I will just go to the properties and
I will just dock to the centre so just
like this and it will dock here so it
will look like this now when I press
this new menu item I should be able to
open a new tab here so I will click this
new and double click it and in here I
will add the code for opening a new tab
and in which I want to show the rich
text box because I want a notepad
so in here write this code so right tab
page which is a tab new tab and give it
a variable name TP so tab page for TP is
equal to new tab page and in here give
the title for the tab okay so like this
these are the tabs and this form 1 dot
CS is the title so for new document I am
giving new document title then declare
our rich text box variable
RTB so in that tab I want to show this
rich text box to be able to see the text
so declare a rich text box RTB is equal
to new rich tank box bracket and bracket
closed just copy this RTB variable dot
docx so it will dock this text rich text
box to the tab is equal to dock style
dot fill and then just copy this tab
page the variable dot controls dot add
and I will add this RTB rich text box to
my tab okay and just write tab control
which is the name of this tab so this
one tab control one so tab control one
dot tab pages dot add and then pass this
TP variable which is stamp variable so
now when I run the program and when I
click this new button a new tab is
opening and whose title is new document
once again new so new tab is opening
right now I want
the rich text box so that I could be
able to add text in that rich text box
or and I could be able to cut copy and
paste text so you can go at the top or
you can just go above this function tool
menu strip very function and in here you
will make a new function so this
function write this and just close this
function I will explain it to you so
declare this function private rich text
box and give it a function name and this
private rich text box and this rich text
box will return the rich text box so it
will return something to us
so return for example our tb4 rich text
box okay and this rich text box we will
declare in a while so just make this new
function here and in here we will write
the code now above this return RTB you
write this code so this code is right
rich text box
RTB so this is a rich text box variable
is equal to null so initially we
initialize it as null and then once
again write tab page which is our tab in
our tab pane TP is equal to tab control
one which is the name of this tab pane
so tab control one name which is this
name dot selected tab and after that we
will provide a condition F T
P which is this variable is not equal to
null so if any tab is opened in our tab
control then in the F condition right
RTB is equal to TP dot controls and in
the square bracket right zero as rich
text box
so whatever tab we have selected
it'll dock RTB in that tab and that will
return a rich text box okay so the
selected tab will return the rich text
box okay
so just write this function new function
you need to write this this will not be
automatically generated and now I will
go to my form once again and I will go
here add it and in here I will just
double click this cut menu item and
double click it and I will just copy
this get which text box function and
paste it here in this cut tool strip
menu item click and I will just do dot
cut bracket and break it closed okay so
it will cut whatever text which is
present in the text box which is this
rich text box once again for copy jobs
just double click once again and just
paste it here also rich text box
function dot
copy okay and similarly we will do for
paste also just double click it is the
function rich text box and paste so we
could be able to cut copy and paste from
this rich text box okay so I will run
the program once again I will open a new
tab in here I will add some text okay
and I will open a new tab once again and
I will just select all this and I will
cut when I press this cut it will cut
all the text from here and when I press
here and I will press paste it will
paste all the content from this document
to this document okay you can just press
copy also and just select here and press
paste also so it will paste so now this
is working now we will write the code
for opening a text file into this rich
text box okay so if you are following
these videos in the video number 25 I
think I have shown you how to open a
text file in the rich</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
