released Windows 10 now so in this video
we will look what are the top features
in Windows 10 so the first thing you may
be curious about is the Start menu is it
back or is it not
so let's directly go to this Start menu
button and click it and bam the Start
menu is back and your tile menu is also
there so it's a mix of Windows 7 Start
menu and Windows 8 tile menu and in here
you can search for all your apps which
are installed in your system or you can
search on the basis of the letter they
start with like this okay so for example
I want to search an app which start with
letter M I can choose it and I can see
all the apps which start with M I have
this tile menu here but it's not
covering the whole screen so this is a
very good feature here now the best
thing which I liked about this Start
menu is its resizable so you can resize
it according to your requirement so you
can resize it from the top and you can
even resize it from the side ok so this
is a very good feature
now for example I opened some apps from
here for example this folder Explorer
and I opened this calculator this
calculator also I wanted to show you
that this is totally changed and in here
you can see different you know modes you
can use this calculator now the good
thing is it's also resizable so you can
resize it earlier version of windows
have calculators but they can't be
resized right but this calculator you
can resize and one more feature of this
calculator is when you do something
and it stores the history so you have
the history of all your previous work
and you can even delete your history
also so for example I click this button
and you can delete this history now one
more feature which I want to show you is
this task view here so when I click this
task view I can see all the tasks or all
the apps which are running at this time
in my Windows operating system so this
is also a nice feature and I can also
drag these for example I want to drag
this file explorer on the side then it
automatically aligns all the other apps
on the left-hand side or if I want to
drag it on the right then it will align
all the apps on the right-hand side
right so you can you know resize your
app according to the space available on
your window right so this is also a nice
feature
one more good feature is when you click
this task view you can have multiple
desktop which is very nice so for
example I have a second desktop now
which is totally clean and I can go to
my first desktop from here which in
which I have my calculator and my folder
explorer so in this way I can add
multiple desktop from here and I can
even drag my apps from here so from
first desktop I can drag the app to the
second desktop right so it will go to
the second desktop and you can even
close all these desktop like this okay
now one more very new feature in this
Windows 10 is Microsoft has launched
their new browser which is Microsoft
edge and this is totally different from
Internet Explorer
you also have Internet Explorer here if
you want to search the Internet Explorer
is all
there in windows 10 but there is a new
browser which is this edge browser from
Microsoft which is quite new so for
example I want to see some news I can go
there and very cool feature about this
is you can have this reading View mode
here so you can click this and you will
go to the reading mode like this okay so
when you are reading something you can
enable this reading mode right now one
more very nice feature about this
browser is it has this make a web node
so when you click this button make a web
node you can have these options for
example this pen option is enabled right
now so I can write on my web page like
this so I want to underline this I can
you know underline this this has the
highlight option also so I can highlight
any text I want and this has other
option also for example arrays or nodes
so you can make your own notes so I can
add my own notes here and I can type
here so this is good when you are
studying something or you are learning
something you can make note and you can
even save these nodes on Microsoft edge
so this is really a nice feature you can
exit from here and when you click this
button you have all your regular
features like mail or OneNote and other
features right and this three dots you
have more options like new windows or
print or pin or other options like
settings right so this is totally new
for Windows 10 now one more very good
feature they have is which I liked very
much which I was missing in the older
windows is
the command prompt so you have this
command prompt here and it's resizable
so earlier versions of Windows has
command prompt but it was not resizable
now it's resizable and you also have the
option to copy and paste something so
for example and I have something on my
notepad and I want to paste it on my
command prompt I can just copy and paste
it here so this is also a very nice
feature one more nice feature they have
is this button here which is new button
added to Windows 10 and in here you can
see all your settings and all your
important you know apps which you can
use from here so for example I want to
open all settings from here and it will
open all settings and this is different
from control panel in the user interface
and user experience so for example I
want to personalize my desktop I can do
this so for example I want to change the
Start menu from here to the full screen
menu I can do this
simply when I go to start and I can
enable use start full screen so I can
enable it and when I go to my Start
button once again it will turn to the
full screen right and I can go to once
again to the setting and turn it off and
once again I can click this button here
and it will go back to your normal Start
menu right so you can personalize the
stop according to yourself
for example background images or colors
or lock screen will look like this but
they have some different pictures from
here and other stuff now for example you
want to uninstall some app which you
have installed how you can do it you can
go back to the settings once again and
you can go to system here and you can go
to apps
and features and in here you will be
able to see all the lists and you can
even filter your list from here and
whenever you click on some app for
example this I have the option to move
or uninstall some apps which you add
using a third-party installer then you
can uninstall it for example they allow
to uninstall this microsoft solitaire
collection from here you can press this
button and it will be uninstalled so
these are the new features which I liked
about Windows 10 I hope you have enjoyed
