video I will show you how to use open
file dialog with your visual basic
windows form application so I have this
basic project which have one form and I
have taken a button and I have taken the
text of this button as open file path
and I will also take a text box from
here and place it here and what else I
need is a Open File dialog that will go
to the tool box and search for the Open
File dialog here it is and I will drag
and drop into the form and you will
notice that this will go below your form
a bar because it's not a part of your
form it's not visible in your form okay
and you will notice also that you have
this Open File dialog one name for this
Open File dialog okay now I will select
my button and double click it and here I
will write a condition so I will write
if Open File dialog dot show dialog and
it has automatically created then but I
don't want them is equal to
dialog result dot okay and then if this
is okay so what it this sentence is
doing is it will open the Open File
dialog and if the result of the file
dialog or the path of which we have
selected from the Open File dialog is
valid then it will execute the piece of
the code which we want to execute so
here we will copy the path of the file
we will select from the Open File dialog
and show it in the text box so i will
write text box 1 which is the name of my
text box dot text is equal to hope open
file dialog 1 dot file name okay so now
i have written this piece of code and
let's see what it does so here is the
form I will when I click the button it
opens the Open File dialog and I can
choose any file for example this text
file and when I click open it copies the
path of the file text file into my text
box okay now it's done there are some
other properties which you can set with
this Open File dialog for example just
select your Open File dialog and first
of all we can change the title of the
Open File dialog so for example we write
Open File and you can also set the
initial directory of the file so just go
to the property called initial directory
and here for example I want to set this
initial directory as C file so I can
write C colon and back slash ok this is
the initial directory I want to open one
other thing you can do is you can filter
your files for example you want only one
to open the text file then you can set a
filter for the text file from here also
or you can set the filter for the text
file in this button click event also
what you can do is just double click
this button and just make a space above
this if condition and below this button
click event and just copy this Open File
dialog 1 and right dot filter is equal
to and give this double quotation and
here you can write the filter FOIA foil
so for example you can write text file
this is the the text which is given by
you so you can give any text here but
after this we give this pipe or or sign
and we give star dot txt so what this
means is the open file dialog will
filter all the files which it sees with
the X the extension of dot txt now for
example you want to see also the PDF
files then just write this pipe vertical
pipe once again and write PDF files
which is the optional text which is
given by you so this text can be
anything but the extension so after that
give one more pipe and then write star
dot PDF so it will open the every file
or it will filter every file which has
the extension PDF right now when I run
the program and when I click this button
you can see here it can see the text
file which is said by me and can see the
PDF file which is set by me so you will
be able to only see the text file and
the
PDF files right so let's search if I
have some PDF or text files so I will go
to some folder which can have the PDF
file so I will choose the filter for PDF
files here and now you can see I can see
only the PDF files and not any other
files or if I want to search for the
text file which I don't have here then
it will filter for the text files right
but it's searching for the PDF file
because this folder contains only PDF
files and other files which are not text
files now and if you want to choose all
the files what you need to do is just go
here and give this pipe once again and
write all files and once again the pipe
and write star dot star it will show you
all the files with all the extensions
right once again I will open the file
dialog and now when I choose here all
files will show me all file extensions
this extension or when I go to other
folders it will show me other file text
file extension which I was not able to
see earlier right so you in this way you
can cite the filters now there is one
more good property here in this open
file dialog which is you can select
multiple files so let me demonstrate how
can you select multiple files so just
click this text box and let's make this
text box multi-line okay so it can show
multiple lines
and then just select this open file
dialog and search for the property
called multi select by default it's
false so make it true and now you will
be able to select multiple files now
what you need to do is you can go here
all the codes will remain same but in
here what you can do is instead of open
file dialog one dot file name you just
need to give open file dialog one dot
file names so we have added this extra s
to the file and you can just give plus
sign here so it will just give you the
path one by one or it's better to show
it in the message box then we'll
demonstrate it better so let's make a
message box so I will create a message
box dot show and in the message box we
will give the extension or all the files
which we have selected and now when I
run the program showing me some error
let's see what and the error is okay so
now you can see the error because I am
selecting the multiple files so I need a
kind of a loop to iterate all the files
so what I will do is I will create a for
loop for X is equal to zero to open PI
log file dialog one dot file name dot
count and then just
press ENTER and just copy this message
box message and in this file after this
filenames just passed this variable
access from here right and this should
be file names instead of filename so
this is a very long code so if you want
you can just pause the video and copy
all the code and now when I run the
program and when I click this open file
path I can select multiple files from
you let me select all files first and
for example I want to choose 1 2 3 4 by
pressing ctrl button I can select
multiple files and when I click open
it will show me first file which I have
selected then it will show me the path
of second file which I have selected
then the path of third file and then the
path of 4th file right so in this way
you can also select multiple files with
your Open File dialog right and I have
noticed that it has given me at the
error because this is counting from 0 so
we must minus 1 minus 1 from here
because it was counting Open File dialog
count plus 1 because its starting from 0
ok
so just add this 1 minus 1 after this
count so in this way you can use open
file dialog with your visual basic
windows form application I hope you have
