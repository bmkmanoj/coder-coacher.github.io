show you what is inheritance and how to
use inheritance in C++ so we all know
that C++ is an object-oriented
programming language right and
inheritance is one of the most important
concept of object-oriented programming
so what inheritance does inheritance
allows us to define a class in terms of
another class right so once again
inheritance allows us to define a class
in terms of another class which makes us
easier of it makes it easier to create
and maintain our application and this
end result will increase the user
reusability of code and faster
implementation of our code so let me
give you an example for example you want
to calculate the area of some shapes and
this shape is a polygon right so what
polygon can be polygon can be a
rectangle polygon can be a square
polygon can be even triangle right and
why I am saying this is because each of
the polygons has similar property and
what is the property every polygon
rectangle or square or triangle have
height and width okay
so height and width are common to each
polygon but the calculation of area for
each of the polygons is different right
so what we can do is we can define a
class which have width and height that
we can reuse in other class for example
rectangle square triangle
or any other variable so that it will
reduce our code writing also and it will
use the reusability of our width and
height in our polygons class so let's
see how we can define inheritance
classes in C++ so I have already told
you we have polygons class and in this
class for example I named this class as
shape okay and this class has two member
variables bit can hide as I have told
you and what are these these are
protected members now I think I haven't
discussed about protected access
modifier before so this is the right
time I think so protected member of a
class are reusable or can be used in
other class which is inheriting this
class okay so I'm going to give you a
once I complete this example you will be
able to understand what is protected and
I will repeat this definition once again
and you already know what is public
members public members are available in
other classes freely even though they
are not inherited from the base class so
we have our class which we call as base
class which will be a base class for
rectangle square or triangle classes and
the height and width we want to keep
common to this rectangle square or
triangle class so we have the class
called shape which has protective
members which is height and width and
which has public function function which
sets which sets these the value of width
and height okay so this is
function which take two argument and
whatever argument we pass it in this
function it will set the value of these
two width and height right so this shape
is a base class
now for example I define a class called
rectangle rectangle little bit okay so
rectangle and in this rectangle we want
to calculate the area of the rectangle
okay so this has public function called
void area and what it does it it's just
we are using to calculate the area of
the rectangle right so what we are going
to do we are going to use these width
and height from the shape class to our
rectangle class and how we can use it by
using inheritance and how we can
inheritance I inherit from our shape
loss to our rectangle class okay so the
shape class in our case is called a base
class and rectangle classes in our case
is called the derived class and how we
can inherit from the shape class inherit
these member variables or member
functions in the derived class we just
use call a column this kind of : and
then we define a access modifier which
is public public and then the name of
our class
which we are deriving okay so this kind
of declaration is called inheriting from
the base class to the derived class and
rectangle in this case is called the
derived class and shape in this case is
called the base class from which we are
inheriting and what we are inheriting we
are inheriting height and width of the
polygon okay so we have the function
public function and we want to calculate
the area right so what we can do because
we are inheriting from the shape class
which have height and width define
already we can use all the public and
protected members of the base class in
our derived class we can use this height
and width in our derived class so what
we can do return what is the area of the
rectangle height into width and because
we are inheriting from shape class and
these are the member variable of shape
class we can use it here also height
multiplied by width
okay so inheritance allows us to reuse
the base class member variable which are
either protected or public okay
and it will give you the area of the
rectangle right now in order to
calculate the area let's define an other
class for example triangle and this also
will inherit from the shape class and
you also want to calculate the area of
the triangle so this is a class second
class which is inheriting from the shape
class and in this class also we want to
calculate the area of the rectangle
triangle right
and the area of triangle is height into
width divided by 2 right if you all
agree with me I think so area of the
triangle is width into height divided by
two
right so what we are doing we are
reusing the variables from our base
glass in our derived classes which are
rectangle and triangle now we can just
define the object of a rectangle class
rectangle is equal to rectangle rec okay
and we can define the object of triangle
class triangle
pri for example and what we can do is we
can we use or we can use the function
which is set value which is there in the
shape loss by using these object called
rectangle or triangle because we are
inheriting from our shape class right so
once we write direct which is the object
of rectangle class dot and you can see
here set values is available here right
so we are going to use this and we can
set for example we want to calculate the
area width is equal to 15 and the height
is equal to 10 okay so this will give
you the width and height width this will
set the width and height and I forgot
one thing because we are returning this
we need to return int instead of void
right you may be confused why I'm
writing void here it should be int
because we are returning integer value
in a similar way I can use triangle
object to calculate the area of the
triangle and the member function shut
value is also available here for example
the same values I want to give in the
case of this triangle to calculate the
area of triangle so this set function is
there in our base class but we can reuse
this in our derived class using the
object of our drive classes right now to
calculate the area I can just write our
STD not here yeah standard which is
standard C out and then we can just
print area area rectangle is equal to so
the area of rectangle we can find it
from this rectangle function which is a
area function right area so we can use
this object of this rectangle class
right so our EC dot area right it will
give us the area of the rectangle then I
will just write steep tea and line and
in a similar way I can find the area of
the triangle area triangle okay and this
time we are going to use try object so
let's try and run the program I will
just build it
and yes we want to build it now and it
gives some error let's see what is the
error okay so here I forgot a semicolon
here also at the body semicolon and
let's rebuild it once and clean and
because this has to be clear and we'll
build it we can see area rectangle is
150 which is 10 multiplied by 15 which
is 150 and the area of triangle is 75
which is 15 multiplied by 10 divided by
2 which is 75 okay so this is the
concept of inheritance so once again
what inheritance does inheritance allows
us to reuse our member functions or
member variables from the base class
which is shape in our clip case and we
can inherit from shaped loss because
what we want we want to reuse this
height and width function in our
rectangle class and brand-new class or
even square plus for example and in the
derived class of glass which is
inheriting from our base class is called
the derived class and in this week this
class has the access to all the
protected members and public members of
the base class so what are protected
members protected members are the
members which can be reused in the
derived class ok so class in which we
are deriving from which we are deriving
these are protected but if it was a
private member height and width for the
private member we cannot use it in the
derived class private members are
private to the class they cannot be
reused outside the class
and what our public members public
members can be used everywhere right
even if this rectangle class will not be
derived from the shape class even then
also we will use public members from
shape class but in order to reuse this
height and width we need to define these
members at the protected because we are
inheriting from this and we want to
reuse this height and width right so
this is how you use protected members
protected members are only available in
the derived class and not in any other
class and public members are available
in any class even though it's not
inheriting any class and private members
cannot be used outside your class
because they are private right so this
is the difference between public
protected and private access modifiers
and this is how you can use this
inheritance now how you come to know
that you can use inheritance in your C++
program so see inheritance or always
have the relation of is our relation so
I will write it in double quote is our
relation okay and what is this is our
relation if you can find this relation
for example trying a rectangle is a
polygon right square is a polygon
triangle is a polygon then you can use
inheritance right I will give you
another example for example we have the
base class called animals and we have
derived class dog cat for example so dog
is a is an M animal right
cat is an animal so in this case also we
can use inheritance where our animal
class will be a base class which can be
reused in place of shape and dog and
click Add can be used as the right class
which can inherit from animal class so I
hope you have understood the concept of
inheritance and I hope you have been
doing this video please wait a minute
