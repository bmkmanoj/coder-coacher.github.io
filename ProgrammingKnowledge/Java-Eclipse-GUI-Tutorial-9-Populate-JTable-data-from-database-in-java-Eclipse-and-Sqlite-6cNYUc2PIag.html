last video I have shown you how to open
a second form using your login form in
your Eclipse Java GUI application in
this video I am going to show you how
you can load your data in a J table in
this second form so for example you have
this data in the table in the database
right I want to show all this data in my
J table in my Eclipse cui how can I do
this so I will start with this video by
just removing this label which I have
used in the last video and now my form
employee info form is blank okay so I
will resize this form I will resize this
form and in here I will take a button to
load the table and I will take a J table
okay so search for J table here it is
and the trick of using J table in the
form is just select this J table and
then make us big square here okay
otherwise if you just select this table
and draw a select here click here then
it will not be visible so select your
table and make us big square okay now
what I am going to do is I will
right-click my table so I will
right-click my table and surround my
table with J scroll pane okay so right
click once again right-click the table
and go to surround width
surround width and then surround with
Java X dot swing dot j scroll pane so I
have surrounded my table by J scroll
pane now what I can do is I can change
the name of this button as
button load
table or whatever you feel like and I
will also change the text of this button
as load employee data for example okay
you can even change the name of your
table but I will leave it as default so
this table is inside your scroll pane
right so whenever you select your table
you will see the scroll pin because your
table is inside the scroll pin right so
now once you have these both things I
will just double click my button and I
have reached to the source code of this
button action perform method but first
of all I need to connect this form with
the database right as I have done with
login dot Java class right so we have
connected this frame to the SQLite
class which we have created so this
employee info dot Java file also we need
to connect with the SQLite class and how
we can do it just go to our excel is
collide connection class and take all
the import copy all the imports from
here which is import Java dot SQL dot
star import Java X dot swing dot star
and just go to your employer form and
paste these two imports here also the
second thing I have done is I need to
make the connection with the class so I
need to declare the connection object so
go to your constructor constructor of
the class is the same name as your class
name so just search for the method which
has the same name as your class and this
is my constructor just go above this and
I will declare a connection to my
sqlite class of for example so alright
connection connection is equal to null
so this is our connection object I am
made and this connection class belongs
to the java dot SQL dot connection class
ok so you see here Java dot SQL dot
connection class this class now go
inside your constructor which is the
same name as if los just inside and copy
this connection object paste it here is
equal to the name of your SQLite
connection class my escolar connection
class name is SQLite connection dot Java
which we had created earlier SQLite
connection dot the connection method
inside the connection class right if you
have remembered now I will once again go
to my load table and just click this
button once again and I reach to the
action perform method of this button
click event and then here I will write
the code so what I need to do is I need
to write the code for this button action
perform so what I am going to do is
first of all is the try catch block so I
will just copy the blank try catch block
from here and inside this try block I am
going to write the code first to create
the query and I will pass this query to
the connection so I will write the
connects query first so string which is
where is a string variable so
query is equal to double quotes and
semicolon and here I will pass the query
which is select star from your table
name my table name in my databases
employee info so I will write it here
select all from this employee info okay
now next in the last line I will pass
this query to the prepared statement so
I will create a create a prepared
statement prepared statement PST is
equal to then take the name of the
connection object which is connection
from here which we have created above so
connection dot prepared statement we
need to write it here
so let us copy the connection dot
prepared statement and just pass your
query here okay
so this query string will go here now we
will declare a result set result set
and which will be my RS variable is
equal to and then PST my prepared
statement object dot execute query so
this will execute the query and pass the
result to the result set which is RS
right now I will take the name of my
table so first of all you once you have
this result set you can load the table
in different ways and there this will be
a long task to load this table model or
to convert this result set into a table
model and load this so what is the easy
way of doing this is you can download a
class jar file which is free or freely
available on internet and I use this
class to make my model for the table
using this result set so I am going to
show how you can download this class
just go to your browser and search for
RS - XML dot jar free download okay so
search for RS - XML dot jar free for
download and the first link you will
find here is from sourceforge.net okay
so go to this source was not net and I
will just the pass or paste the link in
the description so you can directly
click this link and come to this site
and you just need to download this RS -
XML dot jar and what this jar is it
contains a class which helps us to
convert our result set to our data model
it is just like that okay so once you
have this RS to XML jar file in your
downloads here so I have this RS - XML
file here then what I can do is I can
just go to my project Explorer here
and in this in this resources folder
which I have created earlier which
contains SQLite JDBC or other jar file
which I have downloaded earlier I can
drag and drop this RS to XML in this
resources folder just drag and drop
there and once you have dragged and
dropped there and click OK this RS to
XML file will go into this resources
folder now once you have this RS to XML
dot jar in resources folder go to JRE
system library here right like this and
go to build path and go to configure
build path and in here in the library
tab just add a jar which is there in
your source file which is RS - XML dot
jar file click OK click OK now this jar
file is added to your project and you
can easily use the classes from the jar
file in your project once again in my
button click event which is load table
button click event here I have written
this code I have created a query
prepared statement and passed the query
to this connection prepared statement
and this prepared spit statement I have
executed and I have this result set in
the result set right what I can do next
is I can copy the name of the table my
table name is let us see what is the
name of the table so the table name was
table here you see
a table name of a stable okay so if you
do not find the table name just go at
the start of your class where public
loss declaration is there your class
name extend jframe and in here you will
find your table name which is stable
right in our case just come to your
button action perform method here page
the name of the table dot add or not add
but set model table dot set model if we
have this and in here we will paste our
model so what this jar will help us to
use this result set convert our model so
what we can use is DB utils this DB
utils is a is a class inside this RS to
XML sprite so just hover over this and
you will find or let me pause the video
and see okay so this DB utils is a class
inside this RS to XML jar file so I will
just write this TB utils like this so
just write DB utils dot result set to
table model okay and this DB util first
it will show an error and when you hover
over this DB util so just go and hover
your mouse above this error for DB util
and you will see you need to import this
net dot protein net dot SQL file so just
click this import here just click this
and what this will do it will import
this class in here so net dot whatever
this is called Pro te a NIT dot SQL dot
DB util it will import this and then
your error in the button action perform
will go okay so now you you have
converted with the help of this class
your result set into a model which your
table takes and then this result set
will be converted to model and then you
can run your program now I will run my
program once again
connection successful username and
password we gave the user name and the
password login successful and then I can
see the second form and when I click
this load table just see here what
happens it says something let us see
what is the error so I will look at the
error SQL error SQL error for missing
database okay so I know why we are
facing this error I have created this
connection class I think but yeah I am
doing this also so let me find the error
and I will come to you okay so I found
the error my query here is wrong I have
written select star form it should not
be formed but from fr om okay so now I
have corrected this query which is
select star from it is not formed but
from your table name once again I will
run the program
and I will see this second form and when
I click this load table or load employ
data I see my data from the data base in
this table right so I will check with my
original data base which is this one and
you can see here the data matches
employee ID 1 2 3 4 name mark John Julie
Peter age 35 25 30 21 you can see here
35 25 32 so I have this data in the
table ok but for example for some reason
you do not want to show username and
password because whenever you click this
button it's also showing username and
password but you do not want to show it
what you can do you can change the query
which you have written here select star
from employee info instead of star which
which query all the data instead of star
just Y select and whatever column you
want to select for example you just want
to show a ID name surname and age just
select these column names just right
select PID comma name comma surname
comma age for example ok select all the
name separated by commas select the ID
name surname and age from your table
name and once again run the program
and now when I load this I will only see
a ID name surname and age which I have
passed here a ID name surname and age
right so in this way you can load your
data in J table from your database I
