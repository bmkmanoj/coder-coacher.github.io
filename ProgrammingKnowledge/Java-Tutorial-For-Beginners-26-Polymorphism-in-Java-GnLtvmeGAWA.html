tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will
discuss what is polymorphism in Java and
how we can use polymorphism in Java by
an example so what is polymorphism
polymorphism is the ability of an object
to have different form so polymorphism
literally means the word polymorphism
means having different forms and
whenever you define an object class
object I should say and its property or
its quality of having many forms is
called polymorphism and how we can make
our classes polymorphism or how you can
define an object which follows
polymorphism I am going to give an
example so I have four classes define
one is called the bank class which will
be my base class okay so there is a bank
class which is my base class and this
contains three or a one method and this
method just gives the rate of interest
so I define this method as get interest
rate and because it sort of base class I
return I am returning zero as an
interest rate okay I also have defined
bank underscore ABC class Bank
underscore de F class and Bank
underscore XYZ class okay so if you
don't know how to make a class just
right-click new and go to class and in
here give the name of the class so this
is how I have created these classes okay
so one is called bang class which will
be my main class second class is called
Bank underscore ABC which extends from
Bank class because Bank our class is our
base loss and Bank ABC is our derived
class and this also contains the same
method and but this returns the rate of
interest or this Bank has the rate of
interest is equal to five percent for
example okay
Bank de f which also extends from Bank
loss have the rate of interest six
percent so I have defined a method here
which returns six simply okay and Bank
class XYZ which is also extending from
Bank so this is a derived class and this
is a base class also have the same
method get' interest rate and the
interest rate in this Bank is ten
percent so I have the same method in all
the four classes yet interest rate and
the only difference between these this
function is the rate of interest banks
Bank itself has zero Bank ABC has five
percent interest rate Bank de F has six
percent interest rate and Bank XYZ has
ten percent interest rate now there is a
property in Java called polymorphism by
which you can define the reference or
you can point the reference to a base
class to any object of the derived class
so what I mean by that is so when a
reference object or reference of parent
class points to the object of the
subclass it is called a casting and this
is the basic you know extract of
polymorphism
so our
we will define the reference of our bang
class so we will just define bank b1 is
equal to or Bank ABC
is equal to so this is the reference of
bang class which will point to the
object of bank ABC which is a child
class right like this
and this is what we call polymorphism
when a object can have different form
so here the object of Bank class is
having the form of Bank ABC right so the
reference of Bank lass is pointing to
the object of Bank ABC class in the same
way we can define
different objects so here we can define
bank de F and here also bank d e f and
bank X Y Z and Bank
x y e okay so and let us see if it has
the same name or not here
and Bank XYZ it should be underscore
right
okay so we have defined three references
of Bank class itself which points to the
subclasses or object of subclasses
reference ABC points to the object of a
bank ABC class reference d EF points to
the reference or object of d EF class
and reference XYZ points to the object
of XYZ class
and I can call all these method get'
interest rate from all these references
right so I can just write this for
control shift and in the same way I will
do it three times and first time I will
take ABC as my object and I will just
call get interest rate and in the second
statement I will paste de F dot get
interest rate and third time I will
paste XYZ as my instance and I will call
get interest rate okay and when I run
the program I get 5 6 and 10 so this
type of reference defining reference
from the object of subclasses is called
polymorphism and all the you know member
function are available through this
reference so this get instant interest
rate are available in here in this class
also in this class also in this class
also and this Bank ABC gives us 5%
interest rates which returns 5 Bank de F
gives us 6 percent interest rate so it
returns 10 and Bank XYZ gives us 10
percent interest rate so it returns 10
but the interesting thing here here is
all are the object of Bank yeah all or
all references are pointing to different
objects but all objects are from Bank
class right so this is how probably
morphism work in java i hope you have
