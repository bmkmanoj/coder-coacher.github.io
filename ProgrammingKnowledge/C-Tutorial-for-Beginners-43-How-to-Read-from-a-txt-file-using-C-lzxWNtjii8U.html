you how to create a text file using C++
and how to write into that text file
using C++ now in this video I'm going to
show you how to read from a text file
and show it on your terminal using C++
so this was the code I have shown you in
the last video and I have shown you
these three classes which are used to
create or read from a file and I have
shown you whenever you want to write
into the file you use this class called
web stream and whenever you want to read
from a file you need to use if' stream
class so in this video we are going to
use this class called if' stream which
is used to read the data from a text
file so let's get started I will just
comment this earlier code and I will
write a new code to read from our text
file now I'm going to use the text file
I have created in the last video to read
from it so this was the text file I am
now in my project folder and this is the
text file in my project folder
they just present in your thread project
folder and this contains four lines
which are like this and I want to read
each line and I want to print each line
on my terminal how can I do it so let's
see how can we do it so first of all as
I have told you you need to use if'
stream but before that I'm going to
declare a string variable to store every
line which we are going to read so what
I am going to do
going to include one more class which is
called string which will help us to use
strings
okay so just include string and I'm
going to add a string variable string
and I will call it line okay and in the
next line to read the file I'm going to
use if' stream plus and once again I'm
going to name my file as file underscore
for example this depends upon you
whatever name you want to give to your
file you can give it but now the text
file name this text file name should be
same as present in your project folder
over wherever your file is okay so my
text file name is my text and when I go
to the property I can see this is a dot
txt file right so I'm going to just take
the same name as my file name and then
what I need to do I need to open this
file so I will just check if this file
is open so this line has opened this
text file but I'm want to make sure that
file is open and then only I will read
the data from this text file so I will
check in the next last video also I have
shown you this method to check where the
file is open or not so you just need to
take the name of the file and then write
dot if under soup or open and this
method will return a boolean value
so it will give you true or false if the
file is open it will return true or or
in any other case will it will return
false okay and at the last of the file
when you are done with reading you need
to close the file so in order to avoid
any mistakes I will just close my file I
will write the code to close the file
first and then we are going to do
perform our code inside this if
condition now in order to read the file
line by line there is a function in the
string class in the string class called
get line so I will use a while loop
while and there is a function call get
line which takes two arguments this is
the this is the overloaded function and
what we can do is it we can pass two
argument in this first is the file
instance we have created which is this
one file underscore and the second
argument is the line which is a string
variable right and what this getline
function will do is it will read this
fine line by line and then transfer into
this string variable line by line okay
so what it's going to do it will read
the first line it will transfer into
this variable called line and whatever
we want to do with this line that we can
do and then it will go on reading line
by line until the end is reached
okay and what we are going to do in this
while loop is we are just going to
output these lines so I will just use
FTD see out and then I will just print
this line which is our string where you
bill and then I'm going to just a print
next line so I can just use this
backslash n to change the line right if
you remember in the last video I have
shown you this okay now in any other
case if the file is not open I can just
so show L and I can just print out the
message that file is not open right so I
can just print out here file is not open
okay now I'm going to run this program
and let's see if it gives the same
result
they just present in the file or not so
our file is this one you can see here
and I will close the file
to avoid any clashes and I will compile
my program first which is compiled fine
and I'm going to run my program and it
reads the same data which is there in
your text file it's just this one right
so this is one method to read line by
line from a text file now for example
you want to read a custom data from a
file for example we have a custom data
for example we have a student name whose
ID is 1 name is mark and for example his
age is whatever 14 ID 2 and named Tom
and the age is 15 3 name is
John and the age is 14 for example now
this is a custom data which is present
in my text file whose first word is a
integer second word is a string and
third word is a integer once again this
can be double float or anything right
and I will just save this data here so
data is now saved and I will just close
this file and to confirm this I'll
reopen this and start is there I want to
read this data one by one how can I read
this I will just I can just create I'm
going to just delete these two lines and
what I can do is I can create three
variables in ID a which is an integer
then FTD string and this will be the
name of the student and in age this is
the age of the student and instead of
using this getline function which was
the inbuilt function in string class
what we can do is we can just use this
file and if you remember when we are
writing in the file we use this kind of
angle brackets right now in order to
read from a file we will just revert
these angle bracket as we do in C input
or CIN so just use file and then just
use these angle brackets which we use in
C in and to write the data we you
who's the angle bracket which we use in
C out right to remember this just
remember that whenever you want to write
you use the angle bracket similar to C
out and whenever you want to read from a
text file you'll use the angle bracket
which you use in C in okay so file and
then give your ID here ID variable once
again give the name variable and once
again gave the age variable okay and
what will this will do is it will also
read your text file line-by-line and the
first word will be stored in this ID
variable the second word will be stored
in the name variable and the third word
will be stored in the age variable like
this and in order to print this just you
can just print out this using C out and
here you can just print our ID and you
can just give the space here in a
similar way just print name give this
space here and then print the edge and
then we will change the line okay now
I'm going to compile this program
hopefully it will not give any error and
when I run this program that gives me
the same data which is there in this
text file right so in this way this is
the second
way of reading customs ah now this data
it's not necess it's not you know
mandatory to the spaces here you can use
either comma for example like this and
whenever you compile and run the program
it will give the comma separated values
like this or you can give any other
values for example pipe or any other
value for example hash and ash thirdly
give this hash is in between them so in
this way you can read the customer dot
off from the text file and show it on
the terminal so I hope you have
understood this concept of reading the
text file using C++ and I hope you
