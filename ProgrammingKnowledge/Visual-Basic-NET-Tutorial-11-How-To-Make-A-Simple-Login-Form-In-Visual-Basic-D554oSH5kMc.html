last video I have shown you how to link
a second forum with your first forum so
I have made a small little project in
which when I click this button it opens
the second forum now in this video I
will show you how to create a simple
very simple login application with your
visual basic windows form application so
let's get started it really it will be a
very basic login application and in the
future I will also show you how to
create a login page with the help of a
database
it may be MySQL database or SQL Server I
will show you all but this is for very
beginner level so let's get started I
have this button which I take from the
last video and one more thing I will
take here is a text box so let me take
our text box from here and our label
okay so I have text box a label and a
button I will change the labels text as
password and I will change the text of
this text box as I will change name of
this text box as text box Pass hope text
box password and I will change the text
of this button as
log in for example so when I click this
button and when I enter some password it
should open a second form so just double
click this button once again and in the
last video I have shown you how to
simply just open the second form so I'm
going to delete this and I will say if
and make a bracket and I will say if
textbox password dot text is equal to
double quotes and give any password
which you want to match for example I
give the password one two three four
five and then I will say here we'll
right then and then and if and in here
between I will open the second form so I
will write form two dot show and bracket
so it will validate this password
whatever you enter in the text box and
if it's correct it will open the second
form else what I will do is I will show
a message that my password is not
correct right so I will say
password is not correct for example okay
so now when I run the program and when I
enter some random text and when I click
login button it says me password is not
correct and when I click enter some real
or a valid password which is one two
three four five and when I click this
login button it opens this second form
now for example you want to hide this
form when second form opens so when this
form opens you want to hide the first
form how you can achieve that simply you
need to add one more line of code so go
inside this if condition if password is
true of whatever you enter in the text
box is true then just below this form
two dots or just write me dot hide so me
refers to the form itself
it's like saying this in c-sharp or the
it's like saying this in C++ also so
when now I run the program and when I
and valid password for example one two
three four five and when I click this
login button you will see the first form
is disappeared right so in this way you
can link the second form to first form
and you can make a login application a
very simple and basic login application
with the help of this Visual Basic
those form application in the future
videos maybe after some some of the
videos I will also show you how to
connect a database and then also I will
show you how to create a login page
using whatever is saved in your database
and how to validate the database
password with the help of Visual Basic
so stay tuned and please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
