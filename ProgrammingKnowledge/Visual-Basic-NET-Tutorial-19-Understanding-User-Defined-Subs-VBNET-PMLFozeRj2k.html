video I will show you how to use
user-defined subs with your visual basic
windows form application so I have
created this simple project Visual Basic
windows form application project and I
have taken a button and I have changed
the text of this button as execute sub
so make a project and just take a button
here and if you want you can change the
text of this button and now I will
double click this button and I reach to
the button click event of this button
and if you notice that this button click
is also a kind of a sub so what is a sub
a sub is a code or piece of code which
executes when you call it from some
other function or other sub or from some
class so let me show you how to create a
sub first so you can create sub in
between from the starting of the class
to the end of the class but not in
between some other sub so just if you
want to create sub just just we will go
below our previous sub riches button
click and I will right
private sub and you give the name to
your sub so I give the name to my sub as
ad and you give these bracket and when
you press ENTER it will automatically
create the end of the sub okay so for
example I will create two integer
variables
so I will write dem a as integer okay
and in the same way I will just copy
this and paste it here once again and
this second will be a integer B and I
will just paste it once again and I will
name it as the integer sum for example
okay and what I want to do is I want to
show this sum in the form of a message
so I will write message box dot show and
in the message box I write here
the addition so the I will write sum is
equal to a plus B and I will just copy
the sum and I will say the sum of
to number is and I'll give this and sign
anion with some okay so now I want this
piece of code to be executed when I
click this button so what I need to do
is I just need to call this sub from my
button click event so once again I go to
this button double click it and I just
call this function or sub I say add and
this ad is same name as this ad now when
I run the program and when I click this
button it says sum of two number is zero
because we haven't initialized our
integers okay so I will give some value
to the integer for example some value
and to the second integer also I will
give a value and now when I run the
program you see it will give the sum of
these values and you also observed that
you haven't written any code for the
addition of these numbers you have just
called the sub function from here and it
executes the whole code which is there
in the sub now why and when you use sub
then you have or when you want to
execute the same code again and again in
your program then you use subs so when
you use a same code or you when you you
want to use same kind of code again and
again more than months in your program
then you use sub so that
you just need to create this function or
sub once and you can call it with this
one line of code this whole code you
don't need to write again and again this
one line will execute all the code so
that's why we use subs now one more
thing with sub is you can pass
parameters with sub so what I mean by
parameters so we have created this sub
and now sometimes we want that this
value should be defined by the user and
this should not be fixed so how can I do
this the way we can do this is for
example I will take two text boxes text
box one and text box two and in this sub
function I will pass two parameters or
two arguments so in this brackets or
parentheses you write by Val
and then you write the name of your
value so for example I write a as
integer and I will pass second argument
by well also and B as integer so you
notice that I have written by well
declaration here by well means by a
value so we are passing these argument
by value and now we are not going to use
this predefined integer we just delete
it and we will pass this with the help
of this these parameters so we have
already called this function or sub here
and we just need to pass these arguments
so how we pass these arguments we pass
this argument with the help of these
textboxes so the name of the text box is
textbox 1 so I will just pass this
textbox 1 dot txt as a first argument
and you notice it's taking two arguments
so and the second argument would be
textbox 2 which is my name of the
textbox - okay so I have passed these
two arguments whatever I have I will
write in the textbox 1 and whatever I
will write in the textbox to this
function add will take these two numbers
and then it will perform the addition
like this and give the result and show
us the message so now let's try and run
the program and I will write for example
34 here 45 here and I say execute sub
and I will click this button and it
gives me the sum of these two numbers so
R sub become flexible in the way that we
can pass the parameters user-defined
parameters from these text boxes so I
think you have understood the basic
concept of sub one more thing I want to
tell you is we have used this private
with our sub you can also use the public
function with a public method with the
this sub and what this public and
private tells the code is or tells this
form is that if you declare this sub as
a public then you can use this sub ad
function to the other visual basic form
class but if this sub which is created
by you is private then you cannot use it
in other visual basic classes so this
private and public you need to choose
carefully whenever you define yourselves
so I hope you have understood the basic
concept of subs in the next video I will
show you how to use functions and how
functions are different from subs so
stay tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
