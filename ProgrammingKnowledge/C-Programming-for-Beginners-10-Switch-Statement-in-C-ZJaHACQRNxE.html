C programming for beginners and in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
use switch statement in C now in the
last two videos I have been showing you
how to use f else conditions and
multiple airfoils conditions in C and
switch statements are also condition
based statements but they are little
different in a sense that you can use
conditions with switch statement but
conditions must be constant conditions
so let me give you an example and then
you will understand how a switch
statement works in C so first of all we
will see how switch statements are
declared in C okay so the basic syntax
of switch statements is like this okay
so I will just delete this for now and
so that you can you know see what is the
basic switch statement code so switch
statements start from this switch
keyword and then comes these two
brackets and in here comes the
expression expression is something which
you want to you know validate on the
basis of some case right now inside
these two curly braces comes some cases
so case and then some constant
expression I will give you an example
this is just the syntax I want to show
you so case and then comes some
condition or constant expression right
and then comes this colon and in side or
down under this case comes the statement
or the code which you want to execute
here right now
after this code
is executed you break the switch
statement with this break keyword so
this is an optional keyword sometimes
you do not need this break sometimes you
need this break and I will tell you
where exactly you need this break and
where you do not need this break right
in the same way you can have multiple
cases inside your switch conditions and
whenever you know whatever condition is
not covered by your case is covered by
this default so if none of the case is
true this will be executed which is or a
default case so default case starts with
this keyword default colon and then your
case now let's see an example and then
we will be able to understand it
much better so for example we want to
calculate the grade of a student and on
the basis of grade we want to give some
message or print some message for
example int and let's say student scores
some marks so I will name my variable S
marks and on the basis of marks we want
to decide if the student is excellent or
whatever good or very good or he is code
poor grades okay so now we use switch
statement switch and I told you then
comes then an expression and this
expression will be our mark mark because
on the basis of this mark we are going
to evaluate some cases and on the basis
of cases we will execute some code but
first of all let
assign some value to mark for example
90% of mark or 80 or whatever you want
to decide right now
mark is our expression which we will
evaluate the value of mark we will
evaluate and then comes these two curly
braces and inside these curly braces
comes the case right case and then your
mark value so different value of mark we
can evaluate right now mark is equal to
90 but for example mark can be 80 or 70
or 60 or whatever right so for example
mark is equal to 90 then we want to
print print print F and we want to print
this is an excellent great right
excellent okay and then the same
semicolon and then we will break okay
now comes the second case for example
this in the in this case we want to
evaluate mark is equal to 80 right and
let me give some indents here and when
grade is 80 or for example 75 we will
say that he has code very good grade for
example okay so we will print instead of
excellent we will print very good okay
in the similar way you can just add a
break here and break is nothing but a
keyword which breaks this switch case
and I will explain you what it does
but let me add two more conditions and
these two conditions will be first s 60%
of mark and then we will say good the
grades are good or we will say 50% of
mark and or 40% of mark and we will say
grades are okay or poor or whatever this
is just an example or otherwise we will
say if the grades are not ninety or
seventy-five or sixty or forty there can
be grade which is not covered by these
cases then we will have the default case
default and this case covers any value
other than covered by these cases right
so we will print grade on
I'm available okay so let's you know run
this program and let's see how it works
okay so I will just compile and run this
program and it says excellent right and
that is what it must do because you see
marks is equal to 90 so it's a science
mark is equal to 90 right and then we
are checking the value of 90 using this
switch statement and because mark is 90
it goes to this case case where mark is
equal to 90 then it prints this message
and what this break does is if the case
is fulfilled then we want to break out
of this switch statement and we won't do
not want to execute any other statement
other than whatever is fulfilling our
case right so it prints excellent and it
breaks out of the switch statement and
whenever your C program sees this break
statement it jumps out of your switch
case right at the end of the switch case
okay now for example our marks are 75
then let's see what is the answer or
what is what it prints it prints very
good which is true right so in the case
of 75 it mark is equal to 75 minutes so
it search for the case for 75 it's if
the case 75 is present it will print
your value or it will execute whatever
code you will write here and then it
will see this break keyword and it jumps
out of the switch statement but the
important thing here is the case 90 is
not executed because the code inside
this case 90 is not execute
because the case is not 90 marks mark is
75 the value of mark we are checking
right so value of mark is not ninety
value of mark is not sixty value of not
mark is not 40
but value of mark right now is 75 that
is why we have executed dis code or si
has executed this code but other codes
are not executed okay so on the basis of
these cases you can define multiple
cases and whatever case is fulfilled at
a time that code will be executed or
code inside that case will be executed
otherwise code will not be executed okay
now you may ask that this code can be 95
uggs also and then also the student has
holder excellent marks right so in order
to do this for example for covering 95
grid or other grades for example like
this and if the grade is 95 still we
want to print this excellent grade so
what you do you just use ks95 and you do
not execute any code inside this case
and you do not give any break here so
this means whenever you give a case
without any code and without any break
here it this means that this and this
are the conditions which are covered and
if either of those conditions are
fulfilled then this code will be
executed okay so if the mark is equal to
95 it sees here that case 95 and jumps
to the next case and it's because it is
not
breaking anywhere so it jumps to the
next case right if there will be a break
here this kind of break keyword and it
jumps out out of your switch code but
because we are not giving here this
break it jumps to the next condition and
executes the next statement we just
print excellent so let us see what
happens when grades are 95 and we will
compile our code and it says excellent
and this is what we were expecting
because there is no break break inside
this case 95 so it jumps to the next
case in the series of cases well in this
same way you can provide same cases for
for example 97 or even 85 you can do 85
here 85 and all those four cases will
covered or will be covered by this
statement okay in a similar way whenever
you want to have very good grade you can
cover 70 or 75 also so 70 or 75 without
giving this break keyword break keyword
break your statement and go out of your
statement okay for example grade is
right now 75 75 and we will compile and
run the program it says very good right
so you can cover different cases and
execute a same statement using or
without using this break keyword okay so
this is how you use switch cases in C
programming I hope you have understood
the basic concept of switch cases and I
hope you have enjoyed this video
