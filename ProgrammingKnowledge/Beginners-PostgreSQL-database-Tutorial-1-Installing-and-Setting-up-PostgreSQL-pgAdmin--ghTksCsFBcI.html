tutorial on post gray SQL database
tutorial for beginners and in this video
I'm going to show you how you can
download and install post gray SQL in
your Windows operating system and what
is post gray database post great
database is a open source object
relational database which is very
popular amongst developer and the Opus
open-source community so it's an open
source database management system so
let's see how we can download and
install post gray so just go to your
favorite browser and just search for
post gray SQL there and the first link
you will find here is PostgreSQL so just
click that link and in here you need to
go to downloads and you need to choose
whatever operating system you have it
has installation for bsd linux mac OS
solaris and windows right now I'm
running a Windows operating system so I
will go to windows click windows and in
here the graphical installer for post
gray include post gray SQL Server and PG
admin 3 so we need this one so I will
just click this and now we are in
download area so in here we need to
download this post gray SQL nine point
three point one installer ok just click
this one and in here you will find
different operating system downloads and
different flavors of operating systems
for downloads so if you have a Windows
just to these windows downloads and
depending upon the flavor of your
windows it can be 64-bit or 32-bit how
can you check if you
32-bit or 64-bit operating system just
go to your Start button here right-click
your computer and go to the properties
and in here you will find the system in
the system type the bit I have 64 bit
operating system right so I will
download this 64-bit operating system
for download this for 64-bit operating
system and right now the latest download
is nine point three point four so I will
download it download this and download
will start so you see a download had
started and will take couple of minutes
because it's about 50 MB file so in the
meantime I will explain you why and
where you can use a PostgreSQL you can
use the this post for a SQL database
first of all what is the database
database is a organized collection of
data so you can use this PostgreSQL with
many languages like c c++ java dotnet
Perl or any other popular language which
you can imagine you can connect this
posterior database and you can you know
keep the record of your whatever data
using those language in post gray SQL
database and you can you know create a
document based management system or the
software which depend upon some database
you can create it with the other
language and this post grave SQL okay so
our download is completed I will click
this exe file here and start my
installation wizard
so the installation wizard has been
started extracting the file and now we
are starting the setup so just click
Next and this is the default location
value of post grade will be installed so
just leave it as default if you have
enough strong reason to change the
location so I will leave it as default
and this is the data directory where
your all the data will be saved so I
will also leave it as default and in
here this is the important step here you
need to give the password which you want
to set to open your database connection
so to the password you can remember and
remember this password for the post gray
SQL database having give the password
and we type my password and I will click
Next
and this is the default port on which
your post gray server will listen so
this is the default port which is PI 4 3
2 so I will leave it as default click
Next and this will be e fault local and
setup is now ready to begin installation
so I will just click Next and my
installation has started ok
so I was talking about the databases
post gray one of is one of the most
popular open-source databases in the
recent time one of the most popular
relational a
shanell database is also MySQL and it's
in the recent time it has become more
popular than post wave but the post way
is also very popular amongst developer
community and it's a server-based
thought of it some of the databases are
not server based what is the meaning of
server base is that there is a server
where your database or your database
data will reside and you need to connect
to that server in order to fetch the
data from the server it can be on your
computer it can be on some other
computer and you can connect to that
computer why are some networking tool
and then you can you know fetch the data
or save the data in that database using
that server on the other hand there are
some server less databases like SQL and
for those you don't need any servers
they are you know local databases so you
can transfer them from one place to
another or you can copy them from one
place to another without worrying for
the server but Postgres
SQL is a server based database okay so
still it's taking some time so some more
details on proscribe SQL as I have told
you that post gray you can connect it
with the languages like Java C++ or C or
dotnet c-sharp
we will basic and the basic you know
need of this database is to maintain in
or keep the data so for example there is
some application in which you want to
keep the employee information or class
information school class information you
can keep that information in the
database and whenever you need the
information you can fetch it from the
database so that's why we use databases
now our database installation is
complete so finish this one
you can even uncheck this but I will
leave checked and I will click finished
and in here it's you know it's asking
for the server we leave it as default
this one next downloading applications
these are add-ons which you can add for
different functionality but this we can
do later also so I want to keep as basic
as possible this one so you know you can
choose some some driver
database drivers from here and the
server whatever you want but yeah most
of them I will leave as unchecked
because I can do it later just the basic
installation I want okay
and next and once this will complete I
will be ready for the installation okay
so next so this is some stake builder
it's downloading but the basic
installation of the postre is complete
so I will this skip in solution because
I have checked that stake build the
download and install I don't want to do
this right now because our basic
installation of post weighs over so I
will skip installation
click Next and finish so once you have
downloaded this pose for a SQL you will
be able to see this PG admin 3 in your
Start menu here otherwise if you do not
see this you can go to all programs and
search for this post way SQL whatever
version you have downloaded and in here
also you will be able to see this course
PG admin 3 tool so we will start this
and in here it has this database right
so we can refresh our database or
connect to the database and in here you
need to give the password you have you
know setup air while you are installing
for space so I will give the same
password and I will save the password
and click OK and click OK
so now I am connected to my post gray
you know localhost server ok and this
has some default database will be in
here in the - the base section we are
going to create the databases and we are
going to you know create tables inside
databases and wait schemas there ok so
you see here a database can contain
different objects but the most important
object of this database is the tables
here and this we will see how to create
the postpaid database and create tables
inside those databases and how to query
those databases in the further videos
but yeah i want to show you the basic
installation in this video so that's why
I have shown you that so stay tuned for
the next video on PostgreSQL tutorial
and till the next time please rate
