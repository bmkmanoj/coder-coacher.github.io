video I will show you how to show a
reference line on your chart for example
this reference line or required level
line I will show you how to show this
type puff line on your bar chart or any
kind of chart you want to make and if
you want to give this kind of reference
lines shown by black color and how could
you make it I will show you today so
let's get started sorry so what I have
right now is this frame which I have
prepared for making charts and when I
press this frame it shows these kind of
a bar chart which shows pressure and
different parameters between 0 200 and I
want to set up a reference line which
should indicate me the level which is
required for these values so for example
I want a reference line at 90 and I want
to see that every value is above 90 or
not so for this chart I will prepare a
reference line so let's see how do we do
it exit first of all my program
and I will go to my frame I will right
click it go to events action I should
perform and these chart for making chart
how to make a Jeffrey chart I have shown
you from the video number 62 and above
this kind of chart bar chart line chart
pie chart how to make them I've shown
near about 62 with your number so if you
don't know how to make a Jeffrey chart
go there and this method is applicable
on every kind of a chart for example bar
chart or line chart if you want to show
our reference line you can do it with
the help of this method so what you need
to do is go to the bottom of your code
this is the code we write for making a
chart so if you don't know this code you
can see from video number 62 6260 for I
have shown you wherever you find the
Jeffrey chart tutorial of mine I have
shown these kind of code there so go and
see there and what you need to do is I
have written somewhere in my code
category plot P is equal to charge dot
chart get category chart plot and P dot
set mean this is not required but you
can write this so main thing you need to
search in your code is this line
category plot
and the variable named after this
category Lord variable name we need this
P variable of category plot to write our
code so go just below that and write the
code for the value marker or the
difference line so right value
marker is equal to marker marker is a
variable name you can name it anything
is equal to nu once again copy this
value marker and paste it here and
bracket and bracket flows it will show
some error because I haven't fixed my
import yet I will fix my import at the
last so write this and in this box you
need to write your a reference value so
this takes upload or integer value so my
range is between 0 to 900 and I want to
set my reference line at 90 for example
so I will write 90 here okay
and in next line I will write we just
copy this marker paste it here dot set
label so this is the label for the
marker so here you can provide any
string text and this is basically just
the name for your marker line so right
required level
this is your reference line name which
will appear on your line and then once
again copy this variable marker and
paste it here dot set label
test.txt ankle okay
and this basically you can anchor your
text of for this name above the line or
center of the line or on the top of the
line so I want my text to appear on top
center of the line so I will write this
and in the next line right once again
marker dot sect paint you can give any
color to your line or the reference line
I am giving right now black color and in
the next line write this copy category
plot variable names of my category plot
variable name is P so I will write P
here dot
dot and range marker and in here it will
automatically take this value marker
variable name so basically what you need
to do is like write these four or five
lines of code and this will show
reference level on your chart so let's
try and run our program this is my
running jframe and I will click this and
you can see here my reference line if
you can see is set at 90 this is your
reference line in name which is not very
clear here I will make it clear right
now so to exit from here and instead of
top center I will write and dot top
right okay so it will show my line at
top right and I will change my turnoff
into the 3d graph so it will show my
reference line more clearly and I run
the program once again and I click this
and you can see
a reference line is automatically coming
here okay
so in this way you can make a reference
line and you can change this also I want
my line at 50 so this will convert my
line at 50 also let's see yes now my
lion reference line is set at 50 so in
this way you can show a reference line
on your chart one thing I also forgot is
for the nibble marker marker is not seen
so I will write here after marker dots
at level I will write marker dot Sept
label anchor and it's automatically
takes anchor dot centers instead of this
I will write dot bottom right okay so
now I can expect my this name to appear
on the chart so let's see the name
appears or not
yes it appears here you can see required
level so add that line also to show your
thanks basically it's just four or five
lines of code and you can show your
marker or reference line on your chart
thank you very much for watching and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
