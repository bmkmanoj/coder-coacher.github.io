gonna be talking about how to make
reports so you can make reports in two
ways one is by using I report and second
is by using a plugin called I text so
first of all I will show you how does
these report look like so whenever you
are using a text it's the simple and
easiest way to for making reports and if
you want to make a simple reports with
simple utter header and title and small
tables and small little written
paragraph contents and pictures you can
use I text for that and it's is lot more
easier than I text and it's also looks
very good so this is the report I made
from I text by using I text this is a
small report I have made previously for
my last project so this is by using a
text and it's the project requires small
report so I used I text for that and it
looks like this you can make tables some
headings some pictures also if you want
you can add and
everything so this is from I text and if
you wanted to make some complex reports
or you want to make some large tables
and pictures and you want to show it in
a very perfect manner so in simple words
you want to make really detailed report
and you can use a text but it's lot more
harder to make a nun it's a lot more
cumbersome to make I report reports and
a simple I report report can look like
this
I click the report it's this is the
report but I report can look like this
is no not for the utilization of I
report it's from in this I was just
making the small table I wanted to show
so this type of report you can make it
from I reports so first of all I will
show you how to make a report with the
help of I text because it's simpler and
for smaller applications you can use any
reports so first of all what you want to
do is download I text plugin
so go to your web browser and just type
I text download it's open-source plug-in
so Java so you can download it for free
and you can see the SourceForge link or
I text Java PDF library
click on that and it will go to the
download section the latest version of I
text available for download here is five
point three point one so I click
download and my download starts I think
so I downloaded my I text five point
three point one five I will open it and
I will extract it on my desktop
for example okay so I have extracted it
on my desktop so this is the way you can
download your I text plug-in for Java so
that's all for this tutorial in the next
tutorial I will show you how to add your
plugin into your NetBeans Java project
and how to write a simple hello world
example with I text so thanks for
watching and please rate comment and
subscribe bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
