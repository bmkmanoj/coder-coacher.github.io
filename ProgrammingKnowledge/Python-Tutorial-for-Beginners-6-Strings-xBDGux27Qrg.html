tutorial on Python programming for
beginners and in this video I'm going to
show you how you can use string in your
Python program efficiently so I think I
have shown you in the earlier videos how
to use strings very briefly but in this
video I'm going to take the string in
detail so I have this Python file I have
shown you in the last video that how you
can make Python files and run them using
this run command right so I have this
Python file and I have this Python shell
open so I'm going to write my code here
and I will see the result in this shell
okay so how to use strings in Python so
there are three method or three ways you
can use strings and I'm going to show
you all three ways so consider this
example we have three variables a B and
C and all three of them I have assigned
a string 1 string 4 which is assigned to
variable a is enclosed in single quotes
right the second string is enclosed in
double goals right and the third string
which is assigned to C is enclosed in 3
or triple code and I'm trying to print
all three of them one by one so I want
to print a print B and print C and let's
see what happens first of all I'm going
to save my program and then I will just
run this module or press f5 to run it
and when I press this one I will see the
result here and the result will be the
same so you can print the same string in
three ways either you can use single
code or you can do or you can use a
double quotes or you can use triple
codes to print the string and the result
will always be seen in Python now
suppose you want to use for example this
is a string enclosed in single quote and
you want to use some single code here so
for example I want to say I'm a single
quoted string and for example I want to
use a word called the don't which also
take a single quote here this kind of
single quote and when I use the single
quote which with the string which is
enclosed already in single code then
what you what your Python program will
interpret is your string starts from
here and your string ends here and this
will be some alien to your fightin you
know Python program because it will
think that this single quote is start
from here and ends here
so this is a string and what is this
it's not recognized by the Python so
whenever you want to use a single quote
in the string which is already there
inside the single quote you can use our
escape character and what is the escape
character in Python escape character in
Python is backslash so just use this
backslash and now you can see
that you're back backslash is hiding or
it's saying Python that we want to use
single code inside the string okay and
this is called escape character so in
the same way when you want to use double
code in the string which is already
there in the double quotes for example
here I want to use double quote the same
problem will come here you're a Python
program will see that your string starts
here and ends here and this will be not
this will not be recognized by a Python
program so here also you can use
backslash to hide or to you know say
Python that we are using double quotes
but it's the part of the string and it's
not starting or ending of the string
okay in a same manner you can you know
use single quote here and you can use
this backslash to show this backslash
for or double quotes here now I will
save my program I will just click ctrl s
and run it once again f5 and you can see
the answer is like this so I'm a signal
quoted string and this single code is
visible now here and just remember that
this is just an escape character so this
will not be printed this will help your
single code to print but this will not
be printed in the same way you can see
it's printing this double quote here
because we are using escape character
and in the same way it will work in the
third string like this now suppose you
want to print this this escape character
so you have some string which uses this
and you want to print here this
backslash how you can do it
you just need to use wherever you need
to you know print this backslash for
example I will use backslash here and
let's see first of all what will be the
result for example I want to print
backslash here here and here and I will
save my program and run it by pressing F
or this run 5 module it will show me
this backslash here right but better way
is to just use double slash let's see
what happens when we use double slash I
will save it and run the program and now
it shows backslash like this so it's
always better to use double slash
whenever you will want to print this
single backslash here okay now suppose
you want to print the length or you want
to find out the length of your string
what you can do you can use our built-in
function called LEM and I think I have
already you know shown this function to
you but once again I am going to show
you so I want to find the length of the
string a I can just use LEM and I will
pass my variable a as an argument and I
can save it and I can run it I'll run it
here once again and now it says 44 so
the length of my string a is 34 okay so
in the same way you can find the length
of B and C also right now suppose I have
a string a for example I have string a
like this
hello and space and string be is like
that hello world okay
and how can I join these strings I can
join these strings just like you just
need to use a and plus and be so plus is
called a concatenation operator here and
what this plus thus it just adds or
concatenate these two string a and B but
we'll save the program and run it once
again and it gives me the answer hello
worlds right so this plus concatenates
your string you can see here now for
example I have this I have this I will
just delete this and I have this
variable a and I want to print it ten
times and I don't want to use you know a
and then plus a once again a I want to
print it ten times or suppose I want to
print it hundred times there is a short
way to print this a hundred times of
whatever number of times what you need
to do is you just need to use your
variable which contains your string and
then give a asterisk symbol here so give
this asterisk symbol and then the number
of time you want to iterate for example
I want to print hello ten times I can
just give ten here and I can save the
program and I can run it once again and
now you can see it has printed hello ten
times this I can do you know I can
change it to hundred and it will print
hello hundred times
just run it now you can see it has
printed this hello hundred times right
this is a short way of printing your
same
string again and again okay now suppose
I have a string which is a so I have
this board for example hello which is
assigned to a and I have the other
variable B and I assign a number to to
this or five to this okay and I want to
print hello five in a single line how
can I do this I can for example I can
try to write it like this a plus B but
let's see what happens when I run this I
will save it and I will run this and
give me the error because my variable a
is of type string and my variable B is
of type integer and I cannot add or can
concatenate these two variables because
they B has a different data type and a
has a different database now in order to
print this these two variables together
or value of these two variables together
what I can do is I can typecast my B
which is an integer to the string and to
convert my integer to string what I can
do is I can just do STR and I can
enclose this B variable in this function
called STR and what this STR does is it
converts your argument into a string
okay
and now when I save this and run this it
will run fine hello five right so in
this way you can use string in Python
efficiently I hope you have enjoyed this
