last video I have shown you how to show
the corresponding values from the
database when you select some cell in
this table view so for example I select
this employee ID column second cell so
it shows the corresponding values from
the database in these line edit I can
select from the column name also any
cell and the corresponding value comes
here in this video I want to show you
how to do the same thing with this list
view so I wanted that if I select some
item from the list view the
corresponding value should appear in
this these line edits so let's see how
can I do it first of all I go to my line
at it and I select it and I right click
and go to slots and I will select first
item from here which is activated and
click OK and in here I will write my
code so in this video I'm going to use
the code which I have used in the last
video so if you have seen that video it
will be very easy for you to follow this
video and I will paste the same code
here and I will explain what I'm doing
here so first of all last in the last
video I was taking the index of the
table and whatever cell I select from in
the table I take the index of that table
and I take the value of the index
whatever string is there in the index
and I pass it into the cue string which
is a string the same thing I will do it
for the list box so just I have instead
of this table view I will use UI list
view and take the model of that and
whatever index I select I will transfer
the value
of index here and in this code I'm just
creating the object with login class
which contains my open connection and
open cloak connection open and
connection close class so first of all
I'm checking whether my database is open
or not and then database
I'm opening the database and then I am
creating the cuse SQL query object to
write my query and with this query
object I prepare the query so in the
last video I have shown you how to
prepare the query for the table because
the table has multiple indexes or
two-dimensional cell-cell cells it has
columns and rows that's why I have
written the query that selects start
from your table where employee ID which
is my first column is equal to the value
or my second column is equal to value
this is this is the columns from the
database but because ListView don't have
two-dimensional cells cell arrays so I
can just use only one column which is
employee ID and because my list view
right now is showing the employee IDs
that's why I am taking here select star
from employee info where my employee ID
is equal to the value which I am taking
from the list box right and then if my
query is executed I take all the values
which I am getting from the database and
I am transferring it to the Edit line at
it so this I have explained in the last
video also so I think this code will
just do it for you so if you want you
can just pause the video and copy this
all code and after that I will run my
program
and username password and I will load my
data here and this list box right now is
showing the employee ID which is there
in the database you can see it here I
have nine employees so nine employee IDs
and I can see here and when I select
some employee ID right now it's showing
a guy ID one I select employee ID three
so you can see here the corresponding
data of employee ID three comes here
right employee ID 5 corresponding that
of employee ID five comes here right to
four so in this way you can show the
corresponding value to the selected list
view item in the line edits so I hope
you have learned something new this time
please rate comment to subscribe and bye
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
