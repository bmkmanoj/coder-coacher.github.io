we have learned about how to add your
own images to the Ida put and in this
video I will tell you how to pass a
query from your NetBeans Java program to
your I report so let's get started first
of all how will you go to my NetBeans
project and last time I have made this
button you would use a go if you
remember and when I go to its event
action action perform this code we have
written in order to open the eye report
from your button click event so if you
don't remember this code go few videos
back and see it I will go further in
this code or I will add some more things
like queries in this code and then we
will try to execute that query so so
let's get started first of all what you
need to do is the first line in which
you have defined your path of your gr
XML file for I put
just give us double slash before that
because we don't need this line anymore
and instead of this line I will add one
more line which is just per design
when name is variable as JD is equal to
tea are
XML garment
exploder jrx manoda
dot load and that gave semicolon and in
here instead of null you copy the same
path which you have used in the above
code which we have given double slash
and just so what I will do is I will
provide a double quote first and then I
in between away pasted my path okay this
is my path and then in the next line
what you will do is you will write a
query so string test ul is equal to
and in here the query what the query
will be first of all go to your Jasper
report and go to a design and in here
where you are designing or in your raw
Jasper report is go here at the top and
you can see design XML preview and after
preview you can see a little database
symbol just click it and you will see
the query so the problem with Jasper
report is we have already connected the
Jasper report with the database and we
have used this query to connect just per
report with database so the basic
structure of your query must be like
this select star from improv employee ID
so I will copy this and we go to my
NetBeans program and I will play paste
it now after that you can change your
query according to your requirement for
example you can add order by
name or whatever so after that you can
add your requirement what you want to do
with the your database or your table
this first few words of the line or
query very P or must be same as your
query you have used in your I report
database so and after that it's your
will what you want to do with your query
I have added order by name I can also
say I want to show the table where
employee age is between something or
something or whatever query you want to
execute after this code and then in the
third line what you will do is you will
write J or D
design
query it as new query is equal to nu and
I will once again copy this of you I
paste it and to break it and like a
closed and after that I write or I will
just copy this new query variable paste
it here dot that text and this string
SQL variable will come here up in the
text brackets and in the next line what
you will do is write just for design dot
set
sorry vespidae line bot
okay so instead of just web design I
need to copy its variable name so my
Jasper design variable name is JD I am
used so I will write JD dot sector query
and in the bracket this new query
variable will come so these are the four
or five lines you need to write in order
to execute your query using NetBeans so
let's see how our program looks like
when we run our program run so our
programming is running now and when I
click my I report it should open I think
so
it says something is wrong so I will
check what is wrong
yes so what I have done here is
previously the in this code I have used
and I have given a double slash or I
have deactivated this line of code by
providing doubles less and this report
variable is used here but instead of
this report variable I need to put JT
variable because I am using Java design
variables now so instead of this report
paste JD and now when I run the program
it must work I think so
so my program is running now and when I
press I report now
the query is executed and it's it is
order by name now suppose I want to see
the report and I want to see this edge
into ascending order right now you are
seeing the ages in random orders 20 20
29 24 25 I want to see this age in
ascending order so what I will do is I
will go here in my code and instead of
select star from employee ID order by
name I will write order by age and let's
see
our query works or not and I will press
I report and now you can see age is
order in ascending order
twenty twenty twenty twenty two twenty
three and four n so for so forth so I
know by this that my query is working
from NetBeans one more trial I want to
do for example I want to show the table
in which only those employee will appear
whose age are in between 20 and 22 for
example what I will do is I will take
two variables in one into two I will
change this variable age one age to sew
my age one variable is equal to 20 my
age to variable is 22 and this I will
use here I will write where age
we're eight between h1 and h2 and order
by age so this must show me employees
whose age are in between 20 and 22 years
so let's see our code works or not
I will press I report BAM and my report
I will see only those employees whose
age are in between 20 and 22 years so in
this way you can pass your queries from
NetBeans Java to the I report I hope you
have learned something new from this
