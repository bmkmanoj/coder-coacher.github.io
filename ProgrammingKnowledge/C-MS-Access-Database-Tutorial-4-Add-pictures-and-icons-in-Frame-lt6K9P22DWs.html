of using Access database with your
c-sharp windows form application I have
shown you how you can connect with your
database and how you can create a simple
login form from which you can validate
your username and password against your
Access database username and password so
for example I give the username and a
password I've also shown you in the last
video how to hide your password and
whenever we check and validate this
username password against our database
it shows username and password it's
correct or if it's not correct then it
will show you the message it's not
correct now in this video I am going to
show you how you can add pictures for
example you want to add a picture to
your form here and how to add an icon to
your button or for example other other
tools so I will show you how you can
find a icon for your button and I will
also show you how you can add these
icons to your forms and buttons and
other things so let's get started first
of all the where we can find icons for
our project there are many sites on
internet you can find icons for your
projects one of the site is I can
archive which I use and just you need to
just give this name I can archive on
search on your search engine and the
first link you will find here is
www.hyken.com
just click this
and in here you can find the many icons
which can be useful for your project so
for example I want to search for a
picture for a login page so I will
search login and press enter and in here
you can find the pictures for login
pages so for example I want this picture
for my login page you can resize these
pictures from here also so you see large
icon medium icon
small icon and whatever is a resolution
you want for these pictures for example
I want medium icon so this is this size
you want large icon and this items will
be large
okay for example I want this large icon
to show on my login page I will just
click this PNG little PNG symbol here
and I'll right click and save image as
and save this image to a specified
folder wherever you want to save it okay
I save this once again I will go back
and I want us I can put this button also
for this small button so I will say our
search for ok icon and you see here ok
but this is a very big icon and I need a
small icon for my small MA for my button
so I will go to all first of all and I
will change the size to 16 by 16 or 24
by 24 so this is a similar 24 by 24
pixel and now you can see 24 by 24 pixel
icons just go to the PNG and just right
click and I click this picture and save
image as and save it to your specified
location
so in within this way you can find your
icons and once you found our icons what
you can do is search for one more icon
maybe which will be the icon for my form
so I will just search for employee icon
for example and there are some employee
icon
I choose this but this time I will
choose this ICO file because our form
takes ICO icons so just click ICO icon
and this icon is I think downloaded it's
okay this icon is in our specified
location I will go to my project once
again and now what I will do is first of
all I will add a picture in this form so
I will go to my tool box and I will just
search for a picture box and I will
resize it for example and I will just
click this small symbol or this triangle
here and I will say choose image and
here go to project resource file this is
a five-fold er which is present in your
project project folder so just check
this project this o folder and just
import and just click this whatever
image you want to import to your
projects resource folder for example
this image and I can image both and I
will click open and now I can select my
image and click OK
and you can see here this image is here
and once you have this image heroes here
you can go to your project wherever your
project is and this has a resource file
here the source folder here and in here
you will be able to find all these icons
which you have imported in your project
so go to your project and go to this
resource folder and you will find all
these symbols there also now to resize
this image I can just go to this symbol
once again and in the size mode I can
just say stretch image then it will
stretch man image or auto size it will
resize and you can choose this Center or
assume whatever you want okay so this
will add this picture to your your form
and you can select this button now and
go to the property here and search for
the property let me see called
image so go to this property called
image to select your button and go to
this property called image and just
click the small button here and you can
choose your symbol which is okay symbol
from here and click OK and you see here
your symbol is added or your image is
added to this login button but this
doesn't look good because your text and
your image is merging so you can just go
to image align right now by default its
middle center you can choose it the
alignment of image to the left so it
will go to the left or you can choose it
to the right and it will go to the right
or if you want it at the top you can
just do it like this also
so whatever suits you you can choose the
image alignment like this okay I will
choose this left for my application
okay now this our form also has this
icon you can add the icon to your form
also so you see here a small symbol here
or when when you run your program
you see here this is a symbol of your
application which is the default I can
or this default icon if you want to
change this icon also just select your
form as a whole selector your form as a
whole and go to the property called icon
here and search for the icon which you
want to add so we have downloaded our
icon file also search for this icon file
and click OK and now you see here the
icon is changed here to your icon
whatever you have given the icon now
when you run your program you will be
able to see your icon here when you run
your program here and here right so in
this way you can add pictures and I can
to your form and make it a little bit
interactive and look good looking so I
