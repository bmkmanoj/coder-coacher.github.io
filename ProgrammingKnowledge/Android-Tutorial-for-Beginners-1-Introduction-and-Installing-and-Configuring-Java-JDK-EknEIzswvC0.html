tutorial on android app development for
beginners now I'm not going to give you
the basic or brief introduction of
Android because you may know what you
must know what is Android most of the
mobile devices and nowadays TV and
wearable technology uses Android as
their main operating system so I'm going
to start this video series how we can
download and install and configure
Android app development environment and
we are going to use Android studio to
develop our Android apps so to configure
Android studio first we need to have
Java in our operating system so in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
download and install Java JDK and
configure the environment variables and
in the next video I'm going to show you
how you can download and install Android
studio and configure it to develop
Android applications so let's get
started first of all we need to download
java so just search for java jdk and
search for it
it's jar java jdk and most probably the
first link here will appear from
www.greatinternetmarketingtraining.com
loading java jdk for windows mac linux
solaris and other operating systems and
this series I'm going to show you how to
and develop Android apps on windows so
we will do it on Windows so just click
the option I accept and in here if you
are running Windows 8 it's most probable
that your operating system is 64-bit
operating system so I'm going to
download this 64-bit Java executable
file from here so just click this JDK -
8 Q 25 at the time of making this video
jdk 8 is the latest one so I am going to
click this link to download this JDK
file which is an executable file and it
can take some time to download so I will
let it download and I will see you when
it's fully downloaded so now my download
is complete and I'm going to run this
executable file and I will say yes and
it will prepare the installer for us for
installing Java and once this is
prepared it's easy to install Java you
just need to click some next buttons and
most probably it will be installed in
few minutes on your windows operating
system or if you are using I think they
already give updates for Java so you
don't need to do anything and it says
that Java is already there in my
computer so I don't need to do anything
so once you have you know installed this
Java it's not a rocket science to
install Java you just need to click some
Next button and the most probably after
everything is finished you just need to
click this finish button and once it's
installed you will be able to see in
your
p c and c folder of your operating
system in here you just need to go to
Program Files and in here you will be
able to see this Java folder in your C
and slash Program Files folder and in
this Java folder there will be two files
one is JDK folder and second is JRE
folder JDK stands for Java development
kit and JRE stands for Java runtime
environment so for our purpose for
developing app on Android studio we need
this JDK so what we need to do is we
need to set the environment variable for
Java so that Android studio can
recognize this so what I will do is I
will copy this part from here which is C
colon slash Program Files slash Java
slash whatever is the name of your JDK
folder so it starts from JDK so just
copy this part from here and now we are
going to go to the system so just search
for system and in the system we are
going to go to advanced system settings
ok so go to the advanced system settings
and in here in the advanced system
settings you need to click environment
variable which is this option and in
here what you need to do is you just
need to click in the system variable you
just search if this Java home variable
is there and if it's not there you just
need to click new most probably you need
to give this environment variable so
click new and in here you just need to
write Java underscore home all in
capital so Java underscore home
everything is capital so you
should do all you should write this Java
home exactly the same Java underscore
home okay and then copy the part or
paste the part which you have copied
from here which was your C colon slash
program file slash Java slash JDK okay
this part you will get after installing
Java JDK so you just need to do this
click OK and click OK and click OK and
everything is done so now Java JDK is
installed on your system and you have
successfully set the environment
variables for JDK so that's it for this
video in the next video we will see how
we can download and install Android
studio for developing our Android apps
so stay tuned and please rate comment
