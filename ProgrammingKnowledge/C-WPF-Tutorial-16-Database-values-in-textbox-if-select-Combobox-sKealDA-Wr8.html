tutorial on WPF c-sharp application so
till now we have made this application
where we can login with username and
password and it opens our second form
and here we can save update or delete
data and in the last two video we have
seen how to load how to link your data
way base with your list box and your
combo box in this video I will show you
how to show values in the textbox when
you select some value in the combo box
so for example I select this name mark
because the combo box is loaded with my
column mark values my column name value
sorry and when I select mark the
corresponding value which are related to
mark his employee ID name surname and
age should appear here so that I will
show you today how to show the
corresponding value in the textbox when
some value is selected in the combo box
so let's get started I have this code
right now and in the last last video I
have shown you how to link your combo
box with the database and I have shown
you how to load name column values in
your combo box so if you haven't seen
that video just see that to know the
code and just select this combo box and
double click it and we reach to the
combo box one selection change event and
I am copying the whole code from the
last last video where I have shown you
how to link your combo box with the
database value so this is my fill combo
method which I have written in the last
to last video I will copy all the code
from SQLite connection to the end of
try-catch block and I will once again go
to my window and double click it and in
this combo box selection change event I
will paste all the code so what I was
doing basically is creating the
connection from the database and in this
try-catch block I have written the
strike as block to catch any exceptions
and then I'm opening the SQLite
connection in SQLite core not open and
then I was passing the veggie query
select star from employee ID and then I
create the X collide command where I
pass the query and the connection and
then I execute query so I write this
escalate dot areeda dr is equal to
command dot X execute reader and while
this data reader continues reading I am
showing the values so if you want you
can just copy this code I will just
focus on the code and we will add it
some of the part of this code
in order to show the values in the
textbox so basically we are going to
change the query so just go here string
query is equal to select star from your
table name so we have this table
employee info where I have column E ID
name surname and age so I go here to the
code and I write select star from my
table name where name is equal to my
combo box name so my combo box name is
select your combo box
and go to the properties here and copy
the name of your combo box in my case
combo box one go to the code once again
and in here write single quote in
between double quote in between plus
plus and paste your combo box name there
and white dot text okay so our query is
select star from employee ID where your
name because we loaded names in the
combo box in last two last video when we
linked our combo box with the database
we are showing the names that's why I
have written name is equal to combo bar
whatever we select in the combo box so
combo box not text and all the code will
remain this the same here after that and
we are going to change inside this while
loop dr dr which is dotted reader dot
read and i was adding the items to the
combo box in the last video and i delete
this code here and i will copy this
string name is equal to dr dot get
string and paste it four times because i
have four text boxes to show the values
and i will change the name first is e I
D string s e ID and I will name rename
them as name s
surname and f age I'm adding s before my
variable names because it shows string
so I've just referred to add s now these
are the column view these string
variable will take each column values of
this is for the column employee ID so I
have this first column which is employee
ID right second is name third is surname
and fourth is age so index start from
zero one two three so I will change it
here first column is zero second is one
third is 2 and fourth column is three
three and now because my employee ID is
of data type int I will show you here
when I created this data table I
assigned this employee ID as integer
type name as Val care which is a type of
string surname as where care which is
also a string and age is my integer so
what I will do is instead of this get
string I will write dr dot get into 32
and in this will show error because this
is int and we need to convert it into
the string so right dot two string rank
it and like it closed same thing we will
do for age also because it's also a int
time so right dot
in 32 and dot two string like it and
like it closed so what this will do is
this code will see whatever value
selected in the combo box and it reads
all the values corresponding to it and
it loads corresponding values to this
string so it reads the employee and
loads it loads it in this string e ID
name surname or age right and then what
we can do is we will copy the names of
our text boxes one by one so first
column name is here a ID text go to the
code and just paste below your string
variable declarations second column name
is not column name is mutt text box name
text box name is four name textbox is
name text and paste it just below it I
will use it I am just copying all the
text box names the text box named for
surname is surname txt and the text box
name for age is age txt right
so age txt I will just arrange them in
right manner and what I will do is I
will this is my employee ID text box
name dot text is equal to my a ID string
variable okay in the same way name dot
text is equal to string variable name as
name so named X Box name is equal to
text is equal to my string variable s
surname and last is my age so dot text
is equal to my string variable s age so
what I have done is I have taken the
values from the database corresponding
to this combo box selected value and now
I am setting the values in your text box
right so if you want you can just copy
this code and now I will run the code
run this code username and password
correct and I have these name loaded in
my combo box which I have shown you in
the last last video so when I select
this the corresponding values which is
there in the database should appear in
these text boxes let's see if it happens
or not yes it's happening two three four
okay
so I have this John as one and let's see
in the database if it's showing the
right by loose or not so I have first
employee as Mark and his surname is
Henry and his age is 33 but when I
select this it's selecting random values
which is not right right
when I select John it's selecting Mach
values and when I select this Peter it's
selecting the John values so let's see
what have I done wrong
stop the program so what I have done
wrong is I think I have selected wrong
event for my action so right now my
event is when you select this combo box
and when you see the event here my
current event is selection changed so
instead of using this selection change
in events we must select this go above
and search for this drop-down closed
event just select this drop-down close
event double click it and we is reach to
the function called combo box one drop
down close event so copy all the code
from combo box selection change event
just copy and cut all the code from
there so just make it empty this
function combo box one selection change
event just copy all the code cut all the
code and paste it here in this combo box
one drop down close event paste it all
the code in this function so what I have
done is I have cut all the code from
selection change event and pasted all
the code in the drop-down closed event
the same code we have written earlier
and now when you run the program and
when you give username and password and
when you select the corresponding name
the corresponding value will come so
name and this name is same here and the
database also if you check corresponding
value for mark is employee ID is one
which is here
so name is Henry which is here age is 30
to 33 which is here let us say Lex John
employee ID 2 which is here so name is
same and age is 42 same now it's giving
me the corresponding values correctly
okay so just change the code like that
so I hope you have learned something new
this time please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
