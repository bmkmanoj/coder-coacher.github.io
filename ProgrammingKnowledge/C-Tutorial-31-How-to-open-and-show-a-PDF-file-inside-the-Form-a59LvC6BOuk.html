video I will show you how to show a PDF
file into your form so for example I
want to show a PDF file inside my form
which I am writing with the help of
c-sharp code so how can I show that PDF
file inside this form so let's get
started
first of all go to your toolbox and
right click it ok and you go to choose
items here ok and then go to calm
components and choose here this Adobe
PDF Reader just take it and then click
OK so what it's going to do is if you
scroll down your toolbox you will be
able to see this Adobe PDF reader here
in your toolbox so just drag and drop
this Adobe PDF reader tool component
into your form and resize it according
to your needs and if you want you can
anchor it to the sides of the form like
this go to anchor and just just click
this so it will anchor now take a button
to give the part for the file PDF file
and I will change its text as
open PDF okay and now I will write a
code for loading the PDF file so just
double click this and just write this
code and leave this line this code if
you are following this video you already
know what is this open file dialog which
will open a file dialog to choose a PDF
file so write open file dialog open file
dialog variable name is equal to new
Open File dialog bracket and bracket
closed and if open file dialog which is
this variable dot show dialog bracket is
equal to system dot Windows dot forms
dot dialog result dot okay then it will
open a file dialog to you and then in
the next line what you do is just go to
your form once again just select your
PDF reader no PDF reader and copy the
name of this PDF reader ok and once
again we will go to the code yeah so
this was the code we have written till
down and in this if condition you write
or paste this ax accro PDF one which I
have copied right now the name of the
PDF reader and then write dot s see
okay is equal to your open file dialog
component dot file name and close it
okay so you have written this is the
name of your PDF reader dot source is
equal to open file dialog which is this
variable and file name so basically what
this line will do is it will serve as
this open file dialog will copy the file
name and it will serve as a source for
this accro reader or ax accra reader
so now after writing this code we are
going to run our program and now when
you click this button and you must
choose a PDF file from here so just
choose any PDF file let me choose this
PDF file and if you see it in your file
in your form so this code has opened a
PDF file in your form and this you can
resize it also because we have anchored
it in your form so you see PDF file is
in inside your form so in this way you
can open a PDF file inside your form so
if you haven't copied this code just
copy it and this will open up India I
