last video we have seen how to use a
where clause in your queries in this
video we will see how to use and and/or
operator with your queries so we have
this table as we have made previously or
employee ID name surname and age so last
time we have seen how to use this where
clause so I have written the statement
select star from database dot Tiffany
where so suppose in this table you want
to use or you want to see the employee
information where the name of the
employee is mark and surname of the
employee is Dell so how we can see that
we will see it here so right select star
from database dot table where name and
single goats and my bleep mark and
surname is equal to single quote was
can't
okay
and in between you white or so right
select star from database dot the table
where name is equal to mark or your
surname is them so it's execute this
query yes it shows me the values where
mark is Mark information is there or
Dell information is there okay but
suppose in your database we will add
some one more employee whose name is
mark as same as this but hey his surname
is different
whatever and his age is also different I
will apply it okay and you want to see
the information of the employee where
name is equal to mark but you will see
two marks are there and you just want to
see the information of Mark Bell so what
we will write is select star from
database dot table name where name is
equal to mark and instead of or even
white and surname is equal to Bell and
let's execute this query yes it shows
when we work one mark
information where my name is equal to
mark and surname is
to Bali so in this way you can use end
and our laws with your queries and this
query you can write in your software and
extract this information so that's it
