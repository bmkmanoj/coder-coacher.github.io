will show you how to insert your data
and specially the data from your in jail
date chooser into your database for
example I choose a date so and I want to
save it in my database like how can I do
that I will show you today so I've
already made these text field and the
labels for inserting my data for a baby
and all pressure temperature and
rotational speed so this I already told
you so I in order to save time I already
made that and I also made a button for
saving data now in order to save your
date it should your date should be in
certain form it because SQLite safe
stayed in a certain forms format only so
just click your jet each day choose a
text field and go to its properties and
in here date format string you need to
change this format you need
to do here you need to do your month and
date the skill only takes date in this
moment only first of all you're the
month and then the day format so just go
to the property and in the date format
string change this format of date so now
did will come in that comment was there
then the month and then the day after
doing that now we want to sort our data
so right click your Save button action
action performed and in here I have
already made the try and catch block
it's easy so you can make it and so then
in triad catch block you must write with
string as always string SQL string well
this is the query we are going to write
as a variable SQL so in here right
insult
do whatever your database name is a
database name is database table name is
user info so I copy it and paste it here
insert into table and then break it in
which you write all the column names
which are in my case pump ID date
pressure temperature and volume flow and
rotational speed so we write these
column names
come date ,
the coma
I want to tell you something that SQLite
or SQL is when you whenever you write a
query you can write a word in capital
letters or small letters the SQL is not
case-sensitive so it will take whatever
capital letter or small letter you will
write so it will not make much
difference so so in the bracket I have
written all the column names and then
after values and in the bracket give
same number of question mark as column
so I have one two three four five six
columns I have to make six question
mounts
so until here I have already told you
how to save this data now I will write
my connection which is PSD is equal to
statement
and in here it is this string me you and
then write PS T not sent string and our
first parameter endo first parameter is
we are taking from here first by my
parameters pump IDs would copy the name
variable name of pump ID text field and
paste it here dot get text
and in the in the same way we will make
it six times copy and paste because we
have six columns and six in two three
four five six and just change here
values two three four five and six
and you to write p st dot execute so
don't forget that
otherwise if while you will not execute
and in here we will change the variable
name of the column which we are taking
from these fields at last I will change
the date variable name because that's
very important right now I will change
the other variable names from here
and temperature variable name a steady
at the fourth position so I've copied
all the variable text field names except
for the date so I will copy it
I don't copy it right now I will write
here after two I will make a bracket
here and then because I am taking it
from jtextfield 7j
late the next field
and
this is quoted by another bracket and
after jet track text field bracket you
need to copy your date variable names I
will leave it as date and copy just xt
date so it's clear for us we are taking
it from jake dead chooser and
I will paste it just after the
jtextfield bracket and then dot get
get lead editor dot that
you I component you have to write this
after that this is our initial bracket
which I made earlier
after this bucket you need to write a
dot get next
so you have to write this line in order
to take your date into your SQLite
so after writing this code once again I
will repeat it only for the date text
field from the user that's important all
else you know I think so informed date
you should write PS T dot set string to
gamma J text field and then your
variable name text date in my case dot
get date editor dot get UI component and
bracket closed these bracket and then
dot get text and now we try to run our
program
and in here we have six pump ID so I
will add another seven tiny and date I
will choose for example this and this
format and pressure 20 temperature 34
volume flow rate speed this and when I
save the problem save the new data it's
saved you can see and you cannot see
right now
save data but when you run the programs
once again the table will be refreshed
and you can see the new data is saved
here so in this way you can use your JTD
chooser to save your data so I hope you
have learned something new today and
thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
