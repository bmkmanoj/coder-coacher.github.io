last video we have seen how to encrypt
our data from the simple text to a safer
in this video we will see how to decrypt
your data from safer to the simple text
so we are going to press this the grip
button and when it's pressed whatever is
in this box
which is in the form of encrypted script
will be converted again once again into
a simple script so for that I will take
a text box to show the converted string
once again and I will name it as
simple text okay this one
so here we will enter our first simple
string it will encrypt when we press
this button get encrypted and when we
press this button it is once again
decrypted and show in this text box so
let's get started just double click your
the grip button and then here in the
method decrypt button event actually
perform method you will white here you
will have white first Emily's dream this
cap and ms1 how you name it as - one
variable is equal to this C nu and this
once again copy this memory stream and
paste it here and closed and in the
second line we have taken in that
encryption also this line
crypto stream stringing tapped she has
won this time last time we have taken CS
this time CS 1 G Seenu is equally to
once again copy this paste it here
bracket the medaka close and in here
pass your MS 1 variable which is this
variable the comma copy or des object
which we have defined in the last video
for encryption des obj from here paste
it here then arrow point create
we in decryptor and warm-up and third
Part B right
crypto stream board more double quotes
and here this time we will know the read
method last time we everything here
alright because we were writing into the
crypto stream stream and this time we
are reading from the triple stream and
in the next line write copy us the CS
one variable arrow point read bracket
bracket closed and in here and in here
you will pass your crypto bytes which we
have defined in the last video and we
which you can find in this encrypted
code also in the last video where is our
trip to bytes so see ya this one in the
last line of the encryption code which I
have shown you in the last video just
copy that crypto bytes variable and
paste in between this MS stream bracket
and here also comma
zero comma once again that super bytes
variable and then it slammed
and in the next line we will write we
have defined two plane by its variables
one we have used last time and the next
we will use right now this we have used
in X encryption this we will use in the
decryption plane by two variable so come
to a code once again and paste it here
it is equal to M s 1 which is MD stream
variable and a pointer have a bracket
and bracket closed and then we will
close on simple streams of this paste
this and write close and then we close
our Magda string copy this
and close this also
okay and now we want to write an
decrypted code into a text box so just
copy the name of this tech this text box
name is simple text so we'll copy it and
paste it in my code and then write text
is equal to encoding the ASCII arrow
point get the string break it in black
and just copy this plain by two variable
and pass it here so this code we have
written to disk decrypt our encrypted
data now we are going to try a code and
see if we have some error or we are good
to go so run it and I think there is one
error syntax errors
so let's see what to get
okay I've given two equal to here which
I'm not supposed to do so they need this
equal sign here and once again trying to
run the code
and it's running so enter my username
and password which is correct and here I
will write the simple simple text for
example and I press this encrypt button
and drift my daughter this is my
encrypted text which I have shown you in
the last two videos or to encrypt your
data and when I press this decrypt but
my encrypted string will can give me a
decrypted data which is this single text
once again let's try and press this
button yes it gives me simple text and
this some garbage values because we have
provided a padding to our shipper in the
last video if you know so this garbage
will always come so in this will they
you can encrypt your data and decrypt
your data with the help of visual C++
windows for our form application so I
hope you have learned something new this
time please wait coming to describe and
by no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
