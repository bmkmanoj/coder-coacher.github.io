tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how to use math operators in Java and
how to you know do simple arithmetic
operations in Java now in this video we
will learn about increment operators and
we will learn about what is post
increment and pre increment operations
and we will also learn about assignment
operators and how to use this assignment
operator effectively so for example I
have a variable X for now which is equal
to 10 okay now I want to increment the
value of x by 1 the simplest way of
doing this is X is equal to X plus 1 and
this will increment the value of x by 1
right so let's compile the program and
run the program once again and the value
of x is incremented by 1 which is and
the answer is 11 here right now the
there is other ways of doing this and
the other way of doing this is just like
this so you can do X and then 2 plus
signs and this will increment the value
of x by 1 so let us try to run the
program and in answer you can see that
the answer is still 11 so this operation
when you add two plus symbols before
your variable it will increment the
value of the variable Y 1 but there is
something called pre increment operators
which is which I am going to show you
this kind of incrementation
of the variable is called post increment
operation so for example when I do
something like this when I just want to
print X plus plus in print line see
what's the answer the answer is 10 this
is because in the post increment
operation once the value of x will be
changed only after this plus plus
operation okay so this plus plus
operation will increment the value of x
I in the next usage of X okay so for
example I just print the value of x here
the value of X will be incremented by 1
now okay so the first value of 10 is 10
which is same as the value but we have
added to this plus 2 plus symbols here
then the value will be shown here so
this is called the Pro post increment
operation right in which the value of x
will be increment in the after you
perform this plus plus operation right
but there is something called pre
incrementation and this you can do it
like this plus plus X and what this will
do is it will increase the value of x by
1 first
so in this operation itself it will
increase the value of X and this will
just show the same result so let's
compile the program and this time we get
1111 which is true because this is
called pre increment operator so first
it will increment your value and then
give the result and this kind of
operation where we have written X plus
plus this will first
print your value and then increment your
value after plus plus operation okay so
this is called pre incrementation and
this is called post increment operation
okay
now for example I want to do something
like this so I want to add five to this
value right so you can do it X is equal
to X plus five but this is kind of
lengthy right because you need to write
X is equal to and you need to use X two
times and there is a simple way of doing
this by just writing X so just writing X
plus is equal to five okay and what this
operation does is basically the same
operation what this operation do X is
equal to X plus five okay and let us see
the answer so the answer is 15 right but
the short form of this operation you can
do it like this okay in the similar way
if you want to multiply five into this
value you just need to do X as tricks
which is a multiplication operator and
this is basically equal to this
operation right so run the program and
it's 51 so answer so equal to in Java is
called assignment operator and we have
simplified the process of assignment
operation by you know optimizing our
code okay so in a similar way whenever
you want to divide 10 by 5 you can do it
like this and the answer is 2 which is
true
and this is simply means this operation
and if you want to subtract these values
you just to minus equals and this will
perform simply the subtraction okay so
in this way you can use increment
operation in Java and you can
effectively use assignment operation in
Java so I hope you have enjoyed this
