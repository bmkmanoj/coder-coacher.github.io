video I will show you how to send an
email with your visual C++ windows form
application so let's see how can we send
a email first of all I have designed a
form for sending email and I have taken
one two three four five six text boxes
and six labels and I have named the
labels as username from password to the
subject and SMTP server or SMTP okay I
also take a rich text box from here I
will show you this one I have dragged
and dropped here and this is a rich text
box you can take a simple text box also
but I prefer rich text box and I have
taken a button called send mail okay so
this much amount of text box labels and
rich text box and button so take them
and design like that I also want to show
you the names of my text boxes so user
name text box name is Xbox user name
from text box name is wrong text box
from password text box name is Xbox
password to text box name is text to
subject Xbox name is text box subject
and SMTP text box named as text box SMT
and the rich text box named as rich text
box underscore body okay so remember
these name I'm going to use these name
in the code that's why I show you this
name and then I will click this send
main button double click it and go to
the top of your form and wherever you
have using namespaces declaration you
need to take two things using namespace
system double colon web and using
namespace system double colon net dot
double colon meal so right these two
things wherever you're using namespace
declaration is there and now little
below where your initialized component
function is there this function is
called whenever your form starts running
so this is the first function which is
which start running so go there and go
in that function whatever your form name
is void and go there and you need to
write this in order to save your
password otherwise your password will
appear as you write it so for example
you want to enter a password one two
three four it will appear on the
password text box as it is but I want to
show don't want to show my password so
that's why I show these dollar signs
instead of showing my password
so what'd you do write text box
underscore password which is the name of
this text box right we have seen earlier
and arrow point of password care is
equal to whatever character you want to
show instead of your positional password
in my case I am showing dollar sign so
write this wherever your initial like
initialize component is there just below
that okay now once again we will go to
the form and we will double click our
send mail button and in here I will
write a code for sending the mail first
of all in the declaration for the mail
so write mail message this cap symbol
mean is equal to GC new mail message and
then you need to write this in the
brackets right text box form arrow
pointer text so this is from text box
name which is this text box name okay if
you remember I showed you other names so
write text box for from arrow pointed
text so this will take a text from Xbox
from and put it here comma text box to
text box to name arrow pointed text
comma text box subject name so this text
box name and then I'll pointer text and
the body
text box name so rich text box
underscore body arrow pointer text these
four things you need to pass in this
brackets okay so once again declare mail
message arrow point of mail GC new mail
message and the four text boxes arrow
point the text thanks box from point the
text text box to and open the text
thanks both subject and the body of the
text okay and then you will have to
declare the SMTP client so write smtp
cap client is equal to GC new SMTP
client and the next text box name of
SMTP client arrow pointer text so this
text box name and then our pointer text
you need to write if you are using yahoo
mail so what is an SMTP server name it's
like that if gmail is providing a SMTP
server or you are using the Gmail SMTP
server you need to write smtp.gmail.com
so for example SMTP gmail.com if you are
using Yahoo then you need to write SMTP
dot
so it's like that you need to write into
your SMTP text box okay
then write SMTP client number client at
a pointer port 587 so this comes from
the port number four from Gmail for
example so if you search on internet for
example I want to search the port number
for Gmail so I write SMTP server for
Gmail port number and I opened a result
for that and you can see all the server
details it has gmail has port number
four 65 or 587 in the same way you can
find the port number of other email
providers on internet it's very easy to
find so I am choosing 587 from here am i
and I'm writing that number here so
client which is this variable name and
arrow point of port is equal to 587 then
write client arrow pointer credentials
is equal to GC new system double colon
net double column network credentials
and you need to power a pass your
username and password so take text box
of username so I will copy the name of
your my username text box which is this
Xbox username and I will pass it here
text box arrow pointer text comma text
box password arrow pointer text bracket
and bracket closed so this is client
aeroponic credentials is equal to GC new
system the Belkin net WLAN network
credential and you need to pass your
username and password here and then
write client enable SSL is equal to true
so this will do the secured connection
with your Gmail SSL is a secured
connection so if you want to use it
right
lined arrow point the enable SSL is
equal to true and then write client
arrow point ascend and in the bracket
right meal which is this variable named
Neal message variable name and if your
message is sent then we will show the
message message box double-kill show
message sent this is the name of your
message box and this is the title of
your message box so success and comma we
will provide the ok button for with your
message box so write this okay so this
is the code for sending the email okay
if you want you can propose the video
and copy the code and now when we run
our program
and we go to the mail form here then I
will write the username in my case my
username is same as my email id so I
will write my email id and from so I'm
writing from my email id so my username
and password is same not username and
password but my user name and my email
address is same so I will write that and
then I will pass my password which is
shown in dollar sign and I want to send
the email to myself so I will write the
same email id subject I YouTube and the
SMTP server which is this one
smtp.gmail.com and then I will write
some text for example I YouTube
hello something like this and some text
and I will press this same mail button
and my mail is sent and let's check if
my mail is transferred or not and yes my
mail is transferred you can see it here
so in this way you can send an email
with the help of your visual C++ windows
form application I hope you have enjoyed
