video tutorial on C++ for beginners and
in the last video which I made for this
series was the introduction to
constructor now in this video I'm going
to teach you about destructor so what
are destructor this doctor is a another
special kind of class member function
that is executed when an object of that
class is destroyed so you can say it's
the counterpart of the constructor so we
use constructor to initialize some
values and we use destructor to destroy
the object or variable when it goes out
of the scope okay so I have an example
by now you already know how to create a
simple class so I have created a simple
class called books here and I have a
constructor public constructor here and
it's nothing but the name same as your
class name so this is the declaration of
the constructor so let's see how we can
declare a destructor first and then I
will show you how to use it so to define
a destructor you just need to copy the
class name once again and just paste it
like this once again but the destructor
it starts from this symbol called tilde
this is small squiggly line nose I call
it tilde so this whenever you start your
I mean member function which has the
same name as class and it starts with
with till they sign it's got the
structure and the basic use of this
district
is to destroy the object whenever it
goes out of the scope so let's see a
small example I will output something on
the screen so I will say we are in
constructor and end line and in the
destructor we can say it's a destructor
okay so we are in destructor okay and in
the main function or in main I have
defined an object of this class or an
instance of this class so if you have
watched the last video you already know
that whenever I create any object of a
class first of all constructor is called
and once it goes out of the scope which
means once it goes at this line add at
the end of the main function it's it
doesn't III mean it's not necessary that
it's it's has to be end of the function
whenever your object goes out of the
scope then this destructor is called so
let's compile this program and let's see
what will be the result
so it's compiling let's run the program
and you see here first of all Europe is
called whenever you create an object of
class and once it reaches the end of
your scope for example the end of the
scope for this object is the end of this
function
then this destructor is called and
whenever this destructor is called all
the resources which are mean contained
by this book object are release or all
the memory which is hold by this object
is released okay so it's the destructor
is used to release all the resources
which are used by the object okay and in
between this constructor and destructor
you can do your basic I mean basic
programming for example printing some
some something or some useful work okay
so it will start with the constructor do
its work and once it goes out of the
scope then it will call this okay
so let's see once again in the program
run it you see first of all constructor
is called then it executes the code
which you write in that same scope and
whenever it goes out of the scope it
called a destructor and all the
resources are released by your object
whenever this destructor is called and
one more little important thing that I
also I mean I told you about this in the
last video I think that whenever you
don't even declare the constructor and
destructor in the class that last or C++
we will create a constructor and
destructor for you by itself so it
depends upon you if you want to use
constructor instructor for your some
useful work which you want to perform
with them otherwise your class
automatically has constructor and
destructor by default so you don't need
to define them X
recently but if you can perform any
useful task that concept and destructor
for example constructor you can
initialize some values or in the
destructor you can want to release some
resources from other variables or other
classes then you can do it with the help
of destructor so this is what is the use
of destructor I hope you enjoyed this
