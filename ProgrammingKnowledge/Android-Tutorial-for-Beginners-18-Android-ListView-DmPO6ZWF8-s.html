tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use ListView in our Android
activity so ListView you we can use
whenever we want to display some lists
in our activity so let's get started and
let's see how we can use ListView with
an example so just go to your palette I
have this blank project made and in my
activity I'm just going to drag and drop
a container called ListView so drag and
drop this container called ListView in
your Android activity okay now what we
are going to do is in order to populate
this list what we are going to do is we
are going to create an another layout
with our text boxes and then we will
populate multiple text boxes in this
list view so what I'm going to do is I
am going to right click my layout and go
to new and in here the last option is
the XML file so go to XML and then click
layout XML value and then give a name to
your layout so I will name it as for
example I want to make a list of names
so I will name it as a name list for
example name underscore list and I will
finish and this will create a new XML
file in my layout folder of inside the
resources folder now I'm going to click
this name underscore a list dot XML file
and I'm going to go to the design view
of this list
and in here this is a linear layout so
I'm going to change
this tag to text view so just change it
to text view okay and same we will do
here so we will initialize and and this
text view with the keyword text view
right now what we are going to do is we
will go to our main activity here and in
here in our Java folder we will go to
the mainactivity.java and in here first
of all we will declare this variable
called ListView so
once you have declared this list view we
can create a method for this list view
item click event right so first of all
we will make an array to populate our
list view so for example we can make an
array of string for names
you
so we have declared this array of string
and I have declared some names inside
this array and we are going to use this
array to populate our list view now
there is something called adapter and
this adapter is like a you know as the
name suggests adopter between the data
and the view okay so we are going to
declare the adapter and then using this
adapter we are going to you know join
this data and the ListView so first of
all let's declare a method so public
void and we will name it as list view
for example and now inside this ListView
what we are going to do is we are going
to first of all cost our ListView
variable which is this one and we will
find by ID
now we are going to create an adopter
for our ListView
so array adopter and this will be a
string adopter or so we will pass string
datatype for this and then we will name
our variable as adopter itself is equal
to new array adopter and in here
this takes three argument one is the
context which is this itself second is
the you know list sample list so we have
created this name underscore list layout
here right so what we are going to do is
we can call this by r dot layout dot
name list right and then it takes the
data so for us the data is this strings
of name or array of name right so we
will just pass this array of name as the
third argument and now we can use our
list view to load this so list view dot
set adopter and we can pass this adopter
inside this set adopter function okay
and what it's going to do is it's going
to load all the data into our ListView
okay now let's add some functionality of
our to our ListView so whenever we click
some item of the list it should display
the content of the list or something
like this in the message right so let's
do this first of all what we are going
to do is we are going to take our list
view and we will set item click event so
we will set item click event okay or set
on click item right
so just choose this option called set on
item click listener and inside this set
on item click list now we will create
new on item click listener and inside
this function on item click we can use
this position of the item or ID of the
item - you know display something okay
so for example we can use this position
and what we can do is using this
position we can you know get the value
of the item so I'm going to create a
string variable and I will name it as
value is equal to we will cost the value
so string and then we will take our list
view and dot get item okay so we will
take the item at the position okay and
we will pass this item called position
here or this position here so it takes
the position and now we have the you
know name of the item at this position
whatever we click ok so we will use
toast to display the value and the
position toast dot make text and it
takes three argument as we know first is
the name of your activity or context dot
this second argument it takes is the
message itself so we are going to create
some message for example
and we will take this position from here
and then we can display the value right
value and this value we can take from
this string value right okay now the
third argument we will pass here is the
toast dot length okay and then we will
show this toast and now our function is
done right so not now what we are going
to do is we are just going to call this
function in our on create method in here
and now we are going to run our program
so now our program is running and you
can see all the names are populated
inside our list and these names are
these names right and once we click on
some name for example this name we can
see the position of this name is 0
because index of the list starts from 0
and the name appears the value is Tom
right once we click this name called
mark the position is 1 and value is mark
we will click third name position is two
values John ok so in this way you can
populate our list view using your string
or or using this adopter right so I hope
