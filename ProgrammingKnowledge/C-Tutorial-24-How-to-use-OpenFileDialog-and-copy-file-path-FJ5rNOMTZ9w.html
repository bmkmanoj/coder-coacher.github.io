video I will show you how to use open
file dialog tool with your c-sharp
application so for example I have taken
a button and when I click this button my
Open File dialog will open and when I
select any file from here its path will
be shown in the message box so how can I
copy the path of the selected file I
will show you today so this is done by
using Open File dialog so let's see how
can we do that so first of all what I
have done is I have taken a button and I
renamed it text as Open File ok
and I just double clicked it and I write
this code so right right Open File
dialog and give it a variable names Open
File dialog open file dialog 1 I have
named it opened file dialog 1 is equal
to new Open File dialog bracket and
bracket closed and then give a if
condition and in the if condition right
Open File dialog 1 which is your this
variable dot show dialog bracket and
like it closed is equal to system dot
Windows dot forms dot dialog result dot
ok so if this is ok then declare a
string to save your file path so string
string file name is equal to open file
dialog 1 which is this variable dot file
new
and then I write message back those dots
show and this string will go here string
variables will go here so what this pas
code will do is first of all it will
declare a open file dialog component and
if this is true and the dialogue result
are okay then I am passing the file name
of the selected file into a string and
this string I am passing into the
message box so this matched message box
will show the part of the file so just
write these lines and if you want you
can pause the video and copy the code
also and when you once again try to run
your program and when you select open
file and when you select any file from
your open file dialog you can see the
part of that file in the message box so
in this way you can see the part or copy
the part in the string variable and this
Open File dialog I'm going to be using
in many of the further applications
which I will show you in the further
videos so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
