tutorial on C programming for beginners
in the last video I have shown you how
you can download code blocks which is a
C++ ID in which we are going to develop
our C code and we are going to compile
and run and test our code using this
code blocks now in this video I'm going
to show you how you can create your
first C program and what is the program
structure of this C program so let's get
started first of all open your code
blocks and then go to file and to create
a new program you just need to go to new
and then here you can go to the project
so go to project and in here you can
find few options but the option we are
interested in is console applications so
select this option called console
application and click go and then it
will show some message you can read this
and you can click Next and now we are
going to create a C program so make sure
that this C is selected here and click
Next and in here you need to give the
name to your project so for example I
want to give a name to my project as my
prog okay so this is the name of the
project what a name of the project
depends upon you whatever name you want
to give you can give it to the project
and by browsing this you can change the
directory in which you want to save your
program so I will leave it as default
but you can change it and just note this
part so that you can see the source file
if you
to see ok and click next and this is
generally is showing the basic
information about your project that it's
going to use GNU GCC compiler which we
are going to use to compile our
application it's going to create two
version of your project one is called
debug and other is called release for
now it's not necessary to know all these
things because we are beginners right so
just click finish and when you click
finish you will not see anything on this
window but on the right-hand or
left-hand side on the project tab make
sure it's project tab you will be able
to see a project name which is given
right by you
and a folder called source and inside
this folder there is a file called C dot
main dot C right and once you click this
file maiden dot C you will be able to
see the hello world program here now
you can press ctrl and scroll your mouse
to make your code you know font size
bigger or smaller so in order to make it
bigger just press your ctrl and scroll
your mouse okay so I'm making it a
little bit larger so that you can see
and this is the basic structure of the
program and it's called hello world
program it's automatically created by
code blocks for us so let's see we will
go line by line and let's see what this
code means so the first line or rather
first two lines which starts from this
hash symbol are called preprocessor
command there are other pre-process
c'mon also but these are the very most
basic preprocessor command and a
preprocessor command include includes a
header file into your project so
whenever you create a C program there is
already some files which we need to
include in our project in order to write
a program and this preprocessor command
which is this in hash include includes
the file name which you give here and
this are the most important files which
we need to create a simple program and
the first file is called stdio which
stands for standard input output and
this file is responsible for taking the
input or printing outputs like this
printf which I'm going to describe you
in the moment so this function function
also I will explain you in a moment but
this is due to inclusion of this file
now there is a file called stdlib.h is
this file and this file also we need to
include because mean whenever you write
a C program and whenever you compile and
run try to run this program your
compiler or whenever you run through or
run your program the compiler sees the
main function or searches for the main
function in your project and this is
like an entry point to your program so
this mean is the part of standard Lib
dot H these are called preprocessor
compiler now this int main is a function
and it's a very basic function
and its built-in function which every
program must have and by this mean C++
knows that it is the entry point of your
program so every project must have at
least and only one main function and
what is a function function is a piece
of code which you can you know execute
for now you just need to know about this
is a function is a piece of code which
you need to you know which you need to
execute some piece of code okay and the
most basic function is main and most
important also function is mean now
function has two or three basic things
one is a return type which is in instant
for integer so this is int int is a
datatype or which stands for integer and
this main is the name of the function we
just by default you have to give in
small letters and this bracket takes an
argument and for now we are not passing
any arguments so it's empty so every
program must have this mean function and
because we are returning integer we need
to end our program with return 0 return
0 is just like a success for your main
program so for now you just need to know
that if you return 0 and if you reach
till this point your program has run
successfully
okay now printf
this printf is a part of standard i/o
dot H file there is a function in
while called printer and this printer
helps us to print a string on the
terminal okay so this is a printer and
in side this bracket whatever you write
inside this printer in double quotes so
always remember you need to write in
double quote inside the brackets
whatever you write it will be printed on
the terminal so for now you are writing
hello world so it will be printed on the
terminal now this backslash n changes
the line which I'm going to demonstrate
in a moment this will not be printed but
this is a special you know string or
character which will help you to change
the line of your you know print now
every line ends with this semicolon so
this semicolon
tells see that this line of code is
ending here and from the next line we
are going to write another line of code
okay and every function is started with
these opening and closing curly braces
okay so this is the basic structure of a
C program now once you have understood
you can see every line is starting or
ending with the semicolon and it's not
necessary that you need to give this
kind of indentation you can you know
write a line of code here or like this
or you know position doesn't you know
it's not important
you can you give two line gap between
two codes or you know two lines of code
or or whatever but in order to you know
show or make your program present table
there
is you know design of a code which is
best looking so this in this way your
program looks good that's why we write
it like this now in order to run your
program you need to compile your program
and in the last video I have shown you
or I have told you what is compilation
compilation helps your program to
convert this program into the machine
language which your machine can
understand this is the code which is
readable by human but it's not
understandable by the computer so
compiler will help us to convert this
code which is human readable to convert
it into machine readable code and how
you can compile your code there are
three buttons in code loss which is this
one build run and build and run at the
same time so to build your program build
means compile compile and Bill's are
same so whenever you click it this build
it will compile your program
now there is one tab here and this tab
also has this option called build run
and run and build so you can go here
also and build your program now I'm in
order to build your program you always
need to save your program first so
always click this Save icon so to make
sure that your program is saved and then
click this build button and this
whenever you click this build button the
output of your compilation will be shown
in this build log and if you don't see
any error here you see here zero errors
zero warnings and this means that our
program contains zero errors and zero
warnings so compiler also helps us to
check whether
our program is or we have written our
program correct or not okay now once
your program is compiled successfully
with zero or errors you can run your
program with the screen but just click
this button and now our program is
running and it prints hello world and
then it prints some something which
doesn't interest us it's just thrown by
you know terminal so this is what we are
printing and it's just saying that press
any key to continue and whenever we
press any key this terminal will go so
this means our program is running
successfully now if you want to build
and run your program at the same time
you can just click this button and this
button built and run will build your
program also and run your programs when
I click this to build and run my program
at the same time now whenever you do
some mistakes in writing your code your
compiler will give an error spot example
by mistake I left some unknown
characters here after my print print up
function here and after the semicolon
which is unknown to the C compiler so
whenever we save our program and compile
it this will give us compilation error
you see error and it's showing expected
semicolon before a return right and it's
not we haven't given semicolon here so
it's giving us the error we added
semicolon but still it's unknown to your
C programs once again I compile it and
it will still give us error because
it says error this word is undeclared
right so whenever you write a code which
is unknown to see it will give you the
error and this red mark where or from
where which line this error is coming
from so in this way you can check
whether you have written the correct
program or not so this is to check also
you compile a program to check whether
you have written something or good or
you have written something which is
correct and to convert your program into
the machine language and this to run the
program you just click this button and
it will run the program so this is how
the see a structure of program looks
like and this is how it works so I hope
