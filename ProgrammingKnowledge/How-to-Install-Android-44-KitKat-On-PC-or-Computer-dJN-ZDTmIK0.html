show you how to install Android 4.4
KitKat OS on your Windows PC so for that
you need two things one is the virtual
machine and another is the Android 4.4
KitKat ISO file so I will show you first
of all how you can install the virtual
machine for this I'm using VMware Player
virtual machine there is other virtual
machine called VirtualBox you can either
use VMware Player or Virtual Box to
install android 4.4 kitkat
so in this video i am going to show you
how to install the VMware Player so just
write in your search box VMware Player
download and the first link you will
find here is download my VMware okay and
in here what you want to do is you need
to go down and search for the VMware
Player which is this one and you just
need to download it and install it in
your PC I will also leave a link below
in the description so that you can see
the video I have made earlier and how I
have installed VMware Player in my
Windows PC so just see below in the
description and you will be able to see
how I haven't told VMware Player in my
PC now the second thing you need is the
KitKat 4.4 ISO file okay so this also I
will leave a link in the description
from there you can download the KitKat
Android KitKat 0.4 ISO file so just see
in the description the link for this ISO
file okay so once you have
both of them and you have already
installed VMware Player in your Windows
PC I will just fire up my VMware Player
this is my B&amp;amp;B player and will fire up
my VMware Player and now I will start
installing KitKat 4.4 in my Windows PC
so in here I will go to create a new
virtual machine and in here I will
choose installer this image file which
is ISO file and browse for your recently
downloaded ISO file that you have
downloaded from the link I have provided
you so just download this or just select
this android 4.4 kitkat
ISO file and click open and now click
Next and you can give the name to your
virtual machine so I will give my
virtual machine name as KitKat is itself
and this is the location where your OS
will be installed so if you want to
change this location you can just browse
for the folder and select the folder so
I will leave this as default and I will
click Next and this is the maximum this
disk size you want to provide to your
operating system so by default it's 20
GB but for now for example I am going to
provide the it 10 GB for now and I will
leave this as default split virtual
machine to multiple files and I will
click Next and just see your
configurations or the details which you
have selected and if you want to
customize your hardware for your Android
KitKat 4.4 OS you can go here also
customize hardware and check if you want
to change
the hardware specification so right now
the memory I'm using is by default 256
MB I can increase it to 512 m 12 MB and

you can choose up to 16 processor
depending upon your device right and
once you are done with the hardware
configuration just close it and click
finish and now your installation of

to do is I will select create modify
partition which is first option and I
will click OK 1 press ENTER and you will
be able to see here 2 or 3 options right
