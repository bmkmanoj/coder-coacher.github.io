last video I have shown you how you can
use structures in C++ and I have shown
you this example that how you can define
a structure for a book and how you can
use or call the structure inside your
main program and how you can assign
values to your structures member right
now in this video I am going to show you
how you can use structure as an argument
to the function so in normal program we
are able to pass some argument like in
or characters or double or float values
and I have already told you in the last
video that structure is a user-defined
data type like int like care this
character end and care and int are the
C++ data type and this book for example
which you have defined in the last video
is a user-defined data which we have
created now in order to use this
structure book inside a function as an
argument you need to pass it like a
structure so let's see how we can use
this structure as an argument inside a
function now in order if you don't know
what this code is just see the last
video I'm using the food from the last
video in this video also ok
and in this within the last video we had
defined the structure and I have shown
you how you can use it now for example
we want to define a function to print
the content of the book ok so I will
define a function called void
print book and I will just give this and
I will give this not this but this
parentheses here now in order to pass
yours book structure in the function as
an argument what you need to do is once
again you need to go here in the
parentheses and you need to call the
this keyword called struct and then you
need to call the data type or the this
structure name which is book in our case
right and then just give any name to
your book structure so I will name it as
book itself and then what this book is
doing is it this book I'm I will use to
print the name or name contained by this
book variable so I will just copy it and
paste it here as you remember how we can
we can call the content of the book by
its numbers so book this is the name
variable name dot what is the member
name of this book structure book name
author and ID okay so I will just use
this book in order to print the book
name both author and book ID now this is
just simply you need to pass in order to
call this book variable inside this pair
is this tie inside this function as a
parameter or argument right now in order
to call this print function what you
need to do is just copy this function
name paste it here and as a normal
variable of how you pass your normal
variable a variable inside this function
like this right so think of it if it saw
integer variable ended this will be a
integer variable simply you will pass
any number here okay or the variable
which contains the number in a similar
way we will pass this variable of book
because we have defined this book
datatype here for this book right so
this is this book we can pass it inside
the function and now when we compile the
program and run the program it will work
fine right it's printing whatever we
have assigned here so we have a signed
book name C++ Picatta programming
knowledge book ID 1 and then we are
calling this function to print the value
book 1 name of one name is book 1 book
dot name right we have passed this and
book dot name a C++ tutorial which is
which comes from here right so in this
way you can pass structure variable as a
parameter to a function I hope you an
understood the concept behind this and I
hope you have enjoyed the video please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
