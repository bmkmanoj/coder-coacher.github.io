show you how you can download and
install NetBeans IDE on your Windows
operating system so let's get started
the prerequisite of installing NetBeans
IDE on your Windows operating system is
you need to have a Java JDK installed on
your windows operating system so we are
going to first of all install Java and
then we are going to install NetBeans
IDE so search for on your favorite
browser Java JDK and the first link
which will appear here will be from
Oracle comm so just click that link and
when you go inside this link you just
need to click ask me later and in here
you see a Java and here you will see
NetBeans but for now we are interested
in installing Java so just click this
icon which says Java and in here you can
see various types of binaries for
installing Java so one we are interested
in is this one which is Windows x64
which is for a 64-bit operating system
right so just click this radio button
first of all to accept a license
agreement and then choose this last
option for Windows operating system and
just click this and now once you click
this you are going to save this
executable file now I have already
installed this Java JDK on my operating
system but you just need to save this
file and run this executable file and
you just need to click next next next
and this will be installed on your
operating system it's not really
complicated right so just download it
and run this executable file once this
Java is downloaded and install on your
system you can find it on your C Drive
and go inside your C Drive and search
for Program Files and inside the Program
Files you can see this Java folder and
in here you will see a JDK folder and a
GRE folder so first of all we are going
to set the environment variables for the
Java so that NetBeans can use this
environment variable so go to your
search option and search for system and
in the system go to add bar advanced
system settings and in the advanced
system settings go to environment
variable and in here under system
variables you can see a variable called
path and just double click it or click
Add it so I'm going to double click it
and in here don't remove anything you
just need to give a semicolon and then
you need to give the part of your JDK
binary so go inside this Java directory
and then go inside this JDK and once
again go inside this binary so just copy
this part up to binary and then in here
give a semicolon and then paste your
path which is this one okay same we will
do for the JRE so just go back go to
Java folder on the JRE folder go to bin
and copy the path give the semicolon
once again here and then paste it here I
have already done this one we're not
going to do this but this is what you
need to do okay
once everything is done you just need to
click OK and ok and then close it so
Java is installed on your system now we
are going to install NetBeans so just
search for NetBeans on your favorite
browser and then go to the link which is
NetBeans dot o R G and once we are
inside this NetBeans dot o-r-g website
you can just click this download the
button here and once we are here you can
see various options of NetBeans IDE you
can download so you can download the
NetBeans IDE just for developing Java SE
or just for developing java ee or just
for developing you know HTML or PHP or a
c++ right
so for the longer run I will suggest you
to download this last option which is
all right which is for all you know
project types so I'm going to click this
which is 215 MB file right so just click
this and then save this file okay so
save this file at your desired location
I have already done this so I'm going to
just run this executable file you can
see this file will look like this
NetBeans - 8.1 which is the version -
Windows Exe so I'm going to just click
this executable file and click yes and
now the Installer will start I am going
to minimize my browser and now you can
see configuring the Installer and now
Installer has been started so in here
you can see all the features and you can
click Next and you need to agree with
the license terms and conditions so just
click this check box and click Next and
in here you can see this is the location
where NetBeans will be installed which
is C program file slash NetBeans and you
can see here we have downloaded and
installed Java on our Windows operating
system and this is automatically you
know detecting that directory JDK
directory and you know showing you here
if you don't have Java then it will show
you the warning that you need to install
Java right now click Next and in here
you can see it will ask you if you want
to install GlassFish and the location
where you want to install GlassFish and
the jdk folder for that you just need to
click Next once again and then you just
need to click install
now you just need to wait for this
process to complete once it goes to
hundred percent then we will you know go
further but right now I can already see
this NetBeans icon on my desktop once
the installation process is complete
it's going to say you this message which
says completing NetBeans IDE
installation so let it run and let it go
to the hundred percent mark and once the
installation is successful you can see
this message which says installation
complete successfully now you will also
see some messages like contribute to
NetBeans project by providing anonymous
usage data if you want you can leave
this check box but I'm going to uncheck
this and then finish it okay and now the
IDE is installed so we can run our
NetBeans IDE so just click this NetBeans
IDE icon
and you can see this a NetBeans IDE is
now open so I'm going to maximize it and
let's create our Java project for
example okay so you can go to files to
create a new project and then click on
new project so click it and here you can
see variety of project you can create
you can see that categories here Java
Java FX Java web or HTML or maven or PHP
or C++ we are interested in making the
Java project so just click Java category
and choose Java application and then
click Next and in here you can see it's
active waiting the Java SE environment
and then in here you need to give the
name to your project by default it's
java application per one but you can
change it for example java test ok and
then this is the location if you want to
change the location you can browse for
the folder where you want to save your
project and then here you can see create
main class so you may know that every
java project has one main class so you
can leave this checkbox checked which is
going to create the main class for you
ok and then click finish and now our
project is open so in here you can see
on the left-hand side we have our
project and when you open this project
we have a source package and inside our
java test package we have java test dot
java file which contains this code which
is for the main method right now for
example to print something you can just
write system dot out dot print line so
just search for a print line here and in
here you can give as an argument a
string variable for example hello world
hello world ok and then save your
program by
this button and then build your program
for building your program you have this
hammer like icon here so just click this
and this is going to build your program
and once this building is successful we
are going to run our program by clicking
this green button so the building of our
project is successful and now we are
going to run it so just click this Run
button which is this green button and
then you can see hello world printed
here which means everything is correct
so in this way you can download and
install and NetBeans IDE on your Windows
operating system I hope you've enjoyed
