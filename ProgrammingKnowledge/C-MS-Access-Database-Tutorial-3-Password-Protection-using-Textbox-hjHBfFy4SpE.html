last video I have shown you how to
create a simple login form with your
c-sharp and your Access database and
validate your username and password in
the Access database using your c-sharp
login page so for example I give my
username admin and password
ABCD it will give me user name and
password is correct but when I just
click this ok it also shows me the
message username and password is not
correct so we need to do a little
correction in the last video code which
I will show you in a moment but in this
video I'm also going to show you how to
hide your prod to password in your text
field so whenever you give your username
and password
whenever some user give its password
this should not be visible the password
original password should not be visible
this password should be mean masked by
some character like hash or something
like these dots or anything so that our
password can be protected from other
users so I will also show you how you
can hide this password by using a mask
and I will also correct this thing which
I have done in the last video so in this
login button double click this belongin
button and I have shown you this code
where we were counting the number of
result we have and on the basis of a
number of result we were showing these
message username and password it's
correct to click it username and
password and username and password lost
not correct so I have given here three
condition if count is equal to one if
count is greater than one as whatever
but we have this condition this should
be if and then the second condition
should be as
if right so if this is true I'll save
either this is true as they should be
true so because we were not using this
else if it was showing this result once
again because it checks this it shows
the username and password is correct
once again it checks this and this is a
different if condition so if this is not
true this will show this result so just
just use this like this as there should
be else
and your problem is fixed okay now for
the password protection so just select
your password text field and the go to
the property and search for the property
called password care okay
search for this property password care
and whatever character you will give
here password care for your text box
this character will mask your password
with this special character for example
I give here a hash symbol and I will run
the program once again and whenever I
give my username a admin for example and
the password ABC edy for example when I
give a b c e d it mask my password with
this hash symbol and when I click this
login button it says username and
password is correct right so in this way
you can hide your or mask your password
with this special character it can be
any character for example you can mask
it body with dollar symbol where is
taller yeah this taller symbol and when
I run this program that will hide my
password with a dollar symbol you see
whatever I type it will be masked by
this dollar so you can choose your mask
character and then this will protect
your password so I hope you have enjoyed
