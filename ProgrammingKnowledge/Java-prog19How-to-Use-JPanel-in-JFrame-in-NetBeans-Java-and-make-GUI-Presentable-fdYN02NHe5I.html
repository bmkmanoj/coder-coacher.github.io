tell you how to use J panel on our panel
to make our J prim more pleasant table
so it's going to started first of all
select all the buttons in right click
and go to controls and close in and
click panel so our all Britain's will be
enclosed by a panel you cannot see right
now but when I click and the model of
the panel you can see our all buttons
will be enclosed by a panel you can also
drag a panel from here and put all these
experiment into the panel that is also
one under the other method and now when
you select our panel and go to its
properties and when you go to border
border property right click here you can
give your pen any kind of size or shape
you want generally I like titled border
because we could be able to give the
title to our panel so for example I want
to give it a but open panel title
buttons
and I also want to set the buttons color
that means this text buttons color will
be shown in blue because I have children
and you can also edit your font size I
take my one stylus bold font as Agni FB
and let's make a clicking it big in size
or font click OK okay and now you can
see up at the top of our panel this name
buttons comes so this look nicer when
you use a depth in your program so once
again we can do it for our text field
and labels also just select all the
things I click and flows in both in and
click family all in unimproved on the
panel and just select the panel and go
to properties click water click title
border give it a name now I want to give
the name
employee info and let me give it maybe
some other color for example red and
I'll make it a bold little bit bigger in
size and if you want ribbon chain the
font change the font as a real click OK
click OK and you can see in this way you
can make your JPEG look presentable and
arrange new buttons and text field
accordingly and when we run the program
you can see in our current program the
immediate effect of adding the panel the
buttons and text feed look more
organized so in this way you can make
your jframe more presentable so that was
a short tutorial to use ok hello I hope
