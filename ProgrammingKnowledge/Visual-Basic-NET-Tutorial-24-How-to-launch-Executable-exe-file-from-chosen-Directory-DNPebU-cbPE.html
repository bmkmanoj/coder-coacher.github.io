shown you how to use open file dialogue
with your visual basic windows form
application so I have created a simple
form and when I click the button it was
able to open up open file dialog and in
which we can choose any files from that
now in this video I will show you how to
open or execute any exe file with the
help of your visual basic windows form
application using your open file dialog
so suppose you want to open a PDF file
or dot or a docx file or a web browser
or any executable application which you
can open with your mouse click event how
better it is or how good it is if you
can be able to do it with the help of
Visual Basic so let's see how we can do
it so I have this button and I will
change the text of this button as open
Exe file ok and now I will just double
click this button and in the last video
I have shown you this code for open file
dialog it's nothing but it's opening the
file dialog for us so we have set the
filter for all showing all the files and
we are checking that it's path is
correct so just right if open file
dialog one dot show dialog is equal to
dialog result dot okay then if the path
is OK then we will be able to open any
exe file so just right here system dot
diagnostic dot
process dot start and in the bracket
what we will do is we will copy this
open file dialog one which is our Open
File dialog name this is by the way our
Open File a loved one if you don't
understand how this come here and how to
use open file dialog just watch the last
video of this playlist and you will be
able to understand what it means
so I will write Open File dialog dot
file name okay so this is a code for
opening any exe file ok so just write
system dot diagnostic dot process dot
start and then in the bracket path the
argument open that file dialog one dot
file name now let's run the program and
I will click this button and let's try
to open some files using this so for
example I want to open a Google Chrome
browser from my Visual Basic so I just
click this and you can see it yes it it
has opened the Google Chrome browser or
for example I want to open a PDF file
some PDF fibers they are here so I will
go to the desktop and I want to open
let's see this PDF file
I click it and it will open that PDF
file let's see if it opens or not ok so
it has
opened the PDF file now for example I
want to open some more programs or some
more files for example I want to launch
this VLC media player so I can just
double click it and it will open the VLC
media player as we can open with the
double-click of our Windows application
just wait for a while yes it has opened
this VLC media player or you can open
any executable file which you can open
with your Mouse's Mouse's double-click
right so I hope you have understood how
to open any Exe file with the help of
this visual basic windows form
application and I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
