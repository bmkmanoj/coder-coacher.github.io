bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can add a
carousel on our bootstrap web page so
let's get started first of all I will go
to my index dot HTML page and from here
I will remove this jumbotron dev element
because in place of this we are going to
add our carousel and then add the
element here
first of all let's define the ID so ID
and give some name to your ID for
example my carousel and then include
Atlas called carousel slide and then one
more thing we need to add is data -
right and this will be equal to carousel
okay so add this dev element and inside
this div element first of all we are
going to add the indicators and to add
indicators we need to add this ordered
list element so just add oh L and
include a class called carousel
indicator and inside this ordered list
we need to add some list items and for
the list item we need to add first of
all data target and our data target is
what we have defined above so we have
defined my carousel here so our data
target will be this and then we want to
add the data slide number okay so data
slide two equal to and set it to zero
for now for the first slide and then
just copy this list item from here and
paste it three times because we are
going to show three carousel pictures
and you just need to change the number
here slide number zero one two okay and
to set which slide will be
active we can set this slide as active
so whatever slide you want that this
slide should be active initially then
you can add this class active to it
class is equal to now just below this
ordered list we are going to add one
more dev element and this will be for
our pictures for example and now add a
class called carousel inner and inside
this div element we are going to add one
more dev element for the item so just
add class item here okay and for the
active item which you want active you
just add active okay and this I will
explain a little bit later when we see
the demo and here you can add the source
for your image so just add image tag
here and then as a source you can add
the location of your pictures so for
example I have some pictures to show as
the carousel picture one two and three
and make sure these pictures are of same
resolution so whenever these picture
slides over each other the size of this
picture will be same okay so this is in
my image folder of my bootstrap folder
okay
so I can give the location as I am G
slash 1 dot jpg okay in a same way you
can add more pictures so just copy this
div element and paste it two more times
and you just need to change the name of
your picture picture to and picture
three one more thing you need to
remember here is unist
remove the active from other two slides
and just leave this active class too
only one image right otherwise all three
images will be active and in here I
think this should be carousel indicators
so carousel - indicators ok so just
change it to carousel
- indicators ok and let's save our code
and run it and now it looks like this so
you have your first image which is
active and you have these three
indicators right we haven't added any
controls to this carousel and now we are
going to add these controls to our
carousel okay now for adding the
controls to our carousel images what we
need to do is we just need to go below
our inner carousel develoment and we are
going to add it as a link so just add a
and add a class called left carousel
control and then add H ref or reference
which refer to our ID called my carousel
which is this one and this will be the
button for our carousel slide and the
data slide of this carousel will be
previous right and inside this what we
can do is we can add our span here and
just add this class called gif akan
space glyphicon - keV Ron - left and
this is for adding this image to the
left hand side which will be like
previous button right and same we just
copy this link element from here paste
it down and instead of left now we are
going to do it right so right and the
status slide will be next and instead of
left image we will add a right image
okay and now just save your program and
open it in the browser and now we will
be able to see our carousel images so
this is our first image which is active
and this is our indicator which was
active and then you can change from
these buttons these images so this is
our second image and this is our third
image and these are the indicator which
changes with the image so the first
indicator for first image second
indicator for second image and third
indicator for third image right and if
you wait for some time they will change
automatically
so our carousel is working now and we
can add some more properties to this
carousel for example the interval for
changing these slides so just go to your
carousel div element here and here you
can add an attribute called data
interval and here you can set the time
in milliseconds so for example I set it
here 1000 milliseconds which is one
second so your slide will change in one
second right so I will refresh my page
and now you will be able to see it's
changing every second right so here you
can you know manage your time what time
interval you want to give to a change
the carousel image one more thing which
you can do is you can add the caption to
your carousel so just go to your
carousel inner class and inside your
item here for example this item which
has image 1 just below your image
element add a div tag here and instead
of item active you can add this class
called
caption right and in here you can use
any HTML tag for example h1 and for
example you can say team 1 okay and same
we can do for other items also so just
copy this carousel caption class and go
to image - just below this paste it and
just below image 3 also paste it and
this is team two and this is team three
ok
save your code and run it once again and
now you will be able to see that there
is a caption team one here team 2 here
and team 3 here so you can even add your
captions or your text in your carousel
image so in this way you can use
carousel in bootstrap I hope you have
