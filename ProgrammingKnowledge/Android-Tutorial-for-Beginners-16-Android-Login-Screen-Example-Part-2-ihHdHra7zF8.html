tutorial on android app development for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how to design a simple login app in
Android studio so we have completed in
the last video the design part of our
simple login app in this video we will
see how to write the code behind this
button or login button so that we can
perform some actions or validate
username and password and then perform
some action on button click so let's get
started now once we have completed our
design now we will go to the Java folder
here and in here we will go to the login
dot Java folder okay so we already
designed our you know login page here so
what you can do is you can go to the
login open login from here or directly
go to the Java folder and in here go to
login dot Java folder ok and this is the
job of code behind that login page
activity right now in here we are going
to declare some variables inside our
login class and then we will add a
button action perform method 2 on create
method so let's declare some variables
we will declare to added text boxes for
a username and password and we will
declare one textview for attempt and for
1 for button so let's do this
you
so now we have declared all our
variables I have declared one extra
variable here which is called int
attempt counter so we want to provide
minimum attempt or maximum attempt to
the user so that you know for example of
you just want to provide five attempts
to the user to try login and password
and if these attempts are gone then we
want to do some other option right so
now our variables are declared and now
we are ready to create our button click
event so I will name my method as public
void login button and in here we will
just cast all these variables which we
have declared here so we will cast a
username password and the attempt and
the button our variables
you
so now we have casted all over for
variables which we have declared here
and now we are going to add the button
click event to our login button and on
the basis of this button click event we
are going to decide some action ok so
let's take this button and create our
button click event so login button dot
set on click method or and set on click
listener and then we will create a new
on click listener and inside this on
click method we are going to write our
code so first of all we want to check
the text in the username and password so
we will just write if the password so we
will get the text from the username text
field so user name dot get text and then
we will convert it to the string and
then we will check if it's equal to some
predefined username so dot equals and we
will check if it's equal to a keyword
for example user okay
or you can predefined your own username
right and we also want to check the
password so we will give the end and we
will check for the password also okay so
inside this if we will add this and
condition and then we will add for same
for the password okay so I'm going to
copy this code and paste it here and
here we will check for power for the
password is equal to pass for example
okay so what we are doing in
this if condition we are taking the text
from the user in the user text field and
the password text field and we are
matching if the user name entered is
user and password entered is equal to
this string called Pass and then if it's
true then what we are going to do is we
are going to perform some action so
let's perform some action we will just
add our toast
you
okay now this is for the condition where
username and password is correct if the
username and password is wrong here we
can if the username and password is
correct we can also redirect this
activity to the second user this we will
see in a moment but let's define the
else condition for this first so else
what we are going to do here is we are
going to reduce the number of count
right because we have defined maximum
number of count is equal to five here
right so we can you know reduce the
number of count if the login is failed
so what we are going to do is first of
all we will show some message to the
user that username and password is not
correct and then what we are going to do
is we can reduce the number of attempts
so we can just reduce this counter by
one so attempts - - this will attempts
this will reduce the number of attempts
by one and if the counter is zero we are
going to disable if this counter is
equal to zero then what we are going to
do is we are going to disable this login
button so that user cannot login animal
dot set enabled is equal to false okay
so this is the condition we are going to
write here if the username and password
is correct
we are going to show this message that
username and password is correct
otherwise if the username and password
is not correct we have
going to show this message that username
and password is not correct and we are
going to reduce this counter by minus
one and then we are going to you know if
the counter is zero then we are going to
disable this button right now we are
going to call this method in our on
create method so copy this method and
paste it in oncreate and here I can see
some error so I just want to change this
edit text to text view because this text
view for attempt count is a text view
not our added text now we will add the
code to open the new activity when user
name and password is correct so if this
username and password is correct below
our message that username and password
is correct we are going to create an
instance of intent I or whatever name
you want to give is equal to new intent
and as an argument we will pass the path
to our second activity for the user so
just open your Android manifest dot XML
file which we have added last time and
in here I just see what name we have
given here so just copy this name from
here Android colon name is equal to
whatever the name is this should start
from comm dot example dot whatever name
you have given okay and in this login we
will just in the intent instantiation we
will just paste this path here
okay so we have pasted this path and now
we just want to start our activity okay
using this intent so start activity and
just pass this intent as an argument
okay one more thing
want to do here is we want to set the
count to attempt text box right so what
we can do here is we can take this
attempt inside this login method and
just below the casting of these variable
attempt dot set text and we will set
text is equal to whatever is the counter
or current counter right now so this is
our counter and we will convert this
counter to text first okay so we will
pass it like this integer dot then to
text and then our counter here okay so
now what you need to do is once you have
you know printed your the number of
attempt this code from here and we also
want to reduce the number of count and
set this text to the attempt text box in
the else condition so once if the
username and password is correct or not
correct we will reduce the counter and
set the text to our attempt text box
here right so just paste this here okay
so this attempt door set text you paste
it two times once at the starting after
the casting of all the variables here
and second after the reduction of this
counter by one in the else condition now
we are going to run our program so now
our app is running and now we are going
to enter username and password remember
username should be user and password
should be pass in order to you know a
successful login right so we will enter
first of all successful username and
password or correct username and
password
and if the username and password is
correctly entered when we press this
login button you see it so shows this
message username and password is correct
and we are redirected to the next page
now let's try to enter some random
username and password and let's see the
response okay so once we enter the you
know random username and password and
when we click this login button it
reduces the attempts and it shows you
the name and password is not correct
once again username and password is not
correct and it reduces dot ends once
again once again and last time when we
click login once the attempts becomes 0
then this login button is no more active
okay so it's disabled so in this way you
can make a simple login application
using Android studio I hope you have
