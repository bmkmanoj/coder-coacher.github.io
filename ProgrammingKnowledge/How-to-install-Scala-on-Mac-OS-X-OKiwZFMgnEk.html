you how you can download and install
Scala on your Mac operating system so
let's get started and let's see how we
can download and install Scala
so first of all open your favorite
browser and search for scholar line and
the first link which will appear here
will be from Scala - Lang or G so just
click on this website link and once you
are inside the website you just need to
go to the downloads page so just click
on downloads and then you are in the
downloads page now the first
prerequisite of installing Scala is you
need to have Java JDK installed on your
system you can see the prerequisite is
you need to have Java eight JDK
installed ok so I'm hoping that you
already have installed Java on your Mac
operating system otherwise I have
already created a video in which I have
shown how you can download and install
Java on your Mac operating system so see
that video I will provide the link in
the description and then and then just
continue watching this video ok
so in order to check whether Java is
already installed on your system you
need to just confirm it using this
command Java - version command you just
need to open the terminal and then you
just need to give this command which is
Java - version and if it shows this kind
of result that means Java is already
installed otherwise you need to install
Java ok so I already have Java but if
you don't have you just need to download
it now the second step mentioned here is
download IntelliJ IDEA ide which we are
not going to do or download SBT which
comes with Scala which also we are not
going to install for now right I will
make a separate video how to install SBT
on your Mac operating system but for now
we just want to install Scala so I will
scroll down little bit more and you will
see in the other resources these files
right
so the first option here you can see is
for Mac OSX and you just need to
download this zip file this is a tgz
file so it's a zip file which we need to
download so I'm going to download this
zip file and once this file is
downloaded I'm going to unzip this file
and we will see how we can install Scala
so now this zip file is downloaded on my
Mac operating system so I'm going to
double click on this TD said file and
I'm going to unzip it so you can see
it's unzipped so you can see after
unzipping this file it will look like
this
so now what we need to do is I'm going
to minimize the browser and I'm going to
minimize this folder Explorer also and
once again I'm going to open the
terminal and then I will just go to the
Downloads folders so I will just write
CD downloads and I will Alice here and I
will look for my Scala folder so you can
see this is my Scala folder so next what
I need to do is I need to copy this
folder so I will just give CP command or
let me clear the terminal first of all
so clear the terminal so in your
downloads folder just write this command
so just write sudo for root privileges
and then just give CP minus R and then
your Scala folder name which you have
extracted and then just write forward
slash user for slash local and then just
write Scala this folder will not be
there so it will create this folder and
then copy the content of that folder
into the Scala folder in user local
right so press Enter who is going to ask
for your max password I'm going to just
give my max password and now it will
copy this right so let's CD to the user
local folder so I'm going to just CD
four slash user local and then I'll just
LS here you can see this Scala folder is
created right I will go inside this
Scala folder once again
so Scala and then Ellis you can see
whatever content were there in this
Scala folder or copied into the new
Scala folder which we have created
inside user local Scala now next what
you need to do is you need to go to your
home folder once again so just give this
command CD which will redirect you to
your home folder so right now I'm in my
home folder so when I give PWD I mean my
user whatever the user name is I'm in my
home folder right so in my home folder I
need to search for bash profile file
right so I will just give LS - al come
on so when I scroll little bit up I will
be able to see this dot bash profile
file if this drop bash profile is not
there you need to create this dot bash
profile but if you have already Java
installed and Java home set then it this
file will be there right so in order to
add it this file you just need to give
this command open - e and then dot bash
profile so just give dot bash underscore
profile so just give profile here and
then press Enter which is going to open
this dot bash profile in the text editor
you can see I already have some exports
here so I will go at the end here so at
the end of the file and I will paste
this line here so just paste this line
export capital path equals the path you
have set for Scala so /user
for slash local slash scala for slash
bin : dollar capital path okay
so just give this part I will give this
export in the description also so you
can directly copy and paste this part
and then just save this file by going to
the file and then + save ok and then
close this file once again ok so once
this path is set you are ready to you
know you
Scala on your terminal so in order to
just use Scala it will not directly work
so you when you write Scala here this
command will not work directly so what
you need to do is either open the next
terminal or if you want to just run this
command in the same terminal then just
write source and then dot bash profile
okay which will reload this bash profile
file so just right so is dot bash on the
school profile and once this command is
successful once again give the Scala
command and then press ENTER and then
you will be able to see the Scala
wrapping interface you can see Scala
Ruppel interface is open and then you
can print something for example print LM
and let's say I want to print hello
world for example for the first time so
I will just write hello world and then
press ENTER which is going to print
hello world again right so in this way
you can download and install Scala on
your Mac operating system I hope you've
