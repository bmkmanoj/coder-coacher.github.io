gonna show you how to delete data from
your database from your say table so
let's get started first of all go to
your palette take a button and place
into a jframe named it as delete and
also the variable name change my name it
is EMD
to eat
okay just right-click event action
action performed we will go to its
source code then first off we'll make a
try-catch block
right inch
and it's always in a catch block I write
this statement and in here these packets
right exception e so this is a trying
cache block then up here right straight
string SQL is equal to so now we want to
delete our data we have to pass the
query delete from our table name our
table name is employee info so it from
employee m4 and on the basis of which
column you have to delete your whole car
tie you should decide here so for
example I want to delete my data on the
basis of employee ID or whatever will be
here in this point I am employee ID text
field will be deleted if we wish to do
that then right there
my ID is equal to question mark let's do
that and go into a Phi now right PST
gone not
core not
a statement
and prepared statement you just have to
write SQL then
PST PST not
execute
yes you have to write and you also want
to show the message that our thing is
deleted or our info has been deleted so
we will write here Ian Paice J option
pain not show message dialog and in here
right
for example I am right
deleted
so whenever our data is deleted and if
the window will show message content is
deleted now let's try to run the program
and
that program
for example we want is to delete
employee ID five just click it and
because employee ID five is written here
and then we press the heat button the
measure message is shown deleted and
when we open run the program once again
what table will be refreshed so I think
because our people have not refreshed
under does not diluted so I put up made
some mistake
I found mistake I forgot to write here
in between PS T is equal to cannot
prepare statement SQL and PST dot
execute in between you have to write est
not set string and substring to get
because our employee ID is our first
field and it is there we are taking it
from employee handy text click so copy
the variable name and just pick place it
into your
PST is that straight
dot
we get next
and in order to upgrade the table also
we need to call our update table method
which I have made previously so capital
is immediately updated and we are able
to see that the data has been deleted
now let's run the program
once again we're trying to delete my
number five they need message from
deleted and our boy number five is
needed once again I want to delete my
four number four first date here comes
the commitment message and
instantaneously our table is also
refreshed so that was the video on how
to delete your data we got abyss and
refresh the J table I hope you have
enjoyed and please rate comment and
subscribe bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
