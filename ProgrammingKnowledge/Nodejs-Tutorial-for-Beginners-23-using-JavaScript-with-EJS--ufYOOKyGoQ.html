no gesture tone for beginners in the
last video we have seen how we can use
ejs with express and no chair now in
this video I'm going to give you some
more information about EDF and I'm going
to show you how we can use some control
flows with your EGF completing engine
and let's see how we can use it for
example you want to use our for loop Pro
which we normally use on the client site
using Kwan lube we can iterate over any
area or something like that how we can
use with the help of EGF let's see so
for that I'm going to modify this data
structure which we have so we have the
student Jason and the earlier I have
created something like that that it's
like a key value pair but in a more
complex application a student can have a
name for name age or many other things
right if you are querying within the
database it can have many you know data
data columns and then I will you know
try to imitate that thing with this
Jason so what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to just modify this array like
this and for the student ID one I'm
going to first of all add the student
name here and then I'm going to add the
students name so for example mark and
then for example let's say what subject
he has taken so I'm going to just write
subjects here and then this is going to
be an RA okay so only you can do this
square bracket and let's say this
student is of some computer class or
programming class so he has taken C+
clubs
Java for example and let's say he has
taken see also and same we are going to
do with other two to them so instead of
this I am just going to copy and paste
the code here and here also okay and
then the to the name was Tom here and
the to the meet name for the third ID is
for example John Wright and the claiming
language let's change the programming
language so for example ii should like
fish out python and let's say he like
some database mysql and code for example
we like the javascript and he like so
for example SQLite database and he likes
vehicle okay so we have this kind of for
data structure now for the students
right now this we want to show on our
client how we can do it so for that in
the last video we have created this kind
of you know render method and we have
injected this kind of JSON there right
now because we have modified our JSON
data structure so here we will take the
student Jason and then we will first of
all find its ID so that this will be
this one and then dot mome is going to
give you the name of the student
okay and then ID will be same and let's
say we want to add one more field which
is subject okay so I'm just going to
copy here and this it here and then
subject how we can extract the subject
let's see so I'm just going to this give
the line break here and subject will be
the same as the name but instead of
subject instead of name we will just
replace the main with the subject so you
can do something like this now this is
going to be
I spent as an RA to the client so the
client EGS file has to you know pass it
or iterate over this array and then you
know show the output right so here what
I'm going to do is I'm going to just add
our h1 tag and then I'm going to just
right here for example subject and then
I'm going to add unordered list or
ordered list whatever you want so for
example I'm going to add an unordered
list here so let's add an unordered list
so ul for unordered list and then we can
inject for example some JavaScript code
for passing this subjects array right so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write the name of the array so this
time the element name is subject we want
to pass this element right so we will
take this element subject and then we
will iterate over it so there are many
ways of equating over array in
JavaScript we are going to just use for
each for example ok so just write for
each and then we will are just write a
callback function to just write the
function and then just write for example
item and then just we will iterate over
all the subjects and we will print it
okay and don't forget to give the ending
bracket and the semicolon here now the
way you you know show this using EDF is
the same way you used in the last video
so you use this starting angle bracket
and then mod symbol but for the
JavaScript it won't use this kind of
equals for the code right so you just
need to use the for example this
starting and
back at Ahmad and in the end the mod and
then closing angle bracket right and
then you need to do the same here also
with the next line like this okay so you
don't need to use equals here whenever
you are using for example a JavaScript
function and then you can normally you
know add our HTML tag once again so for
example this is a list item for us so
I'm going to just write list item and
then we are going to just to print that
item so however you can now print it we
just need to print the item because this
item contains our you know data for
example subject right so the way you do
it using EGF you just need to do this
angle bracket percentage equals as we
have done in the last we do like this
right and then this would be the item
right so all the items will be equated
so let's save our code and let's run it
and let's see what's the result so I'm
going to ask for the student one so
student and then one and then refresh
the page so we got the error and let's
see what the error is
so it says syntax unexpected token then
this curly bracket so we need to search
for this kind of bracket and let's see
where it is so in our function here so I
have closed up this anonymous function
here you don't need this extra bracket
here because we are closing the bracket
for this function here right and this
curly break is this is with this one and
this is the item right there was the
extra bracket here so that's why
Sandler's was coming let's refresh the
page once again and now we see the
output right let's see the author for
student 2 and now he has def
subjects right and let's see it output
for two and three and here's the
different subject right when this way
you can remove arrays and JavaScript
code with ejs so I hope you've enjoyed
