video I will show you how to play a
simple beep sound with the help of your
fish app application so let's get
started first of all I will go into my
toolbox and I will take a button from
here and then I will change its text as
play beep and when I click this button
or sound should come so for that I will
double click this button and I will
write here console dot beep and bracket
in bracket closed and now when you run
the program and when you click this play
beep button listen to the song so in
this way you can play a beep sound with
your C sharp application to make this a
little bit interesting I'm enclosing
this in a for loop so for example I want
to play a sound five times so let's see
how this will react here also
so when I click this button the song
should come five times okay so this will
also be useful for you now I will show
you how to play a sound with some delay
so first of all go above and right here
wherever your sis using imports are
there right using system dot threading
okay just take I import using system dot
training and now with the help of this
system threading we can provide a delay
for us off for example right here Fred
dot sleep I can plug it closed and it
takes the time in milliseconds so for
example I want to give one second delay
for the sound so I right here thousand
milliseconds and when I run the program
and I will play this button
so it plays five times so in this way
you can play a beep and make your
program a little bit interesting so in
this video you have learned how to
provide a delay in your c-sharp
application and how to play a beep song
with a c-sharp application so I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
