tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are variables and how we can use
variables in Java so first of all what
are variables variables are nothing but
names which we can declare to store some
value okay so a variable is nothing but
a name which we can use to store some
value okay and in Java there is a
specified format to declare a variable
so for example if you want to declare a
variable in Java in this main method we
will go here inside our main method and
in here we will declare a variable like
this so first of all goes the data type
data type can be for example the type of
variable we are going to declare for
example we want to us store integer in
some variable then we can declare this
data type int which stands for integer
and then you can give any name to the
variable for example X and then you can
assign some value to this variable for
example 10 okay and this simply means
that X is a variable of type integer
which has a value of 10 okay so X in
this case is our variable okay and
variables are nothing but the names
which can store some values ok so this
definition is true for us now to print
any variable
for example we want to print the value
of x we can directly use our variable
like this so we just use system dot out
dot print line and instead of printing
some message you can just print X value
of x here and when you run this program
it will print 10 here right you can also
give some you know innovative names so
that you can understand it for example
my or my variable okay so it it depends
upon you what name you want to give to
your variable and then you can assign
value to it but the format will always
be the same first the type data type of
your variable second here is the name
and then whatever value you want to
assign to your variable okay now in Java
there are different type of data types
like we have declared a variable of type
integer but there are different type of
data type which we can declare and some
of the most basic data types are I am
going to show you how they are declared
so these are some of the basic data
types first is a byte variable and byte
short and int and long all can store a
number but the only difference between
this byte short int and long is their
size so byte can store one byte a short
can store two bytes integer can store
four bytes and a long can store a
bytes so the size differs in this case
okay so you can do something like this
bide my variable is equal to ten also
right or you can also do short my
variable is equal to 10 right
so a byte can be the range of bite can
be minus 128 2 plus 127 for example and
for example for short the range can be
minus 32 thousand or something like this
so the range of these increases in the
ascending order so smallest is the byte
then the short then the int and then the
long okay and all can store the numbers
now to store some decimal point value we
use float for example we want to store
some decimal value we will write a data
type called float and my for example
decimal is equal to 4.5 right and this
will store a decimal value but the
problem with a declaration of float in
this case is you need to declare float
something like this in Java because this
4.5 is natively considered as a double
and double can also store a decimal
point but it's range is 8 byte okay so
that is why we need to convert this
double value which is 4.5 to the float
value and the difference between this
float and double value is float is 4
bytes and this
is a bite okay and in the same way you
can declare a double value double can
also store some decimal points for
example eleven point five six but in the
case of double so double can be declared
as double data type okay so in the case
of double you do not need to add at this
line this float in the bracket means we
are typecasting the double value to the
float value and that we will discuss in
the further videos what is typecasting
of values the other data type is a care
so
a care value can store our character
okay for example you want to store
capital A or any single character then
you store in care value okay and the
last basic data type is a boolean
boolean can store is true for example
data type name boolean can store true or
false so it can be true or false okay so
these are some of the basic data types
in Java and these are the example how
you can declare a variable in Java and
all these variable you can print
something like this
so let's print all the variables first
of all we will print my variable second
my decimal third is my double fourth is
the character and v is this boolean
value and let us compile the program and
run it and now the result is something
like this so the first line shows 10 so
my variable contains the value 10 that
white printed 10 then the decimal value
we are printing which is 4.5 then this
double value which is one point five
eleven point five six then we have
printed this character value which is a
which is true and then we have printed
the value of this boolean boolean which
is false okay so these are some of the
basic datatypes and how we can declare
variables and use variables in Java so I
