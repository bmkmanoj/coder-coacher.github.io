video we are going to create our first
VI using LabVIEW so go to this LabVIEW
work workbench and click this blank VI
and the last video I have explained you
what this plot front plan panel and
block diagram is and let's start with
creating a simple program with this
LabVIEW so just go to your front panel
and in your controls if you don't know
how to open the control just right-click
your mouse and just click this pin down
so it will not disappear when you click
somewhere else and for this first
demonstration I am going to use this
numerical controls so I will click this
numerical control and I will take a
numerical control from here so drag and
drop here once again I will go to
Express and I will take a numeric
indicator from here so I will click this
numerical indicator and there are
several indicators here I am going to
use the simple numerical numerical
indicator and drag and drop here and
when you do this numerical control and
numeric indicator here when you drag and
drop automatically you will see in your
block diagram there are numeric
indicator and control here also and here
you will do some logical operation with
these two so for example when I increase
this numeric number from here it should
appear on my indicator I want this so
what I will do is I will open a tool
palette from here so I will go to view
and tool palette and this is the tool
palette and I will play
disconnect wire or I will take this
connect wire from here and I will just
click here from the starting and I will
just connect this numeric one two
numeric two and it's done and when you
are done connecting these two you can
run your program by just clicking this
run continuously or you can also go to
the front panel and click the same
button run continuously so I will click
this and now your program is running and
if you see here when I increase this
this should also increase so yes it's
increasing so this is very simple and
with this red button you can stop your
program and now for example I want to
add some more functionality to my
program so I will right click and this
will open my function palette here I
will pin it here and for example I want
to give some arithmetic or numeric
expression to these control and
indicator so for example I take multiply
from here drag and drop here and I will
delete this line so I will select this
line and right click and I will say
delete wire branch it will delete the
wire branch and I will put
this wire from numerical control to the
first end of this multiplies sign and
here on the second and of this multiply
I will right-click so I will right click
here and I will say create constant and
here you can give any number which you
want so for example I give five so now
whatever I enter in this numerical
indicator it will multiply that number
by four by five and show it in your this
numeric indicator this is a control okay
and I will connect this output from this
numeric indicator okay so now I have
this control which will multiply the
entered number by five and show the
output let's run our program once again
and you can see here I will enter one
here and it showing five and I will
increase this number and it multiplies
the number by five and it shows the
output right so this is the very simple
first program you can create using
LabVIEW in the further videos I will
also show you some other programming
stuff using LabVIEW so stay tuned and
please rate come in to subscribe and bye
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
