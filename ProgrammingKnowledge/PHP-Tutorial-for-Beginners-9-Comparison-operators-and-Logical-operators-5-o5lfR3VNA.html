seen how to use if statement if else
statement and nested if-else statement
in your PHP script right now in this
video I am going to show you how you can
use some of the comparison operator and
logical operators using this if
condition or in this if statement so
I've shown you the basic skeleton of
this if statement is like this let's see
what are the conditional operators or
conditionals comparison operation and
the logical operators we can use with
this if so these are some of the
comparison operators you can use the
with the if statement in the last video
I've shown you how to use this so if a
is a one variable and B is another
variable you can compare the Equality of
those two variable like this you can
just give two equal say assign and it
will check whether these two variables
are equal or not but there is one more
operator which is triple equal to which
also checks the Equality of these two of
two variables but it also checks whether
they are of same type or not so it it
checks the Equality / plus the type of
your variable so for example I have
these two variables number one which is
a string but the value of the string is
10 and number two which is also a
variable but which is initialized by
number 10 so this is a numerical
variable and this is a string variable
right because it's in single quotation
and for example I want to check the
Equality of these two variables I can
check it line test and I can echo if
they are equal I can just print
equal right and else else I can print
not equal okay so I can say not equal so
in whenever you use this double equal to
sign let's see what happens I will save
the program and go to it says equal
right but logically they are not equal
one is a string and other is a number
but what PHP is doing it's taking the
value for this which is 10 and it's
taking the value of this and compare
compare because you are not checking a
type of your variable using double equal
to right now on the other hand if you
use triple equal to it will also check
the type of your variables and then
money when you run the program or when
you just use it you can see not equal to
so this triple it will do will compare
the type as well as the actuality on the
other hand this double equal to only
checks the value whatever inside your
variable is right now there are some
other comparison variable which which
are like this if you want to compare
that if whether two values inside your
variables differ or not or not equal
then you can just give this symbol not
equal to like this you can just give not
equal to okay so it will check non
equality okay and there is one more
symbol you can give here is these
greater than and smaller than sign which
is also check the non Inc reality so if
you give this symbol also it will also
check the non equality of these two
numbers run this it will not give any
error here
right okay and this is less than science
oh it will compare the less than and it
will compare the greater than and here
you can also check non identical so
similarly it will work like this if you
use triple equals it will check the type
and equality if you give this non equal
sign and double equals after that then
it will check for the non identical
types so it will check for the Equality
and it will check for the same type also
right you can also give this less than
or equal to sign like this and greater
than it or equal to sign like this in
your comparison like this less than
equal to or greater than equal to right
like this and it will also work now
let's see some of the logical operators
which we can use in PHP with our
conditions these are called logical
operations and what are logical
operation it the logical operations are
based on some conditions so for example
a is a value and B is also one value and
a and B can a and B both are true in
that case this operation will be
executed so let's see how we can do or
perform these logical operations so in
here number one is for example 20 and
number two is ten so I can check that
the a number one is greater than or
equal to number two and and number two
for example like this you can check it
like this number one is greater than it
then number two or and number one equal
to number two
right not this one but equal to this one
okay so it will check both the
conditions there this is one condition
and this is second condition and it's
always very better to whenever you have
multiple condition use this brackets so
that you can easily identify these two
conditions okay so this and symbol will
wait for both the condition to be true
this condition has to be true and this
condition has to be true only then it
will show this equals Sutra sign or
equals to string otherwise it will show
non-equity right so in this case this
will show non equal to because number 1
is greater than number two but number 1
is not equal to number 2 so it will show
us this result right let's see it will
show us this result but for example we
are checking for number 1 is equal to
number 2 and for example here also we
can check for the same condition okay
and we can hear right then and we can
check these condition number 1 is
identical to number 2 and number 1 is
equal to number 2 and when we run it
this gave us equal T right these are
some logical operator and and you can
use it like this a and D or double and
symbol like this both will be valid in
the same way it will check for or so or
one of the condition is cube so then you
use this or sign here your if condition
will wait for only one condition to be
true and if only one out of two
condition is true it will give the
result okay
so there is an operator and or logical
operator and there is third operator
called X or the operator and you check
for
either or both conditions are not true
okay so it will basically checks for one
of the condition to be true but not both
at the same time okay so this is a XOR
operation and this when you use not it's
just and checks for the non equality
okay so it will check if the value of
this is not true so these are some of
the comparison operator and logical
operator you can use with your if
condition or else in some other cases
wherever you need to compare or perform
some logical operations in PHP I hope
