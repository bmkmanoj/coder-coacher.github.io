show you how you can download and
install send OS 7 on your VirtualBox
virtual machine
so hopefully you already have downloaded
and installed VirtualBox so virtual
machine and now we are going to download
first the sent OS ISO file and then we
will see how we can install it on our
VirtualBox so first of all open your
favorite browser and search for sent OS
and the first link which will appear
here will be from sent OS dot o-r-g so
just click this link and in this website
you just need to click get sent to us
now and then there will be three options
available to download for you so what I
will recommend is the DVD ISO version so
just click DVD ISO and then this website
is going to show you the mirrors of your
no mirrors of this ISO file which are
near to your place so you can see actual
country and then you can click any of
the link which is going to you know
enable you to download the sent os ISO
file ok so click any of the link from
here for the for example I'm going to
just click the first and you can see
it's a 4 GB file so you need to wait for
a while to let it download ok so I
already have downloaded this 4 GB file
so I will not download it again but you
need to download it you know on your
computer first of all ok and once this
send to s ISO file is downloaded is
going to look like this which have the
extension of ISO now we are ready to
install it on our VirtualBox so open up
your VirtualBox virtual machine and here
first of all we will create a new
virtual machine so just click this
button which says new
and then just type here send OS or any
name you want to give to your operating
system right now automatically type here
will be selected Linux and version will
be selected Red Hat
which is fine right so because sent to
us is really close to Red Hat but it's a
free version so it's ok to select here
right at 64 ok and then click Next now
in here the memory size which is given
here is 5 1 2 megabyte but I have
according to the memory available on
your system you can always increase it
so for now I want to increase it to
around to 2 GB ok you can even increase
it to 4 or 5 depending upon the you know
memory available on your system ok and
then I will click Next now in the next
step it says create a virtual hard drive
now which is OK for us and next option
which says use an existing virtual hard
drive which you don't want to use right
so just leave it as default which is the
middle option which is create virtual
hard drive now and then click create and
here the option for hard drive file type
is popped up and we need to you know
choose or by default its VDI format and
it's a standard so you don't need to
change it and just click Next and in the
next step you need to choose the storage
on the physical hard drive so by default
it's dynamically allocated which is
really good because if you have the
sword shortage of you know memory then
it will be dynamically allocated and if
you choose fixed then only fixed amount
of memory which
however you allocate to your virtual
machine it will it cannot be you know
increased it will be fixed so I will
recommend to choose the dynamically
allocated memory and then click Next and
minimum you know hard tricks or hard
drive size which sank 2's need is 8gb
but it depends again on your you know
computer what how much size or hard
drive size your computer have and
according to this you can you know
locate the hard drive right so I'm going
to choose a little bit near about 20 GB
and I will just click create and then
it's going to create the sent OS virtual
machine on VirtualBox but still you need
to do some settings because remember we
have downloaded the ISO file but we
haven't given the location to this ISO
file so just select your send to s
virtual machine and then click setting
and the settings you can see there are
several settings you can do from here so
in general when you go to advanced
setting the second option says shared
clipboard and if you make it
bi-directional you will be able to you
know copy some text from your host
machine for example I have Windows as my
host to your sent OS operating system so
you can copy and paste text from you
know from your Windows operating system
to the virtual machine which is sent to
us and second is the drag-and-drop just
make it bi-directional right next is the
system here you can once again evaluate
the base memory which you have allocated
and if you want to increase it you can
increase it right
next option is processor by default the
VirtualBox locates one CPU to your
virtual machine but again you
can increase it to two or three or four
I will make it use two CPUs okay and
then the next option is acceleration
which is fine for us the next
interesting option for us here is
storage and from here we are going to
give the location of our ISO file
whatever we have downloaded so just
select storage and then go to controller
IDE and then select this empty CD here
and then select this round CD icon and
then click Choose our virtual cd/dvd
disk file and from here just copy the
location wherever you have your sent to
s ISO and then give the location of your
sent to us okay and select and then just
open ok and then click OK so now you
have done the configuration of your
virtual machine for sent to s then we
are ready to start if so just select
once again your send to s or virtual
machine and then click start is going to
start the installation of send to s now
this process is a little bit lengthy so
you need to be patient
it can take around 15 minutes so first
option here it says install send OS so
we need to install it so just press
enter here in this stage and now the
installation for the center s will start
so now the installation of sent to s has
been started and it says welcome to send
to s and from here you can choose the
installation language so I will leave it
as default which is English but you can
choose any of the languages available
here ok and then click continue which is
going to give you this option just click
capture and then click continue once
again now in the next step send to s
will give you few settings to do so the
first category
here is the localization second is the
security third is the software and
fourth is the system okay so we will do
one by one each setting so first is the
date and time setting and if you see
this pop up in between your installation
you can just click this checkbox and
then click capture and then once again
click on this date and time setting and
from here you can choose wherever you
are situated right your location so for
example I want to choose Europe from
here and then I want to choose Berlin
okay once you are done with this
location then you can click this button
which say it's done okay
so date and time settings are done then
the keyboard setting by default it has
chosen English keyboard for us but for
now my keyboard is German keyboard so I
can just add this German keyboard by
selecting the German language so if you
have any special country keyboard you
can choose it from here so German
keyboard I will just add it and after
adding it just click done here now the
next setting is the language support you
can choose any language support from
here for now I will leave it as English
but you can choose whatever language
support you want and then click done
here okay now in security just click the
security policy and for now I don't want
to change anything here so I will click
done once again and then the
installation source it's going to ask
because we have already given the ISO
file path so it's going to auto detect
it and we don't need to anything right
so click done once again and then we
have software selection this is the
important step because from here you're
going to choose what kind of environment
sent to s environment
I'm talking about what kind of sent to s
environment you want to install right so
there is minimal install compute node
and basic web server
so what mean or what I am going to
suggest you is I'm going to choose this
option it's a server with GUI okay and
these are you know these all the
software's you can install later also so
I am going not going to check them right
now but you can anytime install them
later okay
for now just choose server with GUI and
then click done and now the important
step which will appear here will be the
installation destination ok so just
click this option and for now everything
is ok because we have already given the
size and just make sure that this
automatically configure partitioning is
selected from here and then click done
from here and after this setting is
saved you can see this begin
installation button is enabled and you
just need to click begin installation
now the installation will start
automatically which is going to take
some time but they in between this time
you can set your root password and you
can even create a new user so we are
going to create both the things first we
will create root password and in here
you just need to give the root password
whatever you want so I'm going to give
the root password as I need and just
remember this root password which is
going to help you whenever you want to
you know use sent to s as a root user
and then click done and the next thing
is we are going to create a user so just
click user creation and the user name I
want to give here is code bind
and username I'm going to leave it as
default so full name and username will
be same for me but you can change them
okay and then give the password for the
user and then once you are done with
this you can even make this user
administrator ok so just click this
option which says make this user
administrator and then click done so we
have already created our new user and we
have set the root password now we need
to wait for some time until this
progress bar reaches 100% and we need to
wait for the installation to complete so
I will pause this video and wait for the
installation to complete so now the
installation of Sint OS on our virtual
machine is done and it says sent to s is
now successfully installed and ready for
you to use go ahead and reboot to
restart but before clicking this reboot
button just go to devices here on your
VirtualBox so there will be a tab called
devices and then go to cd/dvd devices
and uncheck this option which says sent
to s 7 dot ISO file
okay so uncheck this option and which
will give you this pop-up just say force
unmount ok so once this option is
unchecked then you can click reboot here
so just click reboot and once you see
this black screen here you can go ahead
and click machine here and just say
reset ok so go on machine and just say
reset and then click reset here ok which
is going to restart your machine so just
choose the first option again which says
send to s Linux or if you don't choose
this option it's going to automatically
you know choose this option and then
it's going to start the send to s
virtual machine again ok
so when you're sent to s operating
system reboots for the first time and if
it shows you directly the login screen
then everything is fine but if you see
this message which says initial setup of
sent to s Linux 7 license information
license not accepted
please make choice from 1 to enter the
license information C to continue and
are to refresh if you see this kind of
message then what you need to do is you
need to you know enter into the license
information and then accept the license
information so for that you need to
choose the option 1 so just press key 1
n 2 1 and then press enter which is
going to show you this kind of message
which says press 2 to accept the license
agreement so this time press 2 and then
press enter and then you will see a
cross before this 2 number before this
message which says I accept the License
Agreement right so there is a cross
before this 20.2 right and if you see
this cross before this point 2 then you
just need to press Q to quit ok so press
Q to quit and press enter which is going
to give you this option which says you
need to reboot yes so you just need to
write yes here ok so just write yes here
I have I just need to write yes and then
press ENTER again ok which is once again
going to reboot your sent OS and this
time hopefully we are going to see the
login screen so now I can see this login
screen first of all I will click on the
user which is code bind and then I will
give the password which I have set
earlier and now I will
see the welcome screen now in here we
can see this very welcome screen and in
here you can see application and laces
right so now this sent to s installation
has been successfully completed and you
can start using send to s right now
after first login once again sent to us
we'll give you this these options which
says select your language you just need
to select your language once again and
then click Next here and just click Next
for everything and then just say start
using sent OS Linux now once you are
logged in in send to s you may want to
first of all enable your internet so by
default the internet is disabled or off
so we need to enable the internet and
for that you just need to click this
small arrow button here and then go to
wire and by default it's off so you just
need to click connect and then your
internet will be connected right so
let's check whether the internet is
connected or not so we are going to open
up Firefox and let's see if it works or
not so let's search for send to s itself
and press enter so Internet is working
right so in this way you can install
send to s on your VirtualBox virtual
machine I hope you've enjoyed this video
