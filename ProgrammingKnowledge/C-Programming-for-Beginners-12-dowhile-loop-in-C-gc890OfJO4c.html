last video I have shown you how you can
use loops in c and i have shown you how
you can use a while loop in C now in
this video we are going to see how we
can use do-while loop which is one more
kind of loop and what is the difference
between a do-while loop and while loop
okay so let us assume that we want to
execute the number or integers from 0 to
10 as we have done in the last video but
this time we want to do it with the
do-while loop okay so this was the code
we have written in the last video which
I am going to comment because later in
the video we will see how or what is
difference between do-while loop and
while loop so let us see what is the
syntax of the while loop first so you
just write the keyword do and then gives
give the semicolon and after the
semicolon at the end of your curly
braces or this is not semicolon this is
curly braces sorry and at the end of
your curly brace you just write while it
should be while and then you give your
condition okay so keyword do and then
curly brace then while then your
condition now once again for example we
want to print values of integer from 0
to 10 I am going to copy this code in
here and it will print the value 0 to 10
and the condition will be same as
earlier which is while I is less than or
equal to 10 okay and I will just compile
this program and run the program
and it prints the value 0 1 2 3 4 up to
10 right and in here what's happening is
first of all your eye is equal to zero
and it says doo doo means do something
so before checking any condition your
statement will be executed which is this
one so it prints I is equal to zero and
then it increases I buy one and now our
value of I is one which is less than ten
right so it goes in the loop once again
and it prints I is equal to one and in
here it increases the value of I is by
one once again so I is equal to two this
time then two is less than or equal to
10 which is true once again it will go
in this loop until I is equal to ten now
I is equal to ten
this will be true and it will this will
be printed but now when the value of I
becomes eleven this is false this
condition is false and as soon as this
condition is false it goes out of the
loop
okay so what is the difference between
this do-while loop and while loop the
difference is while whenever we use
while loop it checks the condition first
and then execute your code but in the
do-while loop it executes your code at
least once and then checks your
condition and if this condition is true
it will once again go into the statement
here and it will execute a statement and
as soon as this statement is false it
goes out of the loop okay so do loop or
do-while loop executes your code at
least once without checking the
condition but while loop checks the
condition first and then executes the
code now
let's see what is the basic difference
here so for example I will just give the
separator or I will print some separator
here so that we know that the code above
the this the star line is for do-while
loop and code below the star line is for
while loop right and I will compile this
program and everything is fine it prints
from 0 to 10 which is okay
and because value of I is the same here
right so here value of I will be 10 once
again so what we are going to do is here
we will take instead of I we will take
variable J in while loop so J here I
will replace J here and J value of j is
equal to j j plus plus right why I have
done that because the value of otherwise
the value of I will be same for this and
this and we will never find the
difference between the two loops once
again I will run the program and it
prints this value I forgot J here so I
must give J here also and once again I
will compile the code and now you can
see it prints the value of first of all
I and then it prints the value of J okay
so it starts from 0 I will just make it
bigger so that we can see all the values
so the value of I start from 0 up to 10
and value of J start from 0 up to 10 my
battery is going so I must hurry up I
think so
right so value of I start from zero to
ten and the value of J start from zero
to ten now let's see the difference here
now for example I will give some
condition which is not true okay so for
example I am checking whether I is
greater than ten which is not true
because value of I is zero 0 is not
greater than 10 right and in this case
also value of J is greater than 10 we
are checking which is false because
value of J is zero which is not greater
than ten J is not greater than ten what
happens here run the code and we see
that value of I is equal to zero which
is it prints value of I is equal to 0
and then it increments the value of I by
1 so I becomes 1 1 is not greater than
10 so it goes out of the loop so what we
have seen that do loop performs your
statement at least once and then checks
the condition but in the case of while
loop here J is equal to 0 0 is not
greater than 10 so nothing is executed
from this while loop okay so nothing is
printed here so this is the difference
between while loop and do-while loop so
always remember whenever you want to
execute your code at least once use
do-while loop and whenever you want to
check the condition first and then
execute your code then use while loop so
I hope you have understood the basic
concept of do-while loop and difference
between do-while loop and while loop and
I hope you have enjoyed this video
