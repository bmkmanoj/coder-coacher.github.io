teach you what is polymorphism and how
we can use polymorphism in C++ but
before that I must recommend you that
you must know the basic concept of
inheritance in C++ and you must have
some knowledge of pointers so if you are
following these videos you can find the
lesson on inheritance in the video
number 32 so I will strongly recommend
you that please watch and understand how
inheritance work first and then watch
this video because polymorphism depends
upon inheritance strongly so I must
recommend you to watch that video and
then see this video okay so what is
polymorphism if we see the literal
meaning of polymorphism then
polymorphism means having many forms so
typically for name autism occurs when
there is a hierarchy of classes and they
are related by inheritance right so the
polymorphism or the property called
polymorphism we can use where we are
using inheritance or classes are related
by the hierarchy of inheritance that's
why I was stressing on watching the
lesson on inheritance okay now how we
can use inheritance in C++ not
inheritance but polymorphism so I'm
going to take an example from the video
number 32 which in which I have shown
you how inheritance works okay so this
was the example I have used in video
number 32 and what I have done in that
video
I have declared a class which was a base
class and this class I named it as shape
and what my purpose of you know creating
this class was I wanted to calculate the
area of some polygons for example
triangle or rectangle or any other
polygon okay and I wanted to calculate
the area of that those pal polygons
using a base class because every polygon
has the property that it has height and
width okay and you can calculate the
area of triangle for example square
triangle or rectangle on the basis of
height and width okay so I defined in
that video and in which I have teach
taught you this inheritance this class
called shape and this has a public
method set values and this has two
member variables which are height and
width okay so if you don't remember just
watch the video on inheritance and you
would know okay so we have this class
and in which we have two variables
height and widths to calculate the area
and we have a member function called set
values and this member function what it
was doing it was just a setting whatever
argument are passed to it to the width
and height okay so we have this base
class now I have defined two derived
classes which are inheriting from my
shape base class okay so I have defined
a rectangle class which is called a
dread derived class and I am inheriting
from my base class
shaped glass and what I am doing here I
have only one member method here which
calculates the area of rectangle okay
and how I am calculating the area of
rectangle because I am inheriting from
the base class shape the member
functions public and protected member
functions are available in this class
also from the base class that's why I
will be able to use the member functions
just like height and width from shape in
my derived class which is a rectangle
class and I am just multiplying this
height and width to calculate the area
okay so this is the area of rectangle in
a similar way I have I'm creating a
class called triangle and this has also
one member function which is calculating
the area of triangle and the area of
triangle is height into width divided by
2 right
so I will divide it by 2 and this is
because we are also inheriting from
shape in this triangle class also so the
member variables and member function
public and protected member functions
are available in this triangle class
also to use okay so this gives the area
of triangle in triangle class and this
member function area gives the area of
rectangle in rectangle class and to set
the height and width we are using this
base class shape okay
now what I want to do is I have already
told you what is polymorphism
polymorphism is having many forms so
what my goal is I want to you know
define my rectangle class and my
triangle glass in terms of my shape
class so what I can do first of all I
will define the instance or object of my
rectangle class rectangle R EC and in
the same way I will define the instance
of my triangle class TR I for example
and then what I am going to do is I am
going to create an instance of this base
class shape okay and I call it a poly
for example because shape I want to
calculate the area of polygon right
polygon that means rectangle or triangle
so I will name it as poly and I will
define the pointer to this objects like
this if you don't know pointer I have
already you know shown you how to use
pointers in previous videos you may want
to see those videos if you don't about
know about pointers so I have defined a
object which is a pointer and which
points to this is important which points
to the address of my rectangle class
okay which points to the object of my
rectangle class this is this point this
is the object to the rectangle class and
when we use and it is a address of this
object and what is the pointer if you
remember pointer is a variable which
points to the address of the another
variable and this is a rectangle
variable right now okay and because why
we are able to do that because there is
a property in C++ that whenever
you inherit from a base class to are the
right class you can define an object in
terms of derived class object like this
okay in a similar way I can derive a
poly - so let let me name it
this is poly one and this is poly two
and I can do the similar thing with
triangle object or try object so what I
am doing I am defining a pointer which
points to the address of my triangle
class object and this is really the
essence of polymorphism so what you have
done you have defined a class in terms
of other class or this poly or this
shape has you know many forms
once it has the rectangle form once it
has triangle forms and what is
polymorphism having many forms right I
have already told you in the starting of
the video so this is solving our purpose
we can define poly object or polygon
object or shape object of shape in terms
of rectangle also and in terms of
triangle also right so then what we can
do simply we can use this poly object to
set the values for example poly and if
you remember whenever we define a
pointer to the class we use this arrow
number so this is like this not
underscore but - and then arrow okay and
we can set the values and in this values
we can define any values to calculate
the area so the how height for example
is 10 and with this 20 for example in a
similar way when I want to set the width
and height of the triangle I can set it
like this poly - this should be poly -
and then I can set it the same function
I can use from my shape class to set the
values okay now I want to calculate the
area of both the both triangle and the
rectangle so what I can do I can just
simply call so I will just see out STD :
see out and then I can call my triangle
or rectangle object here dot I can just
call the area member function from my
rectangle class if you remember this
class has a function called
area I can just directly call this area
function because it's calculating the
area or depending upon the height and
width and height and width we have
already set so it will give the area STD
and line in a similar way I can just
print the area of triangle right I just
need to use this TR I and I can
calculate the area of triangle I will
build my program and I will see if it
has some errors or not and if it
compiles I will draw on it and you can
see it gives two values 200 which is the
area of rectangle which is 10 multiplied
by 20 and 100 which is the area of
triangle which is 10 multiplied by 20 by
2 okay so once again in order to use
polymorphism you have to have the
hierarchy of classes in terms of
inheritance always remember that and
whenever you want to use polymorphism
the basic definition of polymorphism is
to define a class or two class which can
have many forms more than one forms and
this is doing the same of a say shape
instance is having rectangle form in one
at one place and our shape object has
triangle form at another place so you
can assign or define other polymer
polygon classes for example square or
any other polygon classes and you can
even define that polygon class if you
are hand inheriting from the shaped last
in terms of the other classes also and
you can calculate a area or whatever you
want to calculate so this is the basics
of polymorphism in C++ I hope you have
