last video I have shown you how to use a
chart with your C shop application now
in this video I will show you how to
connect your chart with the database so
for example in my database I have a
database called database this one and it
contains some data tables so for example
I want to show the name versus age graph
from the database so these are the all
names and compared to that I want to
show the age so I want to compare all
the ages of all the employees for
example then how can I represent this in
the chart I will show you today so I
have already written a program and when
I click this button all the data of the
employees or all the ages of employees
will be converted into the chart so
let's see so if you can see from here
John is 27 age mark has 55 Patrick has
22 so in the same manner this age comes
here right so how to show this age I
will show you in the code so first
we'll stop debugging this one and now
the core so just double-click your load
button which we have seen load chart
button which we have seen in the last
video when I have shown you how to use
this chart okay then the will click it
and just comment your previous quote
when I have shown you how to write a
code for age score was his name and now
you will write this code so first line
is the connection with the database so
right string constrain is equal to W
code data source is equal to localhost
then semicolon port is equal to three
3:06 username and password this I have
shown you
I think multiple times so I buy the this
time you know what is this then write my
square connection con database is equal
to new MySQL connection will pass this
string variable and then write my skill
c'mon c'mon database is equal to new
MySQL command and in the command query
you need to pass this so write select
star from database dot e data that is my
database name dot my table name and I
have written starved because I want to
take all the values from the database of
the table and then comma your corne
database connection which is this one
okay then right
my SQL data reader give it a variable
name my reader for example then open the
connection just copy this variable and
dot open and then write my reader is
equal to come on database which is this
variable dot execute reader then make a
while loop and write my reader dot read
in the bracket bracket close and in that
while loop we will pass our chart array
or chart code so this is a one line code
you can write it in two or three lines
but I have really cut down the code and
put it into only one line so just write
this dot your chart name which is this
one just go there and copy your chart
name which is chart one in my case so
this chart dot series and the name of
your series this thing I have shown you
how to define the name of your series in
the last videos if you don't know dot
points dot add XY and then make a big
bracket and in that we will pass two
variables one is for name on the x-axis
gamma other is for age so just copy this
- my reader variable which is my SQL
data reader dot get string because name
is a string variable or data type in my
database so if you
see in my database the name is a bear
care which is equivalent to strength and
the age is int that's why I have shown
you this in the case of name I'm writing
my reader dot ket string and your column
name and in the case of age this is your
x axis and in the case of y axis which
is your age if my reader dot get int 32
so this is an integer we are taking from
the database and the column name of the
table okay so basically we are running
this into the loop so it will go through
every row and it will put into your
chart right so it will keep on reading
until the table completes so if you want
you can just copy the code from here
I think screen is not capturing the
whole code but you know what to do okay
so just pause the video and copy the
code and let's try the code once again
so I will write username and password
and when I click load table if we give
me all the ages of the names so name
versus age crotch you get basically the
idea is here just to pass
your table column well column names of
table Gong content into the chart and in
the loop so it will read all the table
rows if your table data is string then
write getstring if your table data is
int write int or otherwise if you write
a table data dot so get so from here you
can choose your data type character data
type name date time decimal double float
so you can choose whatever data type
your column has okay so just change your
column data type in my reader dot get
whatever data type of table is table
column is so I think you understand the
basic concept behind that if you are
able to understand this and this is all
in the try-catch block because when you
are executing the query or your program
if some exception comes then it will
show you the error in the message box so
this is really essential in order to
find any errors in your code or any
unwanted exceptions so I think you have
learned something new this time please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
