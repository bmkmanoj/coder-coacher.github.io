show you how you can use multiple
document interface or MDI with your
visual basic windows form application so
let's get started to start with I have a
sample project which is a blank project
so just make a blank project which have
only one form which is form 1 dot TB oh
maybe sorry ok and in order to make this
MDI container or multiple document
interface container you just need to
select this form and you need to go to
the property and search for the property
called
is MDI container by default this
property is false so just search for the
property called is MDI container and
make it true
so I will make it true and you will
instantly see the change in your form
and it becomes a MDI container now in
order to implement child in this MDI
container child's in this MDI container
I will make two new forms from 2 and
form 3 so I will just click my project
right-click it and I will add a new item
and I will select windows form here and
I will leave it as form 2 dot V B so
I've created one more form which is
called form 2 and let me make it make a
new form which is called from 3 dot V B
and which is a windows form ok so I
created two more form form 2 and form 3
which I will use them as a child
ok so now what I need to do is I will go
to my first form and let's use a menu
strip for opening form to and form 3
inside our form 1 which is our MDI
parent so I will just drag and drop menu
strip from here by from my tool box and
in here it will create this menu strip I
will just name it as
new and I will just go to here and I
will say forma to and form three now I
will just select my form to item which
is this item and I will go to the event
and I will just click on this click
event okay which is already selected
just double click in this box two times
and you will reach to the form - tool
strip menu item underscore click event
and in here what I need to do is I will
need to declare an instance of form two
so I will write them F 2 as new form 2
and now we need to specify that which is
the parent of this F 2 or which is the
MDI parent of this F 2 so right now we
are in form 1 right which is a parent ok
so this is the parent form 1 and we have
gone to this button click event or form
- tool strip item ok so just write F 2
dot MDI parent is equal to me why we
have written me here because it's the
same form form 1 ok so form 1 is the
parent MDI parent of form - ok that's
why I have written I am the apparent is
equal to me and then just we need to
show it so f 2 dot show ok the same
thing I will do it for palm-tree so just
select form 3 men use menustration
and just go to event then just go to
this click event and double click this
and we will reach to the form
a tool strip menu item click event and I
will copy the same code here
but I need to change this instance to
form 3 F 3 F 3 and this will be formed 3
ok so just I written the same code busk
I have changed it for form 3 now when I
run the program it it's opening form one
which is my MDI parent right and now it
has a menu strip and when I click this
form 2 it should open forum to inside my
form one which is MDI appearance so
let's click it and you can see from 2 is
created inside my form 1 ok let's create
form 3 so I will click form 3 and you
can see from 3 is created here and I can
minimize it you can see here and I can
maximize it also ok so from 3 and 4 me
too
ok and I can create multiple instances
of form to inform 3 it's not that only
one instance will be open so you can see
here two instance of form two are open
right now same is for palm tree two
instance of form 3 are open right now
multiple instances of forms we can open
using this method there is code to open
only ones instance at the time you just
need to google it it's really easy to
find this kind of code and you can
optimize your project according to the
multiple document interface in Visual
Basic so I hope you have enjoyed this
