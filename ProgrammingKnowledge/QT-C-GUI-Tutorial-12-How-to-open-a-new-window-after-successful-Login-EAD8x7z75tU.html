with our cutie tutorials we have seen
how to make a simple login page with
your QT creator GUI application so when
I enter some username and password and
when I click this login button it shows
me the status whether my login and my
user name and password is correct or not
and my login is successful or not
so when I click it I see the user name
and password is correct or otherwise if
I enter the wrong password then it saves
me it's not the correct username or
password in this video I will show you
how to open a new window if your
username and password is correct so
generally what happens when you log in
if you are username and password is
correct then you are directed to the
next window which is the main user
interface of your application or
otherwise if your username and password
is wrong then you will stay to the same
login page until your user name and
password is correct so let's start by
making a new window or creating a new
window so I will go to edit and I will
go to file and I will say new file or
project and in here I want to add a QT
application so I will go to QT &amp;amp; QT
designer form class and click Choose and
you can choose the template what type of
template you want so I want the template
dialog without button and I will say
next
and you can name your second windows I
named my second window as employee info
window so here I will perform some
action or some tasks related to employee
data using SQLite database as we are
using SQLite database in our previous
videos also so and then I click Next and
I click finish so you will see a new
window which is blank right now and here
when I go to add it I have one login dot
edge and I have this new dot H file
called employee info dot edge and new
CPP file called employee info dot CPP
and new UI file called employee info dot
UI so first thing what I will do is I
will go to this login dot H and I will
include first of all this employee info
dot edge in here because I want to be
able to call this from my login page so
I will say include employee info dot H
and included and then I will go to my
login UI here double click it and I will
click my login button which I have shown
you in the last videos and I will go to
slot and click OK and this is the code I
have shown you for the login button or
login application so when you login this
was the code which I have shown you in
the previous video I think video number
eight or nine I have shown you how to
make a login button action perform so in
here what we need to do is if our
username and password is correct so here
in here where this count is equal to one
if you don't know this code just go to
the video previous videos and see where
I have shown you the login application
using QT
so it's in the playlist of QT tutorials
so just go there and watch the video
where I have shown your login
application and in this code where I
have written this if count is equal to
one what I will do is I will just cover
it with these curly brackets and here
the count if the count is equal to one
we have we are showing the message on
our label that our user name and
password is correct and if our user name
and password is correct we want to open
the new window and hide this login
window right so first of all what we are
going to do is we will display the same
message or username and password is
correct and then we will say this
arrow pointer hide so what this will do
is it will hide the current page which
is our login UI and then we will create
our object for the second window which
is our employee info dot H or employee
info dot UI so we want to hide this
login page and we want to open this new
employee info page so what we are going
to do first we will make employee info
object
and then what we will do here is we will
copy this object and we will say dot set
model true so this will set model is
equal to true and once again I will copy
this object and I will paste it here I
will say dot exe C okay so I will I have
written these four line of code in order
to hide the present page and run or and
open the new page right so now I want to
check whether my program is running or
not so I will click this run and I will
say save all and it will build and it
will run
so it's showing me some errors that I
have this I don't have this destructor
or constructor so let's see what can I
do I will clean my projects so I will
click build I will click clean all and
once again I will go to build and I will
run this queue make this queue make is
successful and once again I will build
my project let's see this time if my
build is successful or not and you see
it this time my build is successful so
when if you get any error just clean
your project and run queue make and then
play build your project and now I will
run my project it's running so first I
will enter the wrong user name and ID so
and let's see what happens so I press
login and it says username and password
is correct that means we are not going
to the second window we are staying to
this window because my username and
password is not correct and now let's
see what happens when my username and
password is correct so now I have given
my username and password correct and
when I click this login button it opens
my second window or my employee info
window and it has disappeared my login
window that's what I wanted so in this
way you can make the project to open the
second window on successful login so I
hope you have enjoyed this video and you
have learned something new this time
