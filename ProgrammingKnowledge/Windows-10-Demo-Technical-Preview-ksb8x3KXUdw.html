released Windows 10 technical preview
and in this video i'm going to review
Windows 10 so that we can see what are
the new features Microsoft Windows 10
can have so this is the technical
preview I have downloaded and if you
want to download this on your Windows 8
PC I will leave the link in the
description so that you can see how to
install Microsoft Windows 10 technical
preview now let's see what are the
features Microsoft has added in its
preview and it could be the features in
the official release so first of all
what we were curious about is this menu
is it still there or the tile menu will
be there let's see so when I click this
menu this menu start menu is back so you
have your Start menu but with your Start
menu you also have these tiles here so
it could be the mix of both the world
Windows eight tiles menu and our loved
this menu bar here now this looks like
really neat and from by clicking this
button you can either shut down or
restart your computer or you can see the
account info by clicking this button
here and you can also search for all
apps by clicking this button here or you
can go back or you can search for your
apps by going here and for example I
want to search games and give me the
result games right so and when I click
this it opens like
this and once again I will go to the
menu bar and when I want to see this
file menu it can present me the submenu
also like this so if you be the feature
from you can say Windows 7 and once
again when we want to see all apps you
can see it here from here and this style
menu you can adjust it according to
yourself you can readjust this move it
above or down these tiles so you can
customize these tiles one more neat
thing Microsoft has added in this
Windows 10 technical preview is the
resizing of your menu so you can resize
it if you want this kind of menu or
whatever you know size of menu you want
you can resize it according to yourself
the other interesting thing Microsoft
Windows then has added is this search
button here so you can search your apps
using this search or you can search even
internet using this search so for
example I want to search for documents
for example and it will give me the
result for documents from your computer
or from your internet you see and one
more thing Microsoft has added is let's
see the command prompt so for example I
go to the search and I search for the
command prompt this is very nice and I
was you know expecting this for the long
time that this command prompt earlier we
will not be able to resize it but right
now you can resize this command prompt
to the whole window
and you can even cut copy or paste stuff
in this command round which we were not
able to do earlier so for example I open
notepad and in this notepad I can paste
something so notepad and notepad and for
example some text I want to paste it and
I want to just copy this text and paste
it here so you can paste it just ctrl V
and it will be pasted or one more good
thing is when you right-click your mouse
it will be pasted also so this is also
neat or you can just copy all these
stuff from your command prompt and paste
it into your notepad also like this so
this is really good in this command
prompt and then all the features in the
command prompt are same I think I
haven't gone really in deep in this
command from but I hope it will be nice
the other new feature I can see is this
task view but before that I want to see
the icons have they changed any items in
this file system or not I think these
all icons looks as same as Windows 8
just this desktop icon is different but
all other icons I can see are same
almost the same if not exactly the same
but the real interesting thing I was
talking about this add a desktop so if
you have ever seen
Ubuntu desktop it gives you different
desktop in the environment or desktop
environment so you
and place your stuff in this different
desktop so for example I have opened
some holder some other thing paint for
example and Internet Explorer here on
one window and you know my window is
full on for now
desktop is full and I want on a new
desktop so I can just click this task
view here and I can click this button
add a desktop and now I have a new
desktop which is clean but my old
desktop boy is having the old apps open
here so now I have two desktop and I can
add these desktop from here and from
this task menu you can even close these
apps so from this X button you can close
these apps from here for example I want
to close this I can close this right
like this right and I can once again go
here and one more interesting thing I
found in this in this Windows 10
technical preview is thus you know when
you drag and drop to the corners of your
window you can just resize your app like
this but whenever you drag and drop you
in earlier versions you need to drag and
drop the other things to this side but
in Windows 10 it expects that whenever
you want to drag and drop here you want
to resize these other apps which are
open also so you can it automatically
you know gives you this view and you
want to you know resize this option also
so you can just click this and resize it
to three sizes accordingly here or you
can just drag to the top and now the
other app is
and here you can just click this app and
it will be fitted here so this is also
an new feature and I think it's a really
nice feature and what else we can see
all the windows 7 menu item or menu main
menus are here so if you like this
Windows 10 you can also give feedback to
windows by clicking this windows
feedback button and you can cave the
feedback to windows if it's bad or code
or whatever you can give your feedback
so I hope you have liked this review of
Windows 10 and I hope you have enjoyed
