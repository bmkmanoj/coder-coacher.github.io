it and let's refresh our page and this
is going to add this home menu item here
and you can see it's selected or it's
active right now right because it's
giving the effect that this home item is
clicked right so when we leave this list
item as empty class and just refresh the
page it will not be selected okay so
this active we add to show that this
item is active right now okay
now in the same way you can add some
more list item for example about and
this time I haven't added any you know
let's leave it as default like this and
I haven't added any class active here
right so once i refresh the page i can
see this is active and this is not
active right and so now we want to add a
drop-down menu for example in our
navigation bar how we can do this so
there is first of all list item so we
will add a list item here and we will
end this list item with this closing tag
and we have included this class called
drop-down okay and this will add our
drop-down menu item to your navbar right
now first of all we will add this item
here like about so I will just copy this
and I will explain you everything one by
one so
for now let's remove this thing okay and
this okay so what I am doing here I'm
creating a CH wrap here and what it's
doing you can provide any reference or
website URL here so for example when I
click this toggle menu it will go to the
web page related to this LAN
menu item right and we are importing
this class called drop-down toggle so
when somebody clicks this learn button
this toggle or all the items in this
menus should toggle or should collapse
or if they are collapsed already they
should you know contract back or
something like this we will see what
it's doing in a bit let's save it and
let's refresh it and we have learn but
right now it's like same as these other
menu item home and about nothing we can
see which says that it's a drop-down
menu and for you know making it look
like a drop-down we add this class
called carrot okay
so let's add at last which will be bold
after this learn so just add this and
which is with the bold item for example
okay so add this class called carrot
and refresh this page I will add this
small triangle here and now user will
see and yeah he will come to know that
it's a drop-down menu so he can
once this clicked this class is called
called drop-down toggle and it will
toggle your drop-down menu okay now
inside the drop-down menu we have to add
some menu items right so to add a menu
item it's the same procedure like these
right unordered list and inside
unordered list some list items so this
time we will add this unordered list
like this just below your reference and
I will just close it you al with
backslash and inside this unordered list
first of all I am using this class
called
drop-down menu which indicates that it's
a drop-down menu and then in the list
item first of all we can add list item
first of all we can have some header
list item so we can add a li and we call
a class called drop-down head okay so
drop-down - header okay and this shows
that it's a drop-down header for your
menu item right and for this you can add
any name for example examples and just
close your list item like this and then
we have some normal menu item inside
your menu right so we can add some menu
items like this
list items and these are normal list
item these are not head or something so
whenever somebody clicks the C++ it will
go to the C++ paid for example
programming knowledge dot o-r-g / cpp or
/ Java so let's save it and let's see
what happens
refresh the page and I can see this
first of all head up little example and
then sub menu item you can see so C++
and Java right let's add in the same way
one more header so just copy all these
three things and paste it like this and
this time for example I say tutorials
okay save it and refresh the page and I
can see two headers drop down handle
example and tutorial and then some
submenu item C++ Java and C++ and Java
for example and when I collapse this I
can see this button and when I click
this button I can see if menu items once
again I can see the drop down menu here
and both like this okay so in this way
you can add a navigation bar on nav bar
to your bootstrap page I hope you
