MongoDB database tutorial for beginners
in this video we will see how we can
perform limit sort and skip methods on
reading your documents so for example I
have these document all the documents
are listed here and for example I just
want to limit the number of result up to
three how do I do it so the command will
be the same as we have used in the last
video
DB dot students dot find and then inside
the find we were using projection in the
last video so we will use the same in
this video so first of all give the
empty curly brackets and in the second
curly bracket we will give the name of
the field which we want to show so for
example you want to show the student
number and the attribute it takes is one
which is going to show it right
the second element for example we want
to show is the first name so we will add
first name here and this also will be
one so it will show it and the third
element we will give here is the ID and
ID we want to hide and by default ID
will be shown in the query so we want to
hide it so we will just give 0 here
right and then we will execute this
command and it gives us this result now
to limit the number of result of 3 or 4
for example we used a method called
limits so just call a method called
limit and give that maximum number of
values we want to you know match so for
example you want to only match four
values just give four here and then
execute this command and it limits the
value up to four right let me copy this
and now we will see how to sort or first
of all let's see how to skip the data so
for example we
want to show the result except first to
raise values right so we want to show
the result from three four five six so
we can use the method called dot skip
for it so it's going to skip these
values so just write skip and whatever
number of value you want to skip so for
example I want to skip two values and
show all the other result then I can do
this and then I will execute my command
and it shows student number three four
five six and the first two it has
skipped now for example we want to use
skip and limit together what we can do
so what we can do is for example you
want to skip the first result and then
we want to show the next three result so
we will use first of all skip so we will
skip first two results so just you skip
it will skip two result and then we will
call limit and it will show the three or
next results okay so execute this
command and gives the three four five
results so first two skipped and next
three are shown here right
the next command is the sort command so
let's see how we can sort it so just
give the same command and instead of
using the limit we use the command
called sort here okay so just call a
command called sort and then in the
curly brackets we need to give the
element which we want to sort so for
example we will we want to sort on the
basis of the first name right we want to
sort on the basis of first name so just
give the first name here and then when
you give here one so it is going to sort
it in ascending order so let's execute
this command and it gives error to us I
think instead of using comma views must
use colon here and then execute it once
again and it gives us the result in the
sorting order of the first name so you
can see the
names will stop it start with C comes
first then D then k then M then as so
it's sorting according to the
alphabetical order
now if you want to sort the name in
descending order we just use minus 1
instead of 1 here right and then execute
this come on and now it's sorting in
descending order so s come first and
then am that K then D then C ok so in
this way you can use limit skip and sort
methods on your documents in MongoDB I
