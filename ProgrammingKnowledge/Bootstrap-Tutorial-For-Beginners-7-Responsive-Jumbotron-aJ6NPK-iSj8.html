bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use Jumbotron
in bootstrap so let's get started till
now we have made our navigation bar and
photo so I will write this code between
the navigation bar code and the footer
code so just go between that and in here
just add a div tag here so they've lost
and we will import the container class
here so container and after this
container we will just close this div
tag and inside this div tag we will add
one more dev tag and this time instead
of container we will add a class called
Jumbotron okay and I will save it and I
will just open it in my browser and you
will see a small grey area just below
your navigation bar which is this one
and this is due to this Jumbotron class
so Jumbotron you can use whenever you
want to highlight some content in your
web page right and for example you want
to add some HTML markup inside your
Jumbotron how you can do it you can do
it easily for example a h1 tag so I will
just add h1 tag like this and I will
just write something so hello world for
example okay and I will save it and I
will refresh this page now you will see
this hello world like this okay but
right now this hello world is not
aligned at the center right now it's
aligned a default on the left right so
to align this hollow world on the centre
you just need to add just go after this
Jumbotron and just add
text- Center okay
so text Center and save it and refresh
your page and now your text is aligned
at the center right now sometimes you
may want to cover a whole width of your
web page using Jumbotron right now it's
leaving this white area and this white
area on the left and right hand side so
to cover this what you need to do is you
just need to just cut your Jumbotron div
tag from here and just paste it above
your container right so earlier it was
below the container right just paste it
above the container and now what will
happen let's refresh the page and you
see it covers the whole width of your
web page so it's on you what kind of you
know Jumbotron design you want right now
you are seeing here you may observe here
that this Jumbotron is merging with your
nav bar right so in order to resolve
this not a problem but this little you
know confusion what we can do is we can
make a new CSS class which is our custom
CSS class so I will make a new custom
CSS so I will save it as custom dot CSS
right and I will save it inside my CSS
folder in my bootstrap folder so this is
my CSS folder inside my bootstrap where
my boots have CSS and other CSS files
are saved and this custom CSS file I
will save it there right and then in the
index dot HTML file I will just include
this custom dot CSS file so go to the
location where you have included your
bootstrap dot min dot CSS file and in
here
I will just copy and paste this moose
tramp
MnDOT CSS and instead of bootstrap dot
MnDOT CSS I will just add custom dot CSS
my custom dot CSS so it will include
this custom dot CSS which is also in the
CSS folder in your bootstrap folder and
now you just need to go to your custom
dot CSS and you just need to give some
style to it so to the body
just write body here and to the body we
will add a style padding top and we will
add for example 70px here so 70 pixel
and to the padding bottom padding bottom
we will add 20 pixels
okay so 20 px okay and now save this and
once again refresh your page and now you
will see between your navigation bar and
your Jumbotron there is a padding here
there is a space here okay so if you
want to add some padding here you can
add it like this now for example you
want to add some more content to your
Jumbotron you can just add some more
HTML tags for example I will add a
paragraph tag here which I have already
created just below this h1 tag okay and
this is some random text and I will save
it and then I will refresh my page and
now it'll look like this okay so you can
add your HTML markup to this Jumbotron
like this you can add buttons you can
add some different you know tables or
any HTML markup here and I will show you
in the next video how you can add
buttons to this Jumbotron or to this
