node.js troll for beginners in the last
video we have seen how we can send JSON
data to the browser from nodejs right
and this was the code I have written in
the last video now in this video we will
talk something about routing and we will
talk how we can you know route our theta
and cater different responses for
different requests right so let's get
started what I'm going to do is I have
taken the last video code here and I
have added one more line here which is
logging the requested URL okay just this
re q dot URL I have added this code
extra and everything is same from the
last video example okay and now what I
want to do here is I want to first of
all run this app and I want to just open
my browser and refresh my browser so the
base URL here is forward slash right
this is the URL now for example I want
to request something like API for in my
URL I want to add forward slash API and
I want to request some data when I
request or I extend my URL with this
forward slash API and when I do this you
can see the request is gone with the
different URL but the response is same
right and for example I want to add
about page and I will press Enter
it gives always the same response
whatever the requested URL a is you can
see I have requested the for slash API
URL or four slash about URL or for
example
let's say the you know response is
always the same so how we can route
these different URLs according to the
request we want to send the response so
let's see how we can do it so I'm going
to go to the code once again here and
first of all I will use this URL to
parse which kind of you know request is
coming to us and then on the basis of
this request we can that cater the
result right so you can see I have
already made index dot HTML in the
previous videos right so this is just a
sample HTML which I have created in the
previous video so for example I would
say this is my home page ok so I will
just add home page and when somebody you
know requests either the URL forward
slash home or just the forward slash
there then I want to cater this index
dot HTML or home page there so what I'm
going to do here is first of all let's
just take the space here let's make the
space here first of all we will add the
code to parse that URL so just write
request which is the first argument here
the quiz point or dot URL is going to
give us the URL and then give triple
equals remember I'm using triple equals
because it's always a good practice to
use triple equals instead of double
equals so try always using the triple
equals right and then I want to match it
with for example forward slash home or
if it's only a forward slash ok
so I'm just going to copy this and paste
it here
and if it's a forward slash then what I
want to do here is I want to give the
text response so I will just copy this
line of code but this is HTML right so
instead of this I can just say text or
slash HTML right now in the next line we
are going to create the stream of our
HTML page and then we will send it this
will be HTML yeah so FS dot create read
stream and we want to create the
restream from our index dot HTML so we
can just directly give index dot HTML
which is already present right and we
will pipe it to the response so we just
write to pipe and then just write
response or re yes okay so this is going
to just send the index dot HTML when
about this home is requested or the base
URL is requested or else we can just
write if or you can better write as if
right so just write if and if the
request URL is for example the chase and
object so I will just say triple equals
API so this is just kind of API and
whenever this API is requested then we
want to give this JSON objects or just
create if condition and inside my if
condition I want to send all this JSON
data right something like this okay
so what will happen now I'm going to
just forward format it just right click
on your visual studio code and just
click format it's going to format your
code right and let's saw rerun our code
once again so close the code and rerun
it once again and now when I do for
example just a base URL press Enter
is going to show us the home page which
is the index dot HTML it's sending from
the soul or whenever we write here
forward slash home you will see the same
response the home page but whenever we
write here API for example API then it
gives us the the JSON response right and
in the same way we can you know give
different referee response hundred
different requests so let's add one more
response for example for example I want
to have a about page so I'm going to
create about dot HTML so I will just say
about dot HTML and in this about dot
HTML I'm just going to copy the code
from index dot HTML and I will just say
here about page ok so this is my about
page and in my app dot J's I can just
copy this code from here I would just
say else and my code the code which I
have copied which is this code and
instead of home I will just add about
here and I will just remove this right
and instead of index dot HTML I will
just replace it by about dot HTML right
and let's run the code again and let's
see if it works or not so I'm going to
open the browser and this time I will
just ask for about that gives us the
about page right or and it gives us the
home page right now for example let's
say I'm just requesting some random URL
once again it's going to you know
request it but it's not never going to
get any response from the
because server cannot resolve this URL
right now in this case whenever server
cannot resolve the URL ideally we want
to send the response four zero four
which is not found right so let's add
this response so in the last condition I
will just add our else condition which
is the last condition for us and let's
create a 4 0 4 HTML page so I'm going to
right click and just this my 4 0 4 dot
ta ml page right and once again I'm
going to just copy the HTML content from
index dot HTML or about both HTML and
paste it here and I will just write here
4 0 4 and I will just write not found
right and now I will just add the
condition here so if the else condition
just copy these two lines once again and
here I will just try the force 0 4.0 and
instead of giving 200 response this
response I will replace by 4 0 4 right
which is not found status code and let's
run the code again and in the browser
let's try this random URL again and now
it gives the 4 0 4 response to us okay
so oh and we have about and we have our
API which is just JSON response or any
other random URL will give the 4:04
response right so in this way you can
you know route your request and give the
response according to the you know URL
requested now there are much better ways
of routing your requests
and using some extra modules or
third-party modules and this is what we
are going to see whenever we will learn
how to use NPM modules right so there
are you know thousands and thousands of
third-party modules available to perform
different functionalities so we can use
these modules using NPM and this is what
we are going to see in the future how we
can use these modules so all these
things can be done in a much easier and
professional way so I hope you have
