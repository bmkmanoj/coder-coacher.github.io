video I will show you how to use charts
or graph with your C sharp application
so let's get started we are going to
need the chart tool for that so go to
your toolbox and in the go-to data
section and pick up this chart tool from
there and place it into your form and
resize it according to your need so like
this and I will need a button to load
the chart so this and I will change the
name of this chart text of this chart so
load chart and we are going to write the
code for this before writing the code I
want to show some properties of this
chart so just select this chart and go
to the properties here and search for
this series in the properties and just
click this button and you come to the
properties so for example you want to
show the name versus age chart of column
type so it will show bars on a chart
right and I want to change this series
as age so I will go to the name here and
I will change it age okay and also there
are more useful properties which you can
use from him like you can choose a
background image for your chart so just
go to click that button and just just
take an image from there and just select
it and it will show into your chart you
see I have picked up a image and it's
showing in my chart already so in this
way you can customize your chart there
are some more properties like border you
can design a border for example I want
to show a red border and I want to show
green bars so this also you can change
and in here you can select what type of
graph you want to show so by default
it's selected column but you can also
change the type to line or whatever you
want what type of chart you want you can
just select from here so just to the
settings and your chart is ready to use
okay
and now just click this load button and
first of all just see the name of your
chart so this is chart 1 and just
double-click your button in here we are
going to write a code for loading a name
versus age chart so I will write this
dot chart 1
dot series and in the series you will
pass the series name in my case its
age then dot i think these brackets are
square bracket instead of these brackets
okay and then white dot points dot add
XY point and bracket and brackets used
so we are going to show the XY chart in
our chart frame so here we are going to
pass two variables one is name on the x
axis so for example double quotes max
comma his age 33 okay so this is the
fourth first bar of your chart so if you
just want to show more just copy and
paste and edge will remain same because
it's the series name and just change the
name mark le
20 50 and 40 for example so write this
and now let's try to run the program and
once again username and password is
correct and here we are so whenever I
press this load button my choice should
appear here I press it and you can see
the chart for the age versus name comes
here okay but suppose you want to show
the scores of the these persons also so
we want to show the age of these names
and you want to show what score they
have scored so how can I achieve this
two bars in a same chart I will show you
how you can achieve that so just stop
debugging and now so here in the
previous way I have shown you only one
bar chart but in this example I will
show you how to show two or more than
two bar charts in the same chart frame
so just select this chart once again go
to the series and we will add a new
member and just change its name once
again you get you will find it here
itself so this time I want to add score
of those names score and all the things
are auto if you want to change the
color you can change what I want to
leave everything as default so just I
left everything default and you already
see two bars on your chart and the code
for it
just go to the button button click event
and here we will make some spaces one
more and just copy the same code here
and paste it just below that
and this time the series name is score
so I will change the name spore yeah
yeah yeah and this course now I want to
represent so for example they score some
marks out of hundreds so one ma max
scores 90 marks calls for 70 marks ko
sauce 56 and Emily scores only 30 marks
so write this code and try to run the
program once again username and password
correct and when I press this load
button you can see both bars are
appearing according to their age and the
score so in this way you can utilize
this chart to show your own data and
this chart can be used in your
application in the next video perhaps I
will show you how can you link this
chart with your database so I will be
having some data in the database and I
want to link this chart with the
database values so how can I use that
and how can I achieve that I will show
you probably in the next video so please
stay tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
