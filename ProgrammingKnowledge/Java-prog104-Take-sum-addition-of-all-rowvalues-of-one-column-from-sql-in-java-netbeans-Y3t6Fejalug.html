video I will show you how you can take
the sum of your rows or your database
values so for example if you want the
sum of all of your ages how you can do
this
in Java I will tell you today age is not
logical to make a sum of Ages but
sometimes you require that for example
you have to calculate a bill and for
example here instead of age prizes are
given and you want to calculate total
price and show it into a box then this
video is for that so right now I don't
have those kind of logical data so I
will show you how you can take the sum
of your edges so I will go to my
NetBeans program here what I have done
is I have taken a text box and I named
it as text sum which will show the sum
of the ages and this is my button which
will when I press will give me the
result so for example I will go to this
event action and action perform and here
what I need to do is first is make a
try-catch block so I have already done
that
in order to save the time
so now after making your try catch block
what you need to write here
first of all declare your string name
SQL query string you will write a query
so I will select select age from my
table name so I will see what it was my
table name and table name is this I will
copy my table name and I will paste it
here this is my column name age is my
age column name so I will do like that
and in here you have to enclose this in
two methods like this and before this
bracket you have to write some so you
have to write this query this query will
add all of your rows or all of your age
ages and now we will show it into the
text box
don't preparedstatement and SQL and
after that you're right well business is
equal to es t not execute query and then
right if I get negative if s dot next
and in here we'll declare a string
string variable as sum is equal to the
Paris dot get string
and after that closed and here I mean
right what I will copy this whole some
age thing and I will paste as it it's
here so this will what well it will do
is it will take some and it will place
some in this string variable and after
that I will trip to retrieve it
I have to creep it in to this text field
called text some so I will copy this and
I will go to my code will paste it dot
set text and in this variable based here
so now whenever I will run my program I
should see the some of Ages when I press
give result button so I will run my
program once again
and this is my program and here is my
give result button so when I press this
button I should get all the some of my
edges so let's press it and this is the
sum of my age and one more thing you can
do is you can take your update table
method which fills your data into your
table for it
you know this is my update table method
and I will go to my game result
actionperformed method and after your
try catch block if you paste this object
table and run the program
now it gives you the same result the
result of ages which is 358 so for
example I will add one more value which
is
Bob sorry this this should be employee
ID Bob his age you choose he is a meal
and I will save the data not a saint and
when I press it it should it will show
me the result which is different because
26 is added to 358 and whenever you
press this button your table will be
refreshed also that's why I copied and
pasted the update table method so in
this way you can take the sum of your
column values I hope you have learned
something new and please rate comment
and subscribe and now I also have my
blog so you can visit it and leave your
comment there also thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
