tutorial on C++ programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are STD maps and how to use maps in
C++ so first of all what are what is a
map in C++ so map or maps are
associative containers that stores
element formatted by combination of key
values and the mapped value so unlike
vectors which maintains their values on
the basis of index the maps maintains
their values on the basis of key so maps
are associative containers and if you
know of us or if you have learned about
associative arrays or associative sets
you know that in association of sets or
arrays there is a key and on the basis
of key you can assign the value or to a
container now let's see how we can you
know declare a map in C++ so to include
a map what you need to do is you need to
include our library called map so
include map ok and now to declare a map
you can just declare a map using STD map
and then in these angular brackets you
can define your key and value data types
so first argument in this angular
brackets is the key data type for
example we can define our key data type
as integer like int or
float or STD string it can be key can be
anything string character integer
offload now for our example we will
define key as integer and the value as
for example string okay so suppose we
want to make a map of some student based
upon their ID okay so using this map we
can do this so ID we will save in the
form of integer and that will be the key
of our map and the names we will save as
strings right and let's name of a map
variable as name map okay now to use map
or to insert values in the map it's very
simple to insert value in a map like
this so just take a variable and then in
the square brackets you just provide the
key because our first element of first
data type here we have defined is the
key data type so key is integer in our
case so in this square bracket we define
the key for example key is equal to 1
and then we define the value after equal
to so we will assign the value to this
key which is 1 for example Tom and in
the same way we can add more elements to
the map okay
you
so now we have defined a map of some
values and here one two three four five
are called the key of our map and the
names are called
values right now depending on the key we
can access the values for example if you
want to access the value of the map
where key is equal to four
okay so we can just write STD C out and
at the name of our map variable so named
map for example and then you can just
call this key using the square bracket
for example 3 and then once again STD
and line okay and now once I run the
code it gives me the value mark right
because key I have associated to mark is
3 now because maps are associative you
cannot provide the duplicate key to two
values so for example someday you decide
that we will assign a key for or key for
the name John and the name some other
name also ok so in this case the first
assignment will be valid so there is
there are no duplicate keys or you
cannot create duplicate keys inside our
map ok so for example I will try to
access the value of named map for and
run the program it will only give me the
last assigned value ok and not the
our previous values okay so it's not
possible to you know have two similar
keys because you cannot duplicate keys
in map right because they are
associative now in order to iterate over
the map what you can do is you can use a
iterator so there is a special class
iterator and using which you can iterate
over the map
so using for loop you just need your map
you
okay so this is called the iterator and
we can iterate over these values like
this so first of all in the iterator you
can print the key using this iterator
like this so just copy the iterator and
the key is accessed by the function
called first okay and the value is
accessed by a function called second
okay
so this is key and the value is I T dot
second and here we can make it a little
bit fancier like this okay and now when
I run the program it give me error
because this is a pointer so I should
use these arrows here instead of dot
notation and now when I run the program
I can print the values with keys and
values so key is equal to one then the
name associated with this key is Tom and
key is equal to two name associated with
is max key is equal to three name
associated with it is marked like this
so it will iterate over whole map and
show you the values right now you can
also print the size of the map like this
so the name of the map dot size okay and
this function will give you the size of
the map so
runs to run it once again and it says
map size is equal to five okay so the
size function gives you or returns you
the size of the map now there is a
another function called arrays or first
let's see the function call clear and
clear as we have seen in vector it
clears the map so now you will you know
after clearing the map you will just
empty your map so I will call this clear
here and then we check the size of the
map after clearing the map and the
result will be zero okay so map size
becomes zero after clearing your map so
it deletes all the key value pairs okay
now there is an other way to insert the
values to a map right and that is let me
comment this and that is using a
function called insert so just the name
of your map dot insert and it takes our
pair so there is something called STD
pair and using this as TD pair you can
create a pair of two datatypes
so our pair is integer and string pair
because our map is you see integer and
string pair right so I will give the
integer and string pair here and then in
the brackets you can give the key first
and then the name okay
it will print this other values in the
map or it will add these other values
with key six and seven to the map okay
now for example you want to search
something inside a map how can you do it
there is a function which you can call
over your map and that's called a find
function and the iterator IT and then
your value so ii because ii as we have
seen in this for loop indicates the
value okay so it will find the value
five inside your map and store it in the
citrate and using this iterator you can
find the second value of this so I will
close this and run it once again and you
can see key found and the value assigned
to the key five is Patrick you can see
here also right on this iterator using
this iterator you can even delete the
value after finding the value here okay
so for example I want to delete the
value where key is equal to five so what
I can do is I can just call a function
on this map called arrays will erase the
key value pair where a value is equal to
five because we are finding value here
right once again we will run our program
and now you can see here in the for loop
it has printed all the values except the
value five because we have already
erased this value right now there are
some other interesting interesting
functions in map for example if you want
check if the map is empty or not so you
can just I will just call is empty and
on the map you can just call this
function called empty map dot empty and
it gives you the value true or false and
if it returns true then map is empty
otherwise it's not empty so right now a
map is not empty so it returns zero
right but for example or we clear our
map after clearing our map clear and now
I will run the program now it returns
one because our map is empty right so in
this way you can use map</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
