bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can add social
media icons to our website using font
awesome so first of all what we need to
do is we need to install font awesome so
go to your favorite browser and search
for font awesome and the first link will
be here from font awesome right so just
click this link and in here just go to
icons so in here you can see there are
plenty of icons which you can use in
your bootstrap web page right so for now
we want to use a social media icon for
example Facebook I cannot Twitter or
Google+ or some other social media icons
so for example we have this Facebook
icon here I can click it and I can add
this Facebook icon using this code right
and you can also see some examples how
you can manipulate this icon in
different style for example bigger size
or smaller size or let's click this
example here and here you can see you
can size your icon in different sizes or
there are different styles which you can
use with your icons so here all the
examples are given now first of all we
need to install font awesome to have
these icons on our bootstrap back pitts
so what we need to do is just click this
get started button here so get started
and in here there are different options
of having font awesome on your webpage
first is the simplest way you just need
to copy this link here and add it to
your web page or otherwise you can
download this font awesome CSS and then
add it to your web page
so we will just choose this option for
now which is using the link so just copy
this and go to your index dot HTML file
and go to the top where you have all the
CSS link here so just before below this
you can add this link for font awesome
right so this will include font awesome
CSS to your webpage and now you are
ready to use these social media icons
right now we are going to add these
social media icons for example to the
footer here okay so for that we need to
go to our footer code which we have
written in the previous videos this was
the footer code and our brand is on the
left hand side so we can add these
social icons on the right hand side so
go inside the container and I'm going to
copy this div element 4 and navbar text
and then paste it here and this time
instead of pull left I'm going to have
pull right so right okay so this is
going to add these social media icons on
the right hand side okay and instead of
this I'm going to add these icons in the
form of a link right so we need to add
this link tag here and then you can add
your icons right so first of all I'm
going to close this link and now go to
the font awesome website and select your
icon and just copy this code from here
right so I'm going to copy this code for
adding this icon and paste it inside
this link tag okay and this is simple so
I'm going to save it and I'm going to
refresh my webpage here so refresh it
now we can see that this icon is little
bit smaller than the size of our
so if you want the bigger size for this
icon what we can do is just go to the
font awesome website once again and in
here go to examples and in here when you
drag down you can see how you can have
bigger icons okay so to make your icon
bigger you have these options or this
will increase your icon size by two this
will increase the icon size by 3x + 4 X
+ 5 X for example we want to increase
the size by 2 X just copy this FA minus
2 X go to your code and add it with your
class name right save it and then once
again refresh your webpage and you will
have the bigger icon size right in the
same way you can search for more you
know social media icon and add it to
your webpage so for example if I want
some more social media icons like this
you can replace this by Twitter or
Google+ and then you can have these
social media icons and now I have
replaced these icons with Twitter icon
and Google+ icon save this and refresh
my webpage and I can have all these
three social media icons Facebook
Twitter and Google+ right so in this way
you can add font awesome and social
media icons from font awesome to your
boots app web page I hope you have
