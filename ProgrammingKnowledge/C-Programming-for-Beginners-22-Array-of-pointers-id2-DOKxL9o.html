tutorial on C programming for beginners
in the last video we have seen what are
pointers in C and how we can use
pointers in C and I have given you a
simple example how to declare a pointer
and how to assign values to the pointer
and what is a pointer a pointer is a
variable whose value is the address of
another variable which we have seen in
this line so this and symbol if you add
before any variable
it shows the address of the variable and
this address we can assign to a pointer
variable like this now in this video we
are going to see how we can use arrays
with pointer so let me give you an
example for example R we have array
called value array which contains for
example 3 values so we can define array
of size 3 like this and we can
initialize array with these three values
for example for this value is 30 second
value is 40 and third value is 50 right
and now we can assign this array to a
pointer in a same manner we have
assigned a variable to a pointer
variable right so for that we need to
declare a pointer array so we will name
it as pointer array and in the same
manner as array we will give the size to
the pointer now to assign the values
from array to a pointer array we just
need to use for loop to iterate over our
array so we will write for int I is
equal to 0 I should be less than 3
because our array is of size 3 then I
plus plus
and then inside our for loop we can
assign the values from array which is
this array to the pointer array like
this so we will just use the pointer
array variable name and in the bracket
we will provide index as I so it will
increase as the value of I increases is
equal to the address of the array index
right so this variable but the address
one by one right so we will add this
which indicates we are going to show the
address or we are going to access the
address of the variable which we write
just after this and similar so we are
going to write access the address of
value RA at index I okay and hopefully
in arrays when I have shown you how to
use arrays using for loop and how to
access the values of array using for
loop you know this concept of iterating
the values of RA using for loop so I am
NOT going to repeat this basically this
for loop we are going to use to iterate
over this array one by one so I if I
have the index 0 we are accessing this
30 value if the index is 1 we are going
to access this if then X is 2 we are
going to access this value right so
basically what we have done we have
assigned the addresses to our point
array right so index of pointer is equal
to you know whatever value is at this
index the address of this right so what
we have done here
assign the address of array array
elements okay now once we have assigned
all these values to the pointer now
using this pointer you can access all
these values how you are going to use
once again a for loop and in this for
loop we are going to use or access our
value using this pointer okay
so what we are going to do here we are
going to access our array like this so
we will print test print F and then we
can write variable array I for example
or value value of variable array or well
array at index I and then is equal to
the value so what will be the value so
what we can write here is basically
instead of this I we can just use
percentage D so write percentage t is
equal to and then percentage D which
will give you the value right and then
after comma or let's give a line break
to it also
and then after comma just write I after
comma just write the pointer now pointer
this stores the address right and then
whenever you write this something like
this because we are in for loop this
contains the address or
of the index which is contained by I so
basically this value is address of a
variable but both if we want to access
the value of this address or value which
is contained at this address we just
need to use this dereference saying
pointer once again like this okay and
semicolon and now once we run the
program let's see what happens
build the program and we can access the
value value of Val RA is 0 is equal to
30 which is true 30 40 50 value of well
RA 1 is equal to 40 value of well array
at index 2 is equal to 50 so basically
you can assign your array to a pointer
array like this and then access your
array using a pointer array like this
okay so in this way you can use array
pointers in C I hope you have enjoyed
