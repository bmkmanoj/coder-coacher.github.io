show you how you can use template
specialization with class templates so
let's get started so I'm going to give
you an example I'm going to create a
class template so I will create a
template and this will have the class T
capital T and then I'm going to make a
class and I will name it as care find
the class for example ok and this is
just going to have public constructor so
I'm just going to take make a
constructor and I will initialize this
constructor as T and what I am going to
do in this constructor is I am just
going to print some message I am just
going to print C out and I'm going to
print a and then is a valid or is not a
not a valid care ok and I am going to
end line this is the simple class which
is a template class and T is the data
type here and suppose I want to
specialize a template class a
specialization means you re you can
redefine a class to specialize in some
particular data type ok
so for example I want to specialize my
care find the Class A in order to find a
character or specialise in character so
what I can do is I can just redefine my
class but I can say C++ that I want to
specialize my other class which has the
same name with a character
specialization and how you can make this
other class as a character
specialization template class you just
need to remove this in this template
declaration you just need to remove any
declaration in in the angle brackets
okay to just leave this template and
these angle bracket blank and this says
C++ that we are going to make this class
as a specialization of some class and
how we can specialize our class we can
just specialize our class by giving or
specifying the specific data type to our
value so now this will not be T but for
example care okay
care a and now it is a valid character
right so in this way you can specialize
your class in or in a particular for for
a particular data type right so this is
for general template and this is a class
template which specialized in character
data type okay
and in order to use this class what we
can do here is we can I will just make
it a little bit concise so that we can
see all the code and what we can do we
can
instance of our class and in the bracket
we can say care and when you give here
care it says that you are going to
define the specialization instance of
the class so I can just define care CH a
width or CH a one with a character so
this character can be capital a for
example and once again I am going to
copy this and I'm going to paste this
but instead of care for example I use in
and int can be 23 for example or float
and float can be twenty three point four
four and let's see what happens I will
just compile my program and hopefully it
will not give any error and giving error
let's see what's the error yeah so error
here is whenever you leave these
template angle bracket a blank you need
to tell the datatype to this class in
which you are specializing so you need
to give here angle bracket and then here
you need to write the data type in which
you need to specialize your class so
leave this this template angle bracket
Lang but after your class name you just
need to give the data type which is care
in our work our case right so compile
the program and then it's here so this
instance has to be different here
different a variable name of instance
name
right and hopefully it will compile this
time and compile and I will run it and
this time it says is a we're late care
23 is not a valid care 23.4 4 is not a
valid care so what it has done when you
define this instance of care finder
class in specialized in character which
is this one then it goes to dis class
right because this care for this class
specialized in character class well it
when you declare here cap your instance
will know that it's a specialization of
this template class so it will print
this method it will implement this class
implementation or otherwise in any other
condition it will take a tea as a data
type and it will go to this class which
is our general template class right so
in this way you can specialize your
class in order to perform a certain task
for a particular data type so I hope you
