last video I have shown you how to
update or edit your data from your
c-sharp application to your MySQL
database in this video we will see how
to delete the data from the database
using your C shop application so for
that I will need a button so I will drag
and drop a button here and I will change
its text and I will write here delete so
i change the text of my button and i
change it has delete now select save'
button or update button and double click
it and copy the code which i have shown
you in the last two videos because we
are going to use this code same code to
delete the data we just need to change
the query for deleting the data so from
this string to the end of the sketch
block just copy the code which i have
shown you in the same button code also
and update button code also in the last
two videos so if you don't know this
code just watch the last two videos and
then you know what is this code so just
copy this and now select your delete
button and double click it and here you
will reach to the event of the delete
button here just paste the same code
which you have copied and in him all the
codes will remain same from string to
the end of catch block we are just
going to change this query so instead of
update write delete wrong your database
name dot your table name so in my MySQL
database this is my database name and
this is my table name so like this
delete from database dot table and right
instead of set right where your employee
ID is equal to this so and the rest of
the poor people need
okay so we just need to pass this query
delete from the database name dot e data
where your Eid which is my column name
of employee ID is equal to single quote
that will go to plus sign and in between
you will pass this dot the text box name
of employee ID which is this text box
name dot txt and this double quote close
and single quote close so just copy this
code and if you want to delete or not on
the basis of your name or surname just
change it this with your column name and
a text field name just change these two
things and instead of here here so
message updated and write deleted so we
know my doctor is deleted so this is the
code for deleting the data let's try and
run my program first of all login
successful
second form is opened now I'll open the
database and I will show you how I want
to delete the data so for example in my
database I have 10 entries and I won't
going to delete this tenth entry of mark
so I'm right then I don't need to enter
the rest of the text because I'm
deleting the data on the basis of the
employee ID okay so I'm just I will
press this delete button and you will
see data is deleted let's check if
doctors will delete it so I wish to
refresh my database and yes it's deleted
now once again for example I want to
delete employee ID 9 so right 9 here and
we press Delete and that is deleted I
will refresh my not a base and you will
see it's deleted so in this way you can
delete your data with the help of your
c-sharp application I hope you have
