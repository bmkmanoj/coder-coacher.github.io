video I am going to show you how to use
ylu in C++ so while loop is other kind
of few other than for loop in which I
have already shown you in the last
videos so let's see how we can use while
loop so the syntax of while loop is
while and you give this curly or
parentheses and then you give these
curly braces okay this is the syntax of
while loop and what this while loop does
is it loops around the condition until
and unless the condition is met so let
me show you an example I will take a
integer called X is equal to 1 for
example and I will say while X is less
than or equal to 5 then print some value
so I will share C out and X and line and
now when I run this program let's see
what happens so when I run this program
you can see there are so many values
printing one after another so this is
because our while loop is executing so
because we have given this condition
that X should be less than and equal to
so while this condition is true X will
be printed otherwise X will not be
printed so let's give some logical
logic to this while loop so I will say X
plus plus so that increment the value of
x by one so once again when you compile
and run the program that will print two
three four five six why because what
it's doing is it's going because we
initialize X by one it will go to the
loop and it sees X is less than one and
then it increases or increments this the
value of x by 1 which is 1 plus 1 is 2
so it it prints 2 here using this
statement and once again loops around
this loop and C is 2 is still less than
or equal to 5 and then it increments the
value by 1 and it prints it and once
again it loops around and check the
condition and once and again when it
sees that X the value of x at time of 6
is less than or equal to this is not
this condition is not fulfilled then it
goes out of the loop and returns 0 so
this is how you can use by loop let me
show you a better example than this so
let's say you have number some number so
declare my number F number is equal to 0
because I initialized this number by 0
in order twenty-minute any car bitch
values and I will also declare a third
variable called sum ok
and that also I initialize by 0
now I want to input I want that in user
should input the value so I will say C
out input any value and I will end this
line and then I will say C in so I will
wait for the user to enter the value and
this scene will be stored in the
variable number okay
then I want to add all the numbers so I
will say sum is equal to sum plus number
okay so what it will do is it will give
or it will take the value and make the
sum of these numbers unless and until I
don't I mean this obey this condition
which is X is equal to or less than five
right so I will say this condition and I
will print the sum here I will say the
sum the sum is equal to and once again
sum which is our variable name okay so
this loop will ask five times to enter
the values and once this values are
entered by the user then it will take
the sum of the values and it will print
it here or otherwise you can show the
some outside the loop so that you have
the sum only once but not five or six
times
let's try and run this program once
again and it says input any value I will
enter
and once again it's asking me input any
value 20 once again 30 40 and 50 and
press ENTER and it says me
the sum is 150 right this should be
equal to that's why it's showing us a
plus sign here but this should be
ideally equal to so in this way you can
take the sum of the values using while
loop okay or otherwise if you want while
you two never end you can give some
condition which will never be fulfilled
for example you can just write something
like this while one so this while one
generally programmers use it to make an
infinite loop just compile the program
and run it and it says please enter any
values and we keep on entering values
and we never end because this one or
whine one is never ending you so I will
never go out of this loop okay so I will
keep on entering the value and it will
never end so if you want to make
infinite loop just make it like this
otherwise just make a loop which have
some condition and loop can exit when
that condition is met okay so in this
way you can use while loop in C++ I hope
