last video we have seen how to insert
data into your tables and how to write a
query for inserting data into your
cables in this video we will see how to
use a select statement and what is a
select statement and how it can be used
so let's get started
suppose you are using a java application
or java software and from which you want
to see our database in the form of
tables so what query you should write to
see all the data from your database
table I will show you today so go to
your query tab here and for example I
want to see this data from the table so
I want to see employee ID name surname
and age and these values also from my
database so how can I see with the help
of granny let's see I will write select
and keep in mind my SQL or most of the
SQL language are not case-sensitive so
you can write in capital also you can
write in small letter also it will work
totally fine it's not case-sensitive so
it's a good point to remember
right select then your column name so
your column name is Eid name surname and
age so we will write e I D comma name
comma so name come out the page and then
right from your database or database
table so you can write database dot e
dot and just close the query with a
semicolon so what I have written is
select the column names which is
employee ID name surname and age wrong
your database name which is this dot
your table name which is this and now I
will try to execute this query and you
can see all my database or all my table
is shown here in the same way when you
write a query and your database is
connected to a software it will show
this data this same data when you pass
this query from that software using
MySQL suppose you don't want to see all
your table you can select this suppose
you want to see only
PID and name so just delete surname and
age and just try select a ID from a name
from your database and when you execute
this query you can see only your Eid and
name is shown by the query the other way
of using select statement is if you want
to social whole table full data of your
table we can write star if you write
star it will select your whole table
from your database so let's see how it
works
yes so it shows your whole table so
select star from your database dot table
will also work is a query so in this way
you can show and you can use select
statement using my scale and hope you
have learned something new this time
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
