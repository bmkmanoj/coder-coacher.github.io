video I am going to show you how to use
radio button and check boxes and group
boxes with your visual basic windows
form application and MySQL database so I
will give you an example so I have in my
database in this video series I have
been showing you that I have in mamaj
fill database database called database
and the table name called II data and in
this table I have shown you how to save
data in this table so I have shown you
how to save data in the column employee
ID name surname and age right so
employee ID name surname and age and
suppose I want to add one more column
data for gender now so this is the new
column data I want to enter and I want
to enter the data on the basis of the
radio button selected by the user so let
me show you what I want to implement so
I want to take a radio button from my
tool box so I will search for the radio
button radio button then one and radio
button - and this radio button will
represent the gender of the employee so
I will change the text of this radio
button as radio button for male this
should be mean and the radio button for
female okay turn right pane female and I
will also change the text on the name of
this radio button as radio button
female and radio button male okay now
what I want is let me run the program
and I want to show you the behavior of
these radio buttons so when when I
select this male here and when I select
this female you observe the behavior of
the radio button I can only select only
one option out of two radio button at a
time so this is the behavior of radio
button and I also want to show one more
thing which is the group box control and
suppose I will take some radio button
here also inside the group box so just
take a group box and take two more radio
button inside the group box and take two
check boxes also in this group box write
one check box and to check box and now
when I run the program you see here when
I select these radio button only one of
them is selected and in the group box
also when I select one radio button in
the group box this out of these two
radio boxes only one radio button is
selected but this does not have any
effect on these radio button so in any
group box so your form is also our drop
box so in this form group box you can
add a radio button and you can only
select one radio button at a time in the
form if you don't use Dropbox otherwise
include them in the group box okay and
when I select these check boxes you
observed that you can select multiple
checkboxes at a time so this is the
basic difference between radio button
and check box
that you can select only one option at a
time from the radio button but you can
select multiple options using checkboxes
now to the implementation part I will
just delete this group box for now and
what you want to do is for example I
want to save the data
clicking this button so for now just
select this mail radio button and double
click it and go at the top at this stop
and where you have this public class
form to declare and we are going to
declare one more variable here called
dem gender as strings okay and this is
our global variable which will contain
the gender of the employee and just copy
this gender and once again go to this
mail radio button and double click it
and just write in gender is equal to and
the double quote just write mail and
same thing do for the female radio
button just double click and just write
gender which is your string variable and
just try it here female which is like
this okay now what you want to do is in
the video number six of this series I
have shown you how to save the data into
the database using the Save button so
now I have one more column to add so
earlier I was showing employee ID name
surname and age how to save them and now
I have one more field to save which is
gender so in here this all code will
remain same and if you don't know this
code just go to the video number 6 and
just see what I have done there and in
this
in this code I just need to change one
sweaty here so one go one line of code
here I will change this query variable
so just write insert into data base dot
data which is my database name dot my
table name and in the bracket I have
written employee ID name surname and age
which are these column title of the
MySQL database now I want to add one
more column which is gender so I will
write here comma gender and then right
outside this bracket just write value
and make one more bracket and I have
written I have given the text box text
of the text boxes with these text boxes
whatever user enter the data in these
text boxes it was coming here right so I
have the text box for the employee ID
name surname and age and at the last
just go at the last of this code here
and you just need to just give this
gender variable here so just keep comma
before this bracket right just this give
this comma then the double quote and in
between just give this and sign and in
between just give the variable name
which you are declared above which is
gender so just copy this gender from
here and the Save button in the query
down just pissed at the last here so now
your query looks like this insert insert
into database dot etheta which is my
table name and in the bracket just write
that column name for employee name
surname age and new column we have added
as
outside this bracket just write value
and in the bracket just give the text
which you are getting from the text
boxes for employee ID name surname and
age and we have added one more Peele
called
gender here right and now when you run
the program and let me open my database
table also so right now I have employee
ID up to 15 I want to add employ ID 16
for example so I will give 16 some name
some surname and age and for example the
employee is a male and I shall save
click the Save button my dot I've saved
and when i refresh my database you can
see here this gender peel is also filled
now now for example I want to add one
more employee which is a female so some
names some surname and the age and she
is a female and I saved the data in the
database and i refresh my database and
you can see here the gender is now
female so in this way you can read use
radio button with your visual basic
windows form application and MySQL
database I hope you have enjoyed this
