you how you can use match expressions in
Scala
so when Scala match expressions can be
used to select between a list of
alternative just like if or multiple if
conditions so let's see how we can use
it so for example I declare a variable
called age for example and then let's
say age is 18 and then we can just use
match statement let me show you first of
all how we can use it so you can give
the argument name first of all so age is
the argument name and then the keyword
match and then you give these curly
brackets so just give these curly
brackets and then you give case keyboard
and then what is the case so for example
the value of age is equal to 20 so you
write this 20 and then you use this kind
of rocket symbol and then for example
whatever you want to do so for example
you want to print the age you can just
write print line and then the value of
age for example if you want to print it
okay so just write age here so in this
way you can give multiple cases if you
are aware of some other languages
select may look like these match
expressions right so for example 18 I
will write here and then I'll write 30
40 and 50 for example okay and let's
save the code and let's run it and
because the value of age is 18 it's
going to print 18 right if the value of
age will be 20 it's going to print 20 so
in match statement we just pass argument
first of all and then use a keyword and
then whatever case this variable
fulfills that statement will be executed
now you may say that for example I will
write hundred here which doesn't match
any condition so what will happen then
so let's run the code and you can see it
will give us this kind of error right so
to catch the default condition what we
can do here is we can just just write
for example here underscore symbol which
means the default case
okay so underscore means the default
case which means the variable value
doesn't match any case right so we can
just write default here okay and then
let's run the code once again it print
default the same you can do with the
strings also so let's initialize this a
jazz string let's say it's a string
value so I'm going to initialize it as a
string and then here also I will just
enclose these numbers as string so by
double quotes right so and then let me
run the code and it's going to print
default and let's say the value of age
is 50 here and then once again when I
run the code it's going to print 50 okay
so the case you can use to evaluate any
number or expressions or multiple
numbers or multiple strings now let's
see how we can use this match statement
as for example an expression so I'm
going to just copy the match case once
again and paste it here
and then I will just declare for example
well result variable here is equal to so
we want to return from the match right
so we can directly return this age from
here so instead of print line I can just
write age which is going to return the
value of age whenever this case is
fulfilled right so if the value of age
will be 20 so the age value 20 will be
returned
and it will be saved inside this result
variable right so let me just do the
same for the other and for the default
case we are going to return default
let's say okay so once we have the
result we can just print the result by a
print line for example result okay and
let's run the code once again I'm just
going to print result is equal to 50
right so in this way you can use match
expression as an expression so this is
how you can use match as statement and
this is how you can use match as
expression now let's say we want to
evaluate multiple cases and we want to
print the same result for multiple cases
how we can do it and let's say if there
is a variable I and we will use match
keyboard and then these curly bracket
and then we will evaluate for example
let's say odd an even number between 1
to 10 right so let's say case 1 is for
the odd number so 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 9
so if these numbers are given then it's
the odd value so I can just write print
line odd okay in the same way when the
case is for the even numbers so case
let's say 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 then we
will just print line even here and let's
declare variable I so well I is equal to
let's say 7 right and let's run the code
and it's going to print order number
because it falls in this condition so
value of I is one of these numbers then
the print line will be odd otherwise it
will print even if the value is even for
example 6 is going to print Eve
here so it prints even here right so
this is how also you can use match
expressions so that's it for this video
