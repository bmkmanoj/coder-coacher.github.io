will show you how to convert your PNG
image file into jpg image with the help
of Java code so for example I have an
image called PNG file which is PNG but
so I want to convert this PNG image into
JP e g4 mint so how can I do it with the
help of Java I will show you today so
what I have done is I have taken a
button and I have named it as PNG to jpg
and what I will do is you go to event
action action perform and I will go to
its section perform and in the action
perform a third I have written a
try-catch block which you know how to do
it and now we will write our code so
first of all what you need to do is is
to declare variable called
before image for the image itself now I
will copy this variable and in the try
block I will paste it is equal to image
I hope not read and instead of five yeah
you're right you file and make a bracket
and in the double quotes you will
provide your Eng picture file pop so my
picture is in my source directory of my
project NetBeans project so I will
directly copy its name and paste it dot
P and G yeah but if your PNG file is
situated other than your project file
then you have to provide your art here
like C and slash and whatever desktop
you have to provide path like this so do
like this and then in the next line you
will write you will just copy this image
and now sorry this is I want to give
this variable name this is new buffer
image and this was all before image so
it equal to equal to
you know to copy in this variable image
and paste it here not yet
so you have to do like this and after
this you will write , and once again
copy this variable and paste it here
and dot get right and then once again
comma tastes are same for dementia
variable and then right
I think instead of this you have to copy
your four-dimensional M so this is a big
beer not a small B so here is a small B
that will be dot time in RGB like this
once again I will tell you what I have
done I have declared buffered image
where you build then I have taken this
variable and read my PNG file and store
this my PNG file into my buffer image
and then I have taken new buffer image
variable and I have taken this variables
width height and its RGB format like
this and then now I will paste this into
the jpg file so what you have to do is
copy your new before image variable
paste it here dot
create graphics dot the image and in
this there are three
where you miss you need to define
suppose days our buffer image with you
are this variable you can see and yeah
second you will remain 0 comma 0 comma
color white common dull and in the next
line I write this e n J into J PNG
formats I will write image dot I dot
right
and yet you will copy your new buffer
image when you blow and paste it here in
first space and in the second place you
will write double quotes and this is a
jpg moment okay and in third we will
give the name of our file
and double bracket and in here we will
give the name of your JP each file so
this was our PNG and when it's converted
into g JP g what should be its name so
this is your new image which is
converted from this to this this is the
name and after that you just copy this J
option pane and paste it here just to
show the message that our task is done
so I think this will be our code this
whole is our code and now we will try to
run our program right click run
this is my PNG to jpg button I will
click it and you can see it's done so I
know that my image is converted and I
will check in my folder that it's really
convertible or not so this was my PNG
file I will click it and show you this
one this was looking like this and now I
have to search for my jpg file so this
is the new file which is the same file
as this only the format is JB G so you
can see your PNG file is converted to
jpg and I will flick it once again and
you see it's the same picture so in this
way you can convert your PNG file into
jpg file I hope you have learned
something new today and please rate
comment and subscribe and you can ask a
question on my facebook account also so
do that also</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
