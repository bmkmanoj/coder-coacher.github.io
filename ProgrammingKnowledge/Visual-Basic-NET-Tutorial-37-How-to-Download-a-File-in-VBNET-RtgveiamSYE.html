show you how to download a file from
internet using your Visual Basic windows
form application so I have this sample
project and I have taken a button here
and I've changed this text to the button
I hope you know how to drag and drop a
button and change the text by now and
now I want to for example I want to
download a file from my website which is
a PNG file so let me show you which I
want to download so this file I want to
download and I have the URL of the file
which is no programming knowledge dot
o-r-g slash images dot header image dot
PNG so I will copy the path of this file
and go to my project and now I will
double click this button and in here I
will write my dot computer dot network
dot download file and in the bracket I
will pass to argument first is the URL
of the file which I have just copied so
I will just give these double quotes and
copy the path of the file and second is
the name of the file and the folder of
the file where you want to download your
file so for example I have a folder
where I want to download a file so I
will copy the path of that folder and in
the double quotes as a second argument I
will paste this path here and I need to
give the name to the file so copy the
path and just give the name to your path
so for example I will give my M image
name as image dot PNG file right and
don't forget when you copy the path
these backward slashes should be forward
slashes so just change these beggars
slash to the forward slash otherwise it
should not take the right path
so just go to every backward slash and
convert it to the forward slash okay so
now this program is complete just take
two argument one is the URL and second
is the name of the file and the folder
in which you want to save now I will run
the program and I will also open the
folder where I am downloading the file
so you can see it download when it's
downloaded so when I click this button
it should give me image dot PNG in this
folder so let's click the button and you
can see here it has produced a file
called image dot PNG and when I open
this file it is the same file which I
downloaded from my website so let's open
this file okay so this is the file I
have downloaded which is the same file
here okay so in this way you can
download any file it can be a PDF or zip
or text or any other format which is
downloadable you can download with your
visual basic application I hope you have
