video I am going to show you how you can
use j-list in your frame or form in
Eclipse cui application so in this video
I am just I just want to show you how
you can add some item in the Jay list or
how you can use Jay list and in the next
video I will show you how to how to link
your Jay list with the database so let's
see how we can use Jay list first so I
will go to my components palette and I
will search for Jay list drag and drop
this Jay list in your form and remember
once whenever you want to
go to or whenever you select this J list
and whenever you go to your frame you
need to make a rectangle in order to
make this J list of TR okay so make a
rectangle form for this J list otherwise
when you click this and click this here
it will just disappear your J list for
example I select here and I click here
itself you see it's a small J list and
which I don't even see it right so you
need to make this kind of a square in
order to see it now for example I add a
button here
to load some values so I will say load
value okay so
I want that whenever I click some click
this button some value will be loaded
here so how can I do this
it will not work like combo box as you
expect that you just need the name of
your combo box and just add item will
not work like this jalis need a model to
load the values okay so first of all we
need to create some model for the values
and then we add them for example I have
double click this button
and we reach to the button cake event
and we want to add some values to the
list so first of all we need to make a
model and how we can make a model for
the list just right
default
list model okay this is a default list
model which you can use for the J list
okay default list model
and it's not an array right now I am not
using a array or element right now but I
will just use an object D
and default based model is equal to new
default lists model
and then I use this default lace model
object the LM have to add the values
the model so just try the LM dot add
elements so the values or the list in
the J list are called elements you just
add add elements and you can add some
elements here for example you want to
add some name you can write for example
first name mark and in this way you can
populate your list
I want two or three names so
all
so I want to add five items in the list
so I add it like this so if you notice
what I have done I have just declared
the model and in this model I have added
the element now I have the the element
in the model I can pass this model to
the J list so just copy the name of your
J list my jealous name is list okay
otherwise if you don't know the name of
your list just select your list and
see the name of the list
my list name is he list so just copy the
name of your list dot
set model set
model
okay so we have this model dlm so we can
pass this morning
the list
so like this
I run my program
and I click this button these all name
will be
to the list see
and when I click it once again what will
happen it will add this once again or if
you clear this value and once again load
them so let's see one I click this
button once again
it always creates
the new values because we are creating
the item and then adding it if this will
be our global variable
then the value will be keep on adding
but we at the time of performing this
action
we are creating and we are adding the
value for example I
they find this DLM object outside the
actionperformed method let's see what
happens
add the values you see the values are
added
right
so in this way you can use this Jay list
there are some properties also which you
can change in
use j-list for example select your je
list you can change the font of jalis
from here even you can decide your model
from here so you can just write for
example mark or
some names you can even define your list
from here okay
and then when you run your program you
see they better whatever you define in
the model will come here and you don't
even need
give
the values from okay
and
there are some other properties like
what property I want to show you
you can
use
yeah so selected index of this list is
by default minus one but you can change
the selected in this
some other values for example when I run
this
and when I select something it by
default nothing is selected because the
index is minus one right when I run this
nothing is selected and when I select
this it highlights so by this selected
index I can change this for example I
want to highlight Julie I can say set
the model to one because the model
starts from zero one two
so we run the program
okay so you see here selected model
whenever I do it like one
it changes here when I do it like two
the module changes to P right so like
this
so by default it's minus one I leave it
as default
and you've been
multiple or you can select multiple
index from here also
you can enclose your list box like I
have done for table by scroll pain just
select your list right click
surround with we can surround with panel
or split pane or sprawl pain or J tabbed
pane okay so in this way you can use
list J list in your Eclipse GUI
application in the next video I will
show you how you can add or link your
database value with this list so I hope
