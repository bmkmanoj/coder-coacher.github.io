duty tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn about signals and
slots in QT so what I have done is I
have created a new project whose name is
signals and slots and first of all I'm
going to go to the forms folder here and
I'm going to open main window dot UI
file now in here first of all I'm going
to search for our progress bar so search
for progress bar and drag and drop into
your main window here and the second
thing which I am going to search here
will be the horizontal sliders just
search for slider and pick and place the
horizontal slider in your form okay now
signal and slot functionality we have
seen in the previous video also when I
have shown you how we can press a button
and display a message on your for
example a label right so whenever you
want to perform some action based upon
some input then you can use signal and
slot for this action and reaction
mechanism right so for example I want to
move the slider and I want to you know
change the percentage fill of progress
bar whenever I you know change or set
some value on the slider so how can I do
this so first of all what can I do is I
will just select it and you see here at
the top there are some you know buttons
you can say or you know these small menu
items here right so first of all I am
going to just select these two and then
I will just choose this option which
says layout to vertically which is going
to align these two you know a vertically
like this so
you'll be able to resize them together
okay
now second thing what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you two ways of
creating the signals and slot one is the
graphical way and other is the code
using code right so for the graphical
way you just need to choose this option
which says added signals and slots here
okay so just choose this option and then
just select your progress bar and then
you know press your left click of the
button and then draw drag and drop to
the slider okay
so this is going to open this kind of
configure connection interface and in
here we are going to just say show
signal and slot inherited from Q widget
just to this option and in here we are
going to choose this option which says
value change
so whenever the value of progress bar is
changed then what we want to do we want
to set the value on the slider or we can
do the opposite so whenever the value on
the slider is changed then we want to
change the value on the progress bar so
for doing this you just need to once
again select your signal and slot view
and this time you can just first at the
first point you just need to select your
slider and then move towards the
progress bar this time okay and then
just release your mouse and then once
again you can see many options here and
the one option we want here is value
change options which is this options
whenever we change the value of slider
we want to set the value on the
a progress bar so we want to set the
value on the progress bar right so just
to this and this option and then click
OK and this is going to create a signal
and slot connection between the slider
and the progress bar and now we are
going to run our program so just save
all and run it and hopefully it's going
to you know show us this signal and slot
mechanism when I'm going to move the
slider it's going to you know change the
progress bar value also so you see here
whenever I move the slider the
proportional value in the progress bar
is filled right like this okay so this
is the graphical way of using signals
and slots but sometimes I will say most
of the times we want to use a port
instead of using this graphical method
first of all I'm going to delete this so
I will just right click here and I'm
going to just delete it so it's going to
delete the signal slots and I'm going to
just go to edit widget mode here okay
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go to the edit mu here and I'm going to
go to the main window dot CPP file and
in the constructor what I'm going to do
is I'm going to use a method called
connect ok so just add this method
called connect which take 4 argument so
first argument is the sender ok second
is the signal and so let's give these
argument one by one so first argument is
the sender so what is the sender sender
is the one who is the input in our case
for example UI arrow point or we want to
use the horizontal slider as our sender
right so just search
or horizontal slider which we have added
and then as a signal so second argument
it takes is the signal so what is our
signal so just first of all add this
keyword which is signal which is in
capital so just choose signal keyword
from here and then inside the brackets
we want to give the signals our signal
is the value change so just write value
changed here okay and the third argument
is the receiver of the signal right so
who will be the receiver of our signal
the receiver of the signal will be the
progress bar in our case so just to the
progress bar from here and the fourth
item will be the slot so just use a slot
here and what is the slot in our case in
our case slot is the set value to the
progress bar so just right set value and
just use it something like this so I'm
going to minimize this code so that you
can see this code properly or what I am
going to do is I'm going to divide this
code in two lines and I'm going to just
maximize the font and now this is our
connection for the signal and slot so
you need to use this keyword which is
connect and now I'm missing some bracket
somewhere because when I select on the
bracket here it shows me this red kind
of line so I know that there is some
bracket mission missing so I will add
this bracket here and let's run our code
once again so run it and save all and
it's going to build our code is going to
run
and the same way it's going to you know
behave as we have seen in the graphical
way right so what's happening here so
what we are doing here is we are giving
the first of all the source or signal so
our signal is the horizontal slider here
and the value of the signal is value
change method from the horizontal slider
we are providing the value change signal
to the progress bar which is this
receiver of this signal in our case
right and what property of this progress
bar we want to change which is the set
value property right so this is the
sender and this is the receiver right
and sender sends the signal which is the
method which it calls and receiver
receives the slot which is the method
which it's going to perform when the
sender sends the signal right so this is
a simple code to use signals and slots
in QT now there is one more method so we
have connect method here so we also have
the disconnect metal so if you want to
remove the signal and slot between some
you know components of widget you just
need to call this method which says our
disconnect method so I am connecting it
and immediately after this I am
disconnecting the signal and slot and
when I run my program let's see what
happens so just compile the program and
now when I move the slider the progress
bar doesn't change because as soon as
I'm creating the connection I'm also
disconnecting them right so the signal
and slot mechanism is broken by this
method okay so in most of the cases you
may be
able to use this kind of disconnect
method also in order to break the
signals and slot so I told you we were
using in the header when you see this
object this object we were using in
order to use this particular method in
our CPP file right so that's why we were
using this macro in the header in the
last video I have explained you right so
this is how you can use signals and
slots in QT I hope you have enjoyed this
video please read them and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
