tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use rating bars in our Android
activity now rating bar you can use to
rate some you know some app or some
website or anything which you want to
rate and here is the widget called
rating bar which you can use so you can
drag and drop this rating bar in your
activity and you will be able to use it
now there are some properties you can
change for this rating bar first
property you may be interested in is the
number of stars you want to show so once
you double click on this rating bar the
first property comes here is the num
stars which is number of stars for
example I want to rate out of 5 stars so
I will give the maximum number of stars
then the initial rating of the star for
example I want to show initial rating of
2 on my star bar or rating star bar and
the third property is the step size how
many steps you want to increase in your
stars once you hover over it and 4th is
the property I will leave it as default
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take a large text box here and a button
here and I'm going to change the text of
this button as submit and now we are
ready to write the code for this rating
bar we will create two method 1 which
will relation on this star click event
or you can say the rating event and one
which will listen to the button click
event so I will go to the main activity
dot Java file and I will first of all I
will
Claire these three variables one for
button other for rating bar and third
for textbox
you
so now we have declared
variables and now we are going to write
a method or for the button or the
listener for a rating bar okay so we are
going to create a public void method
public void listener for for example our
rating bar so low we will create a
listener for rating bar okay we are not
going to pass any argument in here and
inside this we will write the code okay
so first of all we will cast our rating
bar itself
and same I will do for the textbox
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my rating bar variable which is
this one and I will call a set on rating
change listener on it okay
so I will just take this rating be
variable dot set on set on rating change
listener okay
and in here we will create our new
listener for it so we will just write
new on or on rating change listener and
then inside this method we can just call
our text view which is this one dot set
text set text and in here we can just
you know take this variable which was
automatically created for our created
for us which is rating and display
inside our text view okay so we will
convert this rating to the string so I
will just write string dot value off
value off and then the rating which is
this variable okay and this set rating
bar change listener is now ready to use
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to copy this method which is
listener for rating bar and I will copy
in my on create method okay so I will
just copy it and I will run my program
now so now my app is running so for
example I change the rating for example
I change it to four you can see the
rating change to four I change the
rating to five rating changes to five
change rating change to
you can see in the text box rating
changes to two right so in this way you
can prepare the listener for rating bar
change okay now we will use this button
to you know collect the rating and you
know display in the form of toast on
message right so what we are going to do
is we will just make another method
which will be public void on button
click listener okay we are not going to
pass any argument in it and in here we
will do the same the casting of the
rating bar so rating bar name was rating
be here or I will copy the same code
which I have written in the last
function or method and in the same way I
will cast the button this time okay
so just I will cast the button
now we will set the onclicklistener for
this button variable so we will just use
this button variable dot set
onclicklistener
and then we will create a new on click
listener and inside this we will just
create our toast or message for this so
toast dot make text and my now you may
have guessed what are the argument it
takes because in the last few videos are
being showing you how to use this so
first argument is the activity name dot
this second argument is the text we want
to display so we are going to display
the rating right so how to get the
rating you just need to just write
string which because we are going to
convert this rating from string or from
floor of float or from integer to the
string right dot value off and then we
will take the rating variable which is
rating b dot get rating okay there is a
function which we can call to get the
rating okay now the third variable here
is the toast dot length short you can
take and dot show to show the message
okay once again i'm going to run this
code but first i need to you know copy
this method to on create method oncreate
method is here so i will copy it and now
i'm going to rerun my application cancel
and rerun the application and now my
application is running
again so I can change the rating like
this rating is shown here also and when
we click the buttons the summit button
you can see the rating in the form of
message here write rating 3 submit
button clicked and it's displayed in the
form of message right displayed in the
form of message ok so in this way you
can use a rating bar in your Android
activity I hope you have enjoyed this
