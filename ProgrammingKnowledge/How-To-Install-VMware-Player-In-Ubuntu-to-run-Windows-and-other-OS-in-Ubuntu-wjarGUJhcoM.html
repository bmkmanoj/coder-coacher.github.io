show you how to install VMware Player
virtual machine in your Ubuntu operating
system VMware Player you can use it for
playing or using or running different
operating system on your open to host
machine for example if you want to use
Windows seven or if you want to use
Android OS on your open to operating
system by using VMware Player you can
install and run these two operating
system or any other operating system if
you have its installation in your
virtual machine which is your VMware
Player so let's see how we can install
it so open your search in the browser
search engine in the browser and write
VMware Player and this will open VMware
links in here so just click the first
link which you see on the search option
and in here we want to go to the
download section so just take this
downloads tab and in here search for the
option called VMware Player there are
several number of products from VMware
but what we are looking for is called
VMware Player so just click this
download product
and this will present us different
option VMware Player for Windows VMware
Player for 32-bit operating system and
VMware Player for 64-bit operating
system so right now I have 32-bit open
to operating system so I will just
download this one but according to your
system in Linux you can also choose
64-bit or file from here if you have
64-bit Ubuntu operating system ok so
just click this then on download and I
have already downloaded this VMware plus
file so I'm not going to click this but
download this file and once your file is
downloaded I will show you the
requirement of building VMware Player so
just open your terminal and in here if
you haven't already installed build
essential then just give this command
sudo apt - get installed build essential
this is the buried essential library
which is used for to build the programs
like C++ or Java or other languages
which build essential supports ok so
just give sudo apt - get installed been
essential and press Enter
we'll ask you if you want to really
install build essentially I will say why
and press ENTER and build essential will
be installed okay so once this build
essential is installed then what you
need to do is just let's see I have
VMware file in my downloads so this is
the VMware Player file right
so my life VMware installation bundle is
in my downloads folder okay and in the
meantime my build essential library is
installed so what I will do is I mean
clear and then I will give the command
to execute this bundle p.m. we have
bundle in which is in my downloads
folder right so I will give this command
sudo bash and the path to the VMware
Player so it's in download so I have
given the relative path to download and
this is my VMware Player and star
indicates that any extension of VMware
Player will be detected in the download
folder and it will be executed so by
default it this file will be executed so
just give this command and press Enter
and it will ask for their password if
you are not already have the permission
and now the installation will start
okay so
this is the installer which will start
when you give that command and now just
accept the actually agreement if you
agree with the agreement of VMware
Player and click Next
once again accept next and it will ask
you would you like to check for the
product update if you want product
update say yes and click Next and once
again next and it will say enter your
license key next and product is ready to
be installed
so click install
and once you see this message
installation was successful that means
your installation is complete then close
this Installer and go to this laptop
icon which is search your computer and
in here just search for VMware Player
which is this one and just click VMware
Player from here
which will open your VMware Player
so this is your BM we're player and now
you are ready to install any other
operating system in your VMware Player
for the first time when you install this
VMware Player this message will be shown
there's more update updated version is
available so if you want to use or you
want more updated version then you can
see get more information but generally I
just skip this version or I say it will
remind me later so for now I will click
this remind me later button and now you
are ready to install any other operating
system like Android or Windows or any
other operating system in your open to
operating system you just need to click
this create a new virtual machine and
now you just need to give the physical
drive or your ISO file or any other type
of installation and then you will be
able to install the other operating
system like the normal operating system
in your boot the operating system so I
