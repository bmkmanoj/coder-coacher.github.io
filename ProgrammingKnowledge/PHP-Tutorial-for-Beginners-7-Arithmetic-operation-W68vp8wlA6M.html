show you the math operations in PHP so
there are basically four math operation
basic math operation you can perform
with PHP which is addition subtraction
multiplication division and for example
I have two numbers first is a new number
one number one and which is equal to
some value so for example one thousand
nine and I have the same number not the
same number but other variable called
number 2 which has a value 2003 for
example and I want to use these two
variables to add subtract and multiply
and divide I can do this easily by my
echo and if you remember whenever you
have your variable as number or
numerical value you don't need these
single quotes to display using echo so
you can just use this like this so
number one plus number two for addition
right and if you want you can show some
message here but I'm not going to do
that for now or you what you can do here
is you can just print out add write and
in the same way I can subtract and
multiply and divide for example so I I
can say subtract and this is a subtract
and PHP and for the product
product you need to have you cannot use
this axe symbol like this to multiply
these two numbers you need to use this s
tricks symbol or the star symbol to
multiple and multiply these two numbers
and to divine divide you can just use
this slash symbol so these are the basic
for our automatic operators in PHP by
which you can do your automatic equation
or operations so when I save this and
I'll go to my math dot PHP which I have
created for this tutorial and it's
saying some notice let's see what is the
problem here yeah so problem is I
haven't included this and symbol to any
of my variable I should have used so
don't forget to use this always right
okay
I'll just save it and run it and
hopefully it will give me the answer but
it's just jumbled up because maybe I can
use this break tag to show these answers
in different lines BR right and here
also I can use this concatenation
operator to break right like this okay
so just use this break to change the
line and in here also just break between
these numbers to change the line once
again I will just refresh my program and
you see addition of these two numbers is
you can count it I mean it's
3012 that is okay the subtraction is
minus 994 which is also okay the product
if this one and the division is this one
so these are the four basic automatic
operation you can perform in PHP and
yeah that's it for this video please
