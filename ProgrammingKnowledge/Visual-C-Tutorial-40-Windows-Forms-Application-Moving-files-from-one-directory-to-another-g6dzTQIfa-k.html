video I will show you how to move a file
from one directory to other directory so
let me give you a short demo what I'm
going to do and show you today so I have
this choose file its source button and
choose file destination button so for
example I will choose a file from any
part or any folder of my computer so for
example I choose this untitled PNG file
and I want to move this file to the
other folder so I will choose the
destination folder for it and choose any
or any file from him
so they say this is gonna be the source
folder and this is going to be the
source destination folder and this file
untitled th speed PNG we are going to
move from my desktop to this Windows 7
share folder and I also want to change
the name of my PNG so instead of this
untitled PNG I want to change it as 1 2
3 4 for example 1 2 3 4 PNG ok and when
I press this
change directory button the message
comes change directory success so
directory is successfully
a folder location of this untitled pngs
successfully change with a name one two
three four so this file name is now this
and when we check in our folder we have
the same directory where we are desiring
to place it so how to change the file
directory or folder from one path to
another I will show you so what I have
done is I have done one text field whose
name is text field one and second whose
name is text box - okay not text field I
have a bit of taking the java
terminology so text box one and text box
and I have taken two buttons for
choosing the path of the files one for
sauce one for destination and when I
click this choose source file I think by
the time or by this time you should know
how to open a file dialog so by using
these three lines you can open and set
the file name into your text box it's
just text box number one so I will just
quickly run through it Open File dialog
cap your variable name is equal to GC
Open File dialog and this variable comes
here arrow point of show dialog and then
your text field name arrow pointed next
and then this variable comes here and we
are taking the file name from the chosen
dialogue and placing the path into our
text box to same we are doing for this
but this time we are doing and placing
our text into the text box - so just
same code I have written here bus but I
have just changed this
text box - instead of text or text box
one okay so this is for choosing the
destination folder now main code how to
move the file from one directory to
another is in this button event so take
a button and double click it and write
file double colon move and this is your
source folder part and this is your
destination folder path so we are taking
our source folder path in our text field
or text box one so we are writing your
text box
one arrow pointer text and we are we
want to change the folder to the
destination which is in text box - so
this is the path for text post path for
the destination and when this move is
successfully done we are displaying the
message that change directory is
successful okay so this is a two line
code and when you run the program you
can choose the file once again this file
I am choosing from my Windows share
okay and once again I want to move it to
my desktop so I'm choosing desktop and I
will choose one any file and this name I
will change whatever I want to name my
one-two-three-four PMG once again so I
want to change the name now to five six
seven eight nine so previously it was
one two three four and now it's one two
nine dot PNG and when I click this
change directory
so I will get the message that my
directory is changed so in this way you
can change the file directly directory
from one folder to another I hope you
