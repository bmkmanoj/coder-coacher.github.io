going to show you how to update your
data in the database using NetBeans so
go to palette
take a button we will name this button
as update button update and change our
variable name text
next date
okay
my click Update button event action and
action performed and in action performed
method first of all we will make a
flying catch block try catch
looking catch block right suction and
I'll always be right
I'm just popping the option pain dot so
message now you know comedy in catch
block and in the trial block you have to
write all you have to declare four
variables because we want to add it are
four text fields employee ID name
surname and age we need to declare four
variables so first string
when you one is equal to
take our employ any variable name copy
it and paste it here dot get text get
text text and in the same way you have
to do it what are all four text field
employed in now we need the name
variable name and just paste it here and
so name variable name change just copy
this alumna variable name I will paste
it here and this one last time
copy the age variable name and paste it
here and only one value to three value
for because we have four tech speed to
add it so we became both variables which
we are taking the values of the text
field now we have to write a string as
always for query string SQL is equal to
and in the string SQL query we should
write update whatever is your database
table name my team name is employee info
so and copy it and just update employee
info then write set and then
write the name of your variable first
table column name is in point ID so we
have to write it here
my D is equal to here's the most
important part we have to supposed to
fall make two single quotes and inside
two single quote make two double quotes
and inside two double quotes make two
plus signs and in this in between this
plus sign you have to copy your first
variable name which indicates your
employee ID and paste in between the
value one so employee ID is equal to
single quote in between the bull code in
between plus and in between that you
have to write value one we will do it to
the same for our four values now for the
new name I think this quote put one yeah
so name is equal to once again we'll
just cook me we don't have much time and
just change it to value too
so same thing you have to do two times
more for surname
assign value 3 and for age assign value
for and kind with semicolon so this is
our method after writing this write P is
T is it way to con not
prepare statement
and in the prepare statement just SQL
and then white ESD execute
okay so I think that mentalism completed
one more thing and we update our table
we should know that the table is updated
so fish have to show the message update
so showing the message I'm writing the
option not
show message
you should write writing table updated
table yes we will come to know that our
table is updated or not so let's try to
run the program
I click on one file
this is our program suppose I want to
add it in thirds right-click it I want
to change the name Sam yes Graham and
certain emails BAM and age also 29 I
press update button I think there is
some error so I have to check it so
let's check our error so I think I found
a mistake yeah I spell update incorrect
if tonight update employee info set is
equal to this is all correct and one
more thing you have to write here after
you have declared out of 4 values
employee ID is equal to value name is
equal to value 2
so name is equal to value 3 and the ages
unit value 3 and after that right where
your employee ID is equal to when you
just copy this whole code employee ID is
equal to value and after we're just
paste it so it should know and bitch
employee ID we want to update data so
let's try term data that one a program
and obtained not
and then go to Sam one to t know if
Samus damn when we change the name idols
to the age s 29 when I click the Update
button our data is updated because we
can see the message updated and one
woman once again we will run the program
we can see and artists from undated Bam
Bam and 29 it's not updated
instantaneously because you have haven't
call our method update table and in here
so just go and copy your update table
method which I have shown when we are
populating our table and you can see it
in the previous tutorial and just paste
it here and now when you run the program
we will try to update employee ID to
once again I add mark one more kay and
Douglas one more s and we change the 8th
ages if the true for example and now
when I update the table the table should
be completed in still days and you can
see instantaneously and table is updated
so that was this tutorial on how to
update your table I hope you have
enjoyed and please rate comment and
subscribe thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
