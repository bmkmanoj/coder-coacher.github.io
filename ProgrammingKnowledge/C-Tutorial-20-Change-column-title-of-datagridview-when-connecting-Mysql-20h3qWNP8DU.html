video I will show you how to change the
column names when you are loading your
database values from MySQL in your data
grid grid view so if you have noticed
when I linked my MySQL database table
with this data grid view the column
names come literally like this but I
want my custom title to be showed on the
title or as a title so what can I do is
I just first of all exit the application
and then what I can do is I will write
here for exam first of all I will go to
my load button table
click event where in the 13th video I
wish I have shown you how to connect
your data grid view with your MySQL
database okay and we have written this
code and in here I have passed a query
this one so if you don't know this code
just watch the 13th video and you will
know how I have written this code so
right now I want to change the names of
the column what neat title of the column
so just go here where you pass the
queries and here
you can provide the custom names for the
column so right
select your column name and then you can
write as and single quote and here you
can give the change the column name so
right boy I name as first name and this
surname as
last name and age as age itselves
so I don't want to change the age so you
just need to change this query like that
select a ID as so this what this as
Clause 2 is it will change the name of
your column title whatever you provide
in desist single quotes okay yeah I need
I forgot to write as okay so right as
and your column title name okay
and when I run my program once again
login password correct and when I load
my table you can see my custom names are
appearing here employee ID first name
last name and age itself so in this way
you can change the column names of the
table which you are taking from MySQL
database so I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
