last two videos I have been showing you
how to use a fence conditions in C now
in this video I am going to teach you
about the ternary or conditional
operator in C this is also used to make
decisions in C but whenever you want to
make a decision which is you know very
short and you want to do it in a single
line this ternary conditional operator
can be useful now how to use this
ternary conditional operator so for
example I have two integer variables
integer a is equal to for example 10
here or 19 or and India B is equal to 20
for example okay now I want to compare
these two integers I can do it with the
help of if conditions but for comparing
and writing if and then else this can be
a little bit longer expression in terms
of code to compare these two the shorter
form of comparing these two integers can
be for example I can declare integer C
and I want to transfer the creator of
these two values a and B which is B to C
so I want to compare a and B and
whatever variable is greater or whatever
values you bet value is greater then we
want to transfer this value to C okay so
there is a operator called ternary
operator which is like this it's used
like this so you have this bracket and
in this bracket
you just write your condition as you
write in the if condition and then you
give a small question mark here and then
if the condition is true you can
transfer a pass the value to your result
from here otherwise if the value is
false then the value which is contained
after this column will be transferred to
your value will be returned so I will
give you an example what I mean by this
so for example I want to have C is equal
to the greater of these from these two
values a and B so I will compare to
these two values like this if a is
greater than B which is not greater than
B obviously then I'm asking C so I will
give this question mark and then if is
greater than B I want to return for
example a ok or if it is greater than B
I want to return B otherwise a so if a
is greater than B I will return B which
is like this or else I will return a ok
so this will be executed by C like this
this bracket will compare the condition
if a is greater than B obviously it in
our condition is not greater than B
because 19 is not greater than 20 then
it will return b b is which is 20 right
otherwise if the value of a is greater
than B then it will once again return B
right so in our condition what
will happen a is greater than B which is
not true then this condition will be
written a is returned if the condition
is fulfilled the first parameter is
returned if the condition is false then
the second condition will be returned so
the value of C in our case will be what
will be the value a will be the value 90
right so we can print this value printf
and then in the double quote answer for
example answer is equal to percentage T
comma spelly of C we want to print value
of C right
I will compile and run this program and
let's see what will be the answer I
forgot this semicolon here so once again
compile and run the program and the
answer here is 19 because is not greater
than B then it will return the second
argument because our condition is false
so it will return the second argument if
the condition is true it will return the
first argument so in our case the
condition is false because is not
greater than B then it will return the
second parameter which is a which is 19
now for example the value of a changes
to 25 what will happen now our condition
is true 25 is greater than 20 then it
will be returned like this B will be
returned because the condition is
fulfilled and we have seen that if the
condition is fulfilled then the first
parameter will be returned right so when
I compile and run the program it will
return 20 right because the Val
of B is 20 okay so in this way you can
use this ternary conditional operator in
C now you may ask what is the
performance difference between this
ternary operator and if-else condition
because you can also write if Ganz
condition to compare a and B right so
there is there are arguments about the
performance some says the performance of
ternary operator is faster than if-else
condition but the benefit of this
ternary operator is if you want to write
your code in one line because if you
would have used F condition you would
have written at least four or five line
but this is simple looking and it's it's
serving your purpose and it will not
even killing your performance right so
it's more you know visibly good and you
can you know directly by seeing this you
can say what you the programmer wants to
write rather than writing those long
if-else condition so always if you want
to compare two values and you have only
if or else condition then you can
replace it by this ternary conditional
operator so I hope you have understood
this basic concept of ternary
conditional operator in C and I hope you
have enjoyed this video please recommend
