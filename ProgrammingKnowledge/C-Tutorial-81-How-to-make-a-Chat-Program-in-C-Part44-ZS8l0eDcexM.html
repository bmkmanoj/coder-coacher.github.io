do is it will show the message that our
port or our client 1 and line 2 are
connected and then it will disable this
start button now when this happens we
also need to enable the send message
button so this button copy just select
it and copy the name of this button
which is button 2 in my case you can
change it as a send button or something
like this and just below this dot
enabled and this time this will be true
because we need to enable this and we
also need to set our focus on this send
message text box so just select this
text box copy the name of this text box
which is text message in my case and
just below your button enabled code just
below that paste your text message box
name dot focus bracket and make it close
so what it will do is it will set the
focus on this message box once the
connection is established right so this
is for setting our connection or
starting our connection ok now we should
be able to send the message so we will
write the code for this send message
button so just double clicks this send
button and in here
we will write our code so first of all
we will make a try-catch block so that
it can catch if any exception occurs so
here right this try/catch block try and
catch exception and show the message in
the catch block and in this try block
what we will do is we will convert our
string whatever we write in the message
text box into bytes so it can go on the
network so write this system dot text
dot ascii encoding and give it a
variable name
ENC in my case is equal to new system
dot text dot ascii encoding bracket and
bracket closed and now we will declare a
byte array just below this code so
declare a byte array like this byte
square bracket message this is the
variable name is equal to new bite and
the size of byte and in the next line we
will take the message from our message
textbox and transfer in this byte
message array right so write this
message variable here is equal to e MC
which is this variable dot get bytes and
then inside the bracket we will just go
here in the form just select this text
message name which is text message once
again and go to the code and we will
just paste it here get bytes and in the
bracket text message dot txt now in the
next line we will send the message so
this is the byte array and we will send
the message to the other line so we will
write s CK dot
Tsang and in the bracket we will pass
this message variable here so it will
send the message to the line in the form
of bytes right so once it sends the
message you also need to be able to see
it on the list box right so just copy
the name of this list box which is list
message in my case and go here and just
below your send message code paste your
list box name dot items dot add and
bracket and bracket close and in here
first of all we will give the argument
who is sending the message so it's you
only so you can write you or me or
something like this plus whatever is
there in the text box this send text box
so just copy the name message text from
here and in this list box argument after
you just give it a colon and then the
message box name dot text okay so this
will show the message which you are
sending in your list box also so you
should be able to see your own message
also and now we want to clear this text
box once you send the message so you
will be able to type the other message
so just copy this text message here just
below that dot clear
and racket them like a closed so it will
clear your text message so now I think
our code is complete if you want you can
just pause the video and copy the code
for this send button click event okay
and this is the code and if you also
want you can just I will just focus on
this start button code also so you will
you can copy this code so just pause the
video and copy this code for the start
connection button okay now once you are
done with all this code what we need is
we need to go to our solution so just go
to the solution Explorer right-click
your solution name and click this open
folder in Windows Explorer it will open
the folder in which your project is
there just click this full project and
go in the bin debug and this is our
executable file so just double click it
and it will open the executable file but
we need two files to run one for the
client one one for the client - so just
double click it once again so now we
have two files running at the same time
now we need to give the port number so
for client 1 port number is 80 for
example inclined to port number is 81
and this is res reverse for this line
because for client 1 this is client 1 so
the client ID for Cline 2 is 81 but here
the client is a t1 line 1 is 81
inclined to is eighty right because
these are two different lines so just do
that and after you enter the client name
just click this start button so when I
press the start button nothing is
happening so I think what mistake I have
done is I haven't build my project so
what I will do is go to my project once
again go to build and I will build
solution once again and rebuild solution
once again so it will build my solution
and now I will go to the app once again
here and now I will run two applications
one is 80 80 80 and 81 and here 81 and
80
now I will click this start button and
it will give you the warning for the
security warning just allow and now it's
connected the same thing do it fraud
Cline to does click start button and now
it's connected now you will be able to
send the message so let's see
hi send and see here here also hi now
here you can write hello YouTube and
send the message and here also this
message comes so whatever you write here
then you come here and whatever you
write here it will come here so in this
way you can make a chat application with
your c-sharp
windows form application I hope you have
