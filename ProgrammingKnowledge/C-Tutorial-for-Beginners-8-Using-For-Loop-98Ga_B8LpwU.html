shown you how to use switch cases in C++
now in this video I am going to talk to
you about loops and I'm going to show
you how to use for loop in C++ that's
the most basic type of loop in C++ so
let's see how we can declare for loop
and how we can use poly so for the
declaration of for loop the declaration
syntax looks like this so what you do is
you write for and just give these two
parentheses and this for takes three
parameter first is the initialization
and then it is separated by semicolon
second is the condition and third is the
increment okay and in this curly braces
you provide the code you want to execute
according to the condition we just met
in the loop so let's take an example I
am going to declare unloop
so I will write here for and I will give
these two brackets and I'm going to give
these two curly braces which is the
basic syntax of bond now I'm going to
declare the initialization for so for
example I will take integer int I is
equal to 1 then I will separate it by
semicolon then I will give the condition
so for example I want to give the
condition loop till my condition of each
is 10 for example so I is less than or
equal to 10 okay
and then the third condition is the
increment so I will give semicolon once
again and I will get should say I plus
plus so this means that we are
incrementing I by 1 this is just like
saying that I is equal to I plus 1 ok so
this is this and this is same so if we
are incrementing I by 1 every time it
sees the condition oh it's less than 10
still it increase the I by 1 now we will
output our
variable ISO I will say see out eye and
once again the NDL okay now I will build
the program and let's see what happens I
will run the program and you see what
happens here is it's looping so it goes
to the for loop and it initializes I is
equal to 1 and if it goes into the
execution of for loop and in it prints 1
and once again it goes back to for loop
and increment it by 1 right so what's
happening I is equal to 1 it prints it
it increments a Q by 1 goes to the loop
once again now this time I is equal to 2
and it sees condition which is less than
10 2 is less than 10 then it prints 2
once again and increment I by 1 which is
I is equal to 3 goes to the conditions
condition once again and it sees yes I
is equal to 3 is less than 10 so it
prints 3 once again and this loop
happens until 10 is printed and then it
goes to the loop once again and sees
okay now I is equal to 11 which is not
fulfilling this condition I is less than
or equal to 10 so I am NOT going to
print this and I am going to break the
for loop and I am going to go out of the
loop and return 0 so this is printing
this these values of I one by one until
this condition is met
okay now I there is one more thing you
can do with the for loop is to decrement
the value it's not necessary that you
need to increment the value every time
and it's also not necessary to increase
increase the value by 1 you can increase
the value by 2 or you can initialize the
value by something else so let's see
let's initialize I
by some other value for example e6 and I
will say the condition would be AI is
less than or equal to 60 for example and
I will increase this eye by 5 so I will
write AI plus equal to 5 that means
increment the value of I by 5 and assign
it to I okay so once again when I build
my program and run it you can see it's
showing me 6 for the first time and
increase this 6 by 5 so 6 plus 5 is 11
and then it sees the condition okay 11
is less than 60 so I am going to
increase it 5 once again then 16 is less
than 60 so I'm going to increase it by 5
1 and again so in this way you can
initialize your eye by any value and you
can increment this eye by any value and
you can give any condition which can be
equal to equal to or which can be less
than or greater than or whatever value
the second thing is you can decrement
the value of I also so let me show you
this example also so for example I
initialize I is equal to 10 and I want
that I should print until I is greater
than or equal to 1 equal to 1 okay and I
will decree in 2 I by 1 every time so I
will say minus minus and this minus is
just like I is equal to I minus 1
okay this light I I is it is just like
you minus the value of I by money right
so now what will happen let's see let's
build the program and run it and you can
see this time I starts from 10 because
we initialize the value of I as 10 so it
prints then and it goes to Luo once
again and it sees ok I is equal to 9
this time because we minus 10 by 1 which
is 9 so I is equal to 9 which is still
greater than or equal to 1 so I will
print it once again 9 and once again
this loop will happen and happen until
one is reached and the condition will be
false then right so in this way you can
use for loop in C++ I hope ever you have
