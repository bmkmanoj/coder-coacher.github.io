cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn how we can use hue
color dialogue class and cutie the cue
color dialogue class provides a dialogue
budget for specifying the colors so
let's see how we can use it so for this
video also I'm going to use the code
which I have rated for my notepad demo
so just see the video in which I have
shown you how you can create a notepad
and I'm going to use the same project
here and I'm going to go to my main
window dot UI file and I have created so
many functionality here I'm going to add
some more functionality so in here I
will add one more menu item which will
be for a color so I will just say color
okay and then press Enter and then for
this color I will select the trigger so
right click and then go to slot and then
choose this triggered and then click OK
and it's going to create ask this kind
of trigger so for creating a color we
need to first of all include the header
for the color so you just need to
include let me correct my key board and
then now include hue color dialogue okay
so we need cue color dialogue and we
also need to include hue of color so
just right Q okay so include these two
header files and then now in our
triggered function we would just need to
create an object of Q color so just
write Q color color is equal to Q color
dialogue and it also has a static
function called and get color so we will
use this function
now the first argument which it takes is
the default color so for example we want
to provide the default color QT white
for example so we will just provide
default color QT white second argument
is the parent so we will give this here
and I think we don't need more argument
we can provide some more arguments for
example you can provide the title to
your color dialog or some other options
so for example let's provide the title
so for example I will just say choose
color okay and now once you have this
color object then you can check if it's
valid or not so you can just say if
color is valid so dot is valid and it
will give you the boolean value and if
the color is valid which is chosen by
the cue color dialog then we can write
some code okay
so what we can do in our triggered
method is for example you may want to
set this color which we select to the
text of the added text right so we can
just write UI and then just call text
add it and then call a method called a
set text color
okay so just call this method which says
set text color and then pass this color
object here so it's going to set the
color to your text so I am going to run
my app and let's see what happens when I
you know set the color to my text so my
app is running now and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to provide some random
text here once again and first of all I
will change the font size of it as we
have seen in the last video that how we
can use font dialog
so I will change the font size and then
I will select the text from here and
then I will go to add it and this time I
will choose color option here and kill
it will give me this kind of color
option right so I can choose from here
any color or I can choose the basic
colors for example I want to choose this
blue color and I will click OK
and the font color of the selected text
is changed to whatever color I'd choose
for example I want to change the color
of this text so I can just choose some
other color and then the color is
changed right so in this way you can use
font color to change the text font color
now if you want to change the background
color of this added text how we can do
it so once again I'm going to go to my
main window and I will create one more
menu here and I will say background
color ok and press Enter which will add
the menu and this time once again I will
go to slot 4 this menu item and then
choose the triggered and in here I will
just copy the same code and what I'm
going to do this time is I want to
change the background color right so
there are few options so for example
first option which I can choose here is
the set background color but this will
not work properly let's use set
background color first and then we will
see what are the you know disadvantage
of this set text background color and
then just use the color here and run the
code and let's see what happens when we
you know run the code so I will just
right some text here change the font to
bold italic for example 16 and for
example now I will choose some color
here for example I want to choose this
dark green color okay
and when I add some text you can see the
text color is changed right and you can
select the text also and then I will
choose the background color okay and the
background color I want is red okay so
background color becomes red here and
whenever you add or add some text once
again and you want to change the
background color of the text you can
choose you know background color of the
text right now I was talking about
changing the background color of this
whole you know text added which is white
right now white background right if you
want to change the color of only the
text then you can use this option so
once again I will go to the main window
dot UI file and this time I will say
background color of the window for
example so I will once again write
background color
but I will say added text okay or I
think you understood what I mean by
added text background color right so
once again I will choose this action and
then I will go to slots triggered okay
and I will just copy the same code from
here and paste it here and instead of
using set background color this time we
are going to use a set pallet so just
write set pallet and then you just need
to call cue
palate here so just call you palette and
as an argument of it you can provide
this color object here okay so let's run
the code so over app is running now and
for example I want to change the
background color of this added text so I
will go to add it and then I will just
choose this option which I have created
background color added text and now I
will choose this black background okay
and I will click OK and you can see in
the background color of my added text is
changed right and now I want to add some
text here random text and I want to
change the font size for example to 16
and bold and font size change and I want
to change the text color also so I will
just choose background color of text for
example light green click OK and then
color is changed for the text background
right and for example now I want to
choose the background color as black
only so click OK and then background
color is changed to black once again
right now I want to change the color of
this text cell so I will just choose the
color and then I will just choose
whatever color I want to implement to
this text right so the text color has
changed okay so in this way you can use
cue color dialog in QT I hope you've
