last video I have shown you how to make
a registration page using your asp.net
website application so when you are till
now when you run the program in the
browser it shows a registration form and
if user fills some of the data and
submits it it shows some warning if here
haven't entered the valid values now if
when the user registers some data it
should be saved somewhere in your
database so in this video I will show
you how to make a database for your
registered daughter or for the new user
data so let's get started first of all
what I will do is I will go to my
project I will right-click it and I will
say add a new item and in here I will
search for a database this will be our
SQL Server database and we can change
the name of the database also so for
example we name our database as
registration database okay and I click
Add and it will show a message that you
are attempting to add a database and
just click yes here and your data will
base will be added to your project you
can see here if the database is not
added or if you haven't if you can't see
your database instantaneously just right
click and refresh the folder and in some
moments you will be able to see this
registration dot MDF file now what you
need to do is
if you can't see a server Explorer in
here you can go view and search for
server Explorer and click it and just
pin it here and in here you will be able
to see your database our database name
is registration dot MDF okay now I will
add a table to my database so I will go
here on the table right click and I will
say add new table and it will present a
form here in which we can provide the
column name and we can provide the data
type so first is the ID so I want to
give the idea of the registration and
then I will say the user name for
example because this is our registration
form we have a user name email password
and country ok for peel we have so first
is username email second and the third
is password and the fourth is country
and because our ID will be an integer so
I will choose the data type as in here
username will be a string type so you
can choose n care and provide the length
of the string you want to provide for
the username so for example I want to
provide 20 character email would be
would be little bit bigger so I will
provide 50 characters here password for
password I will provide 20 and the
country
is 15 enough I think okay now when you
are done with your columns then you just
need to click this Save table and it
will present you dialogues where you
need to provide the name of your table
so I will say use a data table okay so
this is my user data table because
whenever new users register this data is
saved in this table and I will click OK
now my database is already made now what
I need to do is I need to be able to see
my database somewhere in the web page so
what I will do is I will make a new page
I will go to my project right click add
new item and I will add a new webform
from here and I will name it as manager
for example so that only manager would
be able to see it and I say add and it
has made our empty form for us and when
I go to design it just have the body I
will go to the toolbox here and I will
go in this data tab and I will drag and
drop our grid view because we would be
able to see the data base values in our
tables this grid view would help us to
see our database so drag and drop this
grid view you can also resize your grid
view from here or this body from here
and the next thing you need to have is
this
SQL data source this will help you to
attach your database with this grid view
or table now what you need to do is
first is just click this little arrow
button in this SQL data source you you
can see here the name or ID of your SQL
data source is you see here SQL data
source one right you can change the ID
of this dust data source also for
example SQL data source registration
okay so we know that this is the data
source for the registration now just
click this the arrow button and I will
say configure data source and I will
choose my data source our data source is
registration dot MDF which we have
already created and I will say next and
here connection string you can say
registration connection string so this
will save it as registration connection
string so you know that this is a string
for registrations click Next and in here
you can choose whatever data you want to
see in the database I will say or I will
leave it as default which is star and it
sure it implies that I want to see all
the data or you can individually select
whatever data you want to see I will
just leave at this default as star and I
will click Next and I will test my query
if my database is connected or not so if
you see this kind of tea
titles which you have already created ID
username email password and country then
you are sure that your database is
connected then click finish
now this data source is connected with
our database which is our registration
database now we need to connect this
data source to this table so what we
will do is just select your table and
click this arrow button from here and
just say choose datasource and we only
have one data source which is SQL data
source registration just selected and
you will be able to see all the data
columns are present here ID username
email password and country now you know
that you are connected to the database
and you will be able to see your data in
this table you can also change the
property of this tables for example
enable paging enable sorting or enable
selection and also you can change the
way your table must look so there are
some tips there are some designs you can
select from here just go to auto format
and you can choose your design just by
clicking here so let me see which design
I want to show for example I want this
rainy-day design and I will say apply
and I will say click OK now I can see
the design here now you just need to
have some data to be able to see your
table on the web page so once again we
will go to our solution Explorer
and we will go to our database which is
registration mm DF and I will go to the
tables here right click and I will say
or first of all just click this table
which is our user table which we have
created and just click right click it
and say show table data and we will add
here some sample data so for example I'm
adding here ID 1 and user name is
programming knowledge and email ID is
ABC at the rate gmail.com and the
password is 1 2 3 4 5 and the country is
Germany ok and just click this save all
button now your database will be saved
but if you see this red information of
warnings here just click the next line
or this next row and then save your
daughter
now once you are you have some database
data inside this table you can see this
data on the web page which is our
manager web page so go to the project
once again right-click your manager dot
aspx where we have our table this table
right click it and say view in browser
and it will open this data table inside
the manager dot aspx and you have the
same data programming knowledge ABC at
the rate gmail.com
password
and the country okay now this is
designing your database in the next
video I will show you how to bind your
database with your registration form
which is SPX registration form so stay
tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
