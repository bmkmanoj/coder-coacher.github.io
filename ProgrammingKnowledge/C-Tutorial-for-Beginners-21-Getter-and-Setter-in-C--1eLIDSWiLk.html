teach you about setter and getter method
in c-sharp so to start with for example
I have at last called a book and this
book book class have three public
variables public int ID which is a book
ID public string book name and public
int number of pages which is assigned to
a BAC value of 250 now in
object-oriented programming it's a bad
idea to declare your variables as public
numbers of the class and why it's a bad
idea or it's bad practice to declare
your variables public because for
example our book class is here right and
book ID cannot be negative right and
book name cannot be null in in normal
circumstances and our number of pages
you cannot change the number of pages
right book a book contains a certain
number of pages you cannot change the
number of pages in the book right now
for example if you declare them public
numbers variables of the class what the
other user can do is other user can
declare the instance of a class called B
is equal to new book and then he can
access your ID for example B thought ID
and he can assign negative values to the
ID for example minus 10 and it will be
perfectly valid but in real situations
the ID cannot be negative right book ID
cannot be negative and when I want to
print this ID I can even print the
decide I need
console dot right right line and I can
say here book ID is and then my
placeholder and then I can say okay ID I
can call this book ID here right and
when I run the this code it will work
perfectly fine even though it's not
allowed to set the book ID a negative
value right in the same way somebody can
even assign a null value to the book our
each and every book and for example we
are taking the example of book so have
you seen any book having the null value
but in this case when you declare your
book variable public what some other
user can do B dot book name and he can
assign this annul and this means that
your book don't have any name book name
is Molly so you can just call this and
run the program and program runs fine
but it's not valid in real conditions
right the book name cannot be null in a
same way somebody in real situations
when you have declared a book class it
has a certain number of pages you cannot
change the number of pages or usership
user should not be able to change the
number of pages but look at here B dot
number of pages and I can change it to
300 3000 even
and I can call book pages is number of
pages and the user can be able to change
even the number of pages which is not
allowed so that's why it's not a good
idea to declare your members of your
class as a public members so it's a good
practice to declare your member
variables as private okay
so what I can do private and whenever I
declare my variables as private what
will happen is so let's see what happens
I declare all the book number variables
as private as soon as I declare them
private you see your assignments are
invalid now so you cannot directly
access these variables so when you hover
over here it says that this book what ID
is inaccessible due to protection level
because this is a private number of a
class a private member cannot be
accessed outside your class okay so this
is a class and this is the boundary of
this private member and it cannot be
used outside the class so this is one
level of protection you have given to
the variables now nobody will be able to
access them directly but if nobody
should be able to access them directly
how can you assign a name to a book or
assign some other values to a book
so what we use is a setter and get the
getter method and what are these setter
and getter method these are nothing but
a way of indirectly accessing your
variable private variables and
protecting your private variables
against invalid conditions so for
example I will declare the setter and
getter method for ID how we can declare
a setter and getter method so first of
all we will declare a set method of our
variable ID so it start with public and
what hit return it will return integer
because our ID is an integer right
public int and when then we say set ID
okay so setter method how we can define
this setter method generally we add the
set before your variable name okay and
then this set method takes an argument
in ID for example for ID and what people
do is
let me give this bracket once again and
what it will do is it will return an
integer okay or this will not return
into a bag of bag your pardon it will be
provide and the get method will return
the value so it is declared like this
public void set ID and it just has set
and the name of your variable and what
you need to do here is take your teapot
private member variables so you can
access it like this this dot ID is equal
to this ID okay in the same way to
declare a get method what you need to do
is you need to do public get and the
name of the ID so get ID and what it
does is it returns an integer and why it
returns an integer because the proto it
has to return the ID of the book right
so in the code we will just return
return this dot ID okay so indirectly we
are returning this variable so this side
method is used to set the value and get
method is used to return the value or
access the value of it but we have still
or user can still give the negative
value to ID right so what this method
can do is if your ID or this ID is less
than
zero then we can print a message so we
just copy this and we can say the ID is
not valid or ID is yeah so the book ID
is not valid so now we have added a
protection against the negative values
okay so no user should be able to assign
a negative value to your variable ID
right
but even this will also we'll be able to
assign the negative value to the ID why
it will just go here and you'll see okay
ID is less than zero and it will print
it and to assign it so what we can do is
we can throw an exception so how to
throw an exception just right throw new
exception okay and what this will do is
it will throw an exception by saying
this message and then it will this
condition will not be reached okay so
let's try to set the value of value of
ID a negative value okay so let's say B
dot set value set ID
is equal to minus 10 minus 10 okay
and how you can get this ID by calling
this I get ID method and what if you
return it returns the ID right so
ideally it should return whatever it's
assigned to the ID I'll run the program
and as soon as I will I run the program
it's not showing any result and it
throws an exception see it throws an
exception and it says the book ID is not
valid which is our message right it
doesn't go even to the next next code so
in this way we can protect our variables
by assigning invalid values okay the
same we can do for book name so I will
copy this set and get values and paste
it here and now it will be set book name
and get book name okay and this is a
string variable book name is a string
variable so we will pass string book
name and then in the get method it will
return a string right and we will return
book name and in the set method what we
have said earlier that book can not be
null or empty book name cannot be null
and empty so what we can do is in the if
condition we can say what we can say
string dot is null or empty this is a
property in a string to check if your
string is null or empty okay so if my
book name is null or empty I can say the
book name name is not valid so I can
throw that this exception or otherwise
if I get this valid name I will just
assign the value of book to my private
variable and I can access a slight
existed it like this so let's assign
book ID positive and once again let's
assign book name on null value okay book
name I can say null and let's try to
access this so I say book name is and we
call this court get book method and I
will run the program and once again it's
expected to throw the error ever and it
says the book name is not valid it's
showing this exception but whenever I
pass the valid name for example I pass
the name c-sharp tutorial books and now
I will run the program it prints that
book is book name is c-sharp tutorial
book ok so in this way we can protect
our variables which are fragile or which
are which have the capacity to be to
take invalid values we can protect them
using setter and getter method in the
same way for accessing this number of
pages we can only define a gate value
and we can avoid defining the set value
so whenever we define an get value for
number of pages we can only get the
number of pages and we cannot be or the
user cannot be able to set the number of
pages right so what you can do here you
can say public this will be our public
int method ok public int get number of
books and what it will do return this
dot number of pages so it will just
return the number of pages and nobody
can assign the number of pages to it ok
so I can just
P dot get number of pages and I will run
the program it will run fine number of
pages is book name is 250 I can say if
book pages is so now it says book pages
is 250 so always remember that whenever
you need to declare variables in the
class try to make them private and try
to access them with the getter and
setter values it's always a good
practice so I hope you have understood
the basic concept of getters and setters
and I hope you have understood enjoyed
