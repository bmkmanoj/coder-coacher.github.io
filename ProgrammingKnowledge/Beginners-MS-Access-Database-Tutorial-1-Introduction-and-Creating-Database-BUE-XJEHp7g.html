starting a new video series on Access
database tutorial for beginners and they
in this first tutorial I'm going to show
you how you can create a new database
and how you can create tables inside
your database and how you can give it
columns to the tables and how you can
insert data to the tables and I will be
creating these videos on Access 2007 but
if you are using a Access 2010 or Access
2013 also you can follow these videos
because there is not much difference in
those two versions of access so let's
get started first of all we need to
create a database and what is a database
a database is an organized collection of
data right so let's create a database in
Access now if you have already installed
access and you don't know how you can
start access you can just go to your
Start button and search for access here
and you will see somewhere in the search
result Microsoft Office access and the
version you have just open it and it
will open this for you Microsoft or exes
now search for the option called blank
database we are going to create a blank
database
there are several templates also for the
databases which you can choose but I am
going to teach you the basics so we will
start with the blank database so just
search for the option called blank
database which is this and in here on
the right bottom side you will be able
to see this file name so this is the
name of the database you are going to
care
okay so here you need to give the name
of the database so for example I want to
create a database of the employee
information so I will give the name to
the database as employee info database
okay
employee info so I will be creating this
database and I will insert some table in
my employee information database or
employee info database and you can save
your database in the specified location
by default it will save your database in
your Documents folder but you can change
this default location by just clicking
this button and you can just change the
location for example I will create a new
folder here and I will name it as Access
database okay so once gain access
database okay and inside this folder I
am going to save my employee info
database okay so we click OK and then I
will click this button call create and
once you click this button you will be
presented with this screen and here we
will be creating the tables we will be
creating the columns in the table and we
can insert even the data into the table
now whenever you create a table for
example this is default table which
access is created for us but for example
you click this button and you click this
button without saving it then if this
will not be saved inside your database
so I click
this cancel button and now you have the
blank perspective yeah so because we
haven't saved this table it will not be
included in your database now let's
create a new table in the employee info
database for that you will see here some
tabs right and so these are called
tabs and in here there is a toolbar and
you can choose any tool to create or do
different stuff here so what I am going
to do is I will go to this create tab
and I will choose a table and when I
choose this table it will create a table
for us but first of all before creating
a table we want to design our table
first right so I will just click this
button design table and you will be
presented with this prospector and in
here this is the field name data type
and description field name is the title
of your column of the table and the data
type is the form in which your columns
will take the input I will describe the
star type in detail when I create some
column and the description by the name
you know if you want to give the
description to your column you can give
it here so let's get started so for
example I want to create a table called
the employee employee data table for
example right so employee data table
what it can contain it can contain
employee ID employee name employer name
phone number country city whatever you
want to have in your table so we will
start
it employee ID so I will say this table
will contain a ID which means employee
ID and the data type of this employee ID
will be a number right employee ID can
be a number or it's better to give it
auto number what auto number does is it
will increment automatically and you
don't need to increment it by yourself I
will show the demonstration and you will
understand so this means the data type
is the form in which your column will
take the input so this employee ID will
take input in the form of number right
and because it's auto number it will be
generated automatically you can give
text data type mamo number date time
currency there are many different data
types here but employee ID is an odd for
example auto number and here you can
give description for now I am NOT giving
any description here the second column
name for example I will give is name and
it's not necessary that you will you
know give this name in capital letters
or small letters you can give it in any
case but just remember don't give any
space like name whatever name name so
don't give any space in between it's not
a good practice okay
so just give the name of the column like
this or you can give the name of the
column like first name so I haven't left
any space in between these two words
right and this first name data type will
be 'text yes because data type for first
name names are the strings of words
right so for word so this will be our
text data type now the last name will
also be a text right because last name
is also a string now for example we want
to give the date of birth of an employee
right so I will name my column name as
DOB which stands for date of birth so I
can give the description here DOB stands
for
date of birth right and date of birth is
a date so data type will be date/time
here now you can do certain things with
your data the data type assume when you
select this row here which is DOB you
will be able to see this general for
property fields here and first feel here
is the format in which you want to show
that date okay so there are different
format you can show your date you can
show a date like 19-0 6-2 thousands
and the time also you can show this like
this 19 and the full month name in text
and then the year 2007 or you can have
different format so for example I have
choose this format called medium date
okay now there is a way in which you can
also input the value which is called
input mask okay so for example I want to
input the value in the form in some form
just select this and just click this
three-dot button and you need to save
your table first for that so I will say
yes and I will give the name of my table
here okay so I will say my table name is
employee data okay and I will click OK
and I will say yes so you immediately
see here my table name change to
employee data here right and now I have
input mask wizard and in here I can
choose this input like this you can
choose in which form you want to give
your input and it will show in the form
you choose in the format so I will
choose the same input as I have given
the form format here but you can choose
any input type here and I will click
finishing okay now we create for example
country employees country so this
country will be a text and for example
you your employees or your company is
located in a specific country for
example you are USA then what you can do
is you can give a default value to
column also so for example I choose this
country row or column yeah and I go to
the properties and there is a property
called default value and I can give the
default value to my column so that it
will always show this default value for
example us a right and I will add some
more columns here but let's see how our
table looks like till now so you can go
to this view button here and just click
it and it will ask you to save the
changes you say yes and you are now in
the view of the table so you can see
here we have e ID name last name date of
birth and the country column has default
value USA which we have given default
value now there is a concept called
primary key so if you don't if you have
noticed that this in Eid has this small
key symbol before it it's not necessary
that you need to give only this to Earth
to your this key to your column but what
this primary key does is it is a row or
it is a column which uniquely identifies
your row data okay because each employee
ID will be different or unique in itself
to employee ID
cannot be same and that's the primary of
purpose of primary key so primary key is
a identifier which is unique in itself
okay so employee ID in our case is a
unique column which will distinguish the
data and you can remove this primary key
but by this clicking this word button
once again you see here now there is no
primary key you can give the primary key
to any column for example this one or
you can change it to this one once again
but try to choosing the primary key
which is unique so which contains the
unique data and you will be able to
differentiate your raw data on the basis
of this primary key so two primary key
cannot be same okay as a rule of thumb
pocket now we go to we will save this
and we will go to the view okay and when
you see here because it's auto increment
when I click here in this first name
column and I enter some value for
example mark this is auto-generated
because you you see here it's Auto
number so it is automatically generated
even if you don't give any value to it
okay so it has taken the value one last
name
for example some name date of birth you
see here it takes the input in some
format we have given in which we have
given so it takes the format we will
give the format 19 June 8 e8 for example
and the default value for the country is
already USA and once you enter the data
for the table you can save your daughter
and this data will be saved right you
can once again go to the design section
and you can add more values here right
so what else we can give we can give
telephone number for example so I will
say phone and you can give phone number
as a numerical value so naturally you
will think that if it's a telephone
number you can enter the numerical value
but for example if you want to give your
phone number in brackets with your
country codes or some city codes then
you can always choose it text and you
can would go to the property and you can
choose your input mask so I will leave
it as a text and I will go to input mask
and I will click this button once again
and I will say yes and there are some
default input types which you can choose
for example password phone number or you
can create your input types also so for
example you want to create a input type
for your phone number
I hope already have this input type
phone number but for example I want to
create a new input type or a phone
number what I can do is I can add it
list I can just click this button and it
and I will say next because phone number
one phone number already exists and then
I can give a new input type in this list
so for example I want to enter new
telephone number and the input mask so
input mask is the form of data in which
you want to enter your daughter so this
can be seen from the help how you can
give input mask just click your help
here
and it will open this page here and you
can scroll down and there is a table
here and this will give you an idea what
is what so whenever you give 0 here user
must enter or digit when you give 9 here
user can enter a digit digit or whenever
you give L here user must enter a letter
and you can read this list what is what
so for example I will give the C rows
here so that user must enter the values
because the phone number cam must
contain a certain number of digits right
for example I will give this bracket and
inside this I will give 0 0 0 so I will
give bracket 0 0 0 once again a bracket
and then a normal number so this 3
number will be for example city code and
outside the bracket will be the phone
number so I will give for example 5
digit phone number or 6 digit phone
number so I will add 6
six zeros here okay and once you are
done just close it and it says P cannot
be empty sample data you can give sample
data for example the city code is two to
two and the phone number is one two
three four five six
okay of five I have entered only five
zeros I can add one more and I can add
one more six game and I will close it
and you can see our data type is added
here in the list and you can finish it
now whenever you go to view then I just
need to save it and you can see here you
can enter the number in the format you
have provided some number okay
now for example your employee comes from
different countries and you know the
list of the countries you want in this
country column so just go to your design
just select your country column and
there is a data type called lookup
wizard which enables you to give a list
or list of values you want to provides
so just choose this I will type in the
values that I want just choose the
second option and click Next and here
you can give the list of values you want
to see for example first value of the
country is us a second will be UK third
may be India both may be Germany China
and
branch for example and just click Next
and click finish
so now when you go to view here you save
it you and when you want to add at this
country you will have this combo box and
you can see you have the list and you
can choose the values from the list okay
so for example I choose China and I save
the data and I give one more data for
example some name so the name and the
date of birth mmm
see what can I give date of birth and
the telephone number starts from here
and I will just save the data so in this
way you can create a database you can
create a table you can create a column
inside the table and you can punch in
data in your tables so I think that's
enough for this video in the next video
I will discuss some more features of
Access database so I hope you will be
watching these videos and I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
