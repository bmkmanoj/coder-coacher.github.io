you how you can download and install
that Java JDK 10 on your Windows 10
operating system so let's get started
and let's see how we can do it so first
of all go to your favorite browser and
search for Java JDK 10 and the first
link which will appear here will be from
Oracle comm and the heading here will
say Java SE development kit then so just
click on that link I'm going to give you
the link in the description for this
website so you can directly click on
that link and you can directly go to
this website in here just click I agree
and in here you will see Java SE
development kit 10 downloads if you want
to see more you can go to overview and
you will be able to get some more
information about Java in general and
about this version so once again I'm
going to click on download and in the
download section I will click on this
Java download button which says Java
platform JDK 10 and this will also
redirect to the same page which will be
linked in the description so in here
what we need to do is we need to choose
the version we want to install which is
for Windows so I'm going to just check
this radio button first of all accept
license terms and conditions and then
choose the last option which says
windows 64 bin dot exe file and once you
click on this exe file it's around 390
megabyte file so it will take some time
to download so I'm going to just wait
for the download to complete so the
download of this JDK 10.0 point 1
windows x64 Ben dot exe file is complete
so I'm going to double click on this
executable file and I'm going to
minimize by a browser now the first step
is you will see this kind of warning you
just need to say yes here and now you
can see the setup wizard for this Java C
devil
and kit10 has been started so in here
it's really straightforward so you just
need to click Next here and on the next
window you will see the installation
part where Java JDK will be installed so
it will be installed in your C directory
and then in a sitter directory Program
Files and then there will be a Java
directory created and then inside the
Java directory there will be a JDK 10.0
point one will be created so if you
don't have the good reason to change it
you just need to leave it as default and
I'm going to click Next here and this is
going to start the installation process
now in the middle of the installation
you will see this kind of custom setup
window so here you will see the path of
the JRE directory so JRE stands for Java
runtime environment and this will be the
location of the JRE directory so if you
don't have the good reason to change it
just leave it as default and this
checkbox which says enable Java content
in the browser I think this is not going
to harm us so I'm going to just leave it
as default and I'm going to just click
on the next button and this will start
the installation of Java you can see
installing Java and now I can see this
message which says Java SE development
kit 10 is successfully installed so I'm
going to just close this window and now
I'm going to verify the location of Java
JDK first of all so I'm going to open my
folder Explorer and then I'm going to go
to the C and in here I'm going to go to
the Program Files directory and in here
you will see the Java directory which is
created by this Installer and here you
will see our two directories one is jdk
10.0 point one which is the version of
java jdk and other is JRE directory
which is java runtime environment now in
the next step what we are going to do is
we are going to set the environment
variable for the Java JDK and JRE so
that the Java commands we
we'll be recognized by your command line
or terminal so let's do that so what you
need to do is you just need to go inside
your JDK directory and then go inside
the bin directory and then you need to
copy this part up to bin directory
inside the JDK directory and then right
click on your window icon here so right
click on the window icon and then choose
the control panel option from here now
once the control panel is open you just
need to click on system and security
option and in the systems and security
you just need to choose the system
option here so just click on system and
once this system is open you just need
to click on the advanced system settings
on the left hand side so I'm going to
click on advanced system settings and
once this system settings window is open
you just need to click on environment
variable and in the environment variable
window you will see under system
variables a variable called path so you
just need to double click on this and in
here you just need to click new and then
paste the path you have copied so we
have copied C program files and then
Java and then jdk 10.0 point 1 up to bin
directory right so we have seen we have
copied this part from here and we just
need to copy it here ok same we will do
for the JRE directory so I'm going to go
to the Java directory once again and
this time I'm going to go to the JRE
directory and then the bin directory and
then copy the path up to bin and then
once again add a new variable and then
paste it here so we have pasted the JDK
bin directory and we have pasted the
part of the JRE bin directory and now
I'm going to click ok so this is going
to set the Java environment variables
for your Windows 10 operating system now
let's also set the Java home environment
variable so for setting the Java home
variable and as a system variable you
just need to click new and in here you
just need to write Java underscore home
and then in the variable value you just
need to choose that JDK folder so just
choose the JDK folder and then copy the
path up to JDK not up to Ben but up to
JDK folder and then paste this part here
and then click OK which is going to add
this environment variable in your
Windows operating system and now we are
going to just click OK okay and then we
are going to close this window now in
order to verify if Java is installed
perfectly on your system and environment
variables are also working fine we just
need to open the terminal so we are
going to just right click on the windows
icon and now I'm going to open the
command prompt and this is going to open
the command prompt and once the command
prompt opens you just need to write this
command Java - version and then press
Enter which is going to give you the
version of Java which is installed on
your system and in the result you will
see the Java version which is 10.0 point
1 this is the version we have installed
and also the Java SE runtime environment
version also you can see build 10.0
point 1 so this version is also 10.0
point 1 so if you see this message then
Java is working fine on your system this
Java command is recognized and in order
to verify once again you can give this
command Java C c'mon so Java C and then
press ENTER and if you see this kind of
long output then it means Java C command
is also working fine on your windows
operating system this Java C command is
the command to compile your java program
so you can see the usage tip is also
given here so Java C then you give your
options to compile and the source file
which is the Java source file
so if you see this kind of output then
Java is installed on your system and
it's working perfectly fine so I hope
