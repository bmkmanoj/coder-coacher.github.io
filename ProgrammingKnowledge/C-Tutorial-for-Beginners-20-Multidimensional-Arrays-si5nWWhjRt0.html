last couple of videos I have been
teaching you about arrays now in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
declare and use multi dimensional array
in C++ so let's see how we can declare
multi-dimensional array for example
array of 2 cross 2 or 2 cross 3 how we
can declare this now for declaration
it's the same as array so I will just
name my array as my parry and then you
give the square bracket and then you
give the element number and number of
element your array will contain this
till this you know now in order to
declare a multi-dimensional array you
can or two dimensional array you will
give one more square bracket and give
the value of columns so I will I will
explain once I'm done finish writing so
I will give this and this and one more
this and comma okay and give the values
okay so now I am finished now what this
array means this means this is array
which is a two dimensional array and
which contains two rows and three
columns right so you can think it like
this so this is an array of 1 2 3
and 4/4 and quiet
so this array in logically will look
like this it's a two-dimensional array
which has one and two rows and one two
and three columns right so in your mind
you can map this array like this now in
order to access the value for example I
want to print out this value I want the
index of this value right so how you can
find the index of this value is just
like coordinates if you have studies
coordinated school you know that this is
my 0 through and I want the column or I
item to of this zeroth row or item 1
this is item 1 because our array starts
from 0 right so for example I will write
C out and I want to print this to here
so I will say my array and this will be
like this and once more ok so now I want
to print this value so first of all I
will see which in which row this value
is so this is the row number 0 so I will
write 0 here and this is my column
number 1 or index of the column is 1
logically it's 1 2 3
but index start from 0 0 1 2 right
that's why I'm right here 1
so this logically should draw or print
to let's try and see whether it prints 2
or not yes it prints
now for example we want to print five so
this five is our in our 0th row and one
so index of this row is 1 and the column
index is 0 1 2 so we will write here 1
row number 1 or index of the row is 1
and the index of the column is to save
run and you can see 5 is printed now
there is more convenient way of printing
this two-dimensional array for example
you have a bigger array for cross 5
array or then crossed an array you
cannot pray logically you know you you
if you want to print it like this how
you can print it let's see so you need
to declare a for loop and the curly
braces and once again a for loop so you
need to have a nested for loop or you
need to use nested for loop and in this
for first for loop
what I am going to do is I will declare
I or let's see I will declare it
logically so I will say this will
contain this for loop will move around
the rose and row index will start from 0
and it will go up to row less than 2
because we have only two rows and row
plus plus in the same way I will declare
or I will initialize for loop for column
and column is equal to 0 and then this
column will go up to
column is less than three because we
have three columns and column past plus
plus now in order to print this value
what I'm going to do is I will see out I
will write C out and then I will take
this array myarray and then I will write
here to take this row element here and
paste it here and the column element
here and paste it here and one more
thing if you want to print just like
this you need to give the space right
give space here and in order to change
the row you need to write or change the
row in the outer for loop so
you just say see out and line okay now
what this for nested for loop will do is
it will rule ooh it will loop around
rose and then it will loop around
columns and it will print all the row
element and column element so for
example row we go to row number 0 and we
go to column number 0 first so here the
values will be show me the value of 0
cross 0 so row number 0 and column
number 0 and the element 0 cross 0 in
this array is this one so it will print
this then 0 1 is 0 2 like this so let's
try and run the program and you can see
it has printed just like this 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
4 5 so by using nested for nested for
loop you can print the values in the
multi-dimensional array I hope you have
