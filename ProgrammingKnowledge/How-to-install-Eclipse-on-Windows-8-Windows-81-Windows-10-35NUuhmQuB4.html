show you how you can install Eclipse IDE
for developing Java programs on your
windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
system so first thing you need to do is
you need to have Java JDK installed in
your system in order to compile your
program so I will put the link in the
district description so that you know
that Java JDK is installed in your
system and then only you will be able to
install Eclipse and that makes sense
otherwise if you install Eclipse without
Java JDK it will not make much of a
sense and so just see the link below if
you don't have Java JDK and just the
simple test to check whether Java is
present in your system is just to just
open your command prompt and just right
here Java C just this is the command to
compile your Java files and if you see
some output here then you know that Java
is installed in your system otherwise
you need to install Java JDK and just go
in the description and click the link
and see the video where I have shown you
how it installs Java JDK ok so now we
want to install Eclipse IDE for
developing Java in our Windows 8
operating system so just open your web
browser and in here just search for
Eclipse IDE download
and press enter and the first link you
will find here is from
www.logicvoltage.com
and in here you will be able to find
some of the versions to develop or to a
to download okay so for developing Java
standard programs we are not going to
use Java EE but we want to use Java
developers Eclipse for Java developers
so you need to download this in your
operating system which is Java IDE for
Java developers and you need to know
what bit your system has is it a 64-bit
system or a 32-bit system so if you
don't know what bit or what flavor of
system you have you need to go to your
Start screen in Windows 8 and search for
systems so
system and click it and you will be able
to see system type so I have 64 bit
operating system right now okay but if
you have 32 bit you need to download 32
bit zip file for eclipse so I have 64
bit so I will just click this windows 64
bit okay
and in here you will see some of the
mirrors for downloading Java the nearest
mirror from my location is this one but
this will depend upon your location
which mirror is nearer to you so I will
click this link here which is just below
download Eclipse Java ok so I will click
this link and now download will start it
will take around 1 minute to download
it's not a very big file but 155 mb file
so I will let this file to download and
once it's downloaded I will show you how
you can open this Eclipse and how to run
it
ok so I will pause the video while it's
downloading and once it's downloaded I
will let you know so the download for
Eclipse zip file is complete it's a zip
file which I have downloaded so I can go
to my downloads folder
and I can see here Eclipse standard Luna
in here ok so I want to extract this zip
file first I will then so I will right
click and extract all so I will
right-click and click this button
extract all and where I want to extract
this it's in here itself so I will
click extract
it will extract this file in some time
so I will let this file to extract and
once it's extracted then I will show you
what to do next
okay so the download or extraction of
this zip file is complete so I extracted
this file here itself and this is the
extracted file folder and here is the
folder it contains so it contains just
this zip or this Eclipse folder here
right so what you need to do is take
this Eclipse folder and move it to the
local disk we just see and we move it to
this Program Files folder so just you
can drag and drop in here or just
right-click cut this from here go to
Program Files and right click paste it
here okay and press Continue
so now your Eclipse folder is in your
local disk slash Program Files okay and
once you go inside the cyclists you will
be able to see this icon here for
Eclipse and this is the icon you want to
use to open Eclipse IDE just right click
and see if you can pin it to the menu
you can do it to the menu
I have classic shell installed so I can
pin it to the Start menu or I can even
pin and pin it to the taskbar I will pin
it to my Start menu which I have in
classic shell so I will right-click and
do that and once I do that I will be
able to see here this Eclipse icon here
ok so once you have this you just need
to double click it
and for the first time when you open
this Eclipse IDE it will ask for the
workspace which you want to use this
message will come in a moment so let's
wait for that message
and I will say run anyway
so you sees Eclipse IDE is starting now
and I was talking about this workspace
launcher so this will be your default
workspace in which you are going to
create your project so if you want this
location and if you want that all of
your project will go in this directory
which is workspace which is provided by
eclipse itself then you can just click
OK or otherwise you can choose the
folder of your choice and give it as a
workspace ok I will leave it as default
and I will check this but checkbox which
says use this as a default ok so this
will be my default workspace where all
my project will go so just remember this
and click OK
and then it will prepare the workspace
for me and it will load the IDE
so now I clips have started I will
minimize all other folders or I will
close them completely and for the first
time when you open Eclipse IDE it'll
look like this it has samples it has
tutorials you can just click overview up
or you can take a overview of this
Eclipse and if you want to make your
first project you need to go this to
this file tab here go to new and click
this Java project because we want to
make Java project with Eclipse and you
need to give the name for your project
for example
hello world and all other things I
believe them as default so this is the
Java Runtime environment which my
machine has it will it recognizes
Eclipse all automatically recognizes
this and the project layout or will
leave it as default and I will click
finish but this is not all because when
we create a project it will not create
any code for you okay so what you need
to do here is go here or cancel this
welcome screen from here close this and
now you will be able to see your project
hello world which we have created right
now but if you see here it just have the
source folder which is empty so there is
nothing inside this folder so now when
you want to run this it will not run
because you don't have any source code
right so what you can do here is you can
right-click on this source folder
right-click and go to new and you can
say new class and in here you can create
your new class so I will leave all of
this as default but in the name section
here this one I will name my class as
hello world and it's a good practice to
use camel case camel case means the
first letter of your word starts from
capital letter and then other letters
are small and then it will be same with
the second word suppose the first letter
will be capital and others will be small
okay and only I just need to give the
name of my class the source or the
folder for this will be the source
folder it's automatically here but one
important thing if you want to make a
sample program you just need to check
this which is public static main string
args and what this will do is it will
create a main function for you or main
method for you
and every program needs one main
function or method every Java program
needs it okay so for the first time I
will check it when I make other projects
in Java I generally don't do this I make
my main program manually but for the
first time you can check this option and
will create main method for you
automatically so just click this or
check this option which is public static
void main and click finish
and now you will be able to see this
hello world file here and you will be
able to see that Eclipse has created
some code for you which is a public
class HelloWorld we have created and the
main method so every Java program needs
one at least one main program and only
one main program okay so it eclipse has
created the sample program for us what I
can do is I can just right
system
dot out
dot
print line so
print Ln and then I can print something
in this bracket so what I will do is I
will give these double quotes and I will
write hello
world okay so suppose I want to print
hello world for the first time I can do
this like this and then I need to run
this okay so I will just click run
and for the first time when you compile
your program it'll ask for this one just
select this HelloWorld dot Java file
which we have created and click OK and
now you will be able to see hello world
here ok so this is the console where
your all output will be printed if you
want to print any output so just see
here and you are successfully you are
you have successfully created your first
hello world program with your Eclipse
IDE using Java so I hope you enjoyed
