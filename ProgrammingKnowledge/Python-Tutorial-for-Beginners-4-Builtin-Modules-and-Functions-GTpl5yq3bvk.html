show you how to use built-in modules and
functions in Python so if you have
remembered that in the previous videos I
have shown you how to calculate the
exponent of some value so for example I
want 2 to the power 3 I can use 2 and
then these two Asterix and then I can
write 3 and this means 2 to the exponent
3 and gives me the value of 8 ok but
there is a easier way of doing the same
thing and this is by using a building
functions which are provided by - so
what R is a function first of all if you
are new to programming a function is a
piece of food which executes some
function or some logic ok so a function
is a piece of code which executes some
logic so for example you want to
calculate the exponent of 2 like this
you can do it like this or you can use a
built in function which executes of
exponent function right so you can use p
or W which is power and this function
takes 2 arguments first is the value
which is 2 and then the exponent which
is 3 or this means 2 to the power 3 it
also gives you the value 8 which is same
and it's more easier to use this and
it's more easier to understand this
expression rather than this because it's
more descriptive right now how do you
know that what are the built in function
in Python ok so if you don't know what
are the built in function there is a
command to know what are all built in
functions in pipe and what is this the
man this command is you just need to
write di R and then give these two
brackets and this two brackets just
write double underscore and then just
write built-ins and then double an
underscore once again and you just need
to give this command and what this
command just press ENTER and what this
command will return this command will
return all the built-in functions which
you can use in Python
okay so for example I was using P or W
which is a power function and you can
find this P of W function here okay this
is the power function so you can see you
can calculate hacks there is a function
called abs with to calculate absolute
value so for example I want to calculate
I will use a be s and I will write
eighteen point six six six six and press
ENTER it gives me the absolute value of
ABS this should be it will be different
I think it should be like this and okay
so it give me the absolute value of the
number okay or you can use this print to
print something or you can find this le
n function to find the length of a
string so I can use le n and give some
strings for example I can write hello
which is a five letter string 1 2 3 4 5
right and this length will return the
length of this word which gives 5 right
so and there are some other useful
functions like minimum max
simoom slice so these are all the
built-in functions in Python now once
you know the function that okay this
function exists here now how you can
know that what is the functionality of
this function right so to know the
functionality of the function what you
need to do you can use a built-in
function called help
that's help okay so for example you want
to know what this function called Max
does okay so what you can do you can
just write help and then in the brackets
you can just write the name of the
function for example you want to know
what this function Max does you just
write help and in the bracket just write
max okay and press ENTER and this max
you can see here so this helps is that
this Max is a function which can take
more than one argument multiple argument
and it gives the I think maximum value
of those arguments right so you can see
it with a single it readable argument
returns its largest item okay so now I
know that when I use a function called
Max and I can give multiple argument for
comma 2 comma 1 comma 5 comma 8 and when
I press ENTER it give me the maximum
value which is 8 right so in this way
you can use this help function to find
out what these other built-in function
does or what is the use of these written
functions right now this is about the
function of built-in function now there
is something called built-in mod
okay and these built-in modules are the
extra modules which contains extra
functions or extra functionalities which
you can use whenever you choose or
whenever you you include these modules
so for example you want to know or you
want to calculate the square root of
some value so there is a module called
so for example you want to know the
square root of something so there is a
module called the math you can use it
for this
so to include a module you need to
import this module and how you can
import the slide import and this is the
key word to include the module and then
the name of the module which is for
example math in our case and when you
press ENTER now you have included this
module now how you can use the function
inside this module you can just you
write the name of this module which is
math dot and then you can use all them
you can see there are different options
with you which you can use with this
module called math you can see here
right so whenever you write dot can you
give you some options you can see and
this options you can scroll it by up and
down keys okay so this math module has
these much amount of built-in functions
right you can scroll up or scroll down
and what function I am you I want to use
I want to search for square root so
there is a square root here okay so I
can use square root I have press ENTER
so this gives me some values of the once
again math dot s Q R T and then I can
find the square root of any number for
example I want to find the square root 9
will give me the answer 3 so in this way
there are some built in modules also and
this these Wilton mod will also have
some function built-in functions and you
can import these built-in modules using
a keyword input and the name of the
module and then you can use these
modules like the name of the module and
the function which it contains now
sometimes these modules are you know
hard to you know spell all right so what
you can do you can define your own
variable for these modules names for
example I can declare a variable called
square root which is equal to this math
dot s QRT okay now whenever you use
square root variable you can perform the
same functionality for example I want to
find out the square root of 9 it will
give me 3 so you can replace these
built-in functions in module by your
variable using this equal to sign ok and
now you have your own variable which can
calculate the square root or any other
function so in this way you can use
built-in modules and built-in functions
in Python I hope you have enjoyed this
