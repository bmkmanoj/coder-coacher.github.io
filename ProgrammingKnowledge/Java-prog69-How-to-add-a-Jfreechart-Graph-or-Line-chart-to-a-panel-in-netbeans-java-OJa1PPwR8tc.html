last tutorial I've shown you how to make
a bar chart and now in this tutorial I
will show you how to convert or make
your bar chart into the graph or a line
chart so sometimes instead of bars we
required a straight line so I will show
you how to convert a new bar chart into
that so go to your code and the last
tutorial I am showing you how to make a
bar chart and when you click this bar
chart button your bar chart is open so
like a right-click that put the event
action action perform and this is the
code I have shown you in last two
tutorials so what you have to do is
first of all I will run the program and
I will show you how one bar chart looks
like for example I click this and I
click bar chart so this is your part of
you can see the bar now I have the same
code bar chart this code and I want to
convert it into the line chart or graph
so what you have to do is go here where
you defined J pre chart chart is equal
to J chuck is equal to chart factory dot
create bar chart 3d
go there it's below your data set values
so this is the Declaration of the chart
J free chart chart is equal to chart
factory if you don't have a clue where
this comes from you can see my last two
tutorial and I have shown this in to
these tutorials so go to that click here
and delete your create bar chart and
after chart factory you press dot and
here a list of methods come go to the
line chart create line chart just click
create line chart and you are good to go
so instead of create bar chart you just
have to write create line chart and now
when I run the program
and I will click my daughter so data is
represented here when I click my bar
chart I will see my thought I in the
form of the bars so for example my
pressure is 200 my temperature is 300
here and my volume flow is 400 and my
rotational speed is 500 so in this way
you can convert your bar chart into the
line chart I will quickly show you how
to convert this into 3d line charts you
just have to write 3d and when you run
the program and go to your table and
click it will convert it appears to be
3d version of that so that was a small
tutorial how to convert your bar chart
into graph or line chart so I hope this
will help you so thanks for now and
please rate comment and subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
