show you how you can reset your root
password in Ubuntu or any other Linux
operating system if you forgot your a
password so for example I forgot my
login password and now I can no longer
login to my open to operating system
there is a easy way of resetting your
root password so that you have a new
password and you can login with that
password so first of all what you need
to do you need to go to the restart
option here and then just click shut
down and then just be alert you need to
press your shift key here and press
restart ok so when you press restart you
need to hold your shift key so just
press your shift key and hold it until
you can see the recovery menu ok so I
will restart my open to operating system
at the same time I will press my shift
key and hold it until I can see the
recovery menu ok so I am still pressing
my shift key and now you will be able to
see this kind of a recovery menu ok
so in here what you need to do is just
press your down key and go to advanced
option for Ubuntu and then press enter
and in here just go to this option which
says a recovery mode okay so just go to
this option which says in the last
recovery mode and then press enter and
now it's going to open recovery mode so
now you can see your recovery menu now
in this recovery menu you just need to
press your down key once again to reach
to this
route category and then once again press
ENTER and now you can see at the bottom
a command line is opened
so in here you need to give some
commands okay so I'm going to show you
these commands and I'm also going to
paste these command in the description
so you can just copy and paste it there
or you can just see them and just type
them exactly the same okay so the first
command is this command mount - n - o
remount comma read write or RW and then
forward slash okay so I'm going to give
this command mount then - n - o remount
and then comma read write or RW and then
this forward slash and then press ENTER
and now give this command okay
so just give pass WD or password and
then your user name your user name will
appear here in the command line after
the root okay so my user name is
programming knowledge okay so I will
just write pass WD and then the user
name
which is programming knowledge and then
press ENTER and now you can enter your
new password okay so it's a new password
you can set for your login so I'm going
to give my new password and press enter
and retype your new password once again
and press enter and now you can see this
message password update successfully
okay
so now you can reboot you're open to
operating system just give this command
reboot and press enter and now it's
going to reboot you're open to operating
system once again so I'm going to
minimize everything
and now here just give your new password
which you have set okay so I'm going to
give my new password and press enter and
now I will be able to see my window so
now you can see I have been successfully
logged in so in this way you can reset
your root password in Ubuntu or any
other Linux operating system I hope you
