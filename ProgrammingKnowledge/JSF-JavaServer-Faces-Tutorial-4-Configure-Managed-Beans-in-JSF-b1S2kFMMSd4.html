last video I have shown you how to
integrate images or pictures with your
JSF web application so when I run the
program it opens and you can see the
background is like that and we have also
seen how to set this picture last time
and till now we have this application so
when I click this button it goes to
second web page right in this video I
will show you how to use managed bean
with your JSF application and I will
also show you how to use pure Java
classes with your JSF web application so
let's get started till now we have this
web application and in the last video we
have created this resources folder in
which my images reside so I have this
second dot XHTML and I have this index
dot XHTML which I have been showing you
it with the last video now I want to
create a Java class to use managed P so
what I will do is I will go to this
source packages I will right click it go
to new and I will click Java class ok
and you can give your Java class any
name so what can be good give a Java
class name so let's see
user for example and click finish so now
I have this user class first of all I
will create a managed bean so right at
the rate
managed bean and select this Java X dot
faces dot B in one okay which I am
selecting and you will notice it will
automatically import the required
imports so like here when you and this
it will import automatically this one
and we will use sessions so I will write
session scope and make sure it's Java X
dot faces dot bean imports so don't
click upper one but the lower one okay
and it's imposed the other import also
now inside my user class I will declare
a string variable so i will write
private string and the variable name is
name for example and i will also make a
getter and setter method for this
variable string variable so what is the
easiest way to create the getter and
setter automatically just right-click
this name and go to insert code this
insert code and click this getter and
setter and you will come to this
generate getter setup click this one so
because we are using user class that's
why it's asking and we want to create
our Gatos at a class for this name so
that is why we need to take that and now
click generate and it will automatically
create
getter and setter methods okay and just
remember this also and now I will go to
my index dot XHTML which is my first
access tml page in here I already have
some code written so this is my form I
will go to this form inside this form so
we'll go here below this this is the
code which I have written last time so
if you don't know where this code come
from just watch the last few videos and
I will go little bit down and in here I
will create what I will create so I will
create
I will create this edge : input text and
then I will give it a ID ID is not
required but it's good to give this ID
and give it any value so I will write IP
IP text because it's I input text and
give it one so this is our first input
text okay and then I will define a value
so value and here what you need to do is
whatever class you have defined so we
have user dot Java class write user dot
Java
so same copy this from here and go to
index add here and make a hash sign and
give up curly braces and inside your
curly braces paste your class which is
user class and if this class has first
letter start with uppercase then make it
lower so your class always start from
lower case just remember that if even if
it's uppercase in your class definition
then also it's lower case then we want
to call user and the variable name is
dot name so write this and just close
this and the second thing we will do is
command button and this also I will give
it a ID even though it's not required in
this video but maybe in later so I will
name this as C BTN 1 because this is my
first command button no this is my
second command button so I will name it
CB 2 and here this is the first I
haven't given it a ID but maybe in
future so it's good practice to give
these IDs so we can differentiate
between the buttons then we will give it
our value so this is the caption which
appears on it so you can say submit and
then action and in the action what
action do you want to perform we have
seen last time so in this action if you
give the name of the next XHTML file it
will go to this HTML file when it finds
a value so just copy the name of this
second dot H XHTML whatever HTML name
you have and we will write here second
and then we will close it ok so what
this will do is when you click the
button it will navigate to the second
page notice here we are not validating
our input text we are just simply going
from one page to another okay and now go
to your second page say
cannot xhtml and in here we will define
once again I will delete this welcome to
the second page and I will define here
first of all h / form and close it and
inside this form I will define H output
text this one and you can give it ID
also so oh T X t1 and now here the value
so value once again as the last time we
have defined inside this bracket gave
hash curly braces and then user which is
the name of your class with starting
letter small dot name and just close it
so now our code is complete what we have
done is we have made a new Java class
called user we have declared a private
string and declared a getter setter for
it and in my index noticed XHTML I have
defined a input text and a command
button and when I click this button it
should go to the next page and whatever
I enter here it should go to the next
page so let's try and run the program
so I have this submit button and this
text box and I enter something here so
hi youtube and i press this submit and
if you can see here whatever i have
entered in my text box it appears here
so maybe some other via text and submit
and it comes to the next page so this is
possible with the java class and the
managed bean okay so in this way you can
use managed bean with your JSF
application I hope you have enjoyed this
video and please rate comment and
