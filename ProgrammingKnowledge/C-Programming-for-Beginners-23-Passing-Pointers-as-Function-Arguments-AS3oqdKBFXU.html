tutorial on C programming for beginners
in the last two videos we have been
seeing how to use pointers in C and how
we can use array pointers in C now in
this video we will see how we can pass
pointers as an argument of a function so
let me give you an example for example
we want to pass a variable as an
argument to a function which is a
pointer so for example I will write a
function which will take pointer as an
argument so I can return void which is
returning nothing void and then get
value for example this is the name of my
pointer and I am this is the name of my
function a beg your pardon and then I am
passing an argument which is a pointer
to this function right so my pointer for
example pointer okay and then what I am
going to do is basically I am assigning
this so my pointer is equal to some
value okay so something like this
pointer is equal to some value for
example 1 10,000 okay now what this
basically doing is we are using a
function get values
to assign whatever you pass as an
argument of this function is equal to
10,000 right and because we are not
returning anything whenever you want to
return void in C you can just write
return without returning anything just
the keyword return and it means that you
are not returning anything but your
function ends here right now in order to
use this get value function here in our
main for first of all we will declare
our variable for example int get the
value for example right and we are not
initializing it just consider this
because we will store at the address of
this variable test value right so let's
see how we can do this so we will just
call cat value function and remember
what I have said a pointer once again a
pointer is a variable whose value is the
address of another variable right so
this pointer is basically whenever you
want to pass some variable in place of
this pointer as an argument of this
function you can basically pass the
address of some variable in here as an
argument right so how we can pass the
address of some variable address we can
pass it like this and whenever we write
this address at the front of a variable
it means the address of this variable
right basically you can
do something like this so just always
remember this definition a pointer is a
variable whose value is the address of
another variable so this is a pointer so
in place of this pointer we can pass the
address of another variable right and
then what we will do here is print F the
value so the value of get value right so
the magic begins here so the value of
get value is equal to percentage D and
comma and then this value right so what
do you think will be the value of this
variable remember we have 1 initialized
or variable but we have assigned this
variable to the function as an argument
right so let's see the answer and then
we will analyze what we have done so
compile the program and it runs fine and
it says the value of get the value
variable is equal to 10,000 now let's
see what we have done here so what we
have done basically here is what is this
function doing this function is taking a
point or basically a address of a
variable right because a pointer is a
address of another variable right so we
have passed address of another variable
so this argument can be replaced by this
value right address of this variable and
what we have done basically is you have
indirectly here what we have done
here basically indirectly assign value
10,000 at the address of this variable
right now whenever we will access this
variable this value we will be able to
access right so this is the magic of
pointer so you can assign some value to
the address like this and you can access
this value at the address like this okay
and here you are not even returning
anything but this address can store this
value using pointers right so it's I
mean for the first time when I have seen
something like this it looked like a
magic to me now the next thing is I have
told you when I have shown you how to
use arrays as an argument of a function
and at that time I have told you that
you can also pass pointers as an array
arguments right so let us take another
another example okay so I will delete
all this and how we can pass pointer
array as an argument of a function so
for example I will take the same example
that we are going to return integer
value and we want to know the sum of
every element of an array for example
int my array and this array contains for
example four variables and these four
variables can be anything so you can
assign for example 10 comma 20 comma 30
40 okay and we want to get the sum of
each of the elements 10 plus 20 plus 30
plus 40 basically and then we want to
get the results we will make a function
which returns integer and then we can
say get some it takes array as an
argument but I have shown you you can
pass array in three ways to function as
an argument one is like int my or array
well like this or you can just define
the size of the array or third is third
way is you can just pass array like this
as a point right and in this example we
are going to just to the same so we are
passing this pointer array and then we
will also define the size for example so
end size and we will then just use this
array to get the sum so we will just
write four but first of all let's
declare a variable which will contain
the sum sum is equal to zero and then
for inside this for loop we will write
int I is equal to zero and I should be I
should be less than the size whatever we
pass so this size is the size of the
array and in our case the size will be
four right semicolon I plus plus and
then we will just make a sum like sum
plus is equal to if you remain
but I have given this example when we
have seen how to pass arrays to a
function right is equal to and then we
can just take the array and then at
every index of this array we are just
summing this so us we are just adding it
to the sum right and once we have all
the sum we will just return sum okay
this should be returned okay now we are
passing this array we are going to pass
this array as a pointer right so we will
call this function get some and in here
we will also declare a variable int my
sum for example and is equal to because
this will return this function get some
will return the sum of the array which
we will pass as an argument you can just
store it into this variable so I will
pass this my array as a first first
argument and the second argument is the
size of the array which is 4 you can see
here and then we are going to print the
value of my some printf print F and the
value the value of my sum is equal to
percentage D right and let us see the
what is the value of my sum
and basically let us try to run the
program and let's see if it matches the
answer run the program and it gives thus
my sum is 100 so 10 plus 20 is 30 30
plus 30 is 60 60 plus 40 is 100 so our
sum is correct right you can just
increase the value of element in the
array for example five fifty and the
size will be now five here and run the
program and basically you got the answer
150 right so in this way also you can
pass array to a function as a pointer so
