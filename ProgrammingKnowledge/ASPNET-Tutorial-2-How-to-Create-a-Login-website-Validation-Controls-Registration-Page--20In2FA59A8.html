last video I have given you brief
introduction about asp.net and I have
also shown you how to make your first
asp.net website using your Visual Studio
IDE so in the last video I have shown
you how to make this simple website this
is by default created I haven't done
anything to this website it is default
by default created by Visual Studio and
in this video I will show you
specifically about dynamic pages so for
example I want to show you about I will
click login and when whenever you go to
some website for example Facebook or
Google or gmail it has some login page
so for example you gives your login and
password and you can go inside the
website or your own account and there is
something called register option also so
when you click register you can register
yourself to the website so in this video
I will show you how to make this
registration page so for example I write
here username anything and email ID and
a password and confirm password and when
I click this button it says some message
if there is some mistake I have done a
while filling this information it says
password must be 6 character long or I
when I
does not enter any name or email it
shows me these messages so I will show
you how to make this kind of a
registration page and it will also show
these messages using the validation
control which we are going to use in the
in the registration page so this video I
will start with making a new fresh
project and this time we will make a
empty website so I will go file new
website and last time we have chosen
this option asp.net website but it
automatically generates some content for
us and for learning purpose let's start
with creating the empty website so that
we will be able to create our own pages
so I will click empty website and you
can give the path of the website also
and give the name of a other website so
I will say login page for example then
and I choose this empty page and of
course our language is visual C shop and
I click OK and we'll create our M empty
website for us
now let's add a project of not a project
but a webpage to it so I will go to I
will right-click my project and I will
click add new content and I will say web
form and this name I can change so for
example I will write the gist raishin
dot aspx okay and i click add and this
will add a page by default it's in the
source mode source code you can just
click this design mode and it's nothing
but empty design so what we are going to
do is we are going to add a table so
just go to this table here and click
insert and for example we want seven
rows and three columns and I will click
OK
add till creates seven rows and three
columns was so first of all let's going
on following this information for
example I want to write user name email
password and confirm password okay so I
will copy this user name and paste it
here
second is email I will copy this and
paste it here
third is the password I will copy and
paste it and the fourth is the confirm
password field so I will once again copy
and paste it and there is one more field
I want to add here is for example I want
to add a country
country name which you live in so I
added this country and right now you can
see there is some content here so I what
I can do is I can just select this
selection I made is pressing the control
key and selecting one for example one
row second this is a cell not a row and
you select all the cells and what you
can do is you can align these cell
content by going here align and for
example I want to align this in the
right so I can align this in the right
right like this okay and I can also
change the font and other things from
here header height and everything okay
so you can do it from this place and
individually if you go here so I can
what I can do is here I can change the
style title and ID of these this thing
okay so now what I will do is I will add
some text boxes for entering the
information so I will go to the standard
tool box and I will search for the text
box from here and drag and drop into
this cell okay and in the same way I can
drag and drop to the second cell for
email third cell for password both cells
for confirmed password and the country
name generally
we have a drop down menu so let's browse
for drop down list this is the drop down
list and drag and drop into your cell
and you can choose the items in the drop
down list so you can add as many list
item as you want and for example the top
item I want to add is select country
second item is the name of the country
USA for example and third is UK Otis
Germany and the fifth is France for
example and you can add more names of
the country ok and I click OK now I want
to align also align them also so just
select all these controls and what you
can do is you can go to the width and
provide the size of your text boxes and
combo box I'll write 1 8 p PX PX 4 pixel
and I will click enter you see the width
is all automatically changed so I will
click all this control and then I change
the width 180 P
one is TPX okay once you have done that
in here we will add some validation
control so whenever you submit your form
and if some information is not correct
you will be able to see some messages
okay so I was just adjust this a little
and in here I will add validation
control but before that we need to
change the ID names from here okay so
just the ID name of this textbox we name
it as UN for username and second text
box ID is email for example third is
pass pass for password both is our
password repeat password and fifth is
drop down list country okay so we know
that these text boxes and drop down menu
indicates what field now let's add
validation field so validation field is
nothing but these field which appears
when some alert or some wrong
information is given by the user so I
will go to this validation and here I
will choose requested field validation
okay so I will
drag this requested field validation one
by one to my cells corresponding to the
user name/password etcetera okay and now
I can change the message error message
which I want to show so let's go on
these lines itself so for username I
want to show the error message as so
just select this required field
validator and go to the property and go
to error message here and just write
your message whatever message you want
to show second was for email I will just
copy it and second validator and paste
it here and third is required password
so I will go to third field and paste my
error message here and fourth field was
the confirm password okay so I will just
copy and paste it here if field we have
added by ourselves so let's give a
message select a country name okay so
this is our message and you can align
them these fields also just select all
of them and just go to a line and
justify this time left
okay so this is the message I can also
change the font color a foreground color
of these this messages also so that it
shows in the red okay so just ctrl and
select all this these and go to for
color and select red so it will show the
message in red okay
once this is done we will connect our
requested field validator with this text
box so how will it know that it has to
show this message when this field is
empty so just select your field
validator and just go here and we will
search for control to validate so this
is the control which it will look for to
validate this message so for the first
control this is username so I will
choose textbox username second is for
email so just select this required field
option from here and go to control to
validate and choose textbox email third
was for password so text was password
both was for repeat password and fifth
was for the country name drop-down
country now in here we also need to
provide our initial value because if
user doesn't select anything then we
need to show this message also so the
initial value will is here is
select countries just open this and copy
this select country from here and just
select this option once again required
field validation and in here in the
properties search for initial value and
paste whatever you have copied from here
and paste it here ok so this is also
done now our password we cannot show it
to the outside world so we need to
protect our password so what we will do
is we will select our text box for the
password and select text mode and we say
it's a password and confirm password
also it once more select your confirm
password text box and we will select
this as password ok all this is done now
for example you need to confirm password
you need to check whether this password
and this password field matches so
whatever you have entered in this text
box you should enter in this text box so
how will you validate that and confirm
that your password in these both field
are same so there is a validator for
this also which is compare validator so
just choose this compare validator and
drag and drop in this cell where you
have confirmed password is required and
drag and drop here and in here change
the error message so you can say
both pass word must be same okay and
what you can do here is just select the
first option which is required field and
click arrow button and press Enter so it
shows on the second line okay
and just select it and change the font
of this also for color also red and here
we also provide the control to violet
validate control to validate is this
field which is textbox repeat password'
and the control to compare also we need
to provide so it will compare with this
password field so we will choose this
control to compare and choose the
textbox password okay so this also we
have done now to validate the email also
email somebody can write his name and
this will not be a regular email ID and
you also want to validate your email ID
of whatever user have entered the email
ID it should be a valid email ID it
should not be any random text so you can
also validate that also by using a
validator called
regular expression validator regular
expression is nothing but it just check
for the pattern for example it checks
for the email pattern and if user have
it matches the pattern of email then it
will say okay you have entered the right
email otherwise it will show the message
so drag and drop this regular expression
validator
in here in wherever you have email is
required requested validator and in here
we can also change the message from here
we write you must enter the valid email
id okay and we can change the for color
of this also once again really quick
okay and I will choose select it and
from my arrow keys I will just press
enter here okay
now map my messages are done now what I
need to do is I need to submit this form
so for that I will need a button so I
will drag and drop a button here which
will submit my form so I will change the
text of my button as some submit and for
example I need to reset all the fields
also so what I will do is I will go to
this HTML fee field here and I will
choose this input reset button I will
drag and drop it here and it already
have the text we said so I will not
change the text of this and now what I
will do is I will just select this
button and I will double click it so
when I submit my form it should show me
some message that if all the fields are
correct then registration is successful
so I will right
register okay so it's not to register
but response dot right and on the
successful submission of your form
whatever method you want to show just
show it here so you can SH right this
here is your registration is successful
okay
let me make it bigger so you can see it
and now I think you are ready to run the
program if some error comes then we will
see it later so just choose this start
debugging you can run your program like
this also just click this button or
second option is just right-click your
project and say mu in browser and it
will show a message you say yes and you
can see whatever forms you have here the
gist raishin aspx you can see it here
and it will open your registration got
aspx and it's showing some some error
and it says that the control to validate
property of regular expression is not
fills yes we have not given the property
for this regular expression field you
must enter the valid email ID but we
haven't linked it to this control so
what we will do is we will choose this
control to validate and qu we will
choose textbox email ID
and the second thing is what kind of
validation we want to give to our
validator so we want to check email ID
with this validator so what you need to
do is just select this regular
expression validator from here and go to
the property and search for validate
expression this validates expression
checks for the pattern of for example
the email ID there are some other
options also just go here and click this
button and we will search for the
internet email address regular
expression just select this because we
are validating internet email ID right
and click OK
now when I run the program this time I
will run it from here and say ok and
this time you can see your registration
page right and for example I write a
username programming knowledge for
example email ID let's enter a wrong
email id some text random text and then
immediately you see here you must enter
a valid email ID then we will enter a
password and we will repeat our password
once again and we will choose our
country ok and we will submit the form
and it says you haven't entered the
valid email ID let's enter a valid email
ID for example X Y that at the rate
gmail.com and let's delete this confirm
password and let's check whether it
shows the message or not yes it so shows
that confirm password is required for
example we enter some random text which
is which does not match this password
and now it so shows both passwords must
match okay for example we select no
country then it says select a country
name for example we doesn't select a
username
it shows username is required and if
everything is perfect you can submit
your form and you can see the message
here your registration is successful so
in this way you can create a
registration form using your validation
keys right so I hope you have learned
how to create a registration page and in
the later videos for the videos I will
show you how to connect this form with
the database and how to save all these
values which you enter here into the
database and then make a login page so
that you can validate the data and then
login into the site so just keep
watching these videos and please rate
