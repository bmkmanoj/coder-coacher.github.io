chart we made last time and today I am
going to show you how to change the
orientation of your Jeffry chart labels
which is and this so you can see here a
date but it is not shown hold date
because you don't have the proper space
for showing the whole date so is there
any method to change the orientation of
this level and show it in a vertical
like these bars or show it in a tangle
of 45 so can so that you can see the
whole date the answer is yes you can
change the orientation of your levels so
you could be able to see the whole date
so for that what you have to do I will
show you now so this was the code you
have made last time or in the last
tutorial you just go to this line
category plot plot is equal to null but
this time you have to write instead of
null just copy this chart variable from
JP chart chart dot get category plot so
write this
here and after this you have to write
category access which is x axis this is
the variable successful is equal to in
the bracket you have to copy this and
sorry
getting anything save and pasted here
also and
then write this plot copy this plot and
paste it here dot get domain axis that
close the semicolons so write this the
domain axis is your x-axis so whenever
it is written that this get domain
access then it will automatically take
your XSS and then now I will fix the
imports and this is showing ever because
I always do spelling mistake in category
and now what is the mistake I hope to
see
now I will fix the imports everyone's
gone
so do remember the spelling
I always forget them and now just copy
this category axis variable name and
then dot that category label position
and in the bracket right
category label
position
dot whatever angle you want to give to
it so for example I want to show it at
the angle of 45 up I will set it here
and it's showing some error was it what
is it
so set method is not applied to this
so what I have done mistake is instead
of this set category level positions
mistake I have to write this set
category level positions now my error is
gone and let's try a program now my
program is here when I click it you can
see these levels are shown at the angle
of 45
let's try some different angle
now instead of what if I want to choose
down 90 and run the program now
and I will click this and you can see
which is shown vertically so in this way
you can change the orientation of your
access access label I hope you have
learned something new today and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
