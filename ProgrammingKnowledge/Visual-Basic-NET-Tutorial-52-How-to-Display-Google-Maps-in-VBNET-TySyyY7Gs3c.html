show you how to use Google Maps with
your visual basic windows form
application so let's get started I have
this blank Visual Basic project made and
we go to the toolbox and search for the
tool called split container and I will
drag and drop inside my form but with
this split container does is this
enables us to resize our panel right
like this that's why I am using this
split container and then inside my
second panel I am going to go to my
toolbox and drag and drop a web browser
inside my second panel in here it will
search for the Google Maps and show the
options right and in here in the first
panel I am going to take four text boxes
text books 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 4 labels label 1
2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and
I will change the text of these labels
as Street City zip no trip but first the
state and when the zip state and jump so
what I am showing you is it's not
necessary that you need to search on the
basis of all four parameter you can
either enter one parameter or you can
either enter two parameter three
parameter it depends upon the user it's
not necessary that you have to enter all
the
for parameters together okay so now I
will change the text box name first text
box name is text box underscore Street
second text box name is text box
underscore city third text box name is
text box on the score state and fourth
Xbox name is steak sauce underscore zip
this should be underscore and I'm going
to take a button and I will change its
text as search such now I'm going to
just double click the button and in here
I'm going to write the code for
searching whatever I enter in my text
boxes and show it in the web browser in
Google Maps but first of all I will
import one library import system dot txt
and in here then I will declare for
variables dem Street is equal or as
string is equal to text box for Street
dot txt right in the same way I will
declare this for all the text boxes post
shread city state and names so second is
city state zip
and this should be text box on the score
City this should these text box on the
scores state and for is text box on this
corset now I will make a try-catch
blocks will just write try-catch and
inside my catch block I will write a
message so that if some exception occurs
it will show some message right so
exception will come here show unable to
retrieve data okay
and inside my text try block I will
declare a new variable called dim query
address as new string builder and once
again already use this query address and
I will write for the address dot append
and in here I am going to write the
address of Google Maps right this is the
address I am going to write just write
HTTP colon slash slash maps.google.com
slash Maps question mark Q is equal to
and then we will make some if conditions
so just try it if your text box name so
the textbox named for first stack boxes
text box dot text box from the score
Street dot text is not equal to so just
write this
string dot empty then what you are going
to do is just append this query address
your streets so just query address
append and inside this just copy the
name of your street and then just write
this plus not this one but just write
this plus and double quotes and this and
fine plus double quotes and in here just
write comma and in the second double
quotes just so I plus so what this code
will do is it will append this treat
what we have entered in the text box
treat and it will add it here so this
will be the link is equal to the street
name will come here if there is
something in your text books
otherwise it will go to the next if
condition so in the same way I will just
copy these four times so first pause
forestry second is for city just right
sitting here third is for state just so
it stayed here to eat and fourth
condition is phones if and we are also
going to change text box name second
gives false fix for city third expose
text box state and fourth is for text
box
zip and at the last once we have our
query we just need our web browsers to
just copy the name of your web browser
which is this one the browser one
and just say dot navigate and just copy
the name of your query address dot to
string so that's it this is the code now
run the code and in here for example I
want to search for the city called
Frankfurt and I'll just click the search
and you'll see the map of Frankfurt City
and for example I want to search for
some Street in Frankfort so I will write
some Street in Frankfort and search for
it I will search for this Street in
Frankfort so in this way you can search
any city or Street or straight or zip or
you can enter your other conditions like
longitude latitude or other country name
you can search using this code so I hope
you have enjoyed and enjoyed this video
