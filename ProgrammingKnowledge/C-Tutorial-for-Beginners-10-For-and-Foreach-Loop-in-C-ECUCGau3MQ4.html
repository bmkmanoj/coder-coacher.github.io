video I am going to show you how to use
for loop and for each loop in c-sharp
so as I have already taught you in the
last two videos that a loop is a piece
of code by which you can iterate or
perform some statement in a loop again
and again
so spot loop is also just for the same
purpose so let's see how we can use
first of all for loop in C++ let's see
the basic format of for loop so for loop
is declared like this you start with a
keyword call for and then you initialize
these brackets and inside these bracket
you pass three arguments first is the
initialization value and then it will be
separated by the semicolon second
argument is the condition which you want
to met and the third argument is the
increment or decrement whatever you want
to do in the loop and inside these curly
braces you perform your statement so
let's do the same in our code for
example I will declare a for loop for
and in these brackets I will just
declare my condition so I will say int a
is equal to zero semicolon a is less
than 10 semicolon and a plus plus okay
so this is my initialization I'm
initializing an integer variable with 0
this is called initialize
and the second argument is the condition
so I'm checking whether my value of a is
less than 10 and then third argument is
the increment so I am increasing the
value of a by 1 let's add these two
semicolons and in here I want to print
the value of a if it's less than 10 okay
so I will just print the value of a I
will just write console dot write line
and in the bracket I will just say value
of a is in this placeholder
I will pass the value of a okay let's
try and run this program and what this
program did is it just printed the value
of a from 0 to 9 which are 10 values
right and what happened here our code
will start from here and it will
initialize a with 0 and it will check
the condition whether is less than 0
less than 10 or not and then it will go
here and if we print value of a is equal
to 0 and once again it will increase the
value of a by 1 now value of a is 1 and
which is less than 10 it will print
value of a one increase the value of a
plus 1 it just a is equal to 2 once
again it will check the condition which
is less than 10 it will print it and
then we keep on looping until and unless
your condition is met which is a is less
than 10
as soon as a become 10 this condition
will not be true and it will our program
will go out of the loop right so in this
way you can use for loop now how to use
for each tube this is also our loot
which we can use to iterate values so
let's see how we can use for each loop
so first of all let's see what is the
basic format of all for each loop for
each loop is declared like this it has a
initial statement which is a keyword for
each and in this bracket you have this
collection and you will iterate this
collection as a value one by one so this
will this value will learn the trade
through this connection collection sorry
and then this value can be used inside
this loop to print it or to perform some
code or algorithm inside this for loop
so let's see how we can use it in our
code I will to lead this program for now
and now let's see for each for this
example I will take the collection or I
will take an array of names so I will
declare it like this I will declare a
string array with a variable name array
and I will initialize this string by
value 5 so it can hold 5 values right
and I will just initialize this array
with some names so name 0 is this name
name 1 is this and untill name 4 which
is a fifth value and I will assign this
and for example I want to print all
these values using for each loop how can
I do this so what I can do is I will
write I will use for each loop for each
and I will give this brackets and in
here I can
declare my variable which will hold each
name so I will declare this as a name
itself this can be anything this name
can be anything but in is constant we
need to use in between your folder or
place holder and your collection which
is array right this is our collection so
this array will contain the collection
of values like this okay and this
variable will access this collection one
by one so I will just declare this curly
braces and then what I will do is I will
iterate through this array but first of
all I need to give a type to this name
variable because we have this array as a
string we need to initialize this name
as a string also string okay so this
name will contain one name at a time
from this array now we want to print
this so I can say console dot write line
and inside this bracket I can say hello
plus whatever name which is this one so
what this code will do is it will
iterate through this RA one by one so
first of all let's try and run the
program and let's see what it does so
what this code does is it will iterate
the are iterate one by one from array so
it first it will say hello first name
which is Steven and then it will say
hello second name which is Clark and
like that all the name it will the trade
so what it's doing is it will go here
and we see what is the four
value in the array and pass this value
in this variable and then it will print
this value here hello Stephen and once
again it will go here and it will go to
the second value which is Clark and we
go to this port and it will print it
hello Clark
and once again it will loop on keep on
looping until and unless or last value
is printed so what is the basic
difference between for loop and for each
loop in for loop you need to define the
index right so for example we see these
two conditions here you need to define
initial value the condition which is the
end which will iterate through your
index until this condition will met and
you need to increment okay
so let's see in this code yeah I will
once again write that for loop for you
which we have just used and in here we
need to know the index right so we need
to iterate through ten values for
example
now for example you want to iterate
through this string using this for loop
how can you do it what you can do is you
can use this array so just take this
variable array and you can just print
this array like this in the square
brackets to just pass this a which is a
integer which is starting from 0 and
until and less then comes through keep
on increasing so it will go through are
a 0 or a 1 or a 2 or a 3 or a 4 but as
soon as it goes to
arrey 5 which is not declared of which
is not the size of this array which is
greater than the size of this array it
will give you an exception so now for
example I will run the program and as
soon as I print this it must give the
exception like this you see here it's
showing some troubleshooting tips make
sure that the maximum index of the list
is less than the size right so whenever
you you are using for loop you need to
think about the index of the collection
you are using if you are using this
string array which have the index of 5
you cannot go and loop through the this
array and give 10 as an index right if
you use here 5 it will work fine run the
program and you see it's working and we
are waiting waiting and no exception
occurs right so whenever you use this
for loop you need to know the index
correctly and whenever you use this for
each loop you don't need to know the
index of this array you can just iterate
through the collection or this array one
by one until the until and unless the
end of the array reaches so for example
I will increase this array by one okay
and this can be some more name and I
will change the index by 1 5 6 and this
will be 5 so here you don't need to
change anything in this for loop even if
you increase the index or decrease the
index but here you need to change
this value of loot which is the maximum
value your loot will expect or your loop
will iterate so like this and I will run
the program and will work fine okay so
just whenever you want to iterate
through a collection or an array or an
hash values you need for each loop okay
and whenever you need to use index and
you know the index and you want to
iterate on the basis of your index you
use for loop so I hope you understood
this basic concept of for and for each
loop and I hope you have enjoyed this
