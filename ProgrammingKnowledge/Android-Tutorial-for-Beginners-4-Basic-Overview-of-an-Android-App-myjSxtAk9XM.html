tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
the basic overview of an Android app so
in the last few video we have
successfully created our first Android
application and we would be able to run
or we were able to run our first Android
app on an Android emulator now for the
first time when you see an Android app
project it'll look like this but what is
what in this in this project for example
this screen you see here is called an
activity and the formal definition of an
activity is an activity is a single
focused thing that the user can do or in
its simple terms you can say an activity
is a screen which user interact with and
an Android app can contain many
activities in itself now where are these
activity stored so when you go to your
project overview here you can see three
categories one is the project itself is
the broad project overview and this is
what are the files and folders your
project can contain right so it can
contain the IDE files your app files
Gradle files and other files which your
Android studio needs to compile them the
second overview when you go to the
project overview is the package and
these are the packages your app is using
when you created your app but the most
important while developing your app
Android app is the Android category
itself and this is where all you are you
know programming Bill files are there
and this
sign of this activities are now this
activity is just over you but behind
this there is an XML file so when you go
to your app and inside this app there is
a folder called re S or res folder and
inside this restful der there are some
folders like drawable which contains
some PNG files and your main activity or
activity file is this one which is
activity underscore main dot XML file
other files are menu files which we will
see later and the next category is
values category that also we will see
later but right now the main important
design XML file is this one so for the
XML file behind this screen is this main
activity file or main activity XML file
so you can click or you can open this
XML file by clicking this text category
here so this is your design category of
your activity and when you click here in
the text it will open an XML file and
this XML file is the main you know XML
file which is responsible for the design
of your Android write Android activity
so what we can do is we can go to design
and we can delete this for now for
example this one so you just select this
and delete this and then what you can do
is you can drag and drop these palette
widgets in your activity so there are so
many
widgets in here layouts text fields and
other desirable tools so you can drag
and drop these tools and design your
activity for example I can just drag and
drop from this vigeous the large text
here and in here just double click it
and you can just write anything here for
example programming knowledge ok and
then this will be displayed here and and
this Android studio assist you to you
know align your widgets or tools in your
activity so you will be able to see this
message here right now once I have done
that there is a text view added to my
XML file and you see I have written this
text on my text view which is
programming knowledge and this is
automatically added to your XML file
also right I can add it my XML file and
it can be added to this view also for
example programming knowledge YouTube
and it will be added to your activity
here so you can add this from here also
text and from here also you can add more
properties to your text view for example
you can go to the design and you can
change the these properties from here
also so there are so many properties for
example I want to change the background
color of my this text view so I can just
select this and then go to the
properties and search for the property
called background it's responsible for
the background color of your property
and go to the color and here I can
choose any color for my text view for
example green
I will click a choose my color and here
is the result of the color so this is f
f3 triple f 1c so when I click OK the
color will change and when I go to the
text area it is the same background
color which is F F 3 F F F 1 C which was
a color we chose we have chosen right
the other thing is you can even change
the color of your background color or
properties of your main activity screen
which is this one or layout you can just
go to the background and just choose the
color and choose any other color for
example this blue color okay and changes
to the blue color okay now this is just
the design part of your Android app but
the mean brain or you can say main you
know actions are taken in the folder
called Java and in here there is a Java
class or Java file called main activity
just open this and this is the class
which is responsible for all the main
actions of your app so for example you
go to your main activity and you add
some button here and you click this
button all the code for clicking this
button and whatever action will take
while clicking this button will be
written here so this is just a Java
class which extends or inherits the
action bar activity class so this is our
class which Android studio have created
for us and it extends so if you don't
have much experience in Java programming
I will recommend you can see my Java
programming tutorial and you will be
able to understand what this extend
means but simply this
is inheriting four from this class and
in here there are some already
pre-created method which Android studio
have created for us for the first time
so that our app can launch okay and this
these codes we will see in the further
videos what is the meaning of all these
code behind so that we will understand
more about what they are doing okay but
this is the main you know mean logic of
your Android app where you will write
the logic of your Android app okay so
these this is the basic overview of an
Android app or there is one more
interesting folder in this app called
manifest ok so this is the folder called
manifest and this contains the file
called Android manifest dot XML and this
contains all the activity of activities
of your Android app so for example our
Android app right now contains only one
activity which is this one and so this
activity is you know here but your
Android app can contain more than one
activity then there can be something
like one activity below this second
activity below this third activity and
so on right so here is the main launcher
you can say of your app so for the first
time whenever you launch your
application how will your Android app
the knows that which activity should
appear with your Android app can contain
many activities and which activity to
launch first this is decided by this XML
file for example
this activity this app only have one
activity and this is the basic logic
which tells your app that this is our
main activity and we need to launch this
activity whenever we launch our app so
all the activity mapping will be here in
this folder and other other properties
of your app will be here also for
example your packages packages
information or other informations
related to your you know app will be
here so your app name and styles and
other things right so here all the
activity you know listing will be here
so this is the basic overview of your
Android app I hope you have enjoyed this
