tutorial on Python programming for
beginners in the last video I have given
you introduction to Python and I have
shown you how you can install Python on
your Windows operating system and I have
given you a little example how you can
use this pipe ide called idle for the
first time okay so in this video I am
going to continue and I'm going to show
you how you can use numbers and a mat in
Python so if you are familiar with this
last time I have shown you how to open
this - shell right if you don't know how
to open this shell once again I'm going
to tell you we just need to go to your
Start menu and just go to Python folder
and just start this ideal Python GUI
from here and it will open this kind of
gooey shell or pythons shally here now
let's get started and let's see how we
can do math in Python so like a simple
mathematics of Python can also do the
maths for you so for example you want to
add 5 plus 98 will give you the answer 1
0 3 euro you can even add minus values
so minus 4 34 + 4 for example and give
you an answer
30 okay in the same way you can do the
subtraction cookies 56 minus 44 it will
give you the answer and it will also
give you the negative value if you
provide them button value such as for
example 44 minus 56 will give you the
negative value okay now for division
what you can do you can just write the
following
21 / so this is the symbol we use for
divisions which is slash for example 27
21 divided by 7 is 3 which gives you the
answer and if you want to divide the
number and get some decimal values for
example 23 divided by 7 will give you 3
point 2 8 something right so this will
also give you a decimal values now for
example you don't want this these
decimal values after the division you
just want to see the full value or the
integer what you can do we can just
write 23 double slash 7 and this will
give you the whole number which is 3
okay you can even so this this number is
a integer and what is an integer integer
is the whole number right you can even
use decimal values which are called
float in programming float values are
values which have some decimal points
for example 57 point 2 3 4 5 or whatever
divided by 3 point 2 2 2 2 2 ok and
press ENTER and will give you an answer
so you can even divide decimal values
like this okay and remember this
whenever you want to get the whole
number just use double slashes now for
multiplication multiplication is also
simple for example you want to multiply
two number 56
multiply so for multiplication you use
this asterisk symbol or star symbol
simply so this star symbol or a stick
symbol will be used as a multiplication
symbol okay
so 56 x 4 s 2 2 4 so you can use
multiplication like this ok now for
example and you want to get the F
exponent of some
what in what is an exponent exponent is
something like for example 2 exponent 3
is 2 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 2
okay so 2 into 2 into 2 this is the
exponent so you can do it like this and
will give you the answer
but if you want the exponent for example
2 to the power 15 how we can do you can
do something like this two multiplied by
two multiplied this but to multiply it
by 2 multiplied by do 15 times and this
will be lengthy right so the simple way
to find the exponent is use double
asterisks or double stars and then the
power so 2 to the power 15 is 3 2 7 6 8
okay or 2 to the power 5 is 32 so this
double star or double s takes which you
can use to get the power or exponent of
your numbers okay now you may be
wondering what may be the order of your
operations which operation will take
place when you have multiple multiple
operation at the same time for example I
want to do 3 x 4 plus 5 minus 6 and then
divided by 1 or not 1 but 2 for example
so what will be the order when 3 into 4
will happen first or 4 plus 5 will
happen for a plug of 4 plus 5 it will
happen first or 5 minus 6 will happen
first or what is what will be the
priority okay or what will be the order
of this operation
so like simple mathematic
if you remember when you are in this
school and or if you are in school still
you know this basic formula called PE M
da s ok so this is the order in which
your operations will take place and this
P stands for parentheses he stands for
exponents M stands for multiplication d
stands for division is stands for
addition and s stands for subtraction ok
and the way you remember this is you can
just abbreviate it as please excuse my
dear Aunt Sally if you want to remember
this order ok and so this will be the
priority or this will be the order of
your operation so if you want to
prioritize something and close the those
operation in the parentheses so if you
want to be 3 plus 4 and then
multiplication or you want to multiply
by 5 then the priority of this addition
is the most important or this will
happen first because this operation is
enclosed in parentheses and then this
will happen ok and then the the order
will be like PE MDAs
if you can remember so for example I
want to do something like this divided
by 6 minus 2 then the parentheses
priority will be the first and then the
multiplication and then the division and
if you have some subtraction then this
will happen and the last ok
so in this way you can use numbers and
math in your Python programs I hope you
