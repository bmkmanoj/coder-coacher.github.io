show you how to use for each loop in
your PHP code okay
so there is one more kind of a loop
called for each loop which is also used
for iterating values in your PHP code so
for example I have shown you in the
previous video how to declare an array
right for example I have an array of
these names and what this array contains
three names for example I can add one
more name for example and one more name
this has 5 name right ok so this name
array has 5 name in it and I want to
print all the names one by one without
using the key of these elements how can
I do it I can use for each loop and how
you can declare for each loop for each
and then the condition and then these
curly braces you can declare it like
this and here you can give the name of
the array or whatever value you want to
iterate and then give a keyword as and
then declare your own variable which
will contain these named one by one so I
will say this is a name instead of names
this is names which lasts from which it
has the ending with s and this is a name
you can name it anything but logically I
named it as name and this variable will
contain this name one by one okay so
basically what we are saying here in in
using you polish loop that give me from
this array every element one by one and
pass it here one by one so that we can
use it for example I want to print this
I can just write echo and then then I
can just use my name variable here and I
can concatenate this with a break so
that it will be easier see Br okay I
save it and when I run this I see an
error let's see why
okay I haven't provided this semicolon
here okay just provide the semicolon
here and run the program once again and
it gives me all the names one by one
whatever names are there in the list so
this for each loop we use it to iterate
the values or elements in the array one
by one okay and this element will be
contained in this variable which you
declare after as okay so this is single
dimensional array and you can iterate it
easily but what if it's a
multi-dimensional array and if it's a
multi-dimensional array in the I think
in the previous video I have shown you
how to use multiple dimensional array so
for example we have this
multi-dimensional array from our
previous videos so I will delete all
this code from here and if you remember
we have declared this multi-dimensional
array in the video where we have seen
how to use this multi-dimensional array
right now if you want to iterate these
value how you can do it because this is
in array inside an array and then the
values of RA in associative array right
so you can
do it something like this you can just
write for each and give loops something
like this and inside this I am just
first of all named IRA made by basically
is this as my variable name whatever I
want to iterate the elements of the
array so I can say a student this is too
dense right and this will be this will
contain student right and so what are
there in the student we have three
different values inside our student area
this is the student this is the RA and
we have three different value one two
and three right and the key of this
value is zero key of this value is one
and key of this value is two so whenever
we whenever we echo this echo and
whenever we echo student dot break BR
and when we save it and run it it will
give us the key of this once again I
think I forgot this one save it and to
give the key hopefully no so it's giving
us error because we need to indicate
somehow that it has some array inside
it's you can see the error that the
value you are trying to show is an array
so it will not print this because you
print string values using this echo
right so you need to write here equal to
like this and then you can say this is
mine
so this student contain a ra which has
three element and then inside this we
have another array which is this student
and then we want to iterate the value of
this right so we can say this is a in
array or whatever you want to say it and
then whenever you want you print this
then leads let's see what happens - I
want to save this for example Oh case
one now we use this here and save it and
gives me index 0 1 2 right so this is
giving me the key of this array this has
3 3 values which has the key 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 now
I want to trade the value here these are
all values how I can do it now I have
all the values in here for our a1 or a2
and our a3 so what I can do is I can use
for each loop inside for each loop
second for each loop here to iterate the
values of inner arrays okay so I just
equate like this but this time I want to
use this inner array as my primary array
as for example items or item item is a
more logical thing and I will make this
bold so I will just make this bold so
that we will be able to see this B and
here we will end our be like this okay
so let's see what happens I just save it
and I run this
and I need to give her concatenation
operator and now you can see our zeroth
key contains these values mark has a
name weight of 15 and age 15 and a made
46 then John way age 13 and weight 65
Tom age 14 and wait this one so in this
way you can iterate the
multi-dimensional array using for each
cube but you need to use a two for each
loop one to iterate this array outer
array which contains three keys and
another to iterate the values of second
array okay so in this way you can use
for each loop in PHP I hope you have
