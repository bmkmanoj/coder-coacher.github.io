how to add a splash screen with your
Visual Basic windows form application so
what is a splash screen it's a first
window which appears which tells you
about the software version copyright or
something about logo and I will show you
and then you will come to know how what
is a splash screen if you don't know
already so let's get started I have a
sample project which is a blank project
created in Visual Basic and for example
I add some combo box and other buttons
and check box and other things and this
is the functionality of my form now I
want to add a splash screen to this
project so what I need to do is I need
to go to the project in solution
Explorer so go to solution Explorer and
then select your project and right click
it and go to add and click add new items
and in here we need to search for splash
screen here it is so this is a splash
screen just select the splash screen and
add it to your project once you click
Add button the splash screen will be
added to your project and in here you
can change the background image or you
can change the title for example I will
change the title here and I will name it
as my cool project for example and now
when I run the program
you will see first of all splash screen
should appear so how to add this press
splash screen to your project once again
just go to your project and right click
it and go to the properties and in here
in the properties you will find a
property called the splash screen which
by default is none you need to select
splash screen one which is a splash
screen which we have created and just
you just need to do that right and now
when you run the program a splash screen
will appear first which tells the
project name and all and now your
project will come in front right so in
this way you can change these tags and
these the background image for example I
want to change the background image of
my splash screen I can just select my
splash screen and go to background image
and I can select any image from the
local resource I will select import and
I will I can select any image from my
local resource so I selected our image
and I click OK
and you see the image is changed here or
for example I want to change the font
color or for color of this label so I
will make it white so we can see it and
I will just make it white this also ok
and now when I run the program my
customized splash screen appears and
then my project appears
so this is the simple way you can create
a splash screen with your Visual Basic
project there are advanced splash screen
which I will show you in the later
videos but for now this is the basic
format of splash screen which you can
add to your Visual Basic I hope you have
