video I will show you how to show a PDF
file in your forum or inside your form
the suppose you have some application
and you need to show a PDF file inside
your form so how can you do it it's not
very complicated to add a PDF file so
just follow the steps which I am showing
you just go to the tool box and right
click anywhere in the tool box and just
select this choose item option from here
ok and in here you will see some of the
component tabs you need to go to the com
component tab and in here you will find
a option called adobe PDF reader by
default it's not checked so just check
this and press ok so once again if this
addo PDF reader check box is not checked
then just checked it and press ok once
you have done that you will be able to
find this Adobe PDF Reader tool inside
your toolbox so search for this Adobe
PDF reader it looks like this inside
your tool box and drag and drop on your
form ok so this is your Adobe PDF Reader
tool and you can anchor it to all the
site for example and
suppose I want to open a PDF file inside
this PDF reader so let me demonstrate
with example so I will take a button and
I will change its text as open PDF file
open PDF okay and I will take a open
file dialog so this open file dialog
examples I have been showing you in the
last two videos so if you don't know how
to use this open file dialog just watch
the last two videos so I will drag and
drop into this project and it will go
here and now I will double click this
button here and in here I will just
paste the code for opening the file
dialog so it's in the button click event
I will just copy and paste this three
lines of code because these three lines
of code I have been showing you in the
last two videos so I hope you know what
these lines means or otherwise just copy
these three lines of code in your button
click event what these three lines of
code does is doing is they are opening
the open file dialog and you should be
able to choose a PDF file because we
have set the filter to the PDF file and
we will be able to show it in the PD PDF
reader by the code which we write inside
this if condition right so just select
this PDF Reader tool once again and just
check for the name the name of the tool
right now is ax echo PDF one so I will
just copy this name from here and I will
say this name from PDF Reader dot s r/c
is equal to open file dialog 1 which is
the name of my file dialog dot file name
ok so what this will do is it will open
a file dialog and whatever file you
choose it will copy the name of the file
and set this path of the file as the
source of the PDF reader so let's see
how it works I am running the program
and because of the filter I uh for
example I press this button open PDF it
will open up Open File dialog first so
it has opened this Open File dialog in
which I can choose my files for my PDF
files so I will go to somewhere where I
have some PDF file ok so here it is
so you will be able to see some PDF file
because you have set the filter to the
PDF just select this PDF and press open
and it will load the PDF file inside
your form and you can resize your form
and accordingly your PDF reader will
adjust itself so it's that much easy to
open a PDF file inside your Visual Basic
windows form application I hope you have
enjoyed this video and learned something

videos and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
