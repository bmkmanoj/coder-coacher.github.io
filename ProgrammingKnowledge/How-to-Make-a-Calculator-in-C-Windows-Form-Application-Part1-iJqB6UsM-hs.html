show you how to create a simple
calculator
using your c-sharp windows form
application so I am going to show you
how to make this kind of a calculator
which can perform your basic operation
of division multiplication subtraction
and addition and in addition we will
have these two buttons called clear
entry and clear button and I will also
show you how to add two decimal number
for example you want to add three point
three plus twelve point five you could
do that using this calculator and it
will shows this pending result here in a
little so and I want to do some
operation you see it shows me this
pending a value in this label here this
also I am going to show you and
basically I want to make this calculator
like a window calculator but obviously
this windows calculator is much advanced
than this calculator but I am going to
show you how to create this simple kind
of calculator which can perform these
operations okay so let's get started
how we can create it and we are going to
create it something like this so I will
open my blank project I am going to
create a new project so I will click
click new project this will be a windows
form application project and i will name
it as calculator okay click OK
and we create a project for you
and we have this project I will make it
little bit bigger and the first thing I
want to do is I want to open this form
at the center so for example whenever I
open this windows calculator let's see
calculator it opens at the center of
your window right and the second thing
you notice here is you cannot maximize
your calculator right you cannot resize
it so these two things I'm going to show
you first and the third thing is how to
add our icon to your calculator so let's
see how we can do it first of all the
disabling of this maximize button to
select your form here and search for the
property called maximize box and by
default it's true you need to make it
false so just make it false and then in
order to make or open your project or
this form in the center go to the
property called start position and by
default it's window default and make
this property as center screen okay so
this will open your window or form in
the center now let's try and run the
program once again and let's see if it's
opening in the center yes it's opening
and in the center and this is disabled
right this maximize button but even then
you can resize it like this right so how
to disable this resizing also I will
search for the property called forum
bordering style so search for the
property called forum broad ring style
for the first of all select this and
search for the property called forum
bordering style and by default it's
sizable you need to make it fixed
dialogue okay so make it fixed dialogue
once again run your program and now I
cannot resize my form okay so these
three things we have achieved now the
icon for this form and the name also
okay so the windows calculator has the
name calculator and this icon okay so we
will we are going to do that select your
form and go to the property called text
and by default its form 1 make it
calculator calculator so you can see
calculator here and the icon ok so you
can choose this icon from if you have
some icon for your calculator and I will
show you how to easily get an icon you
can find this icon online very easily I
found I have or I generally go to one
site called I can archive and this has
so many items or items and many other
things and I will search for the
calculator and I will find these kind of
icons of the calculator so select one
icon which you find good I found this I
can go to I will and I just downloaded
this icon image just click this icon and
it will be downloaded I think you see so
I have already downloaded this icon and
what I'm going to do is select my form
I'm going to select my form and go to
the property called icon and in here I
can browse for that icon and select that
icon and open it and that will add this
icon here ok so now I have all these
basic settings now I want to add these
buttons right so go to your toolbox and
drag and drop a button in here and the
button
first of all I will change the button
name as one and I will change the size
of the button for example 45 by 45 you
can make it other settings also and I'm
going to change the font size of this
button also to for example fold 40 okay
so it will be look good
now basically all these buttons are same
in size just we need to change the text
of these buttons and one more important
thing is the name of this button I'm
leaving this these names as default but
if you want to you know make your
project perfect you need to change this
name to logical names for the because I
have time constraint and that's why I'm
not changing this but please change
these button names according to the
logical name for example for this one
button one you can just name it as but
than one or button one something like
this okay so change it like this and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy this button just copy it and paste
it okay and once more paste it and we
need a row of five buttons like this and
I will copy these this row of five
buttons and once again base this and I
will just settle it here once again
paste it settle just below that and
paste it and settle it just below that
I'll resize this form a little and okay
now I'll just change the text of these
buttons so this starts from here so as
you can see here this zero button is
little bit bigger and this this button
is little bit bigger right equal to
button so it will change
like that this will be like this
and this will be like this and now I am
going to change the text this is our
button 0 0 this will be 1 this will be 2
this will be 3 4 5 6 7 8 &amp;amp; 9 right
and this should be point so I will add a
little point here and let's start from
here this these are the operators we are
going to use for example a plus minus
multiplication and division
so first is plus second is minus third
is multiplication which is represented
by this
Astrix and both is division which is
this one this is our equal to sign
change it to equal to like this this is
our Clear button so I mean just give
this text C and this is our clear entry
so C and E okay I will just resize it so
that we can see the C okay so now we
have all the buttons and now we need our
textbox so I'm going to go to my toolbox
and take a textbox to show the result
and entries right so I will take a text
box here and you
besides this text box and I'm going to
take a label so take a label drag and
drop in for now I'm not changing the
text in the label but yeah you can
change it just select both of these
labels and text and go to font and we
are going to change this font also as
bold 14 okay so we can see the text you
can change the label background also
just select your label and go to the
property called background here so
background by default it's something
like grey I am going to make it white so
that it can resemble with our text box
color and the name of this text box I
will name change the name as text box on
this store result okay
so I have these things now now what I
need to do here is I need to have the
button entry so for example I press some
button it should the print that entry to
the text box right so basically you can
do it like this you can select a button
and go to this property box and click
this event button here event and the
basic button event is button click event
so you can go to this button click event
or directly double click this button so
I'm going to use this option but you can
double click this button also and I'm
going to define this button click event
as for example button underscore
click and just classic this or just
enter press enter and you will reach to
this button click event of this button
right and here you can write or you can
print the text on the textbox for
example you want to print the text on
this textbox take the name of this text
box which is text box result dot text is
equal to whatever is just next to us
plus is a concatenation operator so you
can do like this because we are adding
one and if you see here by default this
text box has 0 so I'm going to change
this just select your text box and go to
text and we write 0 here so it shows 0
but this 0 is on the left hand side and
this text box is on the right hand side
so just select this and go to the
property called text align by default
its left just make it right so this 0
will go to the right okay now when I run
the program and when I click 1 you see 1
is printed here but the same
functionality I want to do it for all
the numbers and including this point so
what I can do is I have 2 options so I
can just just double click all the
buttons and I perform this functionality
to each button and the section second
option is I can perform same same
operation or same a button click event
for all these numbers and basically
capture the text of these button
whenever I press any button so how can I
do this
I will go to just this button click
event I will select this button 1 and
go to this click event by clicking going
to this events and click event and copy
this method which I have provided which
is button click just copy this method or
this event whatever you want to say it
and just go to all the numbers work I
will start from 0 just select this cero
text box and go to the event click in
this property and paste your same event
button click here ok same I will do it
for this point same I will do it for 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 &amp;amp; 9
ok and once again go to the code and now
this button click event will be
performed when any of the number button
is clicked but how to catch that event
or how to take the text from the button
click and transfer it to this textbox
it's really simple
this object contains the sender of this
button click just take this sender so
just go to button click event and here
right button and we name our object s
button is equal to and we will cast this
object to the budget button so just
write sender and this will we will toss
it toss it to button oh okay and now
once we have this button we can just
change this static test text to the
button text okay now when we run the
program and when we click anything 1 2 3
4
any number of point it will be printed
like this one more thing you can do here
is whenever I click any button here the
zero goes and this number comes right or
by default it's zero but whenever I
click any number it goes zero goes and
six comes but in our condition when I
click this three zero is there and it
does move right so it doesn't make any
difference but I want to I mean achieve
the same functionality so what I can say
is here if my text box text which is
text box for result text is equal to
this is is equal to zero then I want to
clear the text box okay dot clear okay
so this will clear my this zero whenever
I click some number now I want to
achieve the same operation or I want to
achieve the plus minus and this
multiplication and division for the
operation to perform so what I can do is
like I have done for the number of
buttons I can I can make a single method
for all these operations so what I can
do is I can select my first last
operator go to this click event of this
operator and I will say operator click
event on the scope click and just double
click it or press Enter
and be reached to the operate a click
event same operator click event we make
four - multiplication and division just
copy this operator go to the - button
paste there go to the multiplication
button and paste there in the click
event and once again go to the division
button and base there okay so whenever I
press any button for this plus minus or
multiplication division this will or we
also are going to catch the button
action and we will just take this like
this here and we want to store this
button operation in some variables so we
could at the top of our class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
