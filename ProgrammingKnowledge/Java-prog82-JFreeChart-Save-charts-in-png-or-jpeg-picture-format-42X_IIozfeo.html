video number 62 to 69 we have learnt
about J free chart so we could be able
to make this kind of pie chart or this
kind of bar chart as you know or this
kind of line chart also so now I will
show you how to save this chart in the
form of PNG file so you could use
wherever you can or you want to so let's
get started for example we have we want
to convert the our pie chart into the
form of PNG or picture so just right
click event action an action performed
go into the action perform a third of
your PNG button this code we have
written in our pie chart video so in
case you don't know this code you can
see that and after this what you have to
do is first write try-catch block
so yeah try catch
so first of all do this yeah
exceptionally and you can give here the
exception you know that so I'm not going
to show that to you and then try and
block you should right by me Sean
rendering info you can name it whatever
you want to I will name it info is equal
to mu and just copy this chart rendering
for once again and paste it here and and
the code that's an call after that oh I
forgot something in here in this bracket
should add something more new standard
entity collection so just add into chart
trending info brackets this also and
after that
you must try it
by no
Pyle give your variable some new name it
as fine
one is equal to new file and racket and
bracket close and in here sorry I have
spelled file and in here you have to
give some name whatever you want to give
the name of your PNG picture so I will
name it as chart dot PNG so I want to
save my chart by the name chart dot PNG
so I will name that and then I will run
right chart
short utilities dot save so these are
the option I am choosing safe chart as
PNG here the option to save your chart
in the form of jpg is also there so if
you want to save in the form of jpg you
just choose save chart as jpg but I am
saving my chart as PNG so I'll click
Save chart as PNG and in here I will
copy this file 1 and paste it here and
this is the chart which is the variable
name of Jeffrey chart variable so this
will automatically come here and in here
you can define the width and height of
your PNG table so I will define the bit
as 600 by 400 and
, you just copy this chart trending info
variable and paste it here so this is
sorry
this is your code to convert your JPD
chart into the PNG or jpg format and
save it into your parent project folder
so wherever your parent Pro project will
be so my project name is project 1 2 4
so my file will be saved in that folder
automatically so let's try and run the
program
and here is my chart so I will click it
and my chart comes here so when I click
this pie chart button automatically my
chart dot PNG will be saved into the
folder where my project files are so
this is my project folder in which my
source files and build files are saved
and in here you can see this chart dot
PNG is automatically created I will
click here and I can see that this chart
is converted into the form of PNG and
saved him so you can save it into the
jpg format also and this code is
applicable on most of the charts bar
charts or whatever charts you have so I
hope you have learned something new
today and please rate comment and
