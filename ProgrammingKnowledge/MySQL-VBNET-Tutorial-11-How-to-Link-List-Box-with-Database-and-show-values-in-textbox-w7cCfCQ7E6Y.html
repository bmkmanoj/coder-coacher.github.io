last two videos I have been showing you
how to load or populate a combo box with
your MySQL database using your visual
basic windows form application like this
and when you select any item in the
combo box the corresponding values from
the database may appear or should come
in to these text boxes so I in the last
two videos I have been showing you this
and in this video I will show you how to
do exactly the same things with the
drift box so let's get started it's not
much if you have already seen last two
videos for combo box just go to the text
box or toolbox and take a list box from
here and what I am going to do is I will
go to the form load event so if you have
seen the video number 9 and that I have
shown you how to populate your combo box
with the database values so in that I
have shown you how to write a code in
this form load event so just select your
form and just double click it and in the
form load event I have shown you how to
populate or combo box with the database
values which is this one so in here I
have shown you all the code to load a
combo box so you don't need to change
much in the DES code in order to load
the values in the list box what you need
to do is just go to this while loop and
in here I have written the code in the
video number nine combo box dot items
dot add so just below this line just
right the name of your list box which is
list box 1 dot items should list box
also contains items and it also has the
function called add so what I have done
basically is just replace the or just
added this list box instead of combo box
and all will remain same what this line
will do is it will populate the list box
with name values and if you don't know
how I have written all this code for
loading the combo box with the database
value just go to the video number 9 and
you will understand how I have done it
ok and now when I run the program I will
give the user name and password and you
see here all the values from the
database is the same as we have seen in
the combo box also and it's populated in
the list box also right so this is how
to populate a list box in the same
manner as your combo box now next is to
show the values in the text boxes
corresponding to these names which are
fetched from the database right so for
that you also don't need to do much you
just go to the code where I have written
the code to populate these text boxes
corresponding to the value selected in
the combo box and this I have shown you
in the last video so if you don't know
this code just see the last video
in which I have shown you how to show
corresponding values in the textbox
which is selected in the combo box just
copy all the code from here and just
select your list box and double click it
and paste it here okay and in this code
I am just going to change one line of
code which is I'm going to just change
the query of this of this MySQL query
string right so what you need to change
in this query is just replace the name
of the combo box with a list box list
box 1 dot txt and all the code will
remain same and if you don't know how
have I have written this code just watch
the last video right and just change in
this query string select star from
database dot the table name where name
is equal to instead of combo box just
replace the combo box with the list box
and this will work fine let's check
whether this code is working or not once
again
and username and password and when I
select some name in the list box the
corresponding values to the name in the
database will appear here so this is
also working it's just like combo box
but this list box is to show all the
values or list all the values and combo
box is just to select region right so in
this way you can populate your list box
and show the corresponding values
selected in the list box to the text
boxes I hope you have enjoyed this video
