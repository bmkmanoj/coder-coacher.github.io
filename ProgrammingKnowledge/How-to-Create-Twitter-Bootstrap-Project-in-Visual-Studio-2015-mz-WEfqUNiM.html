show you how you can create a Twitter
bootstrap project in your Visual Studio
IDE so let's get started
first of all open visual studio ID and
go to file here and create a new website
project and we want to create a asp.net
empty website we don't want any as
asp.net related templates or any other
thing so we want to create empty website
so choose empty website and if you want
to change the name of your project you
can change it from here but I will leave
it as default and click OK and this will
create a empty website project for us
now once your project is created we want
to add bootstrap files to it so to add
them what we need to do is go to this
option called tools here at the top and
in here go on
nugget package manager and inside the
nugget package manager choose this
option called manage nugget packages for
solution so choose this option and then
you will be able to see this kind of
interface right now you can search for
bootstrap in here if you don't see on
the left hand side I can see this
bootstrap option here directly but if
you don't see it
search for boot strap and it will search
for it and most probably it will show
you the result right but I can directly
see this bootstrap option here so I
don't need to search for it and just
select this option bootstrap from here
and then click install on the right hand
side you will see this option called
install so click install and click OK
and it will add all the bootstrap
related file to
project in here right and once you see
finish here then all the booster press
related files are installed in your
project so you can close this tab from
here now we can see inside the script
folder we have bootstrap dot JS file
bootstrap Minn dot J's and in here we
have jQuery dot J's files right and in
the content folder we have bootstrap dot
CSS files and other CSS files and in the
fold fonts we have other glyphicon
related files right so all the bootstrap
related files are included in our
project now we want to add the HTML file
so right click on your project and click
add add new item and in here we want to
select HTML page and change the name of
your HTML file if you want for example
default and click add okay
so this will add this default dot HTML
file to your project and by default it
gives us this simple HTML script right
now to add the JavaScript files to our
body of our HTML file you can simply
drag these bootstrap MnDOT J's and other
J's files to your HTML so go to this
bootstrap dot MnDOT GS select this and
open default dot HTML from here and just
drag and drop this bush shrub dot min
dot J's to the body of your HTML file
and it will be added as a script right
same you can do for this jQuery 1.9
point one so just select this jQuery 1.9
point one dot min dot GS and drag and
drop to the body and it will add it as a
script now to add the
CSS file to the head just open this
content folder in your project and you
will see inside this bootstrap dot CSS
this CSS file called bootstrap dot min
dot CSS so select this and open your
HTML file and drag and drop inside the
head of your HTML file and it will be
added so we have added all the required
CSS and JavaScript file to our HTML file
so now we are ready to go so for example
I want to add a h1 tag I will add it
like this and for example I want to
print hello world okay and in order to
run it in your favorite browser you just
need to save it and click this green
button here so when you click this green
button it will open your web page in
your default browser in my case it's
Firefox but it will be your default
browser so just click this and it will
open this web page in your default
browser which is Firefox in my case so
now you are ready to develop your
bootstrap project in Visual Studio I
