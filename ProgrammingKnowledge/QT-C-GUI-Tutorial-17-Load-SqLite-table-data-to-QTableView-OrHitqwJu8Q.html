last three videos I have shown you how
to save your data edit your data and
delete your data in your SQLite database
using your c++ QT GUI application now in
this video I will show you how to load
your data in a table which will be here
in your window from your database so if
for example you want to show the data in
your QT window then how can you do it
you have the table in your database and
you just want to show all the data at
one go in a table in your QT GUI
application so let's try and build the
code to show that table in which we will
load our database data so for that I'm
going to go in this tool box here and I
will go item views and I will go to the
model based item muse and I will take a
table view here so there is one more
thing here which is table widget we
don't want this we want just want to use
this table view which is our model base
term mu or item and for that we will
create a model and then just set the
model in this table review and I just
want to take a push button also so that
I can press this push button and load
the table and I will just rename this
push button load table and I will just
change the text also
load table okay so everything is done
now I will right click my button and
we'll go to slots and select click then
press ok and in here I will write my
code so first thing I just want to write
is I will want to make a login object
from my login class so I will write
login and I will give the object name
corn so those of you who are unaware of
this why I'm creating this login object
you can find the answer in my last
videos and in the video number 13 I
think in my QT C++ GUI application here
in the video number 13 I have shown you
how to create connection open and close
function in your database and this these
function I have made in the login class
which I have created earlier that's why
I'm creating the object to access my
connection open and connection closed
class with the SQLite database okay once
you have done that I will make a Q s ql
query model and pointer i will name my
model S model itself is equal to nu Q
SQL query model and close it now I will
open the connection from the database
first so I will just copy this login
object corn object and paste it here dot
corne open this is the function which
opens the connection with the SQLite
database okay and then I will prepare a
query so I will write Q SQL query and I
will name my query as qry query is equal
to nu q SQL ready bracket and bracket
float and Indy's bracket I will pass my
database as an argument
so I will write copy this one object
from my login class dot my DB so this my
DB object is a Q SQL database object
which I have in my login class so let me
show you once again I will go to my
login dot H file and in here I have Q
SQL database object which I have created
in my login class okay so this is that
and now once query is made let me make a
query pointer I will now prepare a query
so I will right ready prepare and inside
this query argument I will write the
query so I will write select star from
the table name so I have this database
and I have this table called employee
info so I will copy the name of my table
and paste it here okay my query is
prepared now I just want to execute it
so I would write ready
exact so my query is executed now I want
to transfer the data which I have got
from the query to the model so what I
will write my model object so I will
copy my model from here and I will write
that query and inside this query
argument I will pass my query object
from here and because it is a pointer I
will pass like this and once the query
is set to the model now we will set this
model to the tree view so i will write
UI arrow pointer the table view last
time I think I said tree view it's not
trivial but the table view and now set
it set model and I will pass my model to
the table view okay once this is done
now I can show some error message also
in the Q debug so like q q debug with a
small cube and then write my model name
from here and paste it here and I will
write row count so he count my row from
the model and one thing I forgot is I
need to close my database first so if I
open the connection with the SQLite
database then at the end of the my code
I should close my connection from the
database so I will copy
my log in corn object and I will write
corn clothes so my connection with the
database is closed this is also a
function in the log in class so now
everything is done I will just build and
run my program hopefully it runs and
there is an arrow so let's see what the
error is
yeah so this should be like this and
this should be closed now I will build
my program once again and hopefully it
runs okay now my login page open so I
will give my username and password let's
login and my second window opens so when
I click this load table button it should
give me all the tables or all the
columns in the database and it will show
me in the table view right so let me
click this load table button and you see
here employee ID column is here name
column is here surname column is here
and when you scroll further edge
username and password and pay column is
here but sometimes you don't want to
show your username and password to the
other users so what you can do is you
can change the query and you can
customize your this query to show the
custom data so instead of Tillich's star
from employee ID you can show write the
specific column names so for example I
want to show the name and surname and
employee ID these three columns in the
table view so I will write select a ID
column name then
name which is second column name and
surname which is third column name mind
you these are these column names these
are the title which I am giving here and
I will build and run my program and
username and password and load table and
now I have only three columns right
employee ID name and surname so I have
customized my data to show in this table
view so in this way you can use table
view to show the database data in your
QT GUI application I hope you have
learned something new this time please
keep watching these videos and please

now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
