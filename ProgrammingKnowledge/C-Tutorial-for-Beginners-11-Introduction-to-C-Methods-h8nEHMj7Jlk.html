show you how to declare and use methods
in c-sharp and other languages methods
are also called functions so functions
and methods are used interchangeably in
programming but in c-sharp we call them
a method so what is a method a method is
a group of statement that performs a
particular task so for example you want
to execute or you want to execute the
sum of two numbers again and again you
can encapsulate the code for summing two
numbers in a function and then call it
into your main function so every c-sharp
project I think I have already told you
that every c-sharp project have at least
one method and that is called this main
method so main is also a method and this
is the main entry point of your c-sharp
program now how to define a method in
c-sharp and what is the structure of a
method let's see what is the structure
of a method a method has access
specifier and then it has return type
then you write the name of the method
and then in the brackets you can pass
some parameters and inside these curly
braces you write the method body or the
code so as we see this and once again we
go to our code and we see this main
method it has this this is called static
specifier we can add a axis specifier
called public specifier so this is
called a ex
specifier and this can be of different
type like public private protect
protected but that we will talk later
when we discuss classes and all but just
remember that when you use public
specifier you can use this method in
other classes also okay
and this is called static specifier and
I will give you an example and this is
called the return type and right now
this main method is not returning
anything that's why that's why it's void
but you can return integers strings or
any class which you defined okay and in
this bracket comes the parameter so
let's declare a method and then use it
so first of all I will give up but X is
specifier which is public and then I
will give the return type for now I will
use void for this example and I want to
sum two numbers okay so I will write
some my method name is some okay and
then I will give these two curly braces
and in here I will define my method so
what I will do is I will define two
integers one is number one is equal to
three 64 and number two which is equal
to 234 for example okay so we have two
numbers which we have initialized and
what we want to do is we want to show
the sum of these two numbers okay so I
will declare a third variable which is
an int and I will call it add and I will
say add is equal to number one plus
number two okay and now I want to print
this number
i console.writeline so I will write
console dot write line and in the
bracket Edition and in this placeholder
I will pass this ad addition of these
two numbers so this is how you can
declare a method right and method has
also argument which I will talk in the
next video and return type that also I
will talk in the next video but this is
the simplest method you can imagine now
how to use this method in the main
method what you need to do is whenever
you want to call a method in C sharp you
want to create an object or an instance
of this class in which you are writing
the method okay so right now as you can
see here we have a class called example
1 and we are writing our code inside
this class example 1 which means that
this method is a member function of this
class so whenever you want to use this
method what you need to do is you just
need to copy this class and you need to
create an instance or object of this
class so just go just copy and paste it
here and then give it a variable name
for example I will give it e 1 object ok
and is equal to a new objects because we
are creating a new object of this class
ok so this code what this does is it
creates a instance of this example 1
class ok and because the sum is the
member of this example 1 we can use dot
separator to call it so just copy this
object
and just write dot and just call this
some method you can see we are using
intelligence so intelligence show that
there is a method in our example class
which is called some so it detects it
and we can just call this method now
when we run the program it will show us
the sum of 364 and 235 so let's see yes
it's giving the addition of the two
numbers okay so in this way you can call
methods in your main function you can
call this method more than once also for
example three times I am calling it this
method three times okay
method is useful whenever you need to
call the same code again and again which
is more than once and I will run this
code and it's showing me the same result
three times without writing the whole
code again and again you are just
calling this method so this is the usage
of method you just write a code which
you want to use repeatedly and you can
use it with this one line only okay now
I have shown you I have already
discussed there is something called
static specifier and what this static
specifier does is lets use the static
specifier I will delete two other line
of code but I will use this and I will
just copy the static specifier and I
will add before my void pictures return
type right so I have now public which is
access step specifier static which is a
static specify am this is a return type
and this is a
and you may have noticed that as soon as
I have used this static specify here
this code is giving me an error because
whenever you use a static keyword before
a function then it becomes a static
member and you cannot call it with an
instance of a class but you can call it
directly how you can call it I will just
comment these two lines and what I will
do is I will just copy the class once
again here and you can call it directly
example which is an example one which is
the name of the class dot the method
name which is some in Argus right and
just give this so whenever you use the
static keyword you don't need to create
an instance of this class you can call
it directly using this dot separator in
your class and whenever you run your
program it will run fine so this is the
difference between using static and not
using statics static now instance when
when these instance are important we
will learn when we I when we learn how
to use classes because this instance
concept is very important concept in
classes right so this is how you can use
method in c-sharp this is a very basic
declaration in the next video I will
show you how to pass parameters in
methods and how to return value in
method ok so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
