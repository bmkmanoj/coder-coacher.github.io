video I will show you how to create an
excel file with your C shop windows form
application so there are many open
source library to create excel file with
your c-sharp application I'm going to
use excel library from Google codes
which is open source library and free to
use so I will use that library to create
an excel file and pass excel file with
my c-sharp application so let's get
started first of all go to your browser
and type excel library in here and the
first link you will find is from
code.google.com slash this excel library
so this is the library from google codes
just click this link and you will reach
to the excel library homepage in here go
to the downloads and download the latest
library it will be downloaded in the zip
file which contains only one dll file
called excel library dot dl so i have
already downloaded and this is the file
which we are looking for so just open
your zip file and extract it wherever
you want the folder of your choice I
generally prefer my project folder to
expect the DLL file so I just expected
the file there okay so in the folder of
my solution
this is my excel excel library dot dll
file now I will go to my project and I
have created a button here and changed
its text as create excel file
okay when I click this button it should
create an excel file for me second three
thing is go to your solution Explorer
and select your project right click it
and select add references and in here go
to browser here and browse for the axil
dot DL in library so in my project
folder I can already see this axial dot
DL so if you don't see that Excel or DLL
just browse from here for that dll and
just select it and press ok and this
excel dot dll is already there in your
references see ok
now the code part once you have taken a
button and change its text just double
click it and we reach to the code
section of this button click event but
before writing any code here I will just
fix some imports these are the two
imposed imports you need to add in order
to use Excel library so I will show you
using
excellent library the once you have
added the DLL in your resources this
import is available dot it has four
libraries binary file format binary
drawing format spreadsheet and all so
right now I have just imported these two
libraries and if I need more libraries I
will add them so just add these two
libraries in your code wherever you have
used using all these libraries now once
you have done that then I wish to the
code section of my button click event
and in here I want to write a code so if
you have noticed the Excel library on
its home page home bitch so here in the
Excel library home page you see an
example code from them so I will just
copy that code from their whole code
this is to create XLS file so I mean
just copy this and I will paste this in
this button click event which I have
made so the milk link and paste it here
but
if you can see it's showing some error
in this for each loop so I will delete
this and for now I will delete this for
loop also so I I have this code right
now which I have copied from Excel
library website so this code will
generate an excellent excellent
called new doc in your C folder so I
will also change the file or folder for
this excel file I want to generate this
excel file in my root folder or wherever
my executable file is if you want you
can provide the part of your choice so
so if I go to my project and in pin in
debug you can see there is no file
called new doc in my folder or there is
no excel file itself in my project
folder but when I run the program then
it will create a new doc excel file in
that folder so let's try and run the
program run it and then write create
excel file I will just click this button
and I will check the folder see if it
has created this new docx file in my
folder so I will open this file and see
what it has created for me so Microsoft
Excel it shows some warning which
say yes and it has generated this text
for me in a first look it looks like
that the Excel library has generated
this random text anywhere in this excel
but when you see in the code I will just
close this application first and when
you see in the code closely you will see
Excel or the code which they have
provided they have defined the row and
column number of the data so one should
be generated at zero comma one place
okay this is short int and this is of
short datatype so 0 1 is at 1 comma 0
place one should appear so let's see in
the excel file this is the zeroth row
and this is post column 0 1 first column
and 0 row so it has created your 1 or it
has inserted your one here ok so from
this logic this 9 9 9 7 time 9 this
should be in the 1 0 1 2 2 comma 0 place
so let's see if it's really there or not
so I will search for this 9 and you see
two commas
zero okay so like that this decimal is
at 3 comma 3 3 point 4 5 at 3 comma 3 so
let's see 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 so 3 point 4 5
so when you see the code closely it has
logic behind this random text so now I
will change the place of the printing of
this text so if you see the code here
they are provided how to insert integer
how to insert short how to insert
decimal number how to insert text and
how to insert other variable date and
time and so in this one code you can
understand how can you insert different
type of data types in the excel file so
now now let's let's try and change this
cell and column so I want every data on
my C wrote row okay I want every data on
different column 1 2 3 4 5 6
and some and now when first of all I
will just close this excel file no and I
will run the program once again and I
will click this create Excel and now I
once again go to that excel file and I
will reopen it by using Microsoft Excel
click OK the warning and you can see
according to my given cells it has given
me the designed dotto ok so in this way
you can change the cell and you can
insert that time to the Excel cells in
column n roll's
so generally it's you cannot insert or
you will not insert that I'm this form
you have to use a loop if you want to
insert a very big data so use for loop
for that so I think what have a code we
have deleted here it will be used for
that for loop and it will insert that
data in the loop so I think you have
understood basic concept of this Excel
library with c-sharp and I hope you have
learned something new this time please

now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
