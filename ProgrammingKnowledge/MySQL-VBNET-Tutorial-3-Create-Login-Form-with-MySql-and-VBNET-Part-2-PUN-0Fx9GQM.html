we'll say this I will give the
sign and in here I'm going to give my
textbox for username name so my textbox
name for username is textbox UN so I
will just paste it here dot t text okay
and once again I will write a query so I
will write here after this single
quotation I will write and password is
equal to single quote and between double
quotation and ampuls
this and sign and then in between I will
once again gave the name of my password
text box here so just paste it here
password dot txt okay so this is the
query I have written just provide the
space between this ampersand and this
between this and sign and between your
textbox password dot txt so now the full
query is like this I have written select
star from your database name dot e data
where your username is equal to in
single quotes and in between double
quotes + this + sign just write the name
of your user name textbox dot text and
once again after closing this single
quotes and double quotes just write and
password is equal to in the same way
single quote double quote and this end
sign and in between right text box pass
which is for password dot text so
basically what this will do is it will
take that
user name and password from the
textboxes and validate it against your
database right and what I will do here
is I will copy this string from here and
pass it as a first argument of this -
will come on and the second argument for
this MySQL command is this connection
from here
okay so first argument is the query and
second argument is the connection with
the database now I need to read the data
from the database for that I will
declare a MySQL reader so here I will
write or I will go at the top and
declare this reader so just below your
command declaration just write them
reader as my SQL MySQL data read out
okay so just just declare this MySQL
data reader variable here and just copy
this reader from here and just below
your connection is equal to new
connection and connection string
declaration just write reader is equal
to new my SQL data reader okay okay so
is giving me some error I think this is
not accessible from outside this sub so
I will declare it as a local so just cut
this code for reader and just declare it
here so just write them reader as MySQL
reader in your login button click event
now just copy this reader from here
reader which is a object of my skill
reader and after this command
declaration just paste your reader and
just write peda is equal to copy this
command variable dot execute reader okay
now what this will do is it will execute
this command and read the data from the
database now we get the database data
from the database now we need to
segregate the data if this data is valid
then we will say the login is successful
or otherwise the login is not successful
so I will declare an integer which will
count the number of data
so I will write them count as integer
and count is equal to 0 for
initialization okay now I will declare a
while loop s'alright while and in this
while loop first of it will give the
condition so I will say read a dot next
or we
the dot read first
so in this while loop what I will do is
I will count the number so I will say
just count is equal to count plus one
okay now outside this while loop I will
give some F conditions so I will write
if my count is equal to one then and
then I need to give one more condition
so I will read else if and I need to
give one more condition for else
okay so else if count is greater than
one then and else whatever is the result
I will show here so I will say if my
count is equal to one I will show the
result in the message box dot show that
my connection is successful so I will
say user name and password are correct
okay in the same way when I will just
copy this message box message here when
my count is greater than one then I will
say username and password are duplicate
okay because there are more than one dot
of present or more than one username and
password
present which is a duplicate
user name and password else I will say
user name and password are not correct
okay so this is basically the code for
the login page now I will run the
program and I will validate my daughter
so let me open my MySQL database and in
this I have this e data and I have this
username and password fields from here
so for example I will write this
username which is 2 and password with
just two I am trying to I will try to
validate this username and password from
here so I will write here 2 and 2 and
validate so I will click this login
button and it's saying database dot e
data doesn't exist because I think my
spelling of the database is incorrect
let me correct my database spelling
really quick this should be not dot abhi
e se but cut of ba se so now the
spelling is correct once again I will
run the program I will write username
and password and login and now it says
username and password is correct because
it validates this username and password
from here and it shows the result
username and password is correct now in
my database I have some duplicate
entries also which is username and
password five for employee ID five also
and I have username and password five
for employee ID six also so this is
duplication of username and password
because this username and password is
present two times in two different
places or two different roles so when I
give five here
five and five username and password five
then when I click this login button it
says username and password are duplicate
because the query found more than one
result for this username and password
right and if I enter some random
username and password and try to
validate it it says me username and
password are not correct so in this way
you can create a login page which
validates your username and password
from the database using your visual
basic windows form application project
in the next videos I will also show you
how to open the new form when your
username and password is correct and how
to hide this password from the user so
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
