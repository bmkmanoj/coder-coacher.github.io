last video I have shown you how to use
cue file dialogue with your qts GUI C++
application so let me show you what I
have shown you last time so whenever I
click this button it opens a file dialog
and whatever file and select it shows
the path of that file in a message box
in this video I will show you how to
open any Exe file which is present in
your system and which you can open it
with the double click of your mouse or
whatever application for example Google
Chrome or VLC media player or PDF file
or any file with this button itself so
I'm going to use the quote from the last
video to open and select the executable
file so for example I I go to my desktop
I want to open this Chrome or I want to
open some other IDE NetBeans IDE or VLC
player how can I open it with this Open
File dialog so Open File dialog I have
already shown you how to open this file
open file dialog so I will take the code
from the last video so if you haven't
seen the last video just go and watch
the last video and what I have done in
this in the last video I just click go
to slot and first of all I in like me
change the name so I will say open
open the file for example okay and I
will right click go to slot and I will
select select the first option and this
was the code I have shown you in the
last video I am going to use the same
code to open the file dialog okay so
just go and watch that video if you have
any confusion and what I was doing in
that code is I work opening the file
dialog and I am taking the name of the
file dialog in this string okay which is
fine name
now for opening the file I need to
include some of the header files so I
will write here include Q Desktop
Services so this is first and the second
header I need to include is include Q
URL okay so these two header file I need
to import and in here I will just
comment this message box because I don't
want to show now the file name in the
message box and just based below this
far open file dialog I will declare a
variable but I will write Q Desktop
Services and then I will write open URL
and in this bracket I will make one more
bracket and I will close this and here I
will write Q URL
okay and in the inner box of this qrl q
URL I will write the path so this is the
path I am getting from the file dialog
but alone this path will not open your
why you need to give an extension that
it's a file so you need to give here
right here file and then : and three
three times you need to give slash so
rights file colon and then first class
second slash and third slash okay and
the second argument you need to give in
this queue URL is because it doesn't
know which file system you are using if
you are using Linux file system or you
are using the windows file system so I
am because I am using the Windows
machine so I'm using the windows file
system so I will write here Q you are l
: : tolerance mode okay so I will write
this and now I will run my program and
see if it's running or not so save it
and build the project and saying that
queue URL open URL does not take two
arguments let me see yeah okay so open
URL will take one now given because URL
would be one but this queue URL takes
two arguments so I will just copy and
cut this code after this comma and I
will pass it here
in this inside bracket where I'm passing
the path of the file okay so now this
code should work so if you want you can
copy it and now I will build the code
once again and it should build now okay
it's working now when I click this open
the file it's opening my C directory and
for example I want to open first of all
a VLC player so I will select VLC player
and click open and it will open my VLC
player ok so it has opened my VLC player
for example I want to open once again
the Mozilla browser so I will just click
it and click open
and it will open my Mozilla browser or
for example I want to open some picture
so I will go and select here picture and
I will select sample picture and I will
select a picture and it will open a
picture here or whatever file you want
to open you will be able to open from
this code so now for example I can open
anything I think you understood what I
want to say ok so in this way you can
open any exe file which you can open on
your desktop using this code I hope you
