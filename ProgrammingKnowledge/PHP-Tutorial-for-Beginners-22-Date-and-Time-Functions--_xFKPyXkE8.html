video I am going to show you how to
print date and time of the server on
which your PHP file resides are using
your PHP code so basically I want to
print the time or time and date of your
server because these file all will be on
the server right so let's see how we can
print date in time using this server so
I can just declare a variable called
date first of all I need to save this I
will save it as date time dot PHP and
now it's date is equal to and there is a
special function called date in PHP
which is used to give us the date right
now this takes one argument or more than
one argument depending upon the user
whatever argument you want to give here
so for example I want to give the date
in some format so for example I want to
give the date in this format first of
all the day and then so for example they
slash month
slash here okay so I can achieve this
like this so for day I can give small D
and then slash so and month small m and
for year capital y okay and let's just
echo this echo date date okay save this
refresh this and run this you will be
able to see this current date of the
server which is on the server and right
now it 7 8 2014 right but you can
for example you want to change this
format you want to add the point month
point then what you need to do is you
just need to change the format of this
string like the point a month point M
point small M point okay I will refresh
this and now I can see the point here
for example on on the dash a minus
symbol I can do it like this so it
depends upon you what format you will
need you just need to give the format
here and I will refresh it and I get the
this state like this now for example I
need the time I can declare a variable
called time is equal to and I can still
use this date function to give the time
so it can take the format of the time
also so for example I want time
something like this I want to show first
of all the hours hours like this and
then minutes and then sex
I mean seconds right then how can I do
this I can just write here capital arch
are - and then small I for minutes and
then - for second I think I should use s
right save it and I want to echo this
echo time time and let me put break here
so the date and time will be printed on
different lines BR with
single quotes okay and now will refresh
this and I can see the time here also so
time is 0 0 30 and the second is PI you
can change this by changing the format
like this for example you want the
format like this of a minute and seconds
you can always change it like this ok so
the format depends upon you whatever
format you want to see it will be able
to see now you may want to display your
day as a string for example wetness day
or something like this there are many
combination to show your date and time
and I have just shown you a few of these
options now if you want to know more
about the form of all formats for
example this D whenever you use it shows
the day and these two letters or
whatever you say but I whenever I use
this capital D let's see what happens
and I use capital D and refresh it it
shows me they in the form F of three
letter word right today's first there so
it's giving me day like this so there
are many combinations possible to show
date and time and to more about this
table of the format you can just go to
your php.net and search for date here
and in here you will find the function
date and here you will find the list of
the format characters so you can see
small D is for day of month two digit
five capital D is a text textual
representation of day in three letters J
is the day of month without leading
zeros and you can see all kind of letter
or characters which you can use
to represent your date and time okay
so just take a look at this list and you
will be able to see how you can combine
these characters to make your own kind
of date or format of date okay so I hope
