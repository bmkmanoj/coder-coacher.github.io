what program we have made till now so
when we run the program our login window
we open and we enter password and user
ID and we press my button it shows the
message whether user ID is going to not
and then it opens the new window it will
apply info window and then in this and
we open the when we click this button
new this page will open so now we are
going to design this page and in this
page we are going to analyze our data
which is there in the second table so
let's get started how to do that how to
analyze data and how to import or show
or elliptical analytical data in this J
frame so let's get started
this is a SQLite database till now we
have made only one table called employee
info and now we are going to make
another table
just right-click and click create people
and we will give the column names first
this table we are going to make it for
pump so we will name it as first off
first column as from ID because in
Empire every table on database the first
thing you need to do is define a column
which is which have a primary key in it
so the data can be identified according
to the key and of course we will name
our table in the info for example and
this first column from binary be our
primary key and
and
we will and date
Oh Heidi data type is integer date data
type is date time and Kesha
it's not a type would be double then
temperature doctor time we will take it
as double
volume flow in second at the time we
will take it as double rotational speed
water type is double so these
six column I have made and the table
name is user info then plus okay and it
will show the query conform operation
yes and second table is made in which
pump ID date pressure temperature volume
flow and speed link um now we will
insert some values in it so pump ID for
example one did it's important to know
that SQLite or MySQL takes date in what
form the SQLite takes date in here month
and they form it so we will take the
date as for example yeah
2:01 to a month till five then date for
example then pressure pressure we can
take anything for example 50 temperature
for example maybe 25 volume flow we will
take it as 50 and the rotational speed
we will take it as 2,000 and when you
click OK this add new record click OK
and you can see the record is added into
your table so in this way you can add
your table information or table data one
by one into it so one cannot gonna do
that you can do by yourself and now we
will go to our java java jframe and we
will do some basic designing for example
you will take menu bar and place it
there then we will take toolbar every of
I have already shown how to use them for
designing and
this is it
next time when I will show this table I
will fetch my user info table which is
this table into this jframe and how to
fetch your database into J table I've
already shown so you will be able to see
or table here and then I will show you
how to design or how to analyze that
data and I will also show how to make
graph on the basis of our analysis and
how to show or use J sliders radio
buttons and damn pain and many more
things I will show you how to use them
in this J frame so I think that's all
for this video please rate comment and
subscribe and thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
