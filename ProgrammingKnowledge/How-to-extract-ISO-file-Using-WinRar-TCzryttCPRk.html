show you how you can extract any ISO
file or image file to your computer
without using any USB or without using
any DVD or CD so what you need to do is
for example you have some iso file and
you want to extract it on your system
the thing you need is a program called
WinRAR
so just open your browser and search for
when - rar calm when - rar calm and the
first link hopefully will come here is
from windra www dot when - rar calm
click this link and in here you will be
able to download winrar on your computer
so I will click this link there is a
professional version but for this I
don't need it so I will just click
download winrar and i just want to
download winrar here from here so for
this you don't need to do anything when
raw executable file will be downloaded i
will save this file it is not a big file
so i will just execute this winrar file
and i will minimize everything and i
will just install it and here is the
important step you need to associate
WinRAR with all these files all these
zip format for example rar zip 7-zip or
any other file format but by default
whenever you install WinRAR this ISO
Association is not selected so just
select this also and then click OK if
you want to make an even draw a shortcut
or Start menu you can choose it but
I will leave it as it is but make sure
that this ISO is checked here and click
OK and then click done and click OK and
now when rar is installed in your system
right now we want to extract our image
file so I have a image file which is
this Microsoft professional ISO
Microsoft Office Professional ISO file
and I want to extract it to my local
computer folder so what I need to do I
will just right click this and then
whenever I am finished with installing
wind rar I will be able to see these
kind of options here so add to archive
add to Office Professional rar compress
or these option I will be able to see
here right so so right click this office
file and if you do not see extract file
or ISO you can go to open with and then
choose a default program if you cannot
see when rar from here just go to choose
default program and then browse for the
folder wherever you have installed
WinRAR so I have installed this vendor
are in my program files x86 this is my
folder where I have installed WinRAR I
just need to select window are from here
ok click open and then I can see all the
file inside this ISO file right now in
order to extract this I just need to
click this button called extract 2 and
from here I can choose the location
where I want to extract so I already
have made a folder where I want to
extract this which is called office 2013
let me show you first with
were extracting this folder that this
folder is empty right now so you can see
it happening or filling in real-time
whenever I click this button okay so I
will just choose this office for now
which is office to pathogen 13 folder
which I made and I will just click OK
and now you will be able to see here in
real time all the files are extracted
from this ISO file to this folder right
so now all the files are extracted from
my ISO file and I can now run this setup
which is there in the ISO file and
install my you know whatever software I
want to install in this case I wanted to
install office so I extracted my office
ISO file in my specified folder using
WinRAR so in this way you can extract
any ISO file using WinRAR I hope you
