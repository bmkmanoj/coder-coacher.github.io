show you how to install adobe flash
player in your Ubuntu operating system
so simple way is to just go to your
Ubuntu Software Center and when open to
Software Center is open on the ye right
top search text box just right
Flash Player and you will be able to see
this Adobe Flash Player plugin in here
right and you just need to select it and
install it but I am going to show you
how to install a door flash player
manually in your open to operating
system because sometimes Ubuntu
repositories are not in their latest
form so you will not be able to get the
latest Flash Player in open 2 by using
Ubuntu Software Center so first of all
just open your browser here and in here
in the search just write a dog
/
lair
download and press enter
yeah and this is the site we want to go
so just go to this site adult flash
player downloads and in here you will be
able to see this screen and what we want
to do is we want to go in this get the
latest version so just like this let get
the latest version here and now you see
here that Adobe site detects your system
automatically so my system is Linux
32-bit system and my browser is Firefox
which I am opening in this site okay so
here you have some options to choose to
download and what we are looking for is
this dot dot dot GZ for other Linux file
so just click this dot tar.gz for other
Linux select this and just click this
download now
and it will ask for saving of the file
it will be downloaded okay and now you
will you just need to go to your file
system and go to downloads and in here
you will be able to see this install
Flash Player 11 Linux for 32-bit what I
am going to do is just right click it
and I will say extract here and it will
extract this folder here and when I open
this extracted folder it has a user and
it has live Flash Player ISO file right
I am interested in this clip flash
player ISO file here and now next what I
am going to do is I am going to open my
terminal and in here I will write sudo
Nautilus which is a filesystem in Ubuntu
default file system and press ENTER and
give your password and it will open this
folder once again but why we need to do
this because we need the root privileges
to copy and paste some file in the root
directories right so now what I am going
to do is I am going to go to the devices
and I am going to go here in the
computer this is a 13.10 open to system
so in here the file system is like this
or if you have previous versions of
Ubuntu you will be able to see file
systems in this section below some
desktop or documents but in 13.10 I have
this I need to click this computer to go
to my root files and I need to go to
this user
and go to lib so I am in user Lib
directory and I will search for the
folder called Mozilla here by default
Ubuntu keeps its plugin and other things
for all the browser whether it's Rome or
any other browser also so got just go in
there and there are extensions and there
is a folder called plugins so we are
interested in plugins and in here you
will see there are already some plugins
which are which I have already installed
here and now what I need to do is I will
just go to my download folder and I will
just go to my extracted folder here and
I will just copy this Lib flash player
file from here right click copy and I
will paste this file here and user live
Mozilla plugins folder right I click and
paste it here and now this is here right
so that's it it's in our plug-in section
and now once again when you open the
Mozilla so you need to restart your
Mozilla browser so just close your
browser and just open Mozilla once again
and just go to tools here and go to
add-ons and in the plug-in tab you will
be able to see this shockwave flash
player ok so this is how you can see
that our flash player is already
installed in Ubuntu ok so in this way
you can install
Adobe Flash Player in your Ubuntu
operating system I hope you have enjoyed
