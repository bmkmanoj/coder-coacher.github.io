change the foreground of background
color or text feed any J component with
the help of a condition when sub
condition is gable for example it will
be take the ages and if we want when our
age is smaller than 25 this age text
field color background color should
become green or if the age is more than
25 the text field
background color should become red so if
we want to apply our condition and want
to change the color how can we do that
today I'm going to show you so
for example whenever you click in the J
table they should change so just go to
your table right click your table go to
event mouse key and mouse clicked then
we will go to the method we have already
made
in which when we select any item or any
row the dark love will be shown in the
text field so we want to change the
color background color according to the
age so we are taking age in the variable
and for in the string so age is storing
the variable which is string we first of
all need to convert this string into
integer so we will write int whatever is
the variable name limit as age is equal
to
is equal to
we have to write in order to convert
string into integer you have to write
this thing
integer dot pass int and whatever your
string name is so my string variable
name is and for so your string variable
and for is converted into integer now
and then we should apply a condition if
the condition is and then in the if
condition if age is
greater than or equal to 25 and we want
to set our background color so we want
to change where background glove this
text field so we will copy the variable
name experience variable name is text
age put your source paste it and write
dot set
background color and we you can see it's
already by default
the color is right I want to change it
example green you can change it or else
we will write as condition
and in else condition tonight
text age which is the variable name of
our text field dot
cept
nice right so if it is greater than or
equal to 25 text be background color
will be green and if it's less than 25
it will be red for example you also want
to change the color of your foreground
color and also you can change just paste
your explain a set the foreground
let's then default color is red but
I'm going to change the color into
doc agree for example saying this way it
will also change the foreground color
and also you can change the foreground
color set program color when you fold
it's red you change it the color is
black
look
so let's try to run the program and see
our condition is true or not
for example
and click
27 so it's greater than 25 so your text
field will become green and when we
click for the ages less than 25 so your
text field where you become red green
green red so this is the tutorial on how
to use so set background color and
foreground color on the basis of
condition I hope you have enjoyed and
please rate comment and subscribe and
thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
