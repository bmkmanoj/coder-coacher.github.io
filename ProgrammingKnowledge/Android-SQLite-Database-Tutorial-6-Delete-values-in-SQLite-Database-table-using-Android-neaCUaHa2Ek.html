Android SQLite database tutorial for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to delete data in SQLite database
using our Android app so let's get
started till now we have seen how to
insert data how to update data and how
to view data in SQLite database so let's
add a new button and we will call this
button as delete data so let's change
the text of this button as delete and
the button ID will change it to button
delete ok now once we have this button
what we are going to do is we are going
to go to our database helper class which
we have made in our previous videos and
in this class we will create a new
function and we will call it as delete
data function or method as we say in
Java so let's call it a public function
which will return integer and we will
call it as delete data function for
example and it will take one argument
and this argument will be the ID of our
table okay so we know that we have four
columns as I always mentions in our
database table one is ID name surname
and age this table we have been working
on and we want to delete the data on the
basis of ID because ID is our primary
key here primary key means the unique
identifier on the basis of which we can
recognize the data which we want to
affect in our in this case we want to
delete this data right so that's why
this function delete data will take this
ID as an argument now the first thing
which we will do is we are going to
create the SQLite database object
using this get writable database which
we have done in the last videos also
right so just copy this and paste it
here
okay and the next thing is we will take
this database instance to delete the
data
so take DB here and we are going to call
delete on this database instance and
this delete takes three arguments one is
the name of your table so let's press
ctrl and go inside this delete function
first of all and well let's see what it
takes
so this delete function takes the name
of your table and then second argument
is the where clause and the third
argument is the value which you want to
pass as a string array and in return it
returns the number of affected rows if
the data is deleted or number of rows
which are deleted otherwise if no data
is deleted
it returns zero okay so we are going to
use this return integer to check how
many rows are affected or if any rows
are affected or not and on the basis of
this we can print the result right so we
will come back to our database helper
class and first argument we will pass it
as the table name our table name is
student table so we will take the table
name variable and pass it as a first
argument second argument is the clause
and Clause is in this case is we want to
delete the data on the basis of ID right
and the ID column name in our case is ID
here right so you can take this ID and
we want to ask for the ID so we will ask
what is the ID like this ID is equal to
question and then
this question mark will be replaced by
the value we are going to pass here as a
third argument so this will be the news
string array and here we will pass the
ID the value of ID which we take from
here and this is going to delete your
data now we are seeing here I am really
returning integer so you can just write
return because this delete method in the
SQLite database class returns the
integer right so this is the method we
want to create in database helper class
now what we are going to do is we are
going to go to our main activity dot
Java class where we will write of a code
for the button press right so first
thing we are going to do is we are going
to declare one more button variable and
we will name it as button delete for
example and now we are going to cast
this button in our on create method so
in here I am going to copy this and I'm
going to just cause this button delete
and change the ID so ID dot button
delete okay now next thing is as we
always do is we will create a function
which will be a public function and it's
going to return nothing and we will name
it as delete data function and it's
going to take no argument and in here
what we are going to do is we are going
to take our button delete variable dot
set on click listener and we will create
a new onclicklistener and in here what
we want to do is we just want to call
our delete data function right so here
what we are going
- is we are going to declare an integer
variable and we will call it as deleted
rows right is equal to and then we are
going to take the object of our my
database class or database helper class
which is my DB in our my case dot we
will call this delete data function
which we have created just now right and
that this takes one argument which is ID
so let's see what is the ID of this
added text ID so this is added text ID
itself right so we will just write edit
text ID
okay now we are going to take the text
from it so we will call get text
function here and then we are going to
convert this into string right so
whatever this function returns we will
check how many number of rows are
affected if this deleted rows not equal
to 0 that means some rows are deleted or
better we can say is greater than 0 okay
if this is greater than 0 then what we
are going to do I will copy this to save
some time and we are going to create a
toast
which will show the message like this
data deleted and if this deleted row is
equal to 0 so if number of rows deleted
is equal to 0 or less than 0 then we say
data not deleted okay so this is our
function which we want to create in our
main activity dot Java file and don't
forget to copy this and paste it in your
oncreate method so call this function in
your oncreate method
and now we are going to run this program
so let's run it so now our app is
running first of all let's see what data
we have so we will click view all and
right now we have two rows right one is
ID 1 and 1 is ID 2 so let's delete this
ID 2 data for example right so what we
need to do is we will just go to this ID
added text and we will just write 2 here
ok and now what we are going to do is we
will just click delete and it says data
deleted and we will see once again all
the data so we will click view all and
now only one row is remaining here so
that means it has deleted of a row
number 2 or ID 2 data okay in the same
way if you write here 1 and click delete
it will delete the row 1 or row with ID
1 so in this way you can delete the data
in SQLite database using your Android
app I hope you have enjoyed this video
