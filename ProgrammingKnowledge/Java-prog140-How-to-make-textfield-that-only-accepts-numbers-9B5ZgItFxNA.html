video I will show you how to validate a
jtextfield to enter only the numerical
values so first of all I will go to the
palette and I will take a jtextfield
here drag and drop and I will delete it
text and I want the user to be able to
only enter the numerical values like 1 2
3 4 and I want that the user should not
be able to enter the characters or the
values other than the numerical values
so how can I do that
I will show you so just select your text
field right click it and go to event and
go to Keys event key and key type ok
once again right-click your text box
event key and key type and just click
this key typed event and you will reach
to the key type event in the source code
ok this one and in here we are going to
write our code so right here in the key
typed event care see see for example is
equal to just copy this event variable
in this bracket Java dot aw t dot event
dot key event and just copy this which
is automatically generated variable so
just copy this EVT from here and paste
it here and right dot get key
care and break it and break it closed
okay and in the next line we will
provide a if condition so right
if bracket and these brackets and make a
space and in here we are going to
provide our condition so right here if
not equal to and bracket and in here
right
character
dot is digit it will automatically take
this C so this C is this care value okay
and just go after this character C
bracket this one and here write this or
sign and then once again copy this C
care value C and is equal to then write
key
event dot V K underscore backspace okay
and if you want you can just provide the
bracket for the clarity and then once
again give or sign condition once again
see care variable is equal to ki
event dot VK underscore the lead
okay
so right this
so what I have done is I have declared a
character variable called C is equal to
e V T which is this key event variable
which is automatically generated when I
press key type event dot get key cap and
bracket and I can close and I have
provided a if condition and in the if
condition I have written the argument if
not equal to and then bracket character
dot is digit and in the bracket I pass
this care value or once again the
bracket C is equal to key event dot V K
underscore space bracket closed or C is
equal to KI event dot V K delete and
bracketing that bracket closed so what
this if condition is checking is when I
enter any character or any key when I
press any key it checks for the digit or
a numerical value and it checks for the
backspace key and it checks for the
Delete key so if you know when I enter
some values I should be able to delete
them all so that's why I have provided
this backspace and this delete
conditions okay so if this is fulfilled
then if this is not fulfilled then I
want to consume this keys or I want to
disable the press key press event so I
will just copy this EVT once again paste
it here dot consume so this consume
means it will not be tied it will the
key type event will be consumed okay and
then now when we run the program run
and in here when I theis type something
I will open a virtual keyboard so you
could be able to see it so in here when
I type any numerical values like 1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 it allows me to enter but when I
enter this character values it does not
take okay so in this way we are
restricting the user to enter the
character values just the numerical
values it takes one more interesting
condition you can provide is the to
create a beep sound or the sound to
restrict the characters so let's see how
we can create that that sound so in your
code in this little code what you need
to do is I will just make it visible in
the frame so write this code and after
this if condition and above this consume
event here right get
so get
- wicked
dot
beep
so this when you write this code this
will create a sound when the character
key is pressed but it will not create a
sound when you enter any numerical
values so let's see how it works
now once again I open my virtual key
board and when I press any numerical
values first of all here I immediately
it takes the numerical values okay when
but when I click any character it will
make a sound so listen for it right so
that what we want we want to restrict it
and when the user enter any character
values it should be alerted or user
should be alerted that he enters the
wrong values that's why this sound so in
this way you can validate a text field
to enter only the numerical values I
hope you have learned something new this
time so please keep watching and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
