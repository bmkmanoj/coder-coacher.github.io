cutie tutorial for beginners in the last
video we have seen how to use layouts
and cutie now in this video I'm going to
show you how you can use spacers
splitters tabs and buddies with layout
in QT so I have created this sample
project and now I'm going to go to main
window dot UI file here and what I want
to do here is I want to take a label
from here and I want to take a line add
it from here okay so I can just select
them both and from here also you can see
some of the options at the top also so I
can you know arrange them horizontally
by using this one and I can arrange them
vertically by using this button so let's
arrange them horizontally by using this
button and you can see these are you
know arranged horizontally right now
what I want to do next is I want to take
some buttons also and I want to do the
same so I will take to push button and
let's say this text is somebody's name
okay and name this should be name and
then what I want to do is this will be
for example somebody gives his name and
presses OK or he wants to quit the
application for example quit okay and
then I will select these two buttons and
I will give a horizontal layout to this
also right now I can select both of
these layouts and I can arrange them
vertically right so select both of them
and then just choose this layout
vertically and they will be arranged in
a vertical manner right now for example
I want these two buttons little bit on
the right hand side
of the you know these this box so what I
can do here is there is an option called
horizontal spacer and vertical spacer
right so as the name suggests horizontal
spacer is to give horizontal space so
just select this horizontal spacer and
just pick and place just at left hand
side of this button okay and you can see
this horizontal spacer gives some space
and you know this squeezes this two
buttons at the right hand side right so
whenever you select this horizontal
spacer this also has some property and
you can see the size type is expanding
you can keep it you know minimum or you
can keep it preferred or you can keep it
maximum or whatever from here okay even
fixed okay and then you can give the
size to it whenever you keep it fixed
okay well now I'm going to choose it as
for example preferred here so you can
see this spacer allows us to give some
space in the layout whenever we are
using the layout in the same way you can
use the vertical layout to give vertical
spaces right in your layout okay now
this is one of my layout now what I want
to do is I want to pick and place some
buttons so I will just give one or two
buttons one and two and for example
three buttons I will select all these
three buttons and I will apply a
vertical layout to them
now what I want to do is I want to
arrange these two layouts one for button
and one for did this you know line edit
and text in a splitter using a splitter
so what I can do is I can just select
these two layouts but I just selecting
them
like this and then right-click on them
and then choose this layout and then use
this option which says layout
horizontally in splitter okay
so this will you know give a horizontal
layout to both of them with a splitter
and the splitter is as the name suggests
splitter it's helped you to split your
to layout so I'm just going to choose
this option and now what I want to do is
I want to just give one layout to them
because I haven't given any layout to my
main window right so I can just go here
and for example I want to give this time
vertical layout so layout vertically to
both of them right now don't worry about
the size policy here I don't want to
show the size policy but the splitter
here right so I will save my code and
run it and let's see what happens once
it runs so now my app is running and now
you can see this is our first layout and
this is our second layout and in between
them you whenever you hover over on this
you know invisible line here you will be
able to see your mouse changes to this
later kind of thing so you can move your
splitter by using this line right so
splitter is something like helps you to
you know manage your layouts like this
is a splitter so this splits between
these properties and this design view so
this can be a splitter right so this is
the same splitter as this you have you
are seeing here so this is how you can
use split there is one more option here
which you can use is and that option is
from here so you can see there is option
called
added buddies right so you just you need
to choose this option from here and
and you can choose the body so whenever
you choose the bodies as the name
suggests they become buddies one and two
so this line text and name becomes
buddy-buddy means whenever you you know
highlight the name it's going to you
know give this you know highlight on the
line added also so this is a buddy mode
so you can give the body more generally
to the labels associated with the line
text or you can give these to as buddies
you can make these two as buddies right
so this is the body you know additive
view okay
so I'm going to go to my normal added
widget view and the last thing which I
want to show you is the tab option so
just click this option we say is added
tab order so just click this and now you
can see every visit which you have in
your window have some number so this is
the tab order in which whenever you
press your tab button your you know
highlight of your cursor will go there
so first it will go to your line edit
because these two things are buddies so
they are you know highlighted as one
option right so that's why I have made
them buddy so that these can be treated
as one option right now second is this
one third tab is this one so whenever I
press first of tab will go here and then
here here here here here according to
the number I can change this ordering of
the tab by just double-clicking on them
so you can see the tab order is changing
from here okay in here also it's
changing so you can just play with them
just by just clicking them and you can
even change the tab order for these
things okay so this is how you can use
spacers splitters tabs and buddies in
queue
