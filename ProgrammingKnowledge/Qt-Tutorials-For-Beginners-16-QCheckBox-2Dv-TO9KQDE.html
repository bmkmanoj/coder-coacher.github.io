cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn about check boxes in
QT so let's get started first of all I
have made the sample project which is
empty for now and first of all I am
going to go to main window dot UI and in
here I'm going to add our check box here
ok so this is a check box and as the
name suggests you can use check box to
you know check something for example you
can ask the user about his opinion if he
likes something or not for example whose
answer is true or false
ok so if the answer is true he can check
it and if the answer is false he can
uncheck it right so for example you want
to ask the user do you like apples and
then let's take a push button also so
just right push button here and drag and
drop here ok and in here we can just
change it to check ok so when we click
or press this button we want to check
which option the user has selected ok
so what I'm going to do first here is
I'm going to right click go to slots for
the push button and I'm going to select
clicked option here and click OK and in
here first of all let's say what we want
to do is we want to first of all check
if the checkbox is checked or not right
so we can just write UI and then just
ask for the check box so just take the
check box and then just use the method
called is checked ok
this method will return a boolean value
so you can check if the checkbox is
checked or not ok so we will use if
condition here and
if the checkbox is checked we want to
display some message right so for
example let's add a message include
message class include so just right hash
include' queue message box okay so just
add here queue message box just add this
one right so this will allow us to use
message box so I'm going to use message
box and I will just use information for
now first argument is the parent second
argument is the title so for example
title itself and the third argument is
the message okay so you can just print
some message you can just say yes user
likes apples for example right and if
the checkbox is unchecked in that
condition we can just use else and then
in this condition we want to show that
no the user don't like apples right so
let's see if this works or not right so
let's run the app and let's see what
happens so for now when the app is going
to run we will see it will be unchecked
so by default it will be unchecked right
so you can see the checkbox is unchecked
and when we press this check button it
says no user do not like apples right
and when this checkbox is checked it
will say yes user like apples right now
there is other way of using this
checkbox so for example you don't want a
push button to you know press and then
check the answer you want that at the
same time when a user presses the check
box you want to show some message so how
you can do this so once again we will go
to
this main window dot UI file and right
click on our checkbox and we can add a
slot to it and this time here we will
choose some slot right so what we can
choose here is the state change method
here so just choose this method which
say state changed okay and then click OK
and then you can just copy and paste
this code here in the state change so as
soon as you press or change the state of
the checkbox it will you know give you
the state and then on the basis of state
you can just you know display some
messages here and this time you don't
even need to check using this is checked
method because this argument here will
give you the state of your checkbox so
you can just use Arg 1 here itself right
and let's run our app and let's see what
happens so just run it and when it runs
we will see the result how it works so
for example I'm going to check this
checkbox right so check it it gives me
this message right that yes user like
apples and when I uncheck it it says the
other message to me right now if you
want to you know by default when you run
the app and you want to check your
checkbox using some code how you can do
it so let's say we want to you know
check the checkbox by some code what we
can do is we can go in the constructor
here and we can just use UI and then use
our checkbox and then we can use a
method called set checked ok so set
checked method it takes a boolean value
so if you write true here then your
check box will be checked when you will
run your app so let's see whether it's
true or not so let's build a program and
let
run it and you can see it shows this
message because this code is called in
the constructor so you can click OK and
you can see by default your checkbox is
checked right so this is due to this
code ok and if you want to uncheck this
you can make it false something like
this ok so in this way you can use
checkboxes in QT I hope you enjoyed this
