last video I have shown you how to play
a beep sound with the help of your
windows form application in this video I
will show you how to play a audio file
with the help of your visual C++ windows
form application so what what I'm going
to do is I will choose a file which will
be audio file from my computer and I
will display in this text box and when I
press this play audio file the file will
play so on the coding part what I have
done is I have taken one text box whose
name is text box one I have taken button
and then renamed we named it as choose
file and I have taken other button
called play audio file and now what I
have done is I have double clicked this
button and in here written the code for
opening a file dialog so write Open File
dialog and this cap sign open 5d
dialogue variable named GC Open File
dialog and then copy this variable here
and arrow pointers show dialog bracket
and bracket closed and this is the name
of my text box which is this text box
text box one point the text is equal to
this variable once again pointing to the
file name so what this will do is
whatever file we will select from our
Open File dialog it will be printed in
our text box okay so this button will do
that now on the part of playing the
audio file we will use this button just
select this button double click it and
here I have taken a try-catch block so
if we have we will face some problem for
example if you select a file which will
not be audio file then it will catch
your error and show you show you our
message box in the form of panel
so in this prime block what you have to
do is first you need to declare sound
clear which is in the system media
library so system
w : media the vehicle sound player and
this small cap symbol and this is our
variable name is equal to GC new system
w : media the between sound player so we
declared our sound player this is the
Declaration of our sound player and this
is the variable
in the next line what you have to do you
have to take the text from the text box
and give the location to the player so
right this variable player arrow point
the sound location is equal to text box
one which is your dis text box and arrow
pointed text so this will provide the
location to the player that you have to
play a sound from this location now in
the third line right play arrow point
the load so this will load your play up
and one more line you need to add is
this length layer that will point the
plays sync okay so this is the code for
playing the sound if you require you can
just pause the video and copy this code
and now let's try to run the program
okay so I will choose the file from this
this will open a dialog box and from
here I will choose this check mean audio
file which is dot WAV extension okay
so I'm choosing dot V file and now when
I press this button it should play that
sound so let's see so it plays the
selected file with the audio player so
in this way you can play any sound which
is compatible with this visual studio
and then lose it into a port so I hope
you have enjoyed this video please rate
