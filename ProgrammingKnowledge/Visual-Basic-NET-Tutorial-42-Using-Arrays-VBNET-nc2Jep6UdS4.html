show you how to use arrays with your
visual basic windows form application
this will be a very basic demonstration
of using arrays so let's get started I
will just take a button and resize it
and I will change its text as array and
this double-click it and first of all I
will show you how to declare arrays so
for example I want to make the array of
names so basically I want to have a list
of names
I have several number of names and I
want to make a list of those names so I
can store the these names in an array so
first of all how to declare array just
write them name and this bracket shows a
visual basic that it's an array and
whatever number you enter between this
bracket will tell you we'll basic that
this array contains the number plus one
members so if you enter here four then
it will contain five names because array
start from zero right and then as usual
need to give the datatype so for example
we give string datatype to our name
array so this is the declaration for the
array now for the assignment what you
can do is this should be names right
because this is a list of names from so
for assignment you can just write
name's zero is equal to and you can give
any name and in the same way I can
assign the rest of the four names right
so the array starts from zero then goes
to one two three and four right a name
can be different and storing different
names okay now how to retrieve the names
as a useful of entity for example I want
to show the first element of the array
which is mark then I can just show it in
the message box five right message box
taught show names and in the bracket you
can pass the item number and you can
just show the name mark which is the
item zero so I will just run my program
so my program is running and when I
click this button it shows the first
element of the array now for example I
want to iterate or I want to show all
the names one by one this I can do by
using for loops so I will write for
I is equal to 0 to the length of the
array so we can determine the length of
the array by just copying the name of
the array dot length right and then I
write minus 1 why I am writing here
minus 1 because we are starting from 0
right and the length of the array is 5
so that's why I'm writing minus 1 here
and in here I can just cut this message
box from here and paste it here and
instead of 0 I will write I so it will
iterate the value of all the name from 0
to 4 in this message box one by one
using this for loop so when I run the
program and when I click this button it
will show the first name which is mark
second name Julie third name code name
and fixed name right so in this way you
can use arrays in your visual basic
windows form application I hope you have
