how to add a VLC media player inside
your Visual Basic windows form
application form so let's get let's get
started I will go to my toolbox and
right click anywhere in the toolbox and
I will choose choose items so click this
option called choose item from here
and it will open a dialog box which have
some tabs so go to this comm component
tabs from here and just search for the
VLC ActiveX plug-in so let me see where
can I find it yeah so just search for
this VLC Len VLC ActiveX plug-in v2 so
by default it's this check box is not
checked so just check this checkbox and
then click OK and what it will do is it
will add a new tool called via video LAN
VLC ActiveX plug-in from here and this
plug-in we are going to use in our forum
so just choose or select this forum and
drag and drop into your forum and let's
make a simple little application to open
some video inside this video clear VLC
media player and star stop and pause the
video so I will take four buttons from
here and now I will
change the text of the first button as
load second button text as start third
button text as stop and fourth button
text as pause okay now I will also take
a open file dialog to open the file path
so just go to the tool box and drag and
drop Open File dialog into your form and
it will go here and if you don't know
how to use open file dialog just go to
the last feet three videos I have been
using this open file dialog so by now
you know how to use this so what I will
do is I will go to this node button and
I will double click it and in this load
button click event I will just first of
all paste the code for the open file
dialog which filters the mp4 file which
is a format of video files so it's just
first line of code filters the VLC or
mp4 files and then it checks whether
your file path is correct or not and if
it corrects it's correct then we are
going to write a code so just copy and
paste these three lines of code or and
if you don't understand these lines this
was the last three videos and here what
I will do is I will just select my VLC
plug-in tool and copy the name of it and
I will paste it inside this if condition
and I will say dot playlists dot
and inside the brackets we will pass an
argument which is the path of the file
so I will copy this Open File dialog
name dot file name okay so this is to
load your file into the playlist of VD
VLC player now just click this start
button and double click it and in here
also in the start button we will write
the ActiveX plug-in name dot playlist
dot play ok and to stop the video just
double click this stop button and once
again the plug-in name dot playlist dot
stop and the fourth option is pause so
just double click this pause button and
the name gaunt playlist not this one but
the playlist dot toggle pause ok now
let's try and run the program and see if
it opens the mp4 file or not so first of
all I will click this load button which
will open our open file dialog to choose
the video file which is the mp4 format
according to our filter right so I will
choose one video file from here and open
it and it will not start because we have
just given the path to the VLC player
now when you click the start button it
will start your video so see this and
when I click this pause button it pauses
the video right so start and pause start
and pause and when I click start and
when I want to stop it stops the video
and when I once again click this start
it starts the video
okay so this is my simple application to
load VLC media player inside your form
and start stop and pause your videos I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
