show you how you can download and
install Eclipse IDE for developing C and
C++ program on your Windows 8 or Windows
8.1 or Windows 7 operating system for
downloading and installing eclipse on
your system you need three things one is
Java runtime environment because eclipse
is a Java based IDE second is Eclipse
IDE itself for developing C and C++ and
third is the compiler which we will use
to compile our C or C++ programs so we
are going to install them one by one
first of all you need to install java
jdk on your system
so just search for java jdk so there is
a simple test if java jdk or java
runtime environment is present on your
system you just right-click your windows
button here and in here
open command prompt and just type Java C
and if it gives any response then Java
is installed on your system
otherwise it's not so I already have
Java that's why it has given me the
response but if you don't have this
search for Java JDK and the first link
most probably come here is www.hyken.com
just click this link and in here just
ask me later click ask me later and in
here you will find Java ok and at the
time of making this video
this version Java platform 8 to 5 is the
latest so just click Java don't click
NetBeans that means is the IDE so click
this Java button here and in here you
need to accept the license terms and
condition and choose your operating
system my system is Windows 64 so I will
choose this and in front of this click
this executable file and download this
ok so I will save this on
my system so while this is downloading
in a meantime I will install or download
this compiler which we will use to
compile our C in C++ program so there
are many options available on internet
to download this compiler and I found
the compiler which is latest version of
compiler and this site provides this
compiler so just search for equation
comm www equation comm and when you go
inside this website you will be able see
this kind of interface and in here you
need to go to programming tools and in
programming tools you need to click 14
comma C comma C++ and in here when you
go down you will be able to see
different releases of GCC compiler ok so
we want to download install the latest
version so I will choose the last one
which is four point nine point one and I
have 64-bit operating system so I will
choose this one which says GCC minus
four point nine point one dash 64
dot exe we want to download executable
file so make sure it's exe file just
click this link and save this file and
this will be saved in some moments also
and the third option or third thing we
need is Eclipse IDE itself so search for
Eclipse download and the first link most
probably will come here from Eclipse dot
hua ji slash download just click this
link and in here there are a different
version of Eclipse available so there
are versions for Eclipse for developing
Java or developing PHP or other
programming language just but what we
are interested in is
this one Eclipse IDE for C and C++
developers right so we want to download
this and depending upon the type of your
windows if you have windows 64-bit click
this one or if you have windows 32-bit
click this one so I have windows 64-bit
so I am going to click this one windows
64-bit and now it will redirect you to
the nearest mirror to you so this is the
nearest mirror image of Eclipse IDE to
my location but it can be different from
your location also so just choose this
link and download eclipse on your system
I will save it so I have three downloads
on my PC one is the java jdk other is
the GCC compiler and third is the
eclipse ide itself ok so first of all we
will install java jdk i already have but
i'm going to show you how you can do it
you just need to run this jdk executable
file and so it will run this executable
file and once it will run this
executable file you will be able to
install this java on your system ok so
once this installation of java jdk is
complete on your system just need to
check whether it's really present on
your system or not so I'm going to
cancel this install because I already
have it but I will tell you what to do
next so it says this software is already
being installed on your computer so I
will say what do you like to reinstall
no but once you ins run this executable
file and Java is installed on your
system you need to go to your C folder
of your computer and in that go to
Program Files and in here in Program
Files you will be able to see this
folder called Java
and in here you will be able to see two
folders one is JDK 8 point something and
other one is JRE folder I had changed
the name of this folder earlier they
were something like Java J's but they
were like jdk 1.7 so I for simplicity I
changed these name - JDK 8 and JRE 8 JDK
installed stands for Java development
kit and JRE stands for Java runtime
environments so if they are present you
what you need to do is go to the JDK
folder which says JDK in its initials
and go to Ben folder in here all your
minor e and executable file will be
there so what you need to do is go to
your system so search for system and in
system you need to search environment
variable for Java so in here just go to
advanced settings and environment
variable and in path go to path and in
this path you need to paste this link
here so just copy this link and paste it
here after giving a semicolon similarly
you won't need to do it for this JRE
folder go to JRE
bin and in here just copy the spot and
give here a semicolon and paste this
link here ok so I have already done that
so I'm not going to do this because I
already have C program files Java JRE H
slash bin in here ok so this sets JRE
and JDK environment variables on your
system once you do have done with that
we are done installing Java on our
system ok the next thing we want to do
is we will install this GCC so just open
this GCC - for point whatever version
you have installed and just run the
the executable file on your system so
I'm going to run this on my system and
here comes the most important part of
this video which we I will show you in a
moment so in here you need to accept the
terms in condition and here you need to
give do the changes so by default this
will give you some location and this
location you need to change because
Eclipse search for its IDE its compiler
at certain location which is fixed so
just delete this and just write C colon
slash so just write something like this
C colon and then back slash and then
just write M I n G W and mingw with a
capital so in mingw
M G and W should be capital okay so
capital m and small I N and then G W
exactly the same path you need to choose
now click install and this GCC will be
installed on your system in some moments
and once it's done by the meantime it's
installing we are going to extract our
Eclipse IDE because it's a zip file
which you have downloaded so just open
this zip file and in here it will
contain one folder which is eclipse okay
so this Eclipse folder you can extract
to your C folder and in see folder you
can extract to Program Files otherwise
you can extract it off on your preferred
location but I will choose to extract
this on my C file so I will go to C and
C I will just extract it in my C polite
okay so I will click okay and this will
extract these clips file in okay so once
this Eclipse file will be extracted we
will be able to see this folder in my
seat for this Eclipse folder right and
this is the min GB folder which we have
installed on our system using this GCC
tool which is still running so I will
let them install and once this both
processes are complete then we I will
show you how you can run eclipse okay so
now GCC is installed in my system and
eclipse folder is also extracted so I
will see go inside my C folder and
inside my C folder I will find Eclipse
folder I will go inside my Eclipse
folder and you will be able to see this
icon called Eclipse so you can just
right-click it and you can pin it to the
start or pin it to the taskbar so I will
pin this to my taskbar so that I do need
to go to this location again and again
right now I can just click this icon and
Eclipse will start on my system so for
the first time whenever you starlet's it
la workspace and workspace is nothing
but the location where all your project
will be you know stored so this is the
default location it will choose to store
our programs which is C slash user slash
whatever your computer name is slash
workspace just I will leave them as
default this folder is default and click
OK and now eclipse will start on my
system now is going to start
so once this eclipse is started on my
spawn new system you will be able to see
this kind of ide so we have successfully
installed and run eclipse now once it's
done you can go to overview or what's
new more samples but we are interested
in you know making our first program for
example hello world program right so
what we are going to do here is we are
going to
open this perspective which is this one
just click the small C and C++ button
here and in here what you need to do is
now for the first time whenever you run
eclipse we need to do some settings so
just go to this windows tab here and in
here click preferences and in the
general category here just take this
general category triangle and in this
general category there will be more
categories we need to go to this
workspace category and in this workspace
category in the text file encoding by
default it's a Windows text file
encoding but most of the time when we
develop C and C++ programs are we want
to use utf-8 okay and in here other in
the new text file line delimiter also
you need to choose UNIX because UNIX is
the standard and using this you will be
able to use your source file on other
operating system including Windows or
Linux or other operating system okay
apply these changes and click OK once
again go to the windows r tab and click
preferences and in here you need to go
to this time c and c++ c / c c++ and in
here in new c / c++ project wizard you
need to choose this option which is
mingw okay because we have installed
mingw GCC choose this option and click
make to chain report okay so once you
have done that apply these changes and
click OK and now we are going to create
our first C++ program so go to this file
tab go to new and then click for example
we want to create C++ project click C++
project and give the name of
project for example test one is the
project name and I want to create hello
world project for me okay so I will
choose this and when GW is already our
preferred GCC compiler so you don't need
to choose this otherwise you can just
select this and click Next you can you
know give your author name this these
are optional steps but if you want to do
this it's okay click Next and click
finish and once you do this you will be
able to see Eclipse has generated a pram
for you which is this one which is the
hello world program okay so now the
hello world program is created
automatically for us what we need to do
is we just need to click this run or
this green button and if it says launch
fail binary not found because we haven't
compiled our program yet okay so you
need to build or compile your program
first in order to run it okay so in here
go to project and click build all okay
so go to project and build all or
otherwise there is a option here to
build all also you can choose this icon
or you can just choose build all okay so
it will build your program and once your
program is built it will generate a
binary so once this binary is generated
one when you click this Run button it
will run your program and it will say
hello world which is this message here
okay so we have successfully installed
Eclipse IDE on our system and we have
already created a
first Eclipse C++ project and we have
successfully able to run this project so
I hope you have enjoyed this video
