been showing you how to use your data
grid view to connect to the MySQL table
in a visual basic windows form
application so this is my table and I
have loaded this values but there is one
more thing you can do with this table
that is that if you want to change the
title column title of these columns
which is which should be different from
the dot the table values in here so
earlier what we were doing is we were
loading the table from the data data
table in the MySQL database in here so
it also it's also taking the names from
the MySQL database which is the names in
the column which is e ID name surname
and age which are these CIA name surname
and age but suppose you want to give the
different name to the column title
suppose you want to say that this column
is a employee ID column instead of a ID
column and this is column so suppose you
want to change this title instead of
name you want to change it to first-name
how can you do this I will show you in
this video ok so what you need to do is
in the video number 12 I have shown you
how to write this load table subroutine
or sub to load your data grid view with
the data base values right and if you
don't remember just watch that video
number 12 and in here we have written
the query for fetching the values from
the database MySQL database specifically
and in here we have written these column
titles so these are the column titles
which are printed in as a title of your
data
right so how can you change or how can
you show custom names instead of these
titles just you need to change the query
a little you just right select a ID
which is the name of my column which is
this one select e ID and just write as
and just right single quotes and in here
you can write the custom name you want
to give so i write employee ID same
thing I will do for name surname image
so name as and in the single quote I
would write first name surname and last
name and age as age okay in the
quotations right now when you run your
program and now when you see the column
titles they are customized according to
your text which you have written here
first name first name employee ID last
name and age so in this way you can
change the column title of your data
grid view according to yourself I hope
