last video I have shown you how to save
your data into your SQLite database
using WPF C shop application in this
video I will show you how to edit or
update data which is there in the
database and you want to edit it with
the help of your WPF c-sharp application
so first of all I will go to the tool
box and I will take a button from here
and I will name this button as in here
first of all I will name this button as
BTN update and I will change the content
of this button also so update now what I
will do is I will just double click this
update button and I reach to the code
for this update click event so in here
what I will do is I will once again go
to my code for this second form and I
will choose this Save button and I will
double click it and this is the code in
this save button click event I have
shown you in the last video so I will
copy all this code from the last video
if you don't know how to write the code
for saving your data this is what I have
shown in the last video so I am just
copying and once again going to my
second form and double clicking this
update button and in here I will paste
all the code which I have written for
the save data and in here I will not
change much this code I will just change
this query so I will delete all the
very and now I will write a new query so
double cloak code and bracket closed and
now here query you need to write what
so for updating your data you need to
write this queries write update and then
your table name so my table name in the
database is employee info I will copy my
table name from here and this is X
SQLite database by the way and I will
paste it here update table and then
write set then your first column name in
the database so what is your first
column name my column name is eid name
surname and age these are the values I
want to update or add it so one two
three four column I have which I want to
update so i will write first
this e is common place at E I D and is
equal to then write single quote inside
that cave double quote inside this plus
and write this dot your password text
box name so what is the name of my pass
not password but employee textbox name
so I select this employee ID textbox
name I copy the name of this employee
textbox from here and I will go to the
code and I will write this dot e ID text
dot text
okay now I will write gamma and once
again I will give single coat inside
double coat inside Perl plus plus and I
will copy this code here I just need to
change my Xbox name so ii is my name so
I will write name is equal to and then
this single quote double quote plus and
then side this this and I will copy the
name of my second textbox named just
copy it and replace it here in the same
way I will do the same for surname and
age write gamma surname is equal to
single quote double quote plus plus copy
this from here to here and I will just
copy the name of my surname text field
which is surname text and I paste it
here
one last more last time comma age is
equal to single quote inside double
quote so I plus plus write this and
then take the name of the age text field
and paste it here so your query is
basically update your table name set
your first column name and then whatever
value you want to set here that here
that you write and then comma your
second column name then the value from
the text box then the third column name
and the fourth column name then the
value from the text box
now this query only defines you want to
set your data somewhere but where you
want to set your data you will right now
so after this setting where you'd want
to say update your data you will write
where so for example you want to update
your data on the basis of Eid so just
copy this Eid code from here to the
single quote here before this comma just
copy this code and paste it after this
where so right where and where a ID is
equal to your text box so it will delete
your data where your employee ID is set
in the whatever employee ID is set in
your Eid text box which will update your
data in on the basis of that text box
and once you executed your query we want
to show the message instead of save I
want to show up dated ok now let's try
and run the program it if it works or
not
so now my program is running I will
login first username in ID password
username and password is correct
okay and it opens the second form here
let's see what data we want to add it so
I have this six employee from one to six
and I have these names from one to six
name surname and age so for example I
want to change this employee ID three
data okay so I will write here employee
ID three and I want to change the data
as I want to make this P capital in the
name and P capital in the surname also
so I will write here and capital P
and the age age also I want to change
for example 34 instead of this 23 and
then I click this Update button and your
message comes your data is updated but
here it will not show immediately you
need to refresh your database so just
click structure and once again go to
your table and now you can see your data
is saved whatever you have written here
your data is here now okay same thing
you can do for employee ID for also so I
want to make it bigger the first letter
of the name and first let go of the
sodium also bigger and the age is same
for example update data is updated i
refresh my table and you see here my
daughter is updated now so the name and
surname has now capital first letter and
age is 32 now so in this way you can
update your data using WPF c-sharp
application and your SQLite database so
