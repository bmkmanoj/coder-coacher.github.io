our app looks like this so for example I
have made two forms one form is for
login so I had username and password and
I login if the username is correct and
then it shows the second form and when I
exit this second form you see or you
have observed that the application is
not exited it's still running in a debug
mode and it's not exited fully so I need
to go to this debug tab and then I need
to stop debugging and then it comes to
the original state so in this video I
will show you how to gracefully exit
your c-sharp application so what you
need to do is just select your form the
whole form so you can click at the top
of your form and then go to the
properties here and click events this
one and click search for form closing
event this one okay and then select this
combo box and just press this or double
click this
and you will reach to the forum closing
event in the code section okay so here
you need to write one line code
application dot exit bracket and bracket
closed okay in the forum closing event
of your forum we just need to write
application dot exit bracket and bracket
closed and now when you run your program
login password username is correct and
when you now cancel your application for
example I will click this it comes to
the original state directly so the whole
application is exited by this code so in
this way you can gracefully exit from
your code by using this one line code so
I hope you have enjoyed this video in
the next video I will show you how to
show a message box that do you really
want to exit your application or not so
stay tuned for the next video please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
