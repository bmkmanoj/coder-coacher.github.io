last video I have shown you how to open
a new jframe by selecting any index of
your jcombobox but sometimes you require
to open or do your actions on the basis
of the means which are there in the
combo box and not on the index because
and there can be many index and you
cannot define a new thing for any new
index based on the name sometimes you
want like when you click John then only
open the new jframe regardless of its
index so how to do that I'm going to
show you today go to your source code
and in the last video you remember I
think that I made a combo select method
you don't have to do much here just
delete your declaration you have done
for your condition and just go to design
copy your variable name of your combo
box
go to source and right here paste in the
condition so if your combo box variable
name dot get selected item
if combo-box variable name dot cat
selected item is equal to sorry keyboard
so this is equal to think one brand
packet of music okay is equal to
something so if combobox not get
selected item is equal to what your name
you which you have already defined for
example we want to open something on the
basis of this when you click Mary the
new window should open so just copy your
string you have to copy exactly the same
name here so just do that and for
example you want to open your second
jframe on the basis of other name so I
copy and just paste it here and this
time on the basis of some other name
which is not for example we have not
defined it here in the properties I want
to open on the basis of Mac if your name
is Mac then here this name when you
click this name then and login on new
jframe should open so I will write here
Mack hope I spelled correct so just you
have to replace the if condition and
right here
the name exact name now let's undo
Graham if it's wrong
followed let's see I want to open my
tape from all the message of this
psychic Mary and if you knew J playing
opens and when I click Mac the new
jframe should open I'll take my spelling
as strong here let's see
so my spelling is not wrong but this
these value I am representing from the
database there well not can be converted
into strings because we are fetching
these value from the database these
first four names we have defined in our
combo box model so only these four names
will open a new JM so I will copy Julia
pasted at the place of true here so
this also you have to remember and I'm
gonna run the program
when you open when you click Maddie new
window opens so this is the tutorial on
how to open a new jframe on the basis of
names I hope you learned something and
please rate comment and subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
