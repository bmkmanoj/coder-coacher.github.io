last video we have seen how to configure
and set up your first JSF web
application and we have made our new
first web application and we ran the
program and it was successful in this
video I will go further and I will show
you how to navigate to the other pages
from one page to other page with the
help of your JSF application so what you
need to do is you have this when you
open your web application you have this
web page and inside this web page you
have this index dot ash XHTML which is
the main HTML XHTML file now it also has
this web dot INF which contains web dot
XML so what you need to do is go here
and right click and go to new and click
JSF pages ok and if you do not find the
JSF pages here you will be able to find
in the JavaServer faces here and go to
JSF pages click next give the name to
the JSF page I will name it as second
page so second and then I will click
finish and if you can see here the other
page second dot HTML comes here so in
here in the title if you know little bit
of X
HTML this is the title so you can change
this title also so second page and you
can change this message also in the
second page so you can show welcome to
the second page it's just an example so
that's why I am writing simple text now
go to your index dot XHTML and we want
to call this second page from this first
page by clicking a button so for example
this is our home page home and in here I
will right click button to go to second
page okay and next here this is the body
and in here in JSF everything start
every tag starts with dot H so I will
show you here right inside this body
itself right one more thing H we are
going to take a button so take this as
dot command button and then we will give
value to it so value is the name which
will appear on the button so I will name
it
open second page for example and then
you can give the action here so this
action defines some action which this
button click will perform so we want to
go to the next page which is our second
page so just go here and copy the name
of this second page so just the name of
this page is second so right here second
okay and just close this with the
closing button come on okay and one good
thing in Java or NetBeans IDE that it
completes your code automatically so if
you have started this command button it
will ask for the completion so you need
to add this completion code here so this
command button code look like this okay
so what this will do is I will run the
program and then see what it does so run
the program and in here you can see it's
showing click button to go to second
page and when I click open second page
this button
nothing happens let's see why okay so
let's go to the index - XHTML and I
think here
I must have declared the H :
form yes because it's a formed and
inside the form we need to call our
pages so like this and now when you run
the program it's running here and now
when you click this open second page it
opens the second page see here and it
can go back and goes to the second page
so now it's working so the mistake what
which I have done was I haven't added
this so just add this and make sure this
name is same as your XHTML file name
here so one thing if you can notice here
that you are on first page notice this
URL it changes to index dot HTML but
this page is our second dot XHTML not
index dot XHTML so for defining or for
changing this URL according to the
navigation we need to change the rules
in the navigation so come back here so
once again we will go to our project
this web page and go here click this web
dot INF file and right click it once
again we will add new
and we will go to others and once again
we will go to the JavaServer faces and
this time we will choose this JSF face
configuration okay and click Next and
you can give the name to this
configuration file I will leave this
name as default because it's our first
application so and I will click this
finish and if you notice here in
configuration file it creates this faces
dot configure it config dot HTML and
this is our file it looks like this and
inside this faces dot config file I will
define the new navigation rule for going
from for one page to other page so right
here faces
sorry we will write first navigation
rules so navigation rule and once again
navigation rune close and inside this
navigation rule we will define from UID
so this first of all we will close this
and inside this from view ID tag we will
write our mean X HTML file so this is
index dot XHTML so index dot X HTML and
so this is from which form you want to
go and next we will define to which form
we are going so to which form we want to
go so here define navigation case and
and just close it and inside this
navigation case we will define two and
close this to ID so this is from and
where we are going we are going to the
second form so right / 2nd dot X HTML
okay there is one more thing you can
define here just above this to view ID
right
from outcome and first of all close it
and in here we will write the tag or the
value so right here for example open and
whatever you write here I notice that
this slash is not required in all so we
are going from here here we require the
slash and here we don't require this
slash so in this from outcome tag we
have passed this open value so just copy
this open and once again go to your
index dot h x HTML and in here we have
defined this command button action and
instead of this action we will paste the
open value from this phase phase slash
configuration file spacious -
configuration file so this value is this
open just copy this value go to index
and in the action just paste it as it is
okay so after doing that just come back
to the phases - config dot s XHTML file
which we have created so this code we
have written there is one more thing
here you need to add is the redirect tag
so right here redirect and give it slash
yeah so what this tag will do is it will
redirect your file from index dot XHTML
when it sees this action value to the
second dot XHTML
so let's see if our code works or not so
run program and it opens this web page
and notice here it should give the URL
to second dot H XHTML right so click
this and this time this is correct
second dot H XHTML so this also depend
upon you what do you want you want to
change the URL or you don't want to
change the URL so this is for
redirecting your URL so just create
confesses config dot XML file and in
here inside this face config file just
pass this so it's going from index to
second XHTML file when it sees this
value and just pass the same value in
the action here okay so in this way you
can use this webpage for navigating from
one page to another page so I think
that's it for this video in the next
video I will show you some more code
about JSF so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
