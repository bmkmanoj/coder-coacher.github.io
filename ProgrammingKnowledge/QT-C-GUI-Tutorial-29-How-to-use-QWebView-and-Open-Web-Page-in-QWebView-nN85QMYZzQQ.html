video I will show you how to use q
webview with your QT GUI C++ application
q webview we use it for opening webpages
inside your GUI application so when you
see in this widget box or or toolbox you
will be able to see Q webview here and
just drag and drop into your form and I
will dock it to all the side just click
this button after selecting this window
so it will dock it to your window now in
order to use all the libraries from web
view you need to add some library to
your project so just go to your project
dot Pierrot file wherever is your
project dot PR o file this is your
project file you will be able to see
here QT plus equal to core and GUI are
already added added and you need to add
one more library called web kit widgets
right to add this web kit widget in
order to access all the libraries for Q
web views okay and one more thing is you
will add this web kit widgets when you
have the version of QT more than four so
just go to your help and make sure by
going to this about Qt creator that you
have this cutie in the latest version
which is more than five point something
if it's lesser than 5.0 then you need to
use other libraries here because QT has
upgraded their libraries after the
version 5.0
okay so this is after 5.0 version
library I will also show you how to use
it if you have lesser than a 5.0 version
but first of all this for 5.1 for
example so just added this WebKit widget
to your project file and then I will go
to my main window and I will go to the
constructor of my main window which is
here and after this UI pointer set up
this which will open your window just go
here and we are first of all let's
include the webview library so just
write include and then write Q web kit
widgets and in here right
q web view okay so now you have included
this webview library to your CPP file
but more library you will need here is Q
URL so just include QR URL in your CPP
file or you can add it in your header
file also q URL and now just go below
this code where you have UI this arrow
pointer set UI and I will go here and I
will just write UI and then I will call
my web view from here which is web view
the name of my web view and then I will
say load
and inside I will call the URL so I will
write Q u RL and in here I will give any
URL which I want to open inside this
webview so I will write here HTTP colon
slash slash www.google.com for example
okay so I want to open this website
inside my QT webview now I will just
build my project and run it so I will
run my project save all the files and
hopefully there would be no error and
it's building and now you can see
google.com is open inside your web view
right so in this way you can add more
website and you can add more
functionality to your webview you can
resize this webview and many things you
can do with this widget and now I will
show you if you have lesser than 4.0
version of QT which I'm talking about so
just go here and see if it's something
like four point something then what you
need to do is just go to your web view
dot profile and instead of this web kit
widgets you need to add only this web
kit instead of WebKit widgets and just
remove this line from your CPP file so
you just need to include web view with
only Q webview so these are the changes
you need to do if you have lesser than
45.0 version of QT
and it will run fine so I hope you have
learned how to open website inside your
Q web view and I hope you have enjoyed
