bootstrap tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how we can
create a navbar using bootstrap now in
this video we will see how we can create
a footer using bootstrap so for example
you want a footer in which you want to
write your copyright message or
something else how we can do it let's
see so I will start with the code which
I have written in the last video this
was the code I have written the last
video and just below this code I will
add the code for footer okay so what
first of all I need is this div element
and in here I need to add a same class
which we have added for the navigation
bar on the top okay so I will copy this
class from here and paste it here and
this class is navbar navbar - default
navbar
- fix - top but because it's our fixed
footer we want to make this top as
bottom so it will be fixed at the bottom
of your webpage
okay so button okay and let's see
instead of default we want this time
inverse so let's save our page and let's
see how our footer looks like so I will
refresh the page and now we can see this
footer here in the black right now as we
know we need to add once again this div
element and this time we will add the
class called container container because
as I have told you you in order to align
your text inside your navbar
you need this container and now suppose
we want to add a paragraph here so just
add
paragraph tag and in here you can write
your copyright message for example copy
copyright and your website name for
example programming knowledge okay and
for example you want to write the here
and just save it and then refresh your
page and you will be able to see this
black message here but it's not fully
aligned right so for that what we are
going to do is we will add one more div
element here so div and we will add a
class called nav bar text pull left okay
and I'm going to close this div and
close it from the bottom here and then I
will save it and I will refresh my web
page and now I can see my copyright
message clear at the center right so in
this way you can add a footer to your
web page using bootstrap I hope you have
