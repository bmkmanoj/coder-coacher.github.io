last video I have shown you how you can
create your first MySQL database using
PHP myadmin now in this video we are
going to see how we can connect to this
MySQL database using our PHP script so
let's get started I have this blank file
so I will save this file first and I
will save it as so in here I'm going to
create one more we'll first of all go
back create a folder and our database ok
and in this database I'm going to create
a file called connect dot PHP so this
will be a file which we are going to use
to connect to our MySQL database and
then we can include or require this file
in other files so that we have the
connection with the database right so in
order to connect to the database you
need three parameters first is server
name or MySQL host name first of all
second is username which is MySQL
username and third is MySQL password so
when you go to your PHP myadmin here and
click this icon PHP my admin' and you
will be able to see this users tab here
and in here you will be able to see the
privileges so we are going to connect to
the user called root and the host is
localhost right now and the password is
the same password you have said when you
have installed this zamp tool right
so our whole user is route and host is
local host right so we go to our PHP
file and in here we are going to declare
my SQL underscore and this will be our
host okay and this will be equal to
localhost okay you can change this to
the IP address of your server or you can
change it to 127.0.0.1 it's the same as
localhost okay
now second thing I will define a as my
SQL and this will be our for example
user and user is in our case user is
root right in here when you see here so
it's root and once again we will define
a variable called my SQL underscore
password okay and this will be whatever
password you have set so I set a
password when I have installed MySQL
that was rude but whatever was your
password when you have installed samp
and when you said MySQL in my in the
security you have said some password
right so the same password you need to
give here in MySQL securities now we are
going to connect to the database so what
we can do here is we can use an inbuilt
function called my SQL underscore
connect okay
this will be the function and in here we
need to pass
three parameter first is the host name
second is the user name and third is the
password so the first argument will be
the host name comma second argument will
be the user name and the third argument
will be the password okay
so if everything goes well we can echo
success for example or we can echo
connection success not here but here
okay I will save it and I will open my
localhost and I will search for
localhost here and here I have database
folder and in here I have connection dot
PHP right I will open it and it will say
connection success that means I am
connected to the database right now for
example you provide some wrong
information for example this username
instead of this user you can provide
some random random user okay save it and
once again run it and you will be able
to see this error it's saying that
access denied for this user because it's
not registered right so you need to give
the same username as here and same host
as here and the password you have set
okay otherwise it will give an error but
if you can see if you see here this is a
kind of error or warning it's giving and
for example you want to define your
custom error how you can define a custom
error you can just i will revert this
changes and i will say after this my
skill function i can say or die and what
this all died
do is it will kill your page after if it
throws an error so when your MySQL
connection is not ok it will kill your
page and this die also takes up argument
and this argument you can provide some
message so this can message can be can
not connect to database ok and then I
will save it and let's provide some
random username to check whether it
throws this error or not so once again I
will refresh it and you can see here
cannot connect to database it chose this
error when the user when MySQL
connection is not ok but still you are
seeing this error right this warning
kind of a thing to remove this warning
you can just add ah add the rate symbol
before your function ok so this kind of
at the rate symbol when you include will
remove your warnings and you will be
able to see only the error you want to
show ok so once this is done what we can
do is we can once this is the connection
to the server but we need to select our
database from this server my SQL server
right so we have some some databases in
this MySQL so right and in the last
video we have created this student
database right so I will select this
then this was the student database and
when I go to this table here I created
this table user info inside my student
database and it has some data right so
what I can do is I can connect to the
same database called student
from this by using a function and I will
use at the rate to remove warnings if it
gives and I will say my SQL underscore
select DB okay and here you can give the
name of your database okay so my
database name is student here you can
see my database name is student you can
give your own database name student okay
so once you are connected to the server
you can connect to the database and then
you are ready to query the database
right but this is kind of you know lose
approach to connect to the database
because once this throws an error there
is no meaning of calling this function
right so what we can do here is we can
just select our if condition so we can
write if and in the bracket first of all
I will do this and in the bracket what I
can do is I can pass this function
because this function returns a boolean
value and boolean what is boolean value
it can either return true or false okay
and from F condition we compare if it
returns true and if the function returns
true we can perform the statement inside
this F condition so I will just copy
this function here it returns true and I
will also use this at the rate symbol so
if it returns true or I can say if it is
not connected I will show an error some
kind of an error so if it returns false
I can say that this
message I can die and I can just give
this message okay so you can just give
this message and you die die means kill
the page okay the same you can do it
with the function called exit exit and
die are same okay so you can either use
die or exit both words like saying it
will kill your page okay so if I'm not
connected to server I will die as else I
can show this message which is
connection success okay but still if I
connect it to the server I need to
connect to the database right so I can
give one more condition here if I am
connected to the student database or
here and this is for example I take if
not connected so I will give this not
connected symbol I can say that now I
will die okay else I will do nothing
okay so I'm checking whether I am
connected to the server and I don't need
these lines now so I will remove this so
this is my code if I'm not connected to
the server then I can say connection
success or or if I'm not connected to
the server I can throw this message
which is connection or connection cannot
connect the database right or if I'm not
connected to the database I can throw
this message right or I am doing it
little bit wrong yes
so this should be here
in the ABS condition because here I am
checking if I'm connected to the
database and if I am not connected I
will throw an error and if I am
connected I am go to the else condition
and I will check one more condition
which is if I am connected to the
student database right and then if I am
connected to the student database then I
will I will show this message connection
successful this should be connections
why we are not checking false but for
the true if connection then we can say
connection successful else we can say
cannot connect to the database right
okay I will make it a little bit smaller
so that you can see all the code and
let's check this once again go to the
browser check it and say cannot connect
to the database why let's see because
our username is root one which is not
the real user or real user user is root
right if you can see here in the
privileges or user we have user is equal
to root localhost and the password so
save this and once again i refresh this
and now it says connection success okay
so in this way you can connect to the
MySQL database using your PHP script
right now in the next video I am going
to show you how you can query your
database to get the database values so
for example I want to get those values
which are there in the database table
called the this table we have created
user info table right and we have some
data in that table so I want to patch
that data from the database in my PHP
form so how can I do this I'll show you
in the next
videos stay tuned and please rate
