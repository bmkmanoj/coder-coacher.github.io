you how you can download and install
SQLite database on your Windows 10
operating system so what is SQLite
SQLite is an open source embedded
database by embedded I mean it doesn't
require any server in order to
communicate with that database you can
directly install or you can directly
create your database on your filesystem
of your computer and then directly
communicate with it directly without the
need of any server right so it's easy to
transfer this database from one computer
to another computer by just copying and
pasting it into your USB Drive and then
transfer or by any other means the best
use case I can give you for the SQLite
database is for example many Android
applications are using SQLite to store
the data locally on your Android device
and then fetch that data whenever
required by that application so let's
see how we can download it so first of
all open your favorite browser and
search for SQLite and the first link
which will appear here will be from
SQLite dot o-r-g so we are going to
click on that link and once you are
inside that website you will be able to
see the Downloads button on the front
page so just search for the download
button in this case here it is so I'm
going to just click on this Downloads
button and on the downloads page what
I'm going to do is I'm going to just
scroll down a little where I can see
precompiled binaries for Windows and
here I'm going to choose the last option
which says SQLite tools - windows 32 -
x86 which is a zip file ok so I'm going
to download this zip file and once the
zip file is downloaded I'm going to just
go to the folder where I have downloaded
this file and I'm going to minimize my
browser
and now I'm going to extract this zip
file you can use anything to extract it
so I'm going to use 7-zip for this
and once you have extracted this zip
file you will be able to see this kind
of fold up it says SQLite tools when 32
right and when you go inside this folder
you will be able to see three executable
file and the most important executable
file for us is this one which says
SQLite 3 so first of all what I will do
is I will just copy this folder or let
me cut this folder from here and then
I'm going to paste it into my C direct
so I'm going to go to my C directory and
then I'm going to paste this folder here
and then I'm going to just rename it to
SQLite 3 ok so I'm going to just rename
this file as SQLite 3 now the next thing
we need to do is we need to set the
environment variables for SQLite so that
whenever we run the SQLite 3 command
it's recognized by our command line from
any folder so for that what I need to do
is I will just go inside this SQLite 3
folder which I have created inside the C
directory and then I'm going to just
copy this path up to the folder ok so
just copy this path and then next I can
just right click on my Windows icon here
and then I'm going to just click on
system and once the system window opens
I'm going to go to the advanced system
settings and then I'm going to go to
environment variables and then I'm going
to go to path in system variable and
then I'm going to say add it to add it
this path now in order to add this
variable I'm going to just click on new
and then just paste the part of the
SQLite folder here now once you do this
you just need to click OK ok and then
you can just click OK here and then
close this system window now in order to
test your SQL I
you just need to open your command
prompt so to open the command prompt you
can just right click on this window icon
and then open the command prompt from
here you can see command prompt admin so
I'm going to open this command prompt
from here and then once the command
prompt is open I can just test it by
giving sqlite3 command ok so just give
XK like 3 c'mon and you can see it gives
us the version of SQLite
we have downloaded so we have downloaded
and installed the three-point-two 2.0
version of SQLite right now how you can
create a database or how you can exit
out of this database so let me show you
how you can exit out of this database so
to exit you just need to just write dot
quit ok so just write code dot quit and
you will come out of this SQLite shell
okay now in order to create a database
because the SQLite database is created
locally in the file system so for that
you just need to just CD to the
directory in which you want to create
your SQLite database so let's say I want
to create this SQLite database on my
desktop so what we are going to do is we
are going to create a database folder on
our desktop let's say so I'm going to
create a new folder and I'm going to
name it as DB folder and once you have
created your DB folder I'm going to just
open this DB folder and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to just copy this
path up to DB and I'm going to CD in
this folder so CD and then just paste
apart and then press Enter
so you will be inside this folder using
your command line now in order to create
a database you just need to give this
command which is a scan
id3 and then your database name so for
example my database name i want to give
is my DB dot DB dot DB is the extension
you can also give dot SQLite extension
also and then press ENTER which is going
to create or your database but you will
not see directly the database created in
your database directory which you have
created now in order to view this
database which you have created you can
give two commands one is you can either
give for example dot databases come on
which is going to list out all the
databases and in turn it's going to just
create this a my DB file inside your
folder in which you are working in so
right now you can see one database is
listed now which is inside my DB folder
which is the folder I'm currently in
right and you can also see this my DB
file here you can either do this or you
can create a table in order to create
this database and view this database
inside your folder so for example I can
create a table inside my database using
Create table command so create table and
then the table name for example students
table and then you can give your column
names inside your database so for
example I want to just give one column
which is ID the name of the column is ID
the data type of this column is let's
say int and let's say it's a primary key
of my table so I can just crave power
primary key option here so just give
primary key and because SQLite is case
independent so you can write this
primary key or this ID in capital
letters also or in small letters or
so and don't forget to give the
semicolon in order to execute your
query ok so just add the semicolon and
then press ENTER and this table will be
created inside your database now how you
can list those tables so for listing out
all the tables inside the database you
can just write dot tables and then press
ENTER and you can see a student table is
there now in order to see the schema of
this table you can just write dot schema
and then whatever table schema you want
to see so for example I want to see the
student table schema and then press
ENTER and you can see the schema which
we have created with this table right so
in this way you can download and install
SQLite on your Windows 10 operating
system I hope you enjoyed this video
