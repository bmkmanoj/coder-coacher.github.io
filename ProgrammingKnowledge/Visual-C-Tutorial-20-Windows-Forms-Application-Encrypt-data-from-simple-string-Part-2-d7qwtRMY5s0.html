anything I'm providing one two three
four five six seven eight nine a b c d e
f I think these are 16 10 11 13 14 15
these are 15 and 0
okay so 16 okay
you can provide your own 16 bit key so
you don't have to specifically define
this and just go below and here you will
declare our object which we have
declared here so just go up I will show
you what we have declared
yes this object just copy des object
from here which we have previously
declared and then come to our code and
paste it here and then right arrow key
is equal to name key which is this one
okay
this key we're taking it here so define
this and then once again take this
object placed it below and this time we
will give a mode to it is equal to so
for more the my code I am taking CBC
mode for this also you need to learn the
theory of cryptography this is a one
mode you can take the other mode I will
show you so you can take CBC mode c FB
cts ECB and ofb mode each one have their
special qualities so just read about
them and choose your best mode and then
go below and once again copy this object
to paste it here and this time we will
define the padding
so padding is a question I think if
Schiffer if your text is 64 bits and
your Shiva is little bit smaller it will
generate some random shippo's so that's
padding padding mode double quote I will
take pkcs7 mode sorry seven again you
can choose your padding mode according
to your requirement and then we will
declare our string of Shiva
so the right here
when we stream this cap symbol and give
it a variable name for example ms g c
new new memory string so like this and
break it and break it first okay and
then we all crypto screen stream so
right crypto stream cap CS name it as CS
g c new once again this crypto cs and
make it break it closed in this we will
pass three parameters post this memory
screen
so right here one memristors memory
stream and then copy this object from
you paste it here and then right
Krypto the
detector ,
to stream mode let me go that way okay
right okay so write this and then once
again in here you will write crypto
bytes which I have declared above I will
show you once again chapter bytes this
variable I will take it from here and
then I paste it here once again and
write is equal to M s which is this one
I'll go to
are we toast and then in the right
ms-dos so this will close our memory
stream and then we need to show this
Shiva bite into a text box so I will
just once again go to my form I will
take the name of my second text box
which is decrypt text and I will go to
my code here and I will paste it here
and then write the PowerPoint text
is equal to encoding w : t
we're going to
get string like I don't make it close
and in here we will pass a shiva bite so
this Shiva bite will convert into spring
and will go in to decrypt box so I think
we are done with the encryption part
let's try and run our program and see
whether it works or not
there is some error so let's see what is
it so as always I have this padding mode
spelled wrong
and my second error was to decrypt are
spelled wrong so instead of this crypto
Decrypter began encrypting our text so
create encryption here crypto stream CS
GC new crypto stream M s comma DES
object crypto and crypto earlier I have
written Decrypter but it's for
description so I must write encryptor
here and let's try and run the program
what's a gamer I have corrected this
reading mode spelling and this instead
of in crypto create Decrypter we write
create encrypted so let's try on the
program once again and it's running
user name and password
it's correct and we have this form so
first in the first box I will write the
simple text which is hello hello world
and when I press this entry button it
should give me a shiver dot of it is in
encrypted form so let's try it
i press this and it gives me nothing so
let's see why this does that so when I
checked my code I missed two lines in
this code just go to your crypto stream
line and just go below that and copy
your crypto stream variable paste it
here provide arrow pointer and then by
right bracket and break it close and
take care of this plane by its variable
which you are declared in the second
line and paste it here and second
variable we will pass is zero and third
variable is your plane by its length so
pop it this once again and open
the length okay and once again next line
we will just close this CS copy this
copy this and paste it so I forgot to
write these two lines and now let's try
and run our program once again I hope
this time it will run okay to to
password is correct okay and here on
right my simple text hello it is spelled
wrong
hello word and here when I press this
entry button it will provide me my
encrypted form so I will press this and
yes it's providing me encrypted form
which is not recognized by any stranger
so in this way you can encrypt your data
and in the next video I will show you
how to treat ripped your doctor once
again so please stay tuned and please
wait coming to subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
