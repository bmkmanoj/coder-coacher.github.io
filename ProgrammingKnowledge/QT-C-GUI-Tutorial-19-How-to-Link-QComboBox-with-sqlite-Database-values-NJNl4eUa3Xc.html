last video I have shown you how to load
your SQLite database table in our list
box so you have some data in the SQLite
table for example I have to show name
column whatever names are there in the
name column I wanted to show you in a
list box so how can I do it in I have
shown you in the last video in this
video I will show you how to link your
database column with a combo box so for
that I will use a combo box which is
there in the input widgets and I will
place it here for example and I will
resize it and for loading the data in
the database for example I wanted to
load the list of name in this combo box
also in the last video I also shown you
how to load the list of names which is
there in the database in this list and
at the same time I wanted to load the
names in this condo box also so how can
I do it in in the last video I have
taken this button to load the list so I
will use the same button and I will
right click it go to slot clicked and
click OK and this was the code I have
shown you in the last video in this
video for loading your column data in
the combo box what you need to do is
just after your model query after
loading your query in the model just
copy this line where I was loading my
model in the ListView and I will paste
it once again below and instead of list
box I will change it here to
the combobox so it's as simple as that
now you have your this column select
whatever you select here will be loaded
in your list box also at the same time
it will be loaded in the combo box also
so for example I will load the list of
all names which is there in the database
and let's see how it works so save all
build and it's building and user name
and password once again and when I click
load it loads the data in the list box
also and the same data you can see it in
the combo box also so you can use combo
box or list box according to your
requirements so I just wanted to show
you how easily this can be done and I
hope you have learned something new this
time please keep watching these videos
and please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
