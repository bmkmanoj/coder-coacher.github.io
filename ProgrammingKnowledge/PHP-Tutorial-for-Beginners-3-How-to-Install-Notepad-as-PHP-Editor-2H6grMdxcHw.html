tutorial on PHP programming for
beginners and in this video I'm going to
show you how to install notepad plus
plus for writing and editing your PHP
programs on your Windows operating
system so notepad plus plus is a simple
text editor but it's good in a way that
it highlights your text okay so whenever
you are writing PHP or C++ or any other
program using notepad plus plus it will
highlight your text and then it will be
easier to read the code what you have
written in PHP or any other language
which notepad plus plus supports so
let's see how we can install notepad
plus plus it's really easy just search
for node pad plus plus and the first
link you will find here is notepad minus
plus minus plus dot o-r-g and in here
you need to go to download tab and
notepad plus plus a is only available
for windows so this is this notepad plus
plus you can only install on windows
otherwise if you want to install it on
ubuntu or any other linux operating
system you need to use vine for that but
that's the another story I will just
download this installer for now
and once this executable file is
downloaded I will start installing this
notepad plus plus on my computer there
are other text editor which you can use
if you want to write your code or you
want an editor which is a cross-platform
for example Eclipse you can use it on
Windows Mac OS or on your Linux
operating system there is one more IDE
called the
netbeans which you can use to write your
code on Linux or Windows and Mac OS you
can program PHP using that NetBeans or
Eclipse IDE also but for now we are
going to is plus for our tutorial series
I have started the Installer and by
default I will select the English as my
language I will click OK next I agree
this is the default location where it
will be installed next next and if you
want to create a shortcut you can just
click this option or otherwise uncheck
it if you don't want a shortcut on the
desktop and install and it will take few
seconds to install this notepad plus
plus it's a very lightweight
installation but it's really powerful
and just leave this checkbox checked so
notepad plus plus will be launched
immediately whenever you want to
whenever you close finish so in here we
can write our code and why I am
stressing on notepad plus plus is
because for example I have a notepad
also notepad in my Windows operating
system and it will also work fine but
there's one major difference in here in
notepad plus plus programming or using
notepad plus plus editor and this this
only node bad editor which is whenever
you write your code in your notepad plus
plus you will be able to see the syntax
highlighting so I have written some code
first of all I need to save this file as
a PHP file so I will right click it and
I will say save as and I will make one
I will make one folder in here which I
will call it as tutorial and in this
tutorial I'm going to give the name of
this PHP file which is for example test
dot PHP and click Save and now you can
see the syntax highlighting it's red and
for example I want to echo something
don't worry about this code we are going
to see in detail how to use this code so
don't worry about this I am just I just
want to show this syntax highlighting
one off so in here you can just print
hello world and let me go okay so you
see this starting tag and ending tag
start with red in color markings this
echo is blue color this hello world has
other color and this semicolon has other
color and whenever you want to write the
same code using notepad plus plus I want
to save as for example somewhere in the
same place where I have given this test
to dot PHP and when I save this it will
not highlight your syntax okay so it's
just a plain editor but you can use this
plain editor there is no constraint that
you have to use notepad plus plus you
can use it but the only problem is the
syntax highlighting this makes your code
really easy to read and maintain and
this you will always see it has a black
script or code so you cannot find the
these keywords easily in using this
notepad so in this way you can download
and install notepad plus plus for
editing and writing your PHP programs
from the next video I'm going to show
you how to write your first PHP program
in your Windows operating system I hope
