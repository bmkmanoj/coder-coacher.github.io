show you how to use functions in C++ so
first of all why do we really use
functions of what is the need of
function in C++ so function is a block
of code which executes some something
for example so ideally a function should
perform a specific task which is
assigned to it
and normally when you write your code
it's made of too many numbers of line
for example thousands and thousands of
line and when you when the other user
tried to read your program it becomes
really overwhelming to understand the
program written by other person and the
function is used to reduce the size of
the code so that it makes your code or
your program understandable so what is
the convention generally is whatever
value of whatever code is with repeating
more than once in your program just wrap
it in the function so whatever code or
whatever piece of code is happening or
you need again and again wrap it in the
function now let's see how we can
declare a function so I already told you
in the first two videos that this main
is also a function right but this is a
main function and we can define
user-defined function so what we need to
do is you can either go just above this
main function and declare your function
here so what you can do is you can give
a function definition so when you define
a function you need to give first of all
the return
type so for example right now I am not
returning anything so I give void void
means are not returning anything okay so
every function whatever you make it
returns anything like this main it's
returning zero which is an int that's
why I have written in India so right now
I'm making a function which which is
returning nothing and then comes the
name of the function so for example I
say my first function and then comes
these two parentheses and then whatever
code you want to write that comes in
these two curly braces okay so this is
the basic declaration of function a
return type which is void right now so
that we are not returning anything the
name of the function curly braces and
these not this curly braces but these
are the parentheses and these are the
curly braces okay and whatever you write
in side this function it will be
executed when you use this function
inside your main function so for example
I want to print something
so I will write we are in a function
okay and I will end the line okay so how
you can call this function inside your
main what you need to do is just copy
your function like this you don't need
to copy the return type just copy the
function and paste it wherever you need
to use your function inside main so I
will paste it here
and I will close it by the semicolon
okay so this is how you can call
function inside your main let me build
the program and let me run it and you
can see it's showing we are in a
function and this line is in written in
the function right and we are calling
this function here so main program just
goes here and it sees that the the
function here so it goes to the function
and it sees this is the code which I
need to execute in the function it
prints this and then goes to this line
point so basically I uh I told you that
whenever you need to execute similar
kind of code again and again you can use
function right so for example I can use
this function multiple times for example
four times then my message will be
printed four times and I don't need to
write the food again and again right
this is one line you can add multiple
line in this function and you just need
to call your function and these line
will be executed whenever you call a
function I will build my program and run
it and you can see it's executed four
times so this is the good thing about
function whatever is repeating just wrap
it in a function and use it
now this is one kind of declaration of
function or use as your function but
there is other kind of declaration
function definition like to use on you
give Rob the function definition below
this main function okay and then when I
compile or build my program it will give
me the error why'd we give me the error
because your program executes from top
to bottom so your program start from
here it sees a that this line so it has
to add or program things that it needs
to add this and it needs to add this
line and then it goes to main and it
sees this but when it executes top to
bottom it doesn't know that there is a
function declared below it so you need
to either declare a function on topic of
your main or otherwise what you need to
do is you need to prototype your
function okay if you want to use this
function below main what you can do is
you can just copy all your function from
void to these parenthesis just copy this
and just paste it above and give
semicolon and this type of declaration
is called the prototyping of a function
so now when the program executes and
compilation is done it knows that right
now this is included this should be
included this namespace should be
included and then it sees okay this
function is prototyped here so i need to
include the declaration of the function
which is here then it comes when it
comes here it knows that there is a
function which I know that it's I need
to execute it so
is why this will be executed so let's
compile it and this time I don't have
any error okay so in technical terms
this is called the true prototyping of
the function you just declare or the
function here and the definition of the
function you can give below this ok and
I run the program advance perfectly so
in this way you can use functions and
this is the big basic of function there
are other type of function which takes
parameter which returns parameter and
these type of function I will cover in
the later videos so keep watching and
