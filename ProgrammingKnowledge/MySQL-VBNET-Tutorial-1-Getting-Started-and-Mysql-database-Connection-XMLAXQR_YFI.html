starting a new video series on using
MySQL database with your visual basic
windows form application so if you don't
know how to install Visual Studio in
your Windows System just go to your
search engine and just type Visual
Studio Express Visual Studio Express is
a free edition for Visual Studio and you
will be able to use it for making your
Visual Basic project now for
understanding and if you don't know how
to install and use MySQL database I have
made these videos in a playlist earlier
by the name of MySQL tutorial for
beginners so in the first few video you
will be able to understand how you can
install a MySQL database and how you can
create queries and how to handle other
clauses and queries now for using Visual
Basic with MySQL you need to install
MySQL with some specification so if you
see this first video which is beginner
MySQL database tutorial one in this
video at the point exactly at 5 minute
38 seconds I have shown you this
installation and in this at this point
at the minute 5.38 this check
requirement steps comes when you install
a MySQL database and in here you need to
see whether your mysql installer is
giving these options basically you need
to check
options in order to enable drivers for
visual studio and MySQL so just check
all the Microsoft related options in
this check requirement when you are
installing MySQL database okay now if
you if you have done that already
let's start a new project and let's see
how you can connect Visual Basic with
your windows we have a MySQL database I
beg your pardon
so just go to just fire up your Visual
Studio and go to this file menu here and
just select new project and it will open
this new project wizard you need to just
select Visual Basic from here and just
select windows form application we are
going to make our application using this
windows app form application now you can
give your project name I am giving my
project name is as d-v DB project 1 for
example and I will click OK and if you
want to save your project at some
specified location just click this
browse button and just select the folder
in which you want to save this project
ok and just click OK this will create a
simple visual basic project for you
which is a blank form and now first we
need to connect MySQL database with your
Visual Basic so what you need to do is
here you will be able to see your
project in a solution Explorer
you need to go to your project and
right-click your project and just select
the option which says add reference just
select this option add reference and
this will open a wizard for add
reference you need to go to this dotnet
tab in here so just select dotnet tab
and search for the option called MySQL
dot data so I am searching for this
option MySQL dot data okay
just select it and click OK and what
this will do is this will add MySQL dot
data
DLL resource in your visual basic
project and using this MySQL data you
will be able to connect to the my SQL
using your Visual Basic once you have
done that we are going to go to the
source code of this visual basic form so
for this video I am going to show you
how to connect with your MySQL using
Visual Basic so what I am going to do is
I will take this simple button and I
will change it text as
check connection okay and let me change
the font size also go to the properties
of this button just select this button
and go to the properties and change the
font size from here so I'm choosing this
bold and 18 so you will be able to see
this button content I will just select
this button and double click it and it
will open the code for this button click
event for check connection in here what
I need to do is I need to go at the top
first before this public class form one
above this I need to import my MySQL
connection so I will say imports MySQL
dot data dot MySQL client ok once you
have imported this to your form what
next you need to do is just go to this
class in inside this class just be look
below this public class form one I am
going to declare MySQL connection client
so I will say them MySQL connection as
my SQL connection and this connection we
are going to use this variable to
connect to our database so this is at
loss which in this my SQL data library
and using this class we are going to
connect to our
our base okay now once again inside this
button click event which we have just
double click this button and in here we
need to declare a new connection to
check to our database so just inside
this button click event what I will do
is I will just copy my mice 12 corn
variable is equal to new my SQL
connection I will search for the MySQL
connection once again ok so what this
will do is it will create a new instance
of this class for connecting to the
database now if you have already watched
the first few videos of my MySQL
database tutorial you would know how to
create a sample database using your
MySQL and how to create how to use this
MySQL workbench so I have already
created this database in MySQL and my
database name is database itself and I
have one table inside my database called
II data and this database contains some
data for example ID name surname age
username password gender date of birth
and other columns so what I'm going to
do is I am going to check or I am going
to connect my Visual Basic project to
this database and check if the I can
connect the to this database or not
ok so in here
after these two lines in the next line
what I will do is I will prepare a
connection string to connect to my SQL
database so just I will just copy and
paste this code to you and explain what
this code means so what I have done here
is I have taken this MySQL instance from
here and dot connection string and diff
connection string I have given in order
to connect to the database so just write
MySQL Conn which is your MySQL variable
by a MySQL connection object variable
and just write MySQL Conn dot connection
string is equal to and in double quotes
just try server is equal to localhost
why servers will to localhost
when you go to your MySQL workbench and
if you have seen my videos when you
click this database tab from here and
click query database you will be able to
see my host name is 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot
1 which is a local host if you are using
your database on some server IP just
replace this localhost by the IP of your
MySQL server ok so this local host is
this IP now the second is the user ID of
MySQL ok so just write in the double
quote server is equal to localhost then
give semicolon then
user ID is equal to whatever your user
ID in my case the user ID is a root you
will be able to see here your name is
equal to a root right so user ID is
equal to root semicolon the password you
have already defined to two with this
user ID when you were installing MySQL
database
just give the mysql database password
here okay in my case this password is
root semicolon the database you want to
connect to so in my case the database
name is database itself you can see here
right so the database name is database
so I have written here database is equal
to database this is the name of the
database basically you need to write
this code in order to connect to your
MySQL server right now in the next line
what I am going to do is I am going to
write a try-catch block so just write
try catch e x which is exception as
exception and and your try and instead
of this standard exception I am going to
use my
exception okay so what this try-catch
block will do is if there is any
exception or error occurs during the
connection to the database this
exception will be caught by this
try-catch block and in here in the catch
block I am going to write a message box
in which I am going to show the error
message okay so in here I will write e x
dot message okay so it will catch any
exception whenever you your code is not
able to connect to the database now in
this tribe block what I will do is I
will open the connection to the database
so I will just copy this - Cal con from
here and inside this I will paste this
maskull con dot open okay
and then once your connection is open I
am going to say in the message box that
I am already connected to the database
so I will write in the message box a
message connection
successful okay and whenever you open
the connection you need to close the
connection after the execution of the
code so just copy this MySQL con once
again dot not like this but dot close
okay now once you have created this
object you need to dispose this also so
what you need to do is just go above
this and the try block and right here
finally and in here just copy this mask
Alcorn and just right dot this pause
okay so I think that's it that's all the
code we need to connect to the MySQL
database I am going to run my program
and check whether I am able to connect
to database so when I click this button
if I see this connection successful then
I know that I am connected to the
database so let's see
check connection and it says connection
successful now for example I gave the
wrong localhost or wrong user ID for
example I change the user ID which is
not the actual user ID so in this case
it should give this exception and it
should catch this try catch block will
catch the exception and my code will not
say connection successful so when I run
this program and when I once again say
check connection it throws me and accept
and it says that access denied for the
user ROP rot which is not the actual
user name right and once again when I
provide the actual username which is
root and once again when I run the
program and check connection
this time connection successful so I
know that I'm connected to the database
using these credentials and if I provide
some wrong credentials then I am or I
get the exception and error message so
in this way you can connect your visual
basic project to the MySQL database in
the future video I will also show you or
I will develop a simple project step by
step and I will show you how to create a
login page and how to connect your
database with the table with the list
box with the combo box and many other
things so stay tuned and please wait
