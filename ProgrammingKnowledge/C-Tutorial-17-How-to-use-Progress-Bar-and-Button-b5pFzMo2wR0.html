video I will show you how to use a
progress bar with your c-sharp windows
form application so first of all you
need to take a progress bar from a tool
box from your toolbox so grab a progress
bar and drop it into your form resize it
according to your use and the second two
we are going to use is a button to load
the to progress bar and I will also
resize it and I will change the name of
this button as load progress bar ok so
these two things I require one more to
live require which is a timer so just
grab a timer and drop it into a form
so like this and you will notice that it
will not go directly into your form but
below your form here so don't worry it's
okay now what you are going to do what
you need to do is just select your timer
and just copy the name of the time of
which is time oven
and then select a progress bar and
double click it and here in the load
progress bar button click event we will
write this dot sorry this dot I'm a 1
dot start bracket bracket closed so
write this in your button click event
and then once again come to your
progress bar or come to your form and
this time you will select your timer and
double click it and in here we are going
to write a quote so for this just select
your progress bar and write the name or
copy the name of the your progress bar
and then right here this dog
progress bar 1 which is my progress bar
name not in Tremont and bracket and
bracket closed and in here we are going
to pass the intervals for the increment
so I will write 1 so my progress bar
will progress with the interval of 1 ok
so these two line one line in the but
timer tick event this line and this line
in the load progress bar event and now
we are going to run our program it's
running and when I click this button see
the progress bar it's increasing
gradually and
it will fill okay so progress bar is
working the other thing is the speed of
filling how to control the speed of
filling so when you select your timer
here you can increase or decrease the
interval okay
so for example if you decrease the
interval to 10 and then run your program
load progress it will fill faster and if
you increase that interval and then run
your program and your load progress bar
it will note very gradually so you can
set the interval according to your need
okay here
so this is very important and in this
way you can use a progress bar to show
some progress in your c-sharp
application so I hope you have enjoyed
