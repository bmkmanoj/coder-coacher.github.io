connection and first of all in the last
video I have shown you how to create a
try-catch block so just make a quick
try-catch block
try catch and it will
take exceptions so just right
exception II
and if any exception occurs I will show
it in option pain dot
show dialog or show message dialog right
dot show message dialog okay and now I
will just pass null here as a first
argument and the second argument I will
pass as the exception message so I will
pass this e itself here okay so in this
tribe block what we need to do is first
of all we need to define the class for
connection to the SQLite so we will
write plus dot for for name and this
will be in the double quotes this will
be or G dot SQLite dot JDBC in capital
okay and do not forget to give the
semicolon here so this will be like this
o our G dot s collide dot capital jdbc
and this is showing error right now
because we are not returning anything
but once we return the connection will
not show this error so first of all let
us create the connection so connection
con is equal to write driver manager dot
get connection and this will be the
connection so in this double quotes as
an argument you will write je d bc j d
bc and then :
SQLite because we are using escalate SQL
ite : and now you will give the part of
your database where your database is
present so my database is present at
this part so I will copy this path or
what I can do I will right click on my
database go to the property security and
I will copy all the path from here ok
copy all the path and I will paste it
here okay
and it will show error because I will
show you why it will show error but
first of all I need to add the name of
this database also so this database name
is employee dot or dot SQLite so slash
backslash employ
what is it doing okay so it should have
this thought of is named employee data
thought esculent I will write
employee data dot SQL ite
okay so first of all it's showing this
error when you when you write this
because you need to add whenever you
make your path or whenever you give your
path in Windows you need to give double
slashes everywhere here instead of
single slash as a path okay and just end
this like this now it will not give any
error okay and once you have your
connection you will return your
connection just right
returned corn and as soon as you return
something here you will be able to see
that this error will go so in here also
we will return null return null and now
the error will go okay so this is the
connection class which we will use to
connect to the database okay now once we
have this connection class we are ready
to make the login form right
so what I am going to do is I will go to
my project once again go to the
subfolder called source right click it
go to new and go to other and then I
will choose window builder and in SQLite
design and I will choose application
window click Next
and now I want to give the path or the
name of the new class I am going to make
so this will be my login login class so
I will name it as login ok and I will
finish and now you will be able to see
this class which is created for us right
so we go to the designer and for this
video we will not do much but we will
just check the connection with the
database ok so we will leave this as a
blank but we will go to the source and
we will go to the source at the top of
this in login dot Java class and in here
I will find the constructor for this
login class which is public login and it
already has this method which is
generated by eclipse which is initialize
method and just below this initialize
method what I am going to do is I want
to call that class connection Java
connection class here to check my
connection so what I am going to do is I
will just go at the top one you can do
it here also but it's better to do just
after this declaration of the frame but
yeah you can do it just above this
constructor which how you can find the
constructor it has the same name as your
class okay so just find the same name as
class and initialize method it has
initialized method and just above that I
will call this class okay so what I am
going to do is here also first of all I
need to add those import which I have
used in SQLite connection class so I
will just copy these two imports which
has import Java dot s ql and import Java
X dot s swing right and I will paste
these two connections here okay and now
in above your constructor you can write
the connection
connection
Khan is equal to null and then we will
make our result set or we will make it
later and this connection Khan we are
going to use globally so just use this
one variable or I will make it as a more
clear
connection so you know that this is a
connection to the database okay just
call this connection so just copy this
object from here and just write is equal
to and just copy the name of the class
which is SQLite connection class write
the name of the class dot or method
which is DB connector method okay so
this DB connector is this method if you
can see here this DV connector is this
connection and we can show some message
here with before returning so that we
know that our connection is successful
so just below this connection in SQLite
connection dot database just above
return connection you can show this
message that our connection is
successful so I can write connection
successful okay
so what I have done in the log in class
I have just called this connection class
form Java dot SQLite class and I have in
the constructor of this login class I
have just called this connection is
equal to the class which is SQLite
connection dot the method in which I
have connected to the database let us
try to run the program it if it works or
not I will right click and let us see if
we can make this project as our main
project or we can when we run it we will
be able to choose this so we have this
here login n connection click OK
and it's saying the message Java not
long last not found exception Oh RGS
collide dot JDBC let's see what is the
error okay so I will just close this
file and I will find the error and then
come back so I found out the error the
error is I haven't added this SQLite
ODBC or JDBC jar file to my project to
use this s collide database to connect
to our project with Java we need to add
some jar to our project so that we can
connect SQLite to the Java so to
download this SQLite JDBC jar file I
will put this link in the description
which is HTTP colon slash slash base
bitbucket dot o-r-g /x irreal / s
collide JDBC okay so I will put this
link in the description then you will be
able to download this file and in here
you need need to go to download and in
here you need to download repository so
just click this button download
repository and download a folder like
this so I will open this folder and in
this folder
you will have some charge so I will go
to Lib and in here I will search for
these jar SQLite and
here include windows I will search for
these jars now so I think I have
downloaded the wrong repository so this
is the repository but I do not find any
jar file there so I will one by one
download all the jar files so first of
all this one and I will keep it second
one and the third one I will keep it all
keep
and both one
keep it v 1
and will be downloaded
and sixth one
and the seventh one
so I will download all these jar files
and once I have these downloads I will
go to the folder where I have downloaded
them so in the folder so these are all
the downloads for the jar file I have
here now in order to add these jar file
in your project what you need to do is
go to your Eclipse project in here so go
to your project here and you will have
this JRE system library automatically
created by eclipse for you in your
project so search for this JRE system
library right click it and go to build
path and in build path go to configure
build path okay so once again go to this
JRE system library right click build
path configure build path and in here
you can add these jar files in your
libraries so to add those SQLite jar
file just click this Add jar button and
then you can browse for your jar files I
think
and here there is no jar file so I what
I need to do is first of all I will just
I will make a new folder
so what I have done I am in source or in
company itself in the project I will
right-click in my project and I will
create new folder and in here I will
create a folder name for example
the sources okay and I will finish so I
have this folder here so what I can do
is wherever my downloads are I can just
select those downloads and let us see we
can drag and drop these in our folder or
not drag these files in this folder
copy files okay
and now I have all these file of jar
files here now I will go to this JRE
once again JRE system library right
click build path configure build path
add jar in the libraries add jar and in
company I have this folder resources and
I can I think multi select them and
click OK and once I have done that let
me see if they are there or not so once
I have done that I think they will be
added in here these files you see so I
will click OK and now these files are
here this so referenced libraries ok so
you will be able to see them here now
once you have all these SQLite - JDBC
file I will run my program once again
and let's see what happens and now I can
see connection successful and when I see
connection successful message I know
that I have successfully connected to my
database so don't forget to add these
SQLite JDBC jar file and I will provide
the link for them so you can download
all the jar files from that link and
just add like I have done and this
message you were seeing when I ran the
program connection successful here is
the connection if you see this line
which I have created connection
successful that means you are connected
to the database
okay once again connection successful so
in this way you can create a SQLite
database and connect it to our Java GUI
project in the next video I will show
you how you can create a login page and
go further okay so I hope you have
enjoyed this video please rate comment
