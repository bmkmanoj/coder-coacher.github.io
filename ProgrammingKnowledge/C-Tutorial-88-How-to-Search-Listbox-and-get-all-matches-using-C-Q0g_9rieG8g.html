video I will show you how to make a
program to search items in a list box so
for example we have a list box and we
list box contains a list and we want to
search and highlight those item which we
want to search if we enter something in
a search text box and we hit search
button so just follow the video and you
will be able to see what I'm talking
about so for this application we need a
list box so I will go to my toolbox and
I will drag and drop a list box by the
way I have a blank project made so first
of all make this project and now I will
drag and drop our list box yeah and I
will resize it okay and then I will go
down and I want a text box so just so
that it can take the word which we want
to search and we want a button to search
the item okay so we have list box we
have text box we have button we can take
a label also to show how many items or
the number of items searched so we can
drag and drop a list box here so I have
this box text box button and label I
rename this text box so I select this
and I will go to the properties and I
rename this text box as text
such okay and I want to rename this
button also so I will select this button
button search and I will change the text
also for this button so such okay and I
can change this label text also label
text maybe status and label status okay
so we are done with the naming and
changing the properties now first of all
we want to have some lists so that we
can search in the list so select this
this box I have some list of the
countries so I have the list of all the
countries in the text format you can
easily search the list of countries
online this is just for the
demonstration so I will select this list
of countries and copy these and I will
go to my project once again I will
select this list box first and go to the
properties and find where this item
properties is there so select this item
properties and click this small button
and I will paste my list here so what
this will do is first I click OK and you
can see the list here
so this is this just for demonstration
you can take the list from the database
you can make your own list also so any
list can be used ok so now I have the
list of the countries now what I will do
is I will click this search button and
double click it and first in this click
event I will write list box 1 dot
selected items dot clear so first of all
if any item is selected I will clear the
selected items for the next search right
and then I will make a for loop so let
me make a for loop I will just make it a
little bit bigger so you can see easily
okay
so I will make a for loop here or
and in the fall loop I declare in my
list box name
next box one dot so I will just copy
this from here
and then I will write dot items dot
count
okay so this is showing error because I
have to declare int I is equal to list
box item dot count minus one so our list
box start from last a value or a last
count of the list so whatever number of
lists its contains for example we have
10 item in our list so it will start
form tenth item and we will go backwards
so I is greater than or equal to zero I
- - okay so we are going from bottom to
top in this list and now here in this
for loop we will make a if statement so
if bracket and break it closed so this
is our if statement and in this if
statement we will once again copy a list
box name dot items and because we are
searching each and every item so we will
write items and inside the square box
right I which is this I dot to shrink
dot to lower dot
contains and in this contains bracket we
will pass our textbox name so the word
we are searching for is in the textbox
right so I will go to my forum go select
my text box copy the name of my textbook
Vistage text text search go to the code
once again and in here in contains
bracket I will paste it here dot text
dot to lower so why we are giving this
to lower because we want to search for
the word independent of its case right
so this to lower will convert every word
into a lower case and then it will
search for it so whether your word V
which you are searching for it is in
uppercase or lowercase it will convert
the list into lower case also and your
the word you are searching for in the
lower case also so you can search
regardless of the case upper case or
lower case you can search any word right
so if list box dot item array I dot two
string dot to lower what contains this
word in the text box or text box dot
text dot to lower then what we do is we
will select that item so I will copy the
list box name once again dot set
selected and bracket them like it closed
and first argument is I which is our
iterator and second argument
is a boolean statement which is true so
what this will do is if the word in the
list matches the word in the search text
box then that word in the list box will
be set selected okay and we know that
this word is in the list now
what remains is we need to count the
number of word found or number of such
items found so we can do after this for
loop we can write the name of our label
so label status this was the label which
is used for status dot text is equal to
the list box so just once again copy the
list box dot selected items dot count
dot two string so this and give it a
bracket plus we can give a small string
also so we can say space items found
okay so whatever the number of item
which it sees that list box in the list
box this much amount of items are
selected it will come this and transfer
into the label so this is the code full
code I will make it smaller so you can
just see in at once and you can copy
this code if you want pause the video
and copy
the code and now we can run the programs
and see whether it is working or not so
run the code and we have this program
and you see here is the status and we
want to search for example for Australia
okay so I will right you see I have
taken the first letter small but in our
list its capital so I want to see if it
works regardless of the case I will
click search and it is not found
maybe the spelling mistake yeah
Australia okay so it's found here right
so it's searching regardless of the case
so you may enter capital a and at last
also capital a and once again I will
select some other and I will say search
and it will search for the same word
Australia regardless of this case of the
word and it says one item found and
suppose this Australia is present in our
list two or three times so let let's
make it like that so I have in my list
so I will select my list and I will go
to the item collection and let's see I
will copy this Australia I will paste it
above here also so this is two time with
smaller case and I will paste this
Australia below here also with last
letter
upper case okay so we have three
Australia in our list one two and three
where is it three okay and let's see it
found all three words or not click okay
run the code and I will enter Australia
in my search text box and I will click
search and no it doesn't work like this
so it only selects only one Australia
and we need to see three Australia
selected because we have three items
which is which has same name Australia
but it's finding only one why it's
finding only one we will see here so we
will go to our form first select the
list box here and go to the properties
and search for the selection mode so
here selection mode property is here
selected only one so it's only selecting
one item but when we make it multi
simple it will select multiple item at a
time so just change this selection mode
property to multi simple and now once
again when we run our code and we will
write here
Australia and you will see all three
word with the name Australia are
selected here so in this way you can
make a simple program to search item in
the list box and highlight them I hope
