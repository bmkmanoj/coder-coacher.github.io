Java effects tutorial for beginners in
this video we will see what is Java FX
and how it's different from swing which
is also a GUI platform for Java so first
of all what is Java FX Java FX is a
media / graphics framework for creating
gooeys in java applications via GUI
stands for graphical user interface and
Java FX is intended to replace swing as
the standard GUI library for Java
software environment now it's more
powerful than swing and it can be used
to create both desktop and web
applications Java FX is like Swing which
draws its own components and which have
lesser communication with OS and it's
lightweight and hardware accelerated now
it make use of a file called F XML which
is a new XML based markup language for
handling you eyes okay
now let's see some history about Java FX
first of all for the first time Java FX
was announced in May 2007 by Sun
Microsystems and it was released in
December 2008 it was originally brought
as a response for flesh and shockwave
but one of the intention was also to
improve the ease of creating gooeys for
java application now the latest version
of Java FX is Java FX 9 and why we use
it
so you can see this is a swing jframe or
you can say swing window which looks
like this and let's see how the Java
expects window will look like when we
create it so this is how the Java FX
project window will look like whenever
you use some widgets of JavaFX in the
window right so it's much more improved
advanced than swing right so it can be
the replacement of the swing now I have
one example I have created the hello
world window for the swing application
and the JavaFX and you can see the
difference so this is on my right is the
swing jframe and here is the JavaFX
scene and you can see the difference
between them the JavaFX is more flexible
and it looks more attractive and it has
much more functionality than java swing
okay now in addition oracle provides you
the JavaFX scene builder which is a
visual user interface design tool and by
using it you don't need to spend a
number of hours anymore on trying to
move a button little bit on the left or
right or a little bit adjusting its
color right JavaFX has the ability to
apply CSS on the component of the UI
opens a door for better looking
application that are more attractive to
the end-user
it also has 3d support now before Java
effects version 2
JavaFX was made to use JavaFX script so
it was using JavaFX script and using
that it was you know creating the scenes
and stages and the windows right but it
was until the version 2.0 which was
deprecated after version 2.0 and from
2.0 onwards F XML has been introduced
which is more powerful and XML based one
advantage of it is all developers has
the
knowledge of XML so which is a benefit
right now F XML is our declarative
xml-based language which is easy to use
okay now you may ask which one is better
JavaFX or swing so GUI which are created
using Java effects a lot faster than
swing or AWT applications Java FX gives
you more sophisticated and aesthetically
pleasing you eyes in Java effects it's
really easy to integrate sounds images
video or web content
JavaFX code is really simplified by
separating the UI from the logic of the
application and Java effects can be
integrated in swing application allowing
for the smoother transaction now Java FX
terminology is little bit different from
swing so the main window of Java effects
on which every widget or component
resides on is called stage ok and on top
of it there is a scene so there is a
framework called scene on on scene you
can add the widgets something like
buttons labels or other widgets ok so
this is the basic framework for Java FX
window so you have the staged scenes and
then your widgets so that's it for this
video in the next video we will see how
we can install and run our first
application in Java FX so stay tuned and
please rate comment subscribe and bye
