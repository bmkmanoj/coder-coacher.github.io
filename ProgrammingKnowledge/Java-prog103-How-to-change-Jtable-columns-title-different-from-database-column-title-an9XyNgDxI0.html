video I will show you how you can change
your J table title or your tray table
column titles right now what happens is
this title comes from your database so
whatever is your database column name
that will come into your title for
example I have taken employee ID name
surname and age in my table so it will
appear as same so if you if I can show
them both at the same time you can see
here employee ID and employee ID even if
I have done spelling mistakes in writing
these this will appear same with no
difference in spellings or in the
uppercase or lowercase so it will show
whatever is your column name in the
database it will show in your J table so
you can see age is same name is same
surname is same and in the same way
username is same so in this video I will
tell you how you can change these title
and customize these title and you can
write your own title instead of directly
taking them from
the base so that gets sorted so go to
your NetBeans program and go to your
jframe and wherever you have written
your update table code which is written
to fill the values in the table go there
so this is my update table code this
thing I have already shown you many
times so go there and now we will make
some changes in this code and you will
see that the title will be changed so
first of all what I need to do is right
now what I'm doing is I'm taking all the
columns by writing star so star means
take everything so it is taking every
column of from a database and showing
into my tables so what I do is I will
remove this and I will go to my database
I will see what is my first column name
its employee ID so I will copy it from
my database and I will paste it here and
now what I am doing is important so I
will right
my column name from the database and
I will write as and twos in two single
quotes and now I can provide my name so
I will provide employee ID and here you
can see I can give space also whatever I
want to do I can give in to these two
single quotes now I want to show the
second column so it's new I will copy so
it's second column name is me and once
again after comma I will go to my then
paste it and as then also two single
quotes and
once again we'll go to my database and
copy my third column name and I take a
comma and surname as surname but in
single quotes whatever you want to do
surname or my surname so right now I
will only show these three columns in my
table so I will only write these three
trip three column names employee ID name
and this just you have to remember that
you have to write as and in single quote
you have to write all you have to write
your customized name which you want to
show in your J table so now when I run
the program let's see what happens
so you can see here a change or what I
have written my employee ID title as
employee ID name and my surname which I
have written in the code so I've written
only three columns and which are
employee ID name and my my surname so in
this way you can change your J table
title according to you and you can
verify it from here from the code you
have written I will show you so
this was the code we have written and
this these are our values you can see
here instead of employee ID it's showing
my title which I have given employee ID
name which I have given an my surname
which I have given so in this way you
can change the title of your table I
hope you have learned something new
today and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
