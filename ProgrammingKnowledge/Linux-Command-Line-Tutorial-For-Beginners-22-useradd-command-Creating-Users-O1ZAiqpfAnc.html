Linux command line tutorial for
beginners and in this video we will
learn how to use user add command create
users in Linux so to create a user we
can use a command called user add and
with this command we use some flags and
the user name to create a user so let's
see how we can create a user using this
command so you just need to type this
command which is user add and then the
name of the user the name of the user
can be anything for example mark or user
one or anything which you want so this
is the user name which you want to give
so I want to give the user name for
example mark ok
and then the second flag which you can
use is - M flag right and what this flag
is going to do is it's going to create a
default home directory for this user
right so we are going to see once this
command is executed that's that the home
directory with this name will be created
whenever we will see the home
directories right now the next command
is - s command and this is the command
for the default shell okay so this - s
command is used for allowing the user to
use the shell whatever we provide after
this flag so generally we give the bash
sub in forward slash bash here so
something like this okay so this is most
commonly used you know shell so I'm
going to use this now the next command
is - G this is next flag I beg your
pardon and this is the default user flag
and after this after space after this
flag whatever user
you type the user will be assigned that
group so the default group is users and
I would recommend that you always use
the minus G flag this users group which
is correct to use there is also some
more flags for example minus C for
providing the comments you can provide
any comments here for this user for
example I want to give some comment my
comment for example right so any comment
can be given to the user using this flag
- see ok now there are much more flags
you can use for example - G for giving
the user defined group or assigning the
user defined group which we are not
going to use but just use man command on
with this user add command and you will
be able to see what are the you know
flags which you can use with this user
and come on and because we are creating
the user we need to create user with our
root you know access so you just need to
write sudo in front of this command in
order to create this user because you
don't want to you know allow anybody to
create the user the root user can you
know create the user right so this is
the command sudo and then the user add
command then the name of the user then
the flag M is used for creating the
default home directory as is for default
shell - G is for the default group - C
is for the comment and then you can
press the Enter key which is going to
ask for your password and then press
enter once again this is going to create
this user
now just do LS and then forward slash
home and you can see my new user here is
created with
the name mark which is this name so this
directory is created in our home folder
for the new user right but you may ask
that we haven't provided any password to
this user so whenever this user wants to
login
he will log in with the username and the
password but we haven't provided any
password here so this password can be
you know given to the user with the
command called the pass WD okay not W
key but WT okay so when you give this
command as it is then it it will allow
you to change the you know password for
the you root user but when you use this
command with the argument for example I
will use this command pass WT with the
user name mark then this will allow me
to change the password of the mark right
and then you also need to use sudo
command because you may have to give the
root X's in order to change the password
of the user right so whenever you use
this like this then it will allow you to
change your password and whenever you
give the name of the user then it will
allow you to change the password of the
user
ok so press enter and now it says enter
the new password so give any password
whichever you want to give to the user
for example I will give a simple
password here and I will press ENTER and
then I need to retype this password so I
will retype this password and press
enter and you can see it says password
updated successfully so now for the new
user you can give this name and whatever
password you have assigned to this user
to the new user and he will be able to
login with this username and password
okay so this is how you can create a
user in Linux in the next video we will
see how we can remove a user in Linux
and I will recommend that you can create
you know four or five users so we can
play with these users okay so with the
same command you can create multiple
users and these users we can use in the
next video to remove them okay so I hope
