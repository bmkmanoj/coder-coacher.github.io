show you how you can install and
configure get on your open to Linux
operating system and I'm also going to
show you how you can create and
configure repository on github so that
you can transfer file to github using
git so let's get started first of all
you need to install gate so the command
is sudo apt - get install git okay so
sudo app - get install gate and give you
a password I will install gate on your
system the gate is already installed in
my system so it says its newly installed
but in your case it's going to take a
few seconds and it will be installed you
don't need to do any extra things okay
once you have installed get on you're
open to operating system you need to
open your browser and go to github.com
ok and in here you need to create an
account if you don't have already
otherwise if you have already created
account you can sign it sign in with
your account ok so creating account is
not very difficult you can just give
your username password and email ID and
it will be created and once you created
your account you just need to login with
your account so I just need to give my
username and password and sign in and
now I can see this dashboard of git ok
now what I need to do is I need to set
up my git username and email ID on this
open to write so what I need to do is I
need to give this command get config - -
global
space user dot name and in double course
you need to give your user name this
user name should be identical to your
username which you are provided on
github okay
so just give this command and press
enter
this will set up your username on get
right in the same way you just need to
provide your email by just giving this
command I'm going to give you all the
commands in the description so you don't
need to worry about the commands you
just can copy these commands and paste
it on your terminal so the second
command you need is gate config - -
global user dot email and in the double
quotes you just need to give your email
ID okay and press enter and now you can
go to your github and just click this
button which says create repository and
then create a new repository click
create new repository and in here you
can give the name to your repository for
example get test and you can provide the
description for your repository for
example this is just for test and then
you can choose whether you want public
or private repository public is free for
you but if you want to choose a private
you need to pay some money for this so
I'm going to choose this public and then
I'm going to just click this create
repository button and then my repository
is created so once this repository is
created let's create a directory for
this in our open to operating system so
what I'm going to do is let's see what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
directory in my home folder so m'kay
gir for make directory and my directory
name would be for example I will give
the same name gate test okay so get test
and the directory has been created and
now I'm going to go to my get test
directory and it's empty right now and
now what I can do is I can simply follow
these commands which github tells me to
do so first of all it's recommending me
to create a readme file so I'm going to
create it so just copy all these
commands one by one and give this
command one by one and everything will
be really easy right so I'm going to
copy this command go to my terminal
paste this command and then press Enter
it's going to create our read me dot MD
file inside my get test directory and
then the second command is to initialize
gate in my directory so I'm just going
to give get in it and press Enter and it
says initialize empty git repository
okay so it has initialized empty git
repository for me
the third command is to add the file I
have created which is readme file to the
gate okay
so just give give gate add readme this
add commands adds your file to the gate
okay
so press enter and it's going to add
your readme file then the next command
is to commit your file okay so once you
add your file you need to commit your
file in order to appear on or in order
to save your changes in gate okay so
just gave this command get commit - em
then in quotes you need to give some
comment for your commit for example my
first commit or whatever is the purpose
of your commit okay so - M is for the
description press ENTER and it's going
to commit your changes to get okay so it
says one file change one insertion and
everything is okay now the next command
is for adding the remote origin okay so
this is the URL which you know which
gives the link to the github right so we
are going to link our directory to this
github directory okay so this will be
the command for this so just copy this
command and paste it and press Enter and
it's going to link your github directory
and your local directory okay and the
last command is to push your changes so
just give this command push so copy this
and the last command is get Porsche -
you origin/master
okay and press enter and here you need
to give your username first so my
username and then you need to give your
password once you press enter so give
your password
and once you do this your changes will
be committed in your github directory
okay
so let's click it once again and now you
can see your directory or your changes
can be seen here now for example I want
to add a new file to my get test
directory right now
I only have one file which is readme
file I'm going to clear this terminal
and then less directory I have only one
which is readme dot MD let's add one
more file for example nano nano is the
command for creating a new file for
example and then ABC dot txt I'm going
to add this ok and press ENTER and in
here I'm going to give some text ABCD
for example or some random some random
letter just for testing ok and or let's
give hi get ok and press ctrl o and
press Enter it will save your changes
and then press ctrl X to exit and then
just to LS and you can see this ABC dot
txt will be created in your in your
directory and in order to read it once
again you just need to give Nano ABC dot
txt and you will go inside it ctrl X to
get out now in order to add this we will
follow the same procedure just write
gate add and then your file name which
is ABC dot txt and press enter it's
going to add my ABC dot txt to the gate
and then I'm going to commit the
a file to the gate so gate commit and
then my file name or and first of all
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add
some description for this so once I
added this I need to commit it to save
the changes okay so what I can do is I
can give them a comment - em and I can
give I added a B C dot txt and it's
going to save the changes
enter and it's going to commit your
changes here so once you commit your
file you just need to follow the same
procedure which we have followed for
readme file which is get remote add
origin and then HTTP colon slash slash
github.com slash your user name slash
your directory name dot get okay so
press Enter
which is or already exists and then just
give this command to push your changes
which is this one get push - you
origin/master okay so press Enter give
your user name and then give your
password
press ENTER and it's going to push your
changes which we have done we have added
ABC dot text so now we are going to go
to our github website repository and we
are going to refresh this repository so
I'm just going to click it and I can see
ABC dot text here ok so just press you
can just check the content just click
this and say is Highgate which we have
added to this text so in this way you
can install a get on your open to
operating system and configure it with
github I hope you have enjoyed this
