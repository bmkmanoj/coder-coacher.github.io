show you how you can install Linux Mint
on VirtualBox I'm using Ubuntu operating
system as a host for the VirtualBox but
you can use Windows 7 or Mac OS as a
host for VirtualBox and the step will
remain the same so let's get started
first of all we will download the Linux
Mint ISO file from its website so just
go to your favorite web browser and
search for Linux Mint download source
for it and the first link you will find
here is www.lynnesnissan.com
no codecs or other flavors but I will
choose this first option cinnamon and
you can even choose if you want 32-bit
or 64-bit operating system so I will
choose this 64-bit operating system
which is cinnamon and then you will find
the mirrors of this ISO file so whatever
location is closer to your location just
click that location so for example I
want choose Germany and this mirror and
just save it on your computer it's a
relatively big file about 1.3 GB file so
it will take some time to download so
once your file is downloaded you are
ready to install Linux Mint so fire up
your VirtualBox and in here just click
this new and write Linux here by default
it'll you know recognize that it's a
Linux and version as linux 2.6 / 3 point
acts 64-bit there are other versions
like Ubuntu 64-bit or even Debian 64-bit
but Linux Mint is not listed in these
versions so you can just choose linux
2.6 / 3 point ice 64-bit or otherwise if
you have installed 30 more two-bit then
this option is
and click Next and in here you can
provide the memory science which you
want to give to your operating system I
will give it around 1 0 to 4 MB click
Next create a virtual hard drive create
and VDI yes next I want the dynamically
allocated physical hard drive so I will
click Next and in here the size which
you want to allocate to your operating
system by default it's 8 GB but I will
provide a little bit more around 10 or
11 GB because it requires little bit
more than 8 GB ok so I will provide 10
GB to my operating system for example
create and now your virtual operating
system is created but you haven't given
the path of ISO file to this operating
system so to start this you need to give
the path so let's select your your
operating system here and go to settings
go to storage and and in control
controller IDE select empty and click
the small CD button choose virtual
cd/dvd disk file and select your ISO
file which you have downloaded for Linux
Mint mine is Linux Mint 17 that's
cinnamon - 64-bit click open and click
OK once you have done that it select
your Linux Mint from here and click
start and it will start your Linux Mint
so for the first time when you start
this it will open this Linux Mint from
that ISO file but once it's open you
need to install it so I will show you
how you can install it we will wait for
the starting
so now it looks like it will start in
some seconds
okay so once this is started you need to
install Linux Mint so you need to choose
this Linux install Linux Mint icon from
here just double click this icon
and the installation wizard will start
so first of all it will ask you what
language you want to use for this
installation I will use English so this
will be the language for your operating
system you can choose different
languages according to your preferences
and click continue
and in here you see here it's showing it
requires 8 1 6 GB but we have a given
enough memory or enough drive space we
have given 10 GB so it's okay and
everything is okay Internet it's
connected click continue and then this
computer currently has no detected
operating system this message is showing
because you are running it on VirtualBox
right so in your virtual boss it doesn't
detect this so you just need to click
this option it is this can install Linux
Mint don't worry it will not delete your
original operating system so it's not
thing to worry about just choose this
option and click Next or install now
choose your location wherever you are
situated so and press Continue
and then choose the language of your
keyboard layout I have a German keyboard
layout so I will choose this German
keyboard but depending upon the layout
of your keyboard you can choose this
okay German German continue
now you need to give the name of your
operating system I will name it as Linux
Mint itself and you need to give the
password so I will give the password and
confirm the password ok click continue
and now the installation has started and
it will take around four to five minutes
to complete this insulation and once its
installed it will ask you to restart
your Linux Mint so we will wait for the
completion of this installation and then
I will show you how to go further okay
so now our installation is complete and
it's asking to restart this operating
system Linux Mint so I will click this
restart Now button and I will restart
this virtual machine or virtual
operating system once again generally I
have observed when you click restart
after installing any operating system on
VirtualBox and when you click restart it
takes much time to restart this
operating system so one way is to just
close the operating system you are
running and you know start it once again
so you see it's taking a little bit of
time so I will close this and I will say
power of that machine and once again I
will choose this Linux Mint from here
and start it once again it's much faster
to start it like this
and now you can see this symbol
and
you will see a login screen soon
so you see here you are seeing the login
screen and in here you need to give your
login so I will log in as a root all
right root and click OK
and give your password so I'll give my
password also and click enter
sorry this user name should not be rude
this should be whatever you can see here
Linux Mint I have given the username
Linux Mint and I have forgotten that so
just whatever is the username here which
is Linux Mint I need to give the login
that so Linux Mint and the password
and press enter and now I will be logged
in successfully
so for the first time whenever you have
done your installation with Linux Mint
it will show this welcome screen to you
to show whatever you can use in this
Linux Mint and then you can go to menu
and see all the options here okay so I
hope you've enjoyed this video please
