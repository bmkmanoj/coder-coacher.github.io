you how you can download and install
OpenCV on your Rubin to operating system
and in the later part of this video I'm
going to show you how you can verify the
opencv installation by creating a C++
project now this procedure which I am
going to show you will work with Python
also so if you want to create a Python
project using this installation it will
work also okay so let's get started now
first of all I want to show you that I
will be following the procedure of
installing OpenCV on ubuntu from my blog
post from my website which is called
bind comm so if you want to copy all the
command or if you want to know all the
command which I have used in this video
you can just go to this link which I'm
going to give you in the description and
then copy all these commands from here
and here are all the detailed
instruction how to install OpenCV and
how you can create your first C++
project with open CV okay so let's get
started so first of all I'm going to
open my terminal and the first step is
to update my open to operating system so
just give this command here sudo apt -
get update okay so sudo apt - get update
and then give your open to spaz word
it's going to get all the updates and
once this is done we are going to give
this command second command is sudo
apt-get upgrade so just give this
command sudo apt-get upgrade and then
give Y here so the upgrade is finished
and then I'm going to go to the next
step you can see this is the next step
to install all the dependencies which
are for example build essentials for C++
and C C make for making your open CV
repositories get for cloning
other dependencies for OpenCV okay so
I'm going to just copy this one by one
and paste it here so let me clear the
terminal and then paste this command and
I'm going to just go to the start
position delete this dollar symbol and
then press Enter is going to install
these dependencies first of all and by
the time these dependencies are
installing I'm going to copy the second
command which is this one which is for
the support of Python and other
libraries okay so just copy the second
command so now the first command is
finished let me once again clear the
terminal and then let's give the second
command which is sudo apt-get install
python 3.5 - dev 5 and 3 - numpy and
these other libraries ok so I'm going to
give this command and press Y and once
this is done we are going to execute the
third command for the dependencies which
is this one so let me copy this command
and then I am going to just give this
command after this installation is
finished so the second command is also
finished let me clear the terminal and
let me give the third command and let's
give the third come on now so and press
Y and let's wait for the command to
execute and install all the dependencies
so the dependency installation process
is finished and let's go and see what's
the next step so in the next step we are
going to get the opencv and these OpenCV
repositories are hosted on the github by
the username ITC's and OpenCV ok so we
are going to just get these repositories
in our opt of folder or directory and
then we are going to make these
repositories right so let me clear the
terminal once again and now
give the sudo su command because we are
going to go inside our opt folder which
requires sudo privileges right and then
we are going to go to the CD opt folder
so let's go to the opt and in the opt we
are going to clone this gate repository
right so just give this command to go
clone the repository and we have already
installed gate in our previous command
right so this gate command will work so
get clone which is going to clone this
OpenCV depository on our opt directory
so that cloning of the first repository
is done and let's clone the second
repository and the second repository was
this gate Sloane HTTP OpenCV underscore
contrib dot gate right this is the
second repository you are cloning so it
will be cloned in few seconds and then
we will go to the next step which is to
make our binaries so the cloning of the
next repository is also done so we can
go to the next step and let's see what's
the next step is so here is the next
step so now once both the repositories
are cloned now we just need to build and
install OpenCV and these are the steps
for building and you know installing the
opencv so we just need to seed into the
opencv directory and create a release
directory inside that and in the release
directory we just need to run this
command okay so let's do that so let's
first of all LS into our opt directory
and you can see we have two directories
created one is OpenCV which is created
by cloning of the first repository and
other is OpenCV contrib we
is created by the cloning of the second
repository right so we will CD into the
first repository which is open CV so
just give the command CD open CV and now
we are in the opt for a slash open CV
directory right here we are going to
create a directory called release and
once this directory is created we will
just CD into that directory so just to
CD release okay so now we are in opt
forward slash open sea for slash release
right now inside this directory we just
need to give this command so we have
given the CD release command and now we
just need to give this see make command
which is a very long command so just
copy this command and we are going to
give this command right which is the C
mix let's clear the terminal first of
all and now let's give the C make
command okay so this is the command we
just need to give C make and then all
the flags associated with the C make
okay and here you can see the last
option is important here last option
here which is the directory opt forward
slash open sea okay so this operation of
C make will happen in opt forward slash
open CV right so just give this command
it is going to build open CV using C
make now the FEMA command is finished so
let's see what the next step is so after
the C make command we just need to make
our binaries and then give them make
install command okay and then LD config
so let's issue the make command and then
we will do the make install so just
write make - J 4 J 4 is for the jobs so
make minus J 4 okay and it's going to
make your binaries and then we are going
to issue the make install command to the
make command is also finished
let's give the make install command now
so let me clear the terminal and let me
give make install command and once this
make install command is finished then we
will do the LD config and LD config is
going to create the necessary links for
the open CV okay so the make install is
also finished so let's give LD config
command here you can also verify these
commands from here so after make we have
given make install and then LD config
right and then we are going to exit from
the sudo and then we will go to our home
directory
okay so let's do the same so LD config
it is going to create all the necessary
links and then we just need to exit from
our sudo so we are out of our sudo and
now we just need to do CD tilde if it's
necessary in your case I was already in
my home directory so I do not
necessarily need to give this command
but I just gave this come on right now
let's verify that which version of open
CV we have installed and for that we
have this command let me scroll down and
we have this command PKG - config - -
mod version OpenCV ok so let us give
this command here and let me remove this
taller and then plus enter and you can
see the version of OpenCV in our case is
three point three point zero ok now
let's create some c++ project and let's
see how we can compile us OpenCV c++
project so i will go down a little and i
can see these instructions here right so
you can create this directory in which
you will you know create your main dot
CPP file so let me do this so
let me create a directory called CPB
test or OpenCV test so mkdir cpp
underscore test and then let's go to
that directory cpp theft and inside the
cpp test i am going to create a main dot
CPP file so main dot CPP and I will need
a picture or image for this program
right so let me open this main dot CPP
and let me open the folder Explorer and
let me show you this mean dot CPP there
right so you can see in here I have CPP
test directory and inside
CPP test I have created this main dot
CPP using the touch command right so I
am going to open this main dot CPP using
my G edit edita you can use any other
editor as you wish so right now this is
NP file right this main dot CPP is empty
and in this empty main dot CPP I am
going to just copy this program which I
have provided on this website and then I
am going to compile this so let me copy
all this code which I have given here
and let me just paste it here ok
and you can see here I need a sample jpg
file also to open it right so in this
here in this directory I need a sample
dot jpg image so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take a screen shot of my
desktop so let me take a screenshot and
let me save this screenshot with this
name which is same sample dot jpg here
or in my case it's a PNG so I will just
say sample dot PNG file ok and I will
save it in my pictures directory and I
just need to copy that from my pictures
directory so sample dot PNG let me copy
this from here
and let me go to the home CPP test and
then let me paste it in the same
directory tree in which my main dot CPP
file is so in this directory I have main
dot CPP and sample dot PNG and because
it's a sample dot PNG I will just change
the extension here PNG right because I
have PNG not jpg and now I'm going to
just compile my program and then I am
going to run it so to compile my program
you can see this command which is going
to compile your program and create an
output binary file or executable file so
g plus plus main dot CPP - OH output so
this is our executable file and you just
need to give this command there okay
let's build so our main dot CPP is
compiled and you can see there is one
more executable file which is created
which is output right so let's run the
output and once you run it you can see
it has opened this image in our case
okay so this is our display window and
it has opened this display window here
that's one it once again to verify and
you can see this is the display window
which is opened by our open CV program
ok so now we know that our open CV is
working fine with our CPP project so
this is how you can download and install
OpenCV on your window operating system
and you can create your first C++
project I hope you have enjoyed this
