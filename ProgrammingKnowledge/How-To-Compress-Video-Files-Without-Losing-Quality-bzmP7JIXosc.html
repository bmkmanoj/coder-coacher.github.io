show you how you can compress your video
less than five times its original size
and keeping its quality or video quality
the same so let's see how we can do it
so if you have on Windows you might know
about a software called the moviemaker
which is this one movie maker and if you
don't have this software which is Movie
Maker it's available free on Microsoft
website so I will link a video link how
you can download and install this
moviemaker
on your Windows operating system and
it's free of cost for Windows 7 and
Windows 8 and earlier version already
have this like Windows XP already have
this moviemaker
so go ahead to this Start button and
open your moviemaker
and it will last start your moviemaker
and in this moviemaker what you need to
do is you just need to select your video
so for example I will select my video
one of my videos and what you need to do
then when it is loaded on this
moviemaker
you just need to go here which is save
movie button and you can choose this
this will come compress your video file
up to 5 times or more than 5 times and
you can choose this which is high
quality display so it will keep the
video quality and it will also compress
your video so what you need to do is you
just need to click this one and you just
give the name of this compressed file so
I will say new
compressed video and click Save and once
you click save it will start the process
and it will give you the percentage of
process which is complete and once this
process reaches to 100 then check your
video which you have created newly
created video and just check the size of
the video and compare the it to the
original video size I bet it will be
compressed up to 5 times or more
depending upon the quality of the video
so one of the video or I have already
compressed few videos using this
moviemakers and generally I use it to
compress video and upload it to the
youtube channel of mine because it it
takes a long time when I upload a very
large video which is a some hundreds of
megabytes so I compress it with this
tool and I just upload it on the YouTube
so let's see for example this was the
original size of the video which I have
created which is C sharp introduction to
methods and let's see what it was what
was its size its size was 350 MB okay
and when I compressed it with movie
maker which is this one compressed one
and when I go to the C could go to see
the properties it's about 70 MB so it's
about seven times or five times less
than the original size in the same way I
have compressed this video also so the
original size of this video was about
200 MB and when I compressed it it was
about 48 MB
so this is the very simple way it's free
and this movie maker is available free
on the Microsoft website if you don't
have already on your Windows operating
system and I will also provide the link
to the video where I have shown you how
you can install a moviemaker on your
Windows operating system so keep
watching these videos and I hope this
video helped you in compressing your
videos and I hope you have enjoyed this
video please rate comment subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
