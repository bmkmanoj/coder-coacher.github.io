video I will show you how to search some
particular item from column in the data
grid view using a text box so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take a text
box which is used for searching some
particular word or name for example and
according to our name in this data grid
view values will be filtered in this
data grid view so let's get started
first of all what I will do is I will
take a text box from here and drag and
drop into my form and I will change the
name of this text box as search
underscore txt and I will also change
the font size of this text box okay now
what you need to do is just double click
this search box and in here we are going
to write the code to search whatever
word or whatever item we will write in
this text box it will should filter the
word or the value and then filter the
values in the data grid view and show us
the result right so what I am going to
do first is in the video number 12 if
you have remembered and if you don't
remember just see the video number 12 I
have made the event called load tables
in the video number 12 where I have
shown you how to link your data grid
view with the MySQL database right and
in here I have declared a variable for
data table which is DB data set right
what you need to do here is just select
all this declaration of this variable dB
data set which is a new instance of data
table and cut from here and just paste
it at the top of your code where you
have already defined my skill Khan and
command which are different instances of
MySQL connection and - welcome c'mon so
just below this just cut your code this
one and paste it here because we want to
make this as a global variable okay now
once again just go to with this search
text box text change event and in here
we are going to declare our variable dim
DB as new data view and in here we are
going to pass this new global variable
which we have declared at the top so
just copy this DB data set from here and
paste in this argument here okay now in
the second line what we are going to do
is we will copy this DB from here and
paste it here and we will say dot row
filter is equal to string dot format and
in the bracket we will pass to argument
the second argument would be the name of
this search text text box so just select
this and copy the name of this text box
from here and paste it here as a second
argument dot text okay and the first
argument here will be the name or the
name of the column which you want to
search in your data grid view so for
example you want to search on the basis
of let me show you first I will
on the program
so for example I want to search on the
basis of name column so whatever name I
will write here on the basis of name it
will match the content with these all
the columns of the name and so filter
this result and show it in here
okay so for example I write John here it
will just show John row here okay so on
the basis of name column name column I
want to filter my data so this is my
name column so what I will write here in
the code in this double quote just write
name and then write single quote and in
between just give this bracket and just
give here 0 and in here just give two
percentage fines so just write this and
you need to write one more thing name
like this okay so what this will do is
it will search all the names which will
which you will write in the search text
box and then what we'll do is we will
transfer all the search data to the data
grid view so we will write data grid
view 1 dot data source is equal to DB
right so that's it these three lines
will search whatever you enter in the
search text box and filter the data and
show it into the data grid view let's
check whether it works or not so for
example I want to search for the name
John so when I enter the first letter J
it will show all the results starting
with J right and I want to search for
the John so I will write J Oh
and I searched for only one row which is
which contains the name John right
for example I want to search for the
name Julie which is present two times in
my list so I will write Julie and you
will see the result search result there
are two names with the name Julie right
or for example I want to search for the
name mark there are two marks or it
shows that there are three names which
start from M right so our search text
box is working now so in this way you
can search the data which you enter in
the text box and filter the data and
show it in the data grid view I hope you
