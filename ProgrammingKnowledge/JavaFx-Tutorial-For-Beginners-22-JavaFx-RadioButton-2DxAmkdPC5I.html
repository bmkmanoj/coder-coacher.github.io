Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use the radio
buttons in Java effects in the last
video we have seen how to use checkboxes
in Java effects so how are radio button
different from checkboxes radio buttons
are also used to choose one option out
of many options available right and
checkboxes are also meant for the same
so what is the difference the difference
is using checkboxes you can choose
multiple options but radio buttons are
generally used to choose only one option
out of many options so let's get started
and let's see an example and see how we
can use radio buttons so I have created
this project which I named it as a radio
button and in my application package I
have this main dot Java file in which I
have added this main dot F XML and then
I have this main controller dot Java
class which I have created which is
blank right now and I have this mean dot
F XML file okay so this is just a blank
project I think till now you know how to
use them ok so first of all what I'm
going to do is I'm going to open my main
dot F XML file and in here first of all
the anchor pin I am going to change the
layout pref width and prep height to 300
and 300
okay so prep width 300 and pref height
is equal to 300 now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go to the controls and
in here I'm will search for the radio
buttons and for example I will give you
an example in which conditions you can
use radio buttons for example you want
to allow the user to choose a gender of
a person right so it can be either
email or mail it cannot be both or you
want to allow the user to choose his age
right so it can be only one age it
cannot be different right so we are
going to take an example of the gender
selection male or female right so I'm
going to take two buttons and I'm also
going to take one label here and first
of all I will change the text of this
radio button I will go to the property
and first radio button next I am going
to change it as male and the second
radio button option I am going to change
the text as female okay and the label
I'm going to leave it as empty and now
what I'm going to do is I will go to the
property of this male radio button and
in here you have some options right so
let's run this or preview this F XML
file using this scene builder preview
option so just go to preview here and
then click preview in window and right
now you can see I can select both of the
options but this we don't want right we
want to choose either male or female
so we want to allow the user to choose
either one of them and not at the same
time so how do we do it there is a
property called toggle group which you
can set to allow the user or to allow
the user to choose from a group of radio
buttons right so we will make a group
and in that group we will assign the
radio button 1 and radio button 2 to
that group so that they will belong to a
toggle group and then you will be able
to choose only one option so I will just
choose first radio button and go to the
property called the toggle group and you
can say this is my group for example
or any other name which you want okay so
for now I'm going to give it my group
right and take the same name which you
have chosen here and then go to the
second radio button and give the same
name here also to the toggle group okay
so the toggle group for male radio
button and female radio button is same
and save your code and let's preview it
once again and now we cannot choose both
radio button at the same time only one
is selected another is unselected okay
so when I choose this female the male is
unselected and female is selected okay
so only one of them can be selected at a
time right so this is due to this toggle
button now if you want to allow the user
that this male radio option is always
selected you can choose this option
called selected just click it and then
it's by default selected so when we
preview it the radio button will be
selected where you have checked this
option okay so right now we don't want
that right now let's give the ID to
these radio buttons so I will go to the
code and select a male radio button and
I will name it as our b14 radio button 1
and second radio button I will name it
as our b-24 radio button - okay and now
I will connect this main dot affectional
file with the main dot controller Java
class so I will go to the controller
here and select application dot main
controller from here and I will save
everything now I will go to my Eclipse
IDE and refresh my project once again
and now I will go to the main controller
dot java class and in here first of all
I will declare these radio buttons right
so let's declare these radio buttons and
the label
so I have declared these radio buttons
and the label and the name should match
what we have provided in the F XML file
so we have provided first radio button
as our b1 and second radio button as our
b2 and we have selected one label also
let's import this label from here and
then choose the same name for the label
and give select your label from here so
we have taken this label just select
this label and then give the FX ID to
this label which you have given here so
the same name to this label here okay
save your code and refresh your project
once again and now we are going to
create one method and which will be
public void actionperformed method so it
will return void and the name of this
method we are going to name it as radio
select and just pass this action event
method here and give the name to your
argument which is event for example and
go inside your method and in here first
of all we are going to declare one six
string variable and we will name it as
message and we will initialize a is
blank string okay now when somebody
selects a radio button it has a property
as we have seen in the last video which
is called is selected so just take your
RB one and then just use the property
call is selected okay so is selected it
returns the boolean value right so if
the radio button one is selected which
is male in our case what we will do we
will just take this message and assign
the value of this radio button or text
of this radio button right so message
plus equals and then take this RB
one dot get text and then you can also
provide this line break ok so just give
backslash n here which will provide the
line break in the same way just copy the
same code and paste it here and this
will be R b2 this time okay so R b2 now
once we have the message we will just
display it on the label so we will just
take this label variable and then dot
set text and then the message value so
just provide this message value here now
once this is done just take your method
name and save everything and go to your
F XML file select your radio button go
to the code and in the action on action
just choose your method name which is
radio select same you will do for the
female radio button and same method on
action will be selected here so both
have the same on action method just save
your code and refresh your project and
run your project okay so I'm going to
right click and run as java application
and now my app is running so when I
click this male radio button it prints
on the label male and when I click
female radio button it prints on the
label female right so male and female
right so in this way you can use radio
buttons in Java effects you can use this
same radio button for choosing edges or
in the situation where you want to allow
the user to choose only one option from
multiple options so I hope you enjoyed
