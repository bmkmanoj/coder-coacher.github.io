how to create a text file using a visual
basic windows form application and how
to insert some text in that text file
using your application so let's get
started I will take a button and I will
change text of this button as create
text files okay and let me change the
font size so we can see the text of the
button and let's say 18 okay now I will
just double click this button and in
here I will declare up variable right
dem file as system dot IO dot stream
writer
okay now I will use this file variable
and I will create a file so I will write
my dot computer dot file system dot Open
File writer and in the bracket I will
pass the path of this file wherever I
want to create this files and the name
of the file for example I want to create
this file inside my binary folder where
my executable file of this project is
there or you can provide any path which
you want to give just wherever you want
to give the path just copy the path of
the library and just paste it there here
but just remember just you need to
replace these back slashes to forward
slash like this
okay so just replace all the backslash
to the /or what you can do is you can
just add one more backslash to every
backslash here so there are two option
you can do or giving the path so for
example I would just want to make my
text file in the default location
wherever my binary file is there so I
will write test dot txt file and the
second argument I will write as true
okay so this will create my txt file now
I want to write some lines to my files
so what I will do is I'll write fine dot
write line and inside this bracket I can
insert the text for the file so I can
write this is my YouTube tutorial for
example and whenever you create a file
after writing the text in the file it's
a good practice to close the file just
write file dot close okay now we'll run
the program but first of all I will show
you how to go to the default location or
the binary directory of your file of
your executable files just try click
your project and go to the
open folder in project explorer and in
here you will be able to find this
binary folder and this binary folder you
will have either debug or release folder
so just go to this folder and this is
your executable file here right now it's
not compiled so it's just running a
blank project so in here my text file
will be created so let me run the
program so I will run the program at
running without any error and just watch
here it will create a text file when I
click this button so I will click this
button and in here it has created a file
called test dot text and when I open
this file in a text editor so for
example I will open it with WordPad it
will open the text file and it has
sorted in this word text picture this is
my youtube channel now how to insert
multiple lines in this text file so I
will close this file and what I will do
is I will just copy this file dot write
line and I will just paste it two or
three times and now when I run the
program and when I click this create
text file and when I open the step text
file once again it create multiple lines
of code right so in this way you can
create a file and write text or insert
text into that text file with the help
of your visual basic windows form
application I hope you have enjoyed this
