last video I have shown you how to use
inheritance in C++ and I have shown you
how you can create a base class and
create a derived class from which you
can inherit from base class so we have
seen in the last video that our shape is
our base class are given you an example
of this polygon and types of polygons
right and the polygon for example shape
class words our base class and the
rectangle which was inheriting this
shape class was the derived class right
so we were just calculating the area of
rectangle using the inheritance method
in this example right if you haven't
remember this example just watched the
last video and in this video I am going
to show you that it's not only that you
can inherit from one class it's also
allowed to multiple inheritance or
inherit from multiple classes in C++ so
if you remember we have created in the
last video a shape class which was our
base class and the rectangle class which
was our derived class let's create one
more base class for example class and I
will name it as description which will
give us the description of any any class
right and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a simple program print
and what it takes it takes a string
which gives us the description okay so
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
print STD C out and then I'm going to
print we are using and then I'm going to
give the space and I'm going to use this
description variable which I'm passing
it as an argument and I can just say
class okay and I will end line okay so
this is a very simple class let me give
the access modifier also okay so this is
a very simple base class and what it
does is it just gives us the description
of whatever we pass as an argument right
so one class which is a shaped class we
have used this class in the last video
as a base class and for example we want
to use this description class also as a
base class for our rectangular class so
what we can do we can multiple inherit
from shape class as well as your
description class and how you can do you
can just separate your inheritance by a
comma or in base classes by a comma so
now this rectangle is inheriting from
shape class as well as description class
but don't forget to give this excess
pacifier to every base class here okay
so we are inheriting from two classes
and now in the main I have created if
you have remembered that I have created
a object called rectangle rec and I can
calculate or set the values using this
set when you method from our shape base
class right so from our rectangle object
which is an object of our rectangle
class we can access the method from the
base class which was the shape class in
a similar way we can access the method
from description class from or by using
the object of our rectangle class
because we are inheriting from our
description class into the rectangle
class also right so what we can do is we
can just in the next line we can use
this rectangle class or object and we
can whenever we just write dot separator
we can see the print method is also
available which is a method we you have
defined in the description class right
but because we are inheriting from
description class it's available to the
object of your rectangle class also just
use this and you can just give a string
as a parameter and for example I can say
rectangle okay so we passed rectangle as
a parameter now I'm going to run the
program I need to build it first and
then run the program
I'm going to run this and now you can
see we are using the rectangle class
right so in this way you can inherit and
inherit from multiple classes and all
the function or member functional member
variables are available for you J usage
by the instance of the derived class
also okay so this is from the base class
function write this in the last video we
have seen this we have defined in the
base class in a similar way this print
method we have defined in the base class
called description we haven't defined
any print method in the rectangle class
but even though even then also we will
be able to use this print method from
the description class because we are
inheriting from the description class in
the rectangle class and whenever we
inherit the public and protected members
of the base class are available for user
use to the derived class okay so in this
way you can do multiple inheritance in
C++ I hope you have enjoyed this video
