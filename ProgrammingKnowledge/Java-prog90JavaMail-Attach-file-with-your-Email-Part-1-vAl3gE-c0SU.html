last video I have shown you how to make
your email code a little bit interactive
in this video I will show you how to
attach a file with your email or Java
mail code so what you have to do first
is to take a button from a pallet and I
will name it as attached and I will also
change its variable name and I will name
it as attached also so by clicking this
button I will attach my document to my
email and now we go to event action in
action perform and what I will do is I
will go at the bottom and I will declare
the string
variable name which is attached part H
attachment so give a string variable
name attachment path so it will be a
global variable so we can use in
different method now once again I will
go to my attach event actionperformed
and this is my attach even action
performed here right yes
so this is my attache event
actionperformed and here you have to
paste this code this is the code I have
shown you in my 49th video of
jfilechooser so jfilechooser what is it
does is it chooses a file from anywhere
and place it in your path so what I mean
by that is this is your attachment
button and for example you have taken a
text field here and you will name it as
name it as path attached and like this
so whenever you click this button your
path will be shown here so you know that
which file you have attached and one
more text field I will take which way
the attach name so this is going to be
the name of the attachment so you can
give the name to your attachment from
this text field so let's see how our
code in looks cool now
so in when you click this and Jay are
jfilechooser option will come and you
could be able to choose some file and
your attachment path will come here and
you can give the attachment name right
now we have written this code now we'll
go to the - button action performed and
whatever strings declared earlier
attachment path below I mean go to my
method and I will paste it here and here
so my path is transferred to this where
you will string variable and my part
attach variable name is path attached I
will replace this path by path attached
so write this code in order to attach
your file and take your file path into
the variable attach path so I think the
time is not enough for the attachment
code in this video so I will show you
the attachment code in the next video so
till then bye
and please create comment or subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
