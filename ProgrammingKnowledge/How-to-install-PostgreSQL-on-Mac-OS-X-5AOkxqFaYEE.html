you how you can download and install
PostgreSQL on your Mac operating system
so let's get started and let's see how
we can do it so there are several way of
downloading and installing postre on
your Mac operating system we are going
to see one of them which I feel is the
easiest way so just search for
PostgreSQL on your favorite browser and
then in the search results just click on
the option which says post gray SQL dot
o-r-g so we need to go into this website
which is PostgreSQL urg just go into
that website and then just click on the
Downloads option and here choose the Mac
OS option and there you will see several
options to download so first is the
interactive installer by Enterprise dB
second is the graphical installer by big
SQL and the third is post gray post
waste dot app so we are going to choose
the third option which is Postgres dot
app so just choose this option and just
click this link which says post Gray's
dot app ok so I'm going to just click
that link and in here this is the
download button for Postgres dot app so
I'm going to just click this button
which is going to download the dot dmg
file ok so I will wait for the download
to complete its about 147 megabyte file
so it will take some time to download so
I will just wait for the download to
complete and then we will see how we can
start our server and how we can connect
to our server so now this dmg file is
downloaded so I'm going to double click
on this dmg file and I'm going to
minimize the browser and first of all
it's going to open this dmg file and
then it will ask us to copy this dmg
file to the Applications folder so we
are going to do that we are going to
just grab this icon and then place it to
applications which is going to start
copying this post grace SQL months this
post-race is copied into our
Applications folder I'm going to just
close this and then I'm going to go to
my launchpad so just go to the launchpad
and you will be able to see this icon
for the post-race so i'm going to double
click on this post quest icon and then
it's going to verify this application
first and maybe it's going to give us
some warning and now I'm going to just
click open here it's going to open this
kind of interface right so we can see
first of all that post way server is not
running so we will first of all
initialize the post que server by
clicking this button so just click
initialize first of all who is going to
initialize and most probably start the
SQL server so you can see this status
here the server is running now and you
can see these users for the databases
right now let's go to the website once
again for this download page so just go
to the same website Postgres app comm
from where we have downloaded and we
will scroll down a little so you can see
we have already executed the second step
which is initializing now the third step
is to configure your path so we need to
execute this command in order to just
configure the paths so I'm going to just
open the terminal first of all and then
I'm going to just copy all of this
command from sudo to the end of this
command so from sudo to here I'm going
to just copy this command and then paste
to my terminal and then just press Enter
which is going to ask me for my Mac's
password because I have used sudo here
right so it's the Mac's password so I'm
going to give the Mac's password and now
this path is set right so once this path
is set you can just write P SQL command
here and then press Enter
and then it says P SQL is
cannot be found because we need to
restart our terminal so I'm going to
just close the terminal and then restart
it once again and then I'm going to try
to connect to the post grace user right
so I'm going to minimize the browser and
then you can see there is post grace
user
there's your user name and there is one
more user here right so I will just give
P SQL command and then - capital you for
the username and then post Chris right
so post grace is this username this one
post grace right so just write Postgres
and then press Enter
and now you are in the interactive shell
here you can execute some command so for
example I want to list out all the
databases so I will just write backslash
list here and then press Enter which is
going to give me the list of all the
databases you can see post grace is
there code bind is there and these two
templates zero and template one is there
right so in order to create a new
database I can just write create
database and the database name so I will
just write test DB for example and then
semicolon semicolon is really important
here so don't forget to give the
semicolon after your queries and then
press Enter which will give us this
result create database that means the
database is created so we will once
again give this backslash list command
and see if it's there or not so you can
see this new database is created which
is testdb
right so in order to use this database
or in order to connect to this database
I can just write back slash connect test
dB
okay so back slash connect test DB and
then I'm connected to the test DB
database right now in order to connect
once again to the Postgres database I
can just write back slash Postgres
instead of test DB so just right
Connect post-race and press ENTER and
now I'm into the Postgres database if
you want to delete the database we can
just right drop database and then the
database name which is test DB in our
case and then press Enter
which will give us this result drop
database and once again when we give
this list command now this database is
no longer there right now let me once
again create this database using this
create database test DB come on because
I want to show you that this database is
shown in this interactive UI also so you
can see this database is created right
and once I drop this database this
database will be deleted from this UI
also you can see here so this is how you
can download and install PostgreSQL
server and interact with it using the
shell on your Mac operating system I
