last video I have shown you how you can
create your SQLite database and connect
it to your Java GUI application so I
have shown you how to create a database
and how to connect this database to your
Eclipse web builder GUI application
right so we have tested our connection
like this so whenever we run the program
it shows connection successful that
means the connection with the database
is successful ok and it opens the login
page but in this login frame we haven't
Rob I mean we haven't inserted any tools
or components here so in this video I am
going to show you how you can create a
login page with checks the username and
password from the database so it
validates user name and password from
the database and if there's that
username and password is correct then it
will give you some message if it's
correct or not so let's get started
first of all I will just make this
window a little bit bigger by
double-clicking this login dot Java and
we have some space to work with now
right so what I'm going to do is I will
just resize this a little and I'm going
to take this absolute layout and I will
just place it on this login panel and I
will take two labels
label one and label 2
so once again label to okay so I have
taken these two labels and then I will
take the text box Xbox one and
Xbox too
okay so I have two labels and two text
boxes and I will take a button which we
whenever user clicks he will be able to
log in so take a button once again take
a button here and now I will change the
names of these labels or variable name
or I will leave these names for the
label as it is you know how to change
the name but will be added variable name
but I will change the text of these
labels as first is user name it should
be user name and the second label text
will be why it goes to the so first
label text will be user name and the
second label text will be
password right and then what I am going
to do is I remember one thing whenever
you use or enter any username and
password the password is always hidden
it should be hidden right otherwise the
other users can see your password and
there is no meaning of password right so
I will delete this text box because it
will show my password to the other user
and what I can use is this password tool
so this there is a tool called J
password field and this tool we
specifically use for passwords so just
click this and just leave it on your
frame and this we use for entering the
password ok so I will resize this M here
and this we will use for entering the
password and properties of this password
you can see here just click this
password field and you will be able to
see that echo care and you can change
this echo care to any character and this
will be or your password will be marked
masked with this character so you can
use dollar sign here or you can use hash
or any other character and it will mask
this character will mask all of your
password so we have done that and I will
change the variable name of these text
field for user names XP text field u n
for example and for password this text
field I will name it as password field
so it's the name already suggests that
is the password field so I will not
change the name of the field but here
this I will change the text of this
button as login and I will change the
name of this button as BTN login okay so
now we have this and maybe you can
resize it so that you can see user name
and password and you can you know play
with the properties for this okay and
now what I'm going to do is I will
select this login button right click it
add event handler action perform action
perform and this will lead me to this
login button action perform method right
and inside this method I am going to
write a code to check the login or
username and password right so first of
all I will just make a try and catch
block so if any error
occurs it will catch the error so I will
just copy the previous code for
try-catch and I will paste it in action
perform method and I will remove all the
other code other than my try catch
blocks so I have this try catch long so
if any error will occur it will catch
the any exception okay now in this try
block first thing I will do is I will
create a query with the database if you
remember in the last video in this login
dot java we have initialized our
connection by our SQLite connection dot
DB connector function so we have this
connection with the database in this
object which is called connection which
we have created where we have created
this connection let us see so this is
the connection we have created right so
this is an object of connection which is
a Java dot SQL class connection and so
if you don't recognize this just watch
the last video once again okay so I am
going to use this connection once again
but yeah now to the button click event
or action perform event of this login
button in this try block first of all
what I need to do is I need to prepare a
query which I want to pass to the
database so I will prepare a query which
is a string variable string
I will name it as query itself is equal
to and in the double quotes and the
semicolon I will write the query so what
is the query I am going to pass select
Asterix or select as Strix means select
all wrong the database table name
so my table name here is employee info
this I have shown you in the last video
the table name and how to create the
database right so select star or
asterisk from your table name and then
we will write a ver gloss so just right
where you are
username so what is the name of username
just as username and password right so
we're username
user name by the way SQLite is a non
case-sensitive language so whatever
squarey you are passing it can be in
uppercase or lowercase but Java is a
case-sensitive language so you cannot
play with these objects and variables
but yeah whenever you pass the query
whenever you are building the query you
can use uppercase or lowercase depending
upon your priority so selects all from
your table name where username is equal
to question mark and password is equal
to is equal to also question mark okay
this is my query now I need to make a
prepared statement from this query so
what I will do I will write prepared
treatment
if the spelling is correct I do not
think it is correct
let me see okay so we will go further is
equal to then what I need to do here I
need to pass the query to the prepared
statement right so I will make a object
of this prepared statement I will name
it as PST for prepared statement okay
and then I will write connection which
is my object which I have created in the
last video which is connection object
this one connection connection is equal
to null right so prepared statement PST
is equal to connection dot prepared
statement and it takes my query so you
see here it takes the query so I will
write Gwennie and this is the query I am
passing here so I'm passing the query to
the prepared statement then I will
prepare our result set but before that
with this prepared statement I want to
pass the values from the text boxes
which the user will enter to the
prepared statement
so I will write p st dot set string this
will be set string and this will take
two argument the first argument will be
the parameter index so parameter index
is what because we are using two
question mark the index parameter index
of username is zero and parameter index
of password is one right so the index
starts from zero and whatever number of
question mark here you have that much
index view will have so the first
question mark we will have the zero
index and this and the second argument
for this PSD cell string is the value
which you are getting from the text
boxes so
to the design view unable to okay so I
will for now I will take this name which
is text field un and I will get the text
so I will write dot get text okay in the
same way I will just use PST get text
for the password
okay so PST dot red string and the index
will be now one zero index for username
index one for password right and the
username or password field name is this
one password field dot get text and as
soon as you see here get text it it's it
has the line above Catholics that means
it will not get text it will mask here
or a password field by the mask you see
get text from the password field is
deprecated okay so I don't right now
let's see I will use it as it is if it
shows me any error I will use some other
method for now I will use like this only
okay so now I have these values in my
query now I want our result set right so
I will right
result set I will name it as RS is equal
to and then this result set will execute
my query okay so what I can do
PST which is my prepared statement this
is the statement I have prepared dot
execute query whatever a query I pass in
that statement I want to execute that
query okay so now whenever I execute
this query this query will be executed
and the result will be transferred to
this RS object okay so in the next line
what I am going to do I will make a
while loop because this RS object gives
the value one by one so I will use while
