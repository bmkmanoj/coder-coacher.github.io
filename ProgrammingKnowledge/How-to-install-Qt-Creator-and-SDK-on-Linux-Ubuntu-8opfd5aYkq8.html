QT on Linux so we will choose this first
option and I will click this link and it
will allow me to save this download so I
will say save download and it will start
the download
so it's downloading and by the meantime
I will go into my download folder
so now it's downloaded and now I will go
to downloads and I have this QT run file
so you can see the extension QT open
source and the version and dot run first
thing you need to do is just right click
this and go to the properties and go to
the permission and if this execute allow
executing file as program is unchecked
just check it and just close with this
and now just double click this
executable file so I will double click
it and our QT setup will start first I
will say next and it will retrieve
component information from remote
repository and if you want to change the
path then you can change it from here I
will leave it as default click Next and
here you can choose the version you want
to install so I want the latest version

and now all the license information I
will say yes I want to install it and
say next and I will say install so it
will stall start installing QT on my
Ubuntu operating system yeah you can see

see how much time it takes I will pause
the video until it reaches 100 and then
continue with the demonstration so now
our QT installation is complete I will
click finish here and it will launch the
new QT IDE in our Ubuntu operating
system so now our QT creator IDE is
launched on our operating system which
is Ubuntu and now you can start making a
new project and new QT projects one more
thing you can do is here on the left
hand side you cannot see the QT creator
icon you can go to dash home and search
for the Qt creator
so I'll write QT and
it's not here it's here
so here I can see the QT creator already
so what I can do is I can just say lock
to launcher and it will it will be
locked and if you once again close your
QT creator you will be able to see the
icon here and it will not go so that's
all for this video in the future videos

core C++ program with your QT creator in
Ubuntu using C make so if you aren't
