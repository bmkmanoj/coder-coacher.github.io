show you how you can create your first
Java GUI project in NetBeans GUI stands
for graphical user interface and using
NetBeans you can create really
interactive Java GUI applications so
let's get started first of all open your
NetBeans IDE
you probably have installed this IDE and
now what we are going to do is we are
going to go to file and we are going to
create a new project and in here you
will be able to see some categories and
projects so what you need to do is you
need to choose the category called Java
and in projects you just need to click
java application and click Next and in
here you will give the name of your
project so you can change the name of
your project like GUI
project for example and make sure that
create main class option is unchecked
here so by default it's checked and make
sure it's unchecked from here okay so if
it's checked make it unchecked and click
finish and it's going to create a simple
empty project for us and in here you can
see in your project source packages and
libraries by default created by NetBeans
now we are going to go to the source
package and inside this source package
we can create a new package by clicking
default package right click on the
default package and create new package
you can see Java package here and you
can give the name of your bracket for
example my package ok and click finish
and it's going to create a package for
you
and you can right-click on this package
right click and new and now we are going
to choose jframe form ok jframe form so
just select jframe form and you can give
the name to your j3 form for example my
first form and create finish what it's
going to do is it's going to create rj
frame which looks like this a frame for
you which is a empty frame and inside
this frame what you can do is you can
design your GUI using this controls on
the right which is in the palettes ok so
you can drag and drop a label you can
drag and drop a button or any other
control from this palette ok now we want
to create a simple hello world program
using this J frames of what I'm going to
do is I can so what I did right now so I
can select this and I can remove this by
clicking the delete button so
you may be wondering how it's
disappearing strangely right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to choose this
button drag and drop a button inside my
frame and I can right click and add it
text ok so right click and click add it
text and I can edit the text of this
button so I can write the text for
example show message ok and I can select
this button and here you can see some
properties of this button I can change
ok so select your button and in here you
can change some properties like
background color foreground color and
other properties for example I want to
change the background color of this
button I can select this button and
choose the property called background
select this small button in front of
background and I can give the background
color to this button ok like this or I
can give the red color and click OK
and it will give the background color to
your button ok so you can change all the
properties or related to this button for
example there are font for your text you
can change text bold and 18 ok and the
font of your text will be changed
ok now what I want to do is I want to
write some code for my button so that
when I click this button it shows me
some message ok so here at the top you
can see we are right now in design mode
right and here you can see a source mode
so this is the design of view of our
frame and when you click the source view
you will see all the codes behind this J
frame ok so what we can do is we can
select our button and double click this
button so double click this button and
in here you will reach to the J
a button one action perform method okay
so what happens here is whenever you
click click double-click by default the
name of this button is you can see in
the properties the name of this button
is J button 1 okay you can change the
name of this button by right clicking
and change the variable name right now
it's J button 1 you can you know change
the name as my button or something like
this right my button okay so it's on you
but I'm not going to change this right
now I will leave it as default which is
J button 1 okay and whenever you double
click here it will create a method and
inside this method you can write your
code which will be performed whenever
you click this button ok so what you can
do is you can write a code to show the
message or J option pane so just write
inside this J button one action perform
method just write J option and just
write J option pane choose J option pain
from here and dot show message dialog
show message dialog and this J option
pane dot show message dialog takes two
arguments okay so what are these
arguments one is the context of this
class so you can just give this and
second argument is the message you want
to show ok so I can just write in the
double quotes hello world ok so just
write this one line of code which is G
option pain
Java is a case sensitive language so
make sure the case of this G option pain
is correct dot show message dialog and
inside we pass two argument one is the
context of this class
this and your message which is in double
quotes hello world okay okay so now what
you can do is once you have done
creating your code you can click this
green button from here it will build and
you know run your program so you can
choose your frame from here run project
we have only have one project if you
have multiple project you need to choose
your project from here and click OK and
it's going to run our GUI program you
can see we have changed the background
color of this button so you can see the
red color on this button and whenever I
click this show message is going to show
me in this pop-up window or J option
pane and it's going to give me hello
world okay I can click OK and it
disappears once again click HelloWorld
okay so in this way you can create your
first HelloWorld GUI program in NetBeans
