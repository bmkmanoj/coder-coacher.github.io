last video I have shown you how to
create a CH M file so this CH M file you
can use with your C sharp a project or
with your visual C++ project or any
other visual studio project very easily
so let me show you in the last video I
have shown you how to create this kind
of CH M file generally these type of
file we use as a usual user manual or
help desk or maybe sometimes we can use
it to publish a book online and this you
can create very easily and I have shown
you how you can create a very simple
CHM file with a tool which we have
downloaded in the last video so in this
video I will show you how to open this
CHM file with Yosi sharp project so
generally if we see here your help
is in the tool strip so we are going to
take a tool strip or a menu bar you can
take any of them so for example I take
menu strip and here you can provide a
menu item or text box or whatever you
want so for example I provide a menu
item and once again a new item and I
name it as
help and here I will go one further down
and I will create a user manual menu tab
and when I click this menu tab I wish to
my menu manuals tool strip menu item
click event right and here I simply
write help dot show help and in the
bracket we pass to argument one argument
is this comma and second argument is the
path to your CH m file so we write file
colon forward slash and now you can give
the path of this coolant should be
single cool and now you can part the
give the path of your CH M file which is
our compiled HTML help file so I will
right click go to the properties go to
securities and I will copy all the path
of the file which is a CH M file just
remember that okay and I will go to my
project and I will paste it here and
because I have single slash I will make
all the slash slash its double so it
will not show me any error okay so this
is the path to my CH m file and now I
just simply
run my program and it's running will
succeed and so by program is running now
I can go to this menu strip and I will
click use a manual and you can see here
this help manual is open now so it's
very easy to create a help manual or
user manual for your software with this
procedure so I hope you will use this
technique with your project and I hope
you have enjoyed this video please keep
watching these videos and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
