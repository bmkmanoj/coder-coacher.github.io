video I will show you how to pass values
between two forms using your c-sharp
application so here I have two form form
one and form two and I want to pass some
value from form one to form two so I
will show you a simple example first how
to pass the values from one form to
other and then we will go to our
original application which we are
developing or we have been developing in
which I login and the second form opens
and in here I will also show you how to
show the user name to the second form
when he logs in and the second form will
say hello or welcome the username
whatever username you enter so first of
all I will show you the simple way so
you understand the concept and then I
will go to our application so I have
first form and second form here okay and
in the second form I will take a textbox
and pass it here okay and I'm not
changing the name of the textbox its
text from text box 1 and in here I will
take up text box once again and I will
take a button sorry
button so I will take a button and I
will change its text as get
well you okay so in here when I press
this getvalue button I should get the
values which I enter in my second form
in this form whatever value I enter in
this text box it should come in this
text box okay so first of all you go to
your second form here and go to its code
here and go above here where your form
declaration is there public forum too
and in which your initial component
method is called so go here in this
bracket and here we will write string
and your value so I will write s T our
value string value okay so just declare
this data type string here in the
bracket and just below your initial
component initialize component method
just below that just copy the name of
your text box which is text box one
which is a default and just paste below
your initialize component function dot
text is equal to I will copy this string
value and paste it here and then closed
okay so write this code in this function
and just declare this string in the
bracket now we will go to the first form
in this design and we will double click
this get value
but and in here we will declare or we
will call second form so i will write
form two and give it a variable name
form two once again is equal to is equal
to new form two in the bracket we will
pass the string value because this form
two takes string according to the code
we have written okay so once again go to
button click event and in this bracket I
will copy the name of this text box
which I am passing so I will copy the
name which is text box one once again
and in here and form two I will pass the
values so dot
text okay and then in the next line I
will just copy this form variable dot
show dialog and flick it closed here
okay so in the first form I have written
this two line of code and in the second
form I have written this one line here
and I have declared a string variable
here now I will run the program and in
France and in this bracket I will write
some string so hello You Tube sorry for
the spelling mistake and I just click
this get value button and you see the
same string is passed to the other form
here okay some other text la la and see
it comes to the second form so this is a
basic way you can pass the values from
one form to another now we will
implement this same code to our original
program which we have been developing so
this is the first form the login form
and our second form is this big form
here okay and for example I want to show
the name of the user who has logged in
so username whatever I and in this text
box I will pass to the second text box
and it will say something like welcome
the username okay so once again I will
go to the code of this and in here no
not here but in second form right so we
will go to the code of second form and
in here in the bracket I will once again
declare a string string user name this
is string right and after my initialized
component method I will write off first
of all I will take some text box no I
will take a label label will look good
and I will write yeah I will place it
here just for now it's not a good design
but it will just demonstrate what I want
to demonstrate so here this is label
seven so I will copy the name of this
label once again to the code and just
below that initialize component dot text
is equal to your string value from here
okay and then I go to the first form
which is my login form this one where is
it this one and in here when I have
pressed login button it should pass my
username from this form to another so I
will print this and this is the code we
have written to login into the form
right and it's showing here of the error
because this code is for the correct
username and password so if you are
using even password is correct you open
the second form but here it takes the
argument string that's why it's showing
the error
so I will just go to first form once
again I will just press this and I will
copy the name of this textbox they use a
name textbox okay and I will pass here
and wherever my form declaration form to
declaration is there so paste dot txt
and now the error will go and I want to
show some something like welcome and so
welcome username I want to pass it from
here
so I will write double quote and plus in
between this double quotes I will write
well come and this and then the username
dot txt and now I will run the program
and I will give my username and password
in my database I have the username admin
so I'm right here admin and the password
is root so and I press login and user
name and password is correct and you can
see if here welcome
admin so whoever logs in his name will
come here and he will be greeted with
his username so it's very useful when
you want to pass the values from one
form to other other I hope you have
