show you how you can install Kali Linux
on your Oracle VirtualBox virtual
machine so let's get started first of
all you need to have Kali Linux ISO file
in order to install it on your
VirtualBox
so hopefully you all have VirtualBox and
to get the ISO file for Kali Linux you
just need to open your favorite browser
and search for Kali Linux here and in
here the first link which will appear
here will be from Kali dot o-r-g and you
can see the download link from here but
we are going to open the Kali dodgy
first and then we will just click the
download link from here so you just need
to click this download link from here
and then in here you will be able to
find different versions of Kali Linux
right the one I have downloaded is this
one which is ISO file for 64-bit okay so
it's 2.6 GB file so it will take some
time to download so just download this
is this file which is the first option
here so after downloading this file it's
going to look like this it's a Kali -
Linux - 2016 point 1 - AMD 64 dot ISO
file ok so once this file is downloaded
we are ready to you know install it on
our VirtualBox so just open your
VirtualBox virtual machine and in here
we are going to create a new virtual
machine so just click this button which
says new and in here we will first of
all provide the name of our virtual
machine for example Kali and then it's a
Linux operating system so we need to
choose the type Linux and in here you
will not be able to find the Kali option
Kali Linux option here
right so the one we are going to choose
here is Debian 64 which is this option
okay so just choose this option which
says Debian 64-bit and then click Next
and in here you can choose the memory
size so I'm going to give the memory to
my virtual machine up to for example 4gb
ok and then I'm going to click Next and
in here it says hard drive so we are
going to create a virtual hard drive for
now so just choose this second option
which says create a virtual hard drive
now and then just click create ok
and in here you will be asked hard drive
file type so we want to make a VDI file
so just leave it as default which is the
first option checked and then click Next
and in here it will ask you for the
storage on the physical hard drive we
want to have the dynamically allocated
storage okay so it's not fixed size but
it will be grown dynamically so just
choose the first option here which is
dynamically allocated and then click
Next and then here you can allocate the
you know memory to your you know device
so for example I want to give around 20
GB to my virtual machine so I'm going to
just move it to 20 GB and then I will
just click create and it's going to
create this Kali virtual machine here ok
now once you created your virtual
machine you can choose this virtual
machine which is Kali and we are going
to do some settings from here because we
haven't given the path of the ISO file
yet right so just choose this option
Kali and then click this button which
says settings and in here first of all
we are going to
go to system here and you can see we
have given 4gb memory to our virtual
machine and just choose this option
which says processor and by default it's
given one processor for this virtual
machine right so we can increase it to
four so this depends upon you how many
numbers of processors you want to give
to your virtual machine I want to give
four processors right now we are going
to choose this option which say storage
and in the storage we are going to go to
controller ID and then choose host drive
D okay so just choose this option and
this will give you this kind of
interface here you just need to click
this CD icon here to provide the path to
your ISO file so just click the CD icon
and then click the first option which
says choose a virtual cd/dvd disk file
ok and from here you can just provide
the part to your ISO file which you have
downloaded ok so just choose the ISO
file which you have downloaded and then
click open and I'm going to minimize
this first of all so now you have given
the path for your ISO file for Kali
Linux right so we are going to just
click OK and then we are ready to start
our virtual machine so just choose the
option Kali and then just click this
button which say start and then it's
going to start the installation for your
operating system now in here it's going
to give this kind of installation
interface what we want to do is we want
to do the click graphical install so we
will just choose the graphical install
option here so just press the down
button and choose this option which says
the graphical install and then press
ENTER ok
and now the installation will start now
in here you
we'll be asked to choose your language
so select a language what we want is
English here so I'm going to leave it as
default but if you want to choose some
other language you can choose it from
here okay and then click continue and
then it's going to ask for the location
you are in and for example I want to
choose UK from here so I can choose UK
and then I can not click continue and
then it's going to ask for the keyboard
layout so the keyboard layout for
example I have German keyboard layout so
I can choose German from here otherwise
whatever keyboard layout you have you
can choose from here ok and then click
continue and now it's going to load the
Installer component from CD and it's
going to start the installation so just
you know wait for this progress bar to
reach 100% and then it's going to ask
for some more options which we can
provide from here ok so just wait for it
and now it's asking configure the
network and the default hostname it has
given is Kali itself so you can change
the default hostname from here it should
be one word name I will leave it as
default which is suit Olly and click
continue and in here it's going to ask
you the domain name I am going to leave
it as blank and click continue and now
you just need to give the password to
your operating system
so the choose the password which you can
remember for example I am going to give
some password here and once again I'm
going to repeat the password and then
I'm going to just click continue
ok and then it's going to just detect
the disk and it's going to once again do
some configurations so we need to wait
for it and now it's going to ask for the
partition disks we want to do the first
type which is guided you
entire disk so choose the first option
here and then click continue and in here
just choose the default option which is
this option and click continue and once
again choose the default option and
click continue
ok and in here also choose the last
option and click continue and now you
are asked that you just need to provide
a partition dis so right the changes to
the disk yes we want to write the
changes to the disk so we will choose
the es option here and then click
continue
now in the next step you are asked to
choose or use a network mirror and you
just need to choose the default option
which is es here and then click continue
and in here just leave it as blank and
click continue and just wait for this
progress bar to reach 100 once again ok
so we will wait once again now in the
next step it says install the grub boot
loader to the Master Boot Record so we
want to leave it as default which is es
and then click continue and in here we
need to choose the second option so when
it's asked that install the grub boot
loader on hard disks you need to choose
the second option which is dev /s da and
then click continue and just wait for
the installation to complete ok so now
our installation is complete and you can
see this message installation complete
right so we just need to click continue
so that it's going to restart this Kali
Linux operating system and then we are
going to see the login window so just
click continue which is going to finish
the installation and then it's going to
restart this virtual machine so just
wait for that and now it says finishing
the installation so we are going to wait
for the
the insulation to finish now we can see
the operating system is restarting so
don't do anything until you see the
login window
okay so just wait for the restart to
happen and we will be able to see our
login window so just wait for that login
window okay and now we can see this
login window and first of all it is
going to ask for the username the
default username is root here so just
give root username and then click Next
and the password will be the password
which you have set so I told you to
remember the password you just need to
fill the password which you have given
here right so I will give the password
and then I will click sign-in and once I
click sign-in hopefully we will be able
to see the Kali Linux desktop
environment right so just wait for this
and now I can see this desktop for Kali
Linux okay so in this way you can
download and install Kali Linux on your
VirtualBox I hope you have enjoyed this
