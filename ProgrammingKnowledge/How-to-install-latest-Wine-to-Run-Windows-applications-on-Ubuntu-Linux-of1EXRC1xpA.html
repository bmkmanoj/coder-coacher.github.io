show you how to install latest version
of wine on your Obon 2 operating system
wine is a tool by which you can run and
install windows apps and games on your
Linux operating system
ok so there are two ways you can install
wine on your open to operating system
first is by going to the Ubuntu Software
Center and search for wine but the
version of wine in this Ubuntu Software
Center is little bit old so when you
click this wine windows program loader
and more information you will see here
the version of wine is wine 1.41 right
so it is quite old whenever when we see
it on its website so for example I will
search for this wine wine HQ which is a
site for website for wine just search
for www-why neck you are G and in here
you will find here that the latest
version of wine is one point seven point
two three so I am going to show you how
you can install this latest version of
wine instead of installing this old
version of wine using this open top
Software Center so just open your
terminal and in here first of all we are
going to add the repository so just open
this terminal and just type this sudo
apt - sudo add - apt - repository space
PPA : ubuntu - wine slash ppm okay so
first of all just give this command and
press enter and give your password
and press enter
and once this is complete what you need
to do is you need to give the dis
command sudo apt - get update press
Enter
and once all the updates are there you
just need to give these commands pseudo
apt - get wine 1.7 because latest is 1.7
right and you just need to give sudo apt
- cat install install wine 1.7 okay and
+ Enter
click Y and plus enter
so with the help of this wine tool you
can even install Microsoft Office
Internet Explorer or any other software
which only runs on Windows but by using
this tool you will be able to run and or
you will be able to first install and
run that app on your open to operating
system you can even run games or you can
even install games using this wine tool
which only runs on Windows and if you
want to run these games on your Ubuntu
operating system you can do it using
this software so it's installing it will
take some time to install so I will just
pause the video and when this process is
complete I will show you how to find
this mine and how to use this
okay so installation is complete and now
you can find your wine tool by going to
this - home here just click this and
search for wine and you can see here
this is a tool which configures wine and
this is the tool which is called wine
tricks I do not know what it is but this
is the tool you want to use so just
click this
and it says the wine configuration in
home - Ubuntu and configures wine and it
will open wine and we are going to for
example for testing this mind let us try
to install some software or some some
app which only runs on Windows operating
system so for example I want to install
notepad plus plus which only installs on
Windows operating system and it does not
support Linux operating system so let us
install notepad plus plus so I will just
search for note the plus plus and the
first link here you will find here is
for node pad minus plus minus plus dot
o-r-g just go here and go to the
downloads and in here you will see that
can go back so you will see here only
the Windows installer is available
it's the installation for Linux
operating system is not available so
what I am going to do is I mean I will
just click or this download button which
will download the executable file in my
open to operating system so this
download is complete and then I will go
to the folder
it contains or its downloaded so here is
the executable file which I have
downloaded in my Ubuntu operating system
for notepad plus plus just go to that
executable file just click right click
this file ok so just right click this
executable file and you can just go to
open with and select wine windows
program loader ok once again just
right-click this executable file go to
open with and go to wine windows program
load up because you have already
installed wine this option will be shown
on your on your terminal or on your on
your right click options so in here you
can just select your language click OK
click Next click I agree and click Next
Next
and if you want to show the shortcut on
the desktop I want it so I will just
create shortcut on desktop and I will
say install that will install really
fast and once the installation is
finished I click finish and this notepad
plus plus will be launched
so this notepad plus plus by default it
runs on Windows but using this wine you
will be able to run this on your Ubuntu
operating system you can even find I
think this on your desktop also so I
will go to my desktop and you will find
the icon for this notepad plus plus on
your desktop screen also so in this way
you can install wine to run and install
Windows apps on your open to operating
system I hope you have enjoyed this
