video we will see how we can take some
average maximum and minimum of the
columns for example I have this table
and I want to find out the sum of all
ages of all employees or I want to find
out the average age of employees in my
company or I want to find out who is the
oldest person in my company or who is
the youngest person in my company how I
can do that I will show you right now so
in your query track tab right select age
from your database table name
and
now it's important to see this select
age hu cover with brackets and outside
this bracket right some so this will
give me the sum of ages of the employee
I will write it I will execute this
query and I can see here the sum of the
ages is 2 it is happen in the same way I
want to find the average so i will write
AVG before my age and I will execute the
query and you can see the average age of
employees in my company is 41 in the
same way I want to find the oldest
person so I will write max age and I
will execute the query and maximum age
of the employee in my company is 55 for
minimum wage just right
min and execute query the minimum age is
27
and suppose you want to find out how
many employees or how many rows my table
contains you can do or kind count your
nose also from writing count age or any
column you can write here for example
the name also now we give the query and
the number of rows in which name are
present is 7 so in this way you can use
this selects statement for finding out
maximum average minimum and some of
these values I hope you've learned
something new this time please rate
