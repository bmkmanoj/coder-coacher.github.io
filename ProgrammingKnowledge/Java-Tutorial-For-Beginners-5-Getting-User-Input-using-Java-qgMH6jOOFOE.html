tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to get user input using Java so for
example you want to enable user inputs a
user should give you the input and then
you want to perform some action on the
input how you can do it I will show you
in this video so there is a special
class in Java called
scanner which enables us to take input
so we will define scanner which is a
class or you can say this can be a data
type and then I can define a variable
for this data type or instance is equal
to new scanner and it takes some input
and what input it takes so to give the
output on the console we write says some
dot out right we have seen in the last
videos and to take input we gave system
dot in okay so this code will enable us
to take the input from the user now for
the first time when you write this code
you can see a red squiggly line below
the scanner so this is because we need
to add this class in our project or in
our project file that's why it's showing
error so when we compile this program it
will give us error I am going to compile
it and it says error exit in required
project
ok
so this there is an error when you go to
the problem tab here the errors a
scanner cannot be resolved okay so to
solve this problem you just need to
hover over the scanner and then eclipse
because it's an intelligent IDE it will
give you some suggestion to solve the
problem and the first suggestion is
import scanner and this is the solution
of this problem you just click import
scanner and it will add this line to
your code and this line is nothing but
it's importing the scanner class which
is already defined in Java so this is
provided by Java to you which helps us
to take the scan from the input from the
user right so you don't need to even
write anything you just hover over this
and click the first option and this will
be added okay now there will be no error
you see there is no error right now okay
now to show what input the user has
given you cannot tell a user that queue
system so we will write system dot out
dot println and in the brackets we can
ask the user and some number okay and
then in the next line we will define a
variable we have seen how to declare a
variable in the last video so for
example int user input
number this is the variable name this is
long but it you know explains the use of
this variable right and then you just
need to use this scan object which is
this one small scan and then you just
need to paste it here then just write
dot and when you write dot it will give
you some suggestions right and we are
looking for taking a number as an input
because this is integer right so we are
take interest in taking numbers as an
input so just search for next int okay
next int and then just give this
semicolon here in the next line we are
just going to print the value so we will
just print the entered value is the
entered value is and then you can just
print the value right so you can just
write print I haven't told you what is
the meaning of this print system dot out
dot print without Allen then this will
just print your output without breaking
the line ok so just copy this variable
from here and paste it here and now I am
going to run this program and now you
can see the output here is enter some
number so we will enter some number for
example thousand so we have given this
user input so it's asking the program is
asking the user to enter some number so
we have entered this number thousand and
press Enter
and it says the entered value is
thousand which is printed by these two
lines okay in the same way you can rerun
this program and once again you can give
some number for example some random
number and press ENTER and it says the
entered value is this okay
so in the same way this is just for the
number so next int it says you want or
you are expecting an integer now suppose
you want to scan all you want that the
user must enter some double value or
some text value how you can do this so
you can do this I will just copy the
same lines from here but instead of
using this scan
I am just defining another scanner which
is scan one and in here I will say enter
some decimal value okay and then I will
just change it to double and in here
whenever you are expecting double value
user input double then you need to
change this function so you need now
expecting double value scan dot next
double okay so whatever you are
expecting from here you need to ensure
that next after next this name comes
here right so right now you are
expecting the double value okay so what
we are doing in this code first we will
ask for a number then we will ask for
the double value and this can should be
changed to scan
one right we will compile the program
and first it says give the number I will
give number four two two two and it says
the entered value is four two two and
then it says enter some decimal value so
I will enter some decimal value one four
five point one five two three for
example and press Enter
it says enter value is the same right so
in this way you can take double as an
input okay
now for example you want to take some
text input okay
so takes to take a text input what you
need to do is you need to define here
string and a string is a data type which
you know takes a string string means the
array of characters right and in here
you just need to change it to scan dot
next line so we are expecting a line
from the user this time and please enter
some string and the entered string is
okay so string means some kind of text
we are expecting from the user okay and
this also we can change it to string and
the variable name here also we will
change a string now we when we run the
program here the program says please
enter some string we will enter hi there
how are you for example this is a string
and press ENTER and it says the entered
string is hi there how
you write so in this way you can take a
different kind of inputs from the user
and print it or assign it to some
variable and then use this variable in
your program in the same way in this in
the place of this next line there can be
different function which can call float
next float is their next simple next is
their which will return you the string
there are some function like next
boolean which can take a boolean value
next big decimal the next big integer
next by next float so whatever datatype
input you want to take you just need to
take the corresponding next value to
this okay
so I hope you understood the basic
concept of taking or scanning inputs
from the user and I hope you enjoyed
