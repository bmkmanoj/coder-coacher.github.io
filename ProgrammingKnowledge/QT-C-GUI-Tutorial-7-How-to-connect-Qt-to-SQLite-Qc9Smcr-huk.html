video I will show you how to connect
your QT GUI application with SQLite
database if you don't know about SQLite
database
I have tutorial on SQLite database also
just go to my channel and search for
this beginners SQLite tutorial and first
few videos you will be able to
understand what SQLite database is and
how you can make your own database and
how you can manage your database so they
are not many videos you just have to
watch three videos and you will be able
to deal with SQLite database now I will
create a new project in QT so I will
open new project application QT GUI
application choose and I will name my
project as a skill light
DB project and I click Next
just change the location if you want
click Next and if you want you can
change this main window name so I will
name it as login window because I'm
going to make in next few videos a login
application which so you can log in and
open the next page if the username and
password is correct but in this video we
will see how to connect with SQLite so
click Next and click finish and the new
database is formed which is called
SQLite DB ok now what I will do is first
of all I will go to my forms and go to
login UI and here I will just search for
a label for this application I just need
a label to show the message whether I am
connected to the database or not so
label and I will go to the properties so
I select label and go to the properties
here and I will change its text to for
example status
so it will tell that status of the
database okay now I will go to added
once again click here and in here I will
go to the headers of my project so I
have login dot H so I will go here and
here I will define some includes but
before that just go to SQLite your
project name dot PR Oh file ok just go
to your project dot PR o file and in
here you will see Qt and plus is equal
to core and gooey and we will add one
more application here called SQL so just
make a space after GUI and write SQL and
after writing this we will save our file
which is SQLite dot P R Oh file and what
we will do is we will right-click our
project and we will say run queue make
so when you run queue make this file
will be compiled which is your SQLite
dot PR o file and now your project knows
that you are working with your SQLite or
SQL databases now just go to the header
file login dot H and here we are going
to include some files so make some space
and I will include include
cutie SQL first of all and second is
include
QT debug and third maybe we can include
QT file
q
file info okay so we have added these
three file this should be Q debug files
okay so just include these three files
and now we will go to the CPP file here
and in here we will add some code so go
here in the constructor where your UI
setup UI and this code is there and here
we will write QT SQLite sorry q
q SQL database and give your database
our name so I will name my database as
my DB for example is equal to and then I
will write once again and we copy this
cutie and then the MU :
that database name and what is the name
of our database it's Q s ql right okay
so I think this should be dot add
database so write this and in the next
line just copy your database name which
is my DB and just paste it and write dot
set database name and in here you will
be having the database you have created
the X collide database so just wherever
you have created your database which is
SQLite database so just go there and
just copy the path to that database and
just paste it here and you can replace
these slash with these forward slashes
like this and my database name is
database dot DB so just copy the
database name also database dot DB okay
so this is the path to my database file
which i have already created and which
is my SQLite file okay so write this and
then write if your my SQL of my DB for
which is my SQL SQL database variable
dot open so if this database is open we
will say or we will set our label as
you I
and then your label name this is my
label name which is default and then set
text and I will say database is
connected so instead of this MySQL open
we will check for if it's not open then
we will pass the fail message so right
this so remember to pass this not equal
to sign and then right
fail to open the database or else if our
database is open we will show you I
label set text is equal to
connected so what we have done is we
have created a database object which is
cue SQL database object and we say that
this is a SQLite database and then we
have given the database name and we have
provided the path to the database here
so MySQL dot set database name and the
path to the database and if my database
is not open then I will say fail to open
the database or else I have connected to
my database okay so this all is in this
constructor now let's try to run the
program and by the way if you don't know
what this label is this is just go to
your login dot UI and this is this label
right so this label name is label here
if you can see so that is that label and
now I will run my program so I will
click this button and I will say save
all and you see here I am connected to
my database that means my connection to
my SQLite database is successful let's
check if my database is not connected so
if I am not connected to my database so
I will just go to my login dot CPP file
and I provide the wrong path to my
database so I delete some of the path
information for example I delete this
slash sign and let's see if it still
connects to the database or not ideally
it should not connect to the database
cause it's not getting the right path to
the database and it should not get the
name of the database so let's check if
it works or not I will run my program
and now it says failed to open the
database okay so in this way I know that
if I don't provide the right path to the
database it will give me the fail
message or otherwise it will give me the
message that I am connected to the
database so in this way you can connect
your cutie GUI application with SQLite
database in the next few videos I will
show you how to create a login page or
login application with your SQLite
database and your QT GUI application so
stay tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
