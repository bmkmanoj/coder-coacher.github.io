JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can download
and install scene builder on our Windows
operating system and integrate it with
our Eclipse IDE
JavaFX scene builder is a visual layout
tool that lets use a quickly design Java
FX application user interface so let's
see how we can install scene milder on
our Windows operating system first so
open your favorite browser and search
for scene builder now Oracle somehow
decided to no longer provide the build
for Java FX scene builder tool in other
words Oracle will no longer provides a
build for the scene builder and there is
a company called gluon which decided to
make the binary and maintain the build
for the scene builder okay so we are
going to go to this website which is
gluon HQ which maintains the scene
builder build tool okay so just in your
search result search for the website
called gluon hq.com
okay and click this link I will provide
the link in the description so that you
can directly click on this link and come
here on this website and in here you can
see there are bills for every operating
system for example Mac OS or Linux or
Windows ok so here we can download this
binary file so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to just install the 64-bit
executable file which is this option so
just click download and it's going to
download the scene builder on our
operating system now once this
executable is installed you just need to
click this executable file and now you
just need to click install
and it's not a big installation it will
be installed immediately and after the
installation you will be able to see the
scene builder directly launched so this
is how your scene builder looks like but
still it's not properly installed so
what you need to do is you need to close
a scene builder and there is a
particular location where scene builder
will be installed so open your folder
Explorer and in here go to your C folder
and in the C folder go to users
directory and in the users directory go
to your computer name folder for me it's
programming knowledge it can be your
name or something here and in here
go to the folder called app data and in
the app data go to the folder called
local and in here you will be able to
see the scene builder here and inside
this you will be able to see scene
builder executable file right so what
you need to do is you just need to cut
this folder from here which is scene
builder and then go to your C folder and
paste it here itself ok so we know that
scene builder is here right so now the
location for the scene builder is in
your C folder so I will paste the link
of this location where scene builder was
initially installed so that you won't be
confused now once this is done just open
your Eclipse IDE and open your project
on which you were working for example I
am working on this project and I will
create a new F XML file here
so right click on your source folder and
go to new and in here go to others and
in other go to Java FX and in the JavaFX
you will be able to see this new F
XML document right so you can just click
Next and give the name to your F XML
file so for example I will give it a
name mean and I will click finish ok and
this is how your main dot F XML file
looks like okay now to configure this
scene builder with your Eclipse IDE what
you need to do is go to the windows tab
here and then go to preferences and in
the preferences
search for Java FX here and select Java
effects and then you will be able to see
the scene builder executable so you need
to browse for the scene builder
executable so it will be in your C
folder because we have pasted this
folder in our C folder and select this
scene builder dot exe from here and
click OK right and then click apply and
click OK now you can right click on your
main dot F XML file and then open with
scene builder so you can select this
option which says open with scene
builder and now this file will be opened
inside your scene builder right so
initially you will see an copain on the
left hand side here in the hierarchy and
this is our route and inside this NGO
pane we can drag and drop our control so
container or other widgets ok
so for just testing for example we want
to add a button here so we can add this
button by dragging and dropping into
this area here right so drag and drop
this button here and after you drag and
drop this button what you will see here
is there is nothing visible but you will
be able to see when you select this area
there is a small point here so you need
to
like this point and make it bigger okay
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to just select this button and I
can see this button is placed here so I
can drag and drop into my anchor pin
like this okay so now we have this n
copain and button here now to add this
to the Eclipse IDE and run it what we
can do is first of all we need to save
it so go to file and then just click
Save here okay and it's going to save
and now go to Eclipse IDE and you can
see this main dot F XML file is added
and I can see this button here right now
go to your Java file which you have
created so this is the Java file which
we have created in the last video and
this was a code we have written so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to remove
all this code from here and I will
remove this root dot children from here
also and I'm going to remove this VBox
root also right and even I am going to
remove these sizes which I have given
here and now what I'm going to do here
is I'm going to write this code which is
parent which is a class and give the
object name root for example which is
passed here in the scene and then is
equal to FXM el loader dot load and
inside the bracket write the code get
class dot get resource and inside these
double quotes we can give the location
for our effects ml file okay so our F
XML file name is main dot F XML so just
write that main dot F X ml and then you
will see here it will show some error
because we need to import this parent
class and we need to import this
XML loader class right so import both
these and the error will go and then
save your code and run it once again and
now you will be able to see this button
in your a stage inside the scene right
so for example I will close this and
once again I will go to my scene builder
and I will drag and drop one more button
here and for example one more button
here and once again I will save my F XML
file save it and once again save your
file here main dot F XML you can see
three buttons added to our main dot F
XML so I will run it once again and now
I can see three buttons here right so in
this way you can download and install
scene builder on our Windows operating
system and integrate it with Eclipse IDE
