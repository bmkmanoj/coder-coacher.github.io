tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are hash set or sets and how we can
use hash set in Java earlier in this
series we have seen how to use arraylist
and linkedlist in java or we can say we
have seen how to use lists in general in
Java
now hash set belongs to the set category
and the basic difference between lists
and sets is that lists can contain
duplicate elements but a set can only
contain unique element so it cannot
contain duplicate elements now let's see
how we can declare headset so you need
to have this import called import Java
dot util dot asterisk which is a
wild-card which includes all the all the
classes which are there in the util
namespace and now let's see how we can
declare hash set so hash set starts with
the keyword hash set and then in this
angular bracket comes the datatype it
can be integer or double or string or
the end datatype of your set then comes
the name of your hash set or variable
name is equal to new not like this but
new hash set and then once again comes
string and then you can define the
length of the head shed it's optional
and this can be overloaded with the size
or different ways okay so whenever you
hover over this hash set you can see how
you can use this
struktur okay now it generally works in
the same way as any list or ArrayList to
add elements so let's see how we can add
element to the set so we will use our
name hash set dot add and then we can
add some string okay so for example I
want to add some name and some other
names in the same way you can add
multiple names of multiple values which
are not duplicate values so Tom check
some other name some other name okay and
now when you compile your program it's
okay but let's set say it has a
duplicate entry it will compile I think
but when you try to access these value
it will give you some errors okay so in
this way you can use hash set and to
access the values in the hash set what
you can do is you can use iterator so in
the last video we have seen how to use
lists iterators in the same way you can
use iterators normally which you can use
to iterate over your hash set or set in
general and you just need to use this
iterator keyword and then the data type
of your list which is string in my case
then your variable name for example ITR
is equal to your name of your hash set
dot iterator
okay and then this ITR you can use to
iterate over your values for example I
can use while I TR dot has next as we
have seen in the last video if it has
next value then we can use sis Oh
control shift and then I TR dot not here
but idea dot next right idea dot next in
a similar way you can iterate over the
list in reverse order let's compile it
once so it it raise over the list and
gives or prints our list in ascending
order from top to bottom if you want to
print your list in bottom to top order
or in reverse order what you can do is
instead of this has next you can use has
previous so search for has previous and
then you can iterate over your list in
reverse order okay but as we have seen
in the last video that lists iterator
has has previous and previous value the
iterators for the sets doesn't have this
has a previous and previous values you
can see there is no method called has
previous or previous values okay so only
lists iterators have has previous and
previous values but they have some other
method like remove or clear this list if
you want to remove the values you can
use remove or clear method so for
example I want
- clear let's iterate over using hasnext
and before this we will remove some
values so for example name dot remove on
the basis of object you can remove or
you can remove on the basis of your your
collection or you can see these are the
options you have to remove the values
right or if you want to clear you can
just use name dot clear and it will
clear all the values from your hash set
right so it will clear all the values
and whenever you run the program you
will not see anything here because it
has already been cleared it has some
other method so you can see you can
check the size of your list by using dot
size method you can check if the list is
empty or not using is empty method you
can use add we have already seen you can
add or arm on the basis of some
conditions and there are some method you
can try which you want to use so you can
just hover over this method and you will
be able to see it's used when you hover
over it so I hope you have enjoyed this
