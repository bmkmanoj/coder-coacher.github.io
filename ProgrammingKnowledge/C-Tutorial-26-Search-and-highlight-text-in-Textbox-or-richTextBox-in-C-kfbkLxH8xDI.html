last video I have shown you how to open
a text file into this rich text area by
using a button so for example I click
Open File button and I select any file
and it opens in this open text area now
in this video I will show you if I want
to find or search some word in this text
so how can I find that word and
highlight it by using the c-sharp code I
will show you in this video so I will
show an example what I'm talking about
so I have loaded this text in this text
area and now for example I want to
search for a word end in this whole text
which is in text area so I will write
the word and and I will press search and
you see all and in the text are
highlighted with red color right so this
thing I will show you in this video so
let's see how I have done this first of
all if you have seen the last video I
have shown you the code to load a text
file by using this button in the last
video so just copy that same code from
there in the Open File button so if you
don't know this code please follow my
last two videos I have shown you there
how to open a file and show it into the
rich text box the new thing this time I
have taken a text box from the toolbox
so I have dragged this text box
and paste it here okay and I have taken
a button and I have changed is its text
as such so I have taken two new things
these two things are from the previous
videos okay and these are the two new
things and now this text box name is
Xbox one so remember this name and now I
will when I double click this button I
will reach to the code of the search
button click event so in here write int
and declare a variable called index is
equal to 0 and then declare a string
variable called temp is equal to rich
Bob textbox dot txt this is your this
rich text box name so rich text box one
dot text here and then just clean your
rich text box so rich text box dot text
is equal to double quote and just
complete your code then write which text
box dot text is equal to temp and
semicolon so declare these variable and
write this and then when you are done
with the declaration write Y index which
is this variable is smaller than rich
text box which is our rich text box name
dot text dot last index of your text box
name so this text box name
dot text so by this while index is less
than rich text box dot text dot last
index of your text box name dot text
okay and then in the while loop this is
a while loop in the while loop right
rich text box one which is the name of
your rich text box not find and in the
bracket we will pass three variables
first is the text for which we are
searching searching for so right text
box one dot text so this is whatever
text you will write in the text box one
that word it will search so that's why I
have write written this text box dot
text comma index so this is the index
which we have declared above comma rich
text box dot text length so this is the
rich text box and we are passing the
length of your rich text box text comma
which text box field dot none so write
this whole line in which we are passing
four variables and then in the next line
write rich text box one which is the
name of your rich text box dot selection
back color so here we are highlighting
our text in this code we are searching
for the text which is there in the text
box and in here we are highlighting our
text with a color so write rich text box
one dot selection back color is equal to
color dot any color of your choice this
time for example I will choose orange
color
okay and then in the last line right
index is equal to rich text box one text
dot index off and in the bracket right
text box dot text comma index plus one
so this line what it's doing is its
increasing the index of your text by one
so once it the desired word is search in
the text it will search for that word
again until your text is completed or
text is ended okay so this is the code
for highlighting your desired word in
the text box or text field so if you
want just pause the video and just copy
the code from here and when you are done
with copying let's try and run the
program
once again
so once again I select our text file
from my computer and this time I want to
search for the name the for example and
I press the and you can see the word da
is highlighted with orange color okay so
in this way you can use this search
option in highlight option I hope you
have learned something new this time
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
