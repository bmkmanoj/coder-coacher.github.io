video I will show you how to show your
data grid view or table cell content in
the text box for example in the previous
video I have shown you how to link the
data grid view with your MySQL database
now when I click any cell in the this
table for example this see here it fills
all the data grid value in the text
boxes okay wherever I click it fills the
values in this text box so how to show
the selected cell row value in the text
fields I will show you today so let's
get started first of all go to your form
and
select your table or data grid view and
double click it and in here write this
code so this code if this is the data
grid views cell content and inside that
you will write if he dot row index is
greater than or is equal to zero
this e is this variable which is
generated automatically data grid view
cell event here GS event so e so e dot
row index is greater than or equal to
zero if it's true then we will write
data grid view row is equal to this dot
data grid view dot rows e once again
this variable dot row index and after
that just copy your sorry
so just copy your fieldname which is
this one employee ID field name text-box
name so I just copy the name and paste
it here dot text is equal to Rho dot
cell and this is the title of your
column so I will show you what is this
so when I load this title to just copy
all the title of your columns as it is
so employee ID first name last name and
age I just remember these names and I
will paste wherever I am passing the
employee ID field in the text box
employee ID I will write employee ID
column title name dot value dot to
strength bracket and break enclosed in
the same way i will copy once again the
name textbox name here and then paste it
here dot text is equal to Rho dot cells
the column title of the data grid view
or table dot value dot to string and
same I have done for other two values so
whatever column you want to show in the
text field
take all the columns and write like this
so once again I will tell you what I
have done I have just gone to my data
grid view I have selected it and double
clicked it and in this data grid view
cell content click event I have written
this code this is textbox name in which
you want to transfer your cell value and
this is the column title of your column
table so if you want you can copy the
code and let's try and run the program
so load table and see here it's empty
right now and when I select some values
or cells it shows all the data from the
cell so anywhere you select it will show
you the all row values in this text
fields right so this is very useful for
not writing the content manually but you
can just select and just it's copied in
your text field and then you can save
update or delete this data directly so
you don't need to type any thing in the
text fields so this will saves your time
save your time and you will be able to
write or go to c-sharp code so I think
and I hope you have enjoyed this video

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
