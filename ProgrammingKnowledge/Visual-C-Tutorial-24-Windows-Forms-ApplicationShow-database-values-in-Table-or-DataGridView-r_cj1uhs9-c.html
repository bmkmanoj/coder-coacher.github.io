I will show you how to link your
database with the table or how to load
your database value in the table or more
specifically is it's called a data grid
view so for example I have this form and
it's running now and when I press this
button all the values from the database
is loaded into this table you see these
are all values coming from the database
so how did I do that I will show you now
first of all I have taken a button
simple and I have taken this data grid
view you can see here this is a data
grid view and just go to a pool bar and
drag it to your form
so take two thin things and then I just
rename my button
in the text all right load table okay so
when I press this load table but in this
data grid view should be filled by the
database value and the data grid view
name is the same as data grid view okay
so what I did I double clicked my button
so I will go to the method of the button
or the function or the event of the
function and here I copied and pasted my
code which I usually paste for linking
the database so if you don't know this
code you can go to the jail list box
with you or film combo box with you and
you can see the similarities of the code
because I use these four lines always
and the try and catch block always so
just copy and paste that code in this
method I will just go through the code
spring constraint this is a connection
that the source localhost port your SQL
port and username root and password food
SQL connection con database is equal to
GC new my SQL constructs variable name
is CMD database is equal to GC new my
command and here you write the query for
now I just write select star from the
database dot e data so I have this
database and in this database I have
this table so database dot this table
name ok
and comma gone database which is this
variable and then I am written my SQL
data reader cap my SQL River and just
make a try-catch block here if you copy
the code from the earlier video for the
connection you will see a while loop
which I have deleted from here because I
don't need that while loop and this is
new code I have added in order to load
my table or load my database values into
the data grid view table so what you
need to do is first you need to declare
a MySQL adopter cap s da so SQL data
adopter that's why I have taken this
variable is equal to GC new MySQL
adapter and then just copy this variable
and paste it here arrow point the select
command which is this declaration so if
you have some other SQL if you are using
some SQL server or some other database
you have different disk will come on so
just copy and paste it here if
if no it's different I think yeah so SDA
arrow point the silic command is equal
to CMD database command here I was
talking about this yes so this is this
MySQL command variable so SDA arrow
pointer select command is equal to CMD
database and then declare our data table
and the variable DB data set or you can
more appropriately named it as data
table if you want is equal to GC new
data table okay and then we this will
hold all the data from the database and
then this adopter will fill the grid
view with this data set so right as the
a arrow point of fill DB data set which
is this variable and then right binding
source cap B source this is the variable
name is equal to new GC new binding
source and then copy this variable and
paste it here arrow pointer data source
is equal to DB data set which is this
variable you see and then just copy the
name of your data grid view which is
this so just select this and copy this
name and paste it here dot a grid view
name arrow point the data source is
equal to b source which is this
and then SDA arrow pointer update DB's
not a set so with just this variable
okay and just code for the catch block
so you have already copied and pasted
this so the new code is this one so if
you want to copy this code just pause
the video and copy and paste it in to
your code so this code will load the
database value into your data grid view
right now I'm loading all the values all
the columns of database so it's loading
EW I name surname age you user name and
password by writing this query select
star whenever we use star it loads all
the values but for example I just need
only three columns name surname and age
how can i load only three columns of the
database you can just replace this star
from name column surname and age column
and when you run the program it's
running
just login and when you press this load
table button it only shows three columns
so in this way you can customize your
table and just use what column you want
to show in this table and just customize
your data grid view when you click these
titles you can also change the sorting
of the values so it's sorting from
maximum to minimum or otherwise minimum
to maximum so this is also very good
quality of this data grid view so I
think you have learned something new
this time please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
