last video I have shown you how to
create a basic simple calculator using
C++ and you have seen and I have shown
you how to do addition subtraction
multiplication for multiplication you
use this Asterix sign for division it's
a little bit tasty concept because this
will give you the division value and
this modulus will give you the remainder
value so if you are not understood these
division concept just go to the last
video and see it now in this video I am
going to talk to you further about this
basic arithmetic and what I'm going to
do is I will declare this int X here and
I am just simply printing it so
insertion operator X and semicolon and
for example now you have little bit
complex calculations so for example you
have 10 into 20 plus 30 divided by 40
and minus 50 so for the first time when
you see it it looks it will still
calculate or the value of x but when the
other user of you yourself will see this
calculation it looks little bit complex
and you will not be able to understand
it by seeing it for the first time you
need to think that yeah this will happen
first so if you have seen remember the
concept in the spool this concept was
called PE m da s which means the
sequence of the calculation will
parentheses exponent then the
multiplication division addition and
subtraction so in the same this is the
same concept will be used here first
will happen the premises of thesis which
we don't have right now but and then
happens the exponent which also we don't
have then happens the multiplication so
this will happen first then will happen
the division then this will happen then
the addition so that this will happen
and then the subtraction so whatever
value you will get we subtract 50 by
this but it's always a good practice to
use parentheses so you yourself can
understand by seeing this calculation at
once so for example I will use
parentheses here and parentheses here so
you know that yes I have this value and
I want to divide this value by this
value and to make it more simple just
give the parentheses here also so now
whenever you see it you know that yes
this will happen for the multiplication
of this two numbers will happen first
and then whatever the product is it will
have be added to 30 and this will be the
subtraction whatever will be the result
and whatever will be the result of the
numerator it will be divided by this
okay and now when you run build your
program and run it it'll give you the
answer but yeah it's always a good
practice to use these parentheses in
order to understand by yourself that
what's going to happen otherwise you
need to you know invest your mind yes
this will happen or this will that it
will happen so yeah always use
parentheses when you want to do this
kind of lengthy
calculations okay so I hope you have
enjoyed this video please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
