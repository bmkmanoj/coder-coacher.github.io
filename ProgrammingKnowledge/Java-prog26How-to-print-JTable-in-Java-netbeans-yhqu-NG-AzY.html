will show you how to print your JT book
so let's get started take a button from
your pallet a meter sprint now we'll
also change its variable name empty
print
then right-click your print or to given
action actionperformed
you will go to the method so as always
we will write our top try-catch block
but this time in our cache block
you should write Java dot AWT dot print
dot printer exception space e and in the
parenthesis of catch you should write
system dot e RR dot form it and in
double quotes cannot print or whatever
your message is gamma e dot get message
so this you have to write in your catch
block and now we will write our main
code
so first of all we need to define the
header and footer of our print page so
write message omit and is equal to Nu
message
moment
I think I made the mistake waiting for
Matt okay and then break it close the
bracket and the blanket patient right
whatever header you want to give to your
print page you can give any header so
for example I write
report report print
so this is the header and now I will
write the footer so once again copy the
same code and play step again instead of
header a pen name put
in the photo you can give for example
page number so how to give page number
you have to write page then curly braces
curly braces right zero comma comma
so our page is of number time and page
will come as an integer okay and you can
see some error is coming home message
footer and this two codes this is
because we have to import one file at
the starting so write both Java dot txt
dot star
and also write import a dot print dot
star
I want to do it
okay
this is small
okay so just import these two files and
then once again we will go to our code
and in here right
whatever is your table names of our
table name is Tippin slash employee this
is the variable name this name table
point once again go to your code paste
it in there dot print
and
in the print we have to click
such that this thing will come J table
dot print mode dot normal comma your
header oh my a photo okay
this is the small code you have to write
once again I go to the code first of all
you to define match search form it had
da is equal to new message form it and
the text of your header and same message
span message form it what is equal to
new message form it and whatever you
want to write a new footer so I want to
hide the page number so I have written
page in parenthesis 0 comma number comma
integer and in the try block I have
written table thought print in the
bracket J table dot print mode dot
normal comma and which is this and
footer which is this
and in the catch block right in bracket
java.awt dot print dot printer exception
space e and in the block right system
dot e RR dot form it and in the bracket
write your message error message comma y
dot get message and you have to take
both two files also which I have already
shown here import Java dot text dot star
and import Java dot aw t dot print but
star now we will try to run our program
when you click your print button you can
see the print window will open you can
choose whatever format you want to print
the document if you have PDF and install
in your computer this time or this combo
box will also show PDF file so you can
do well in PDF and when you click print
data will be printed and you need to
give the path where you want to save
your data so I named it a save and I
save it on my desktop save building is
in process printing page 1 and let's see
how does our print page looks so this is
our print file we have created right now
and this looks like this this is the
print report which is the header this is
our data of our tea table and this is
our footer which shows the page number
so that was the tutorial on how to print
your tea table I hope you enjoyed and

all of your comments so please give your
comments and suggestion to me so I can
improve my tutorial and you can also
request what you want to learn more so I
guess I'm finish this tutorial thanks
