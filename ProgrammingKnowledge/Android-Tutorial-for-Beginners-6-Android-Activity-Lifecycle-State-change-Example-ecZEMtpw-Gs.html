tutorial on android app development for
beginners in the last video we have seen
the basic overview of Android activity
lifecycle now in order to understand
this activity lifecycle in the more
deeper sense we will take an example
which will show how these activity
methods will be called in some order so
in the last video I have shown you in
this main activity dot Java file there
is a method called oncreate which is
called first
whenever you launch your application
right and I have shown you a diagram
like this which shows the order of the
calling of this method one by one
whenever your activity is launched to
activity is running to activity is shut
down so we will try to call all these
method one by one and we will see how
these methods are called in order right
so what we are going to do is in our
mean or main activity dot Java class we
are going to import one more library so
import Android dot util
dot dot log okay so just add the this
library and this is just for logging
messages to your console here okay so we
will log some messages while calling
these methods and we will see which
method is you know logged first so that
we know that this is called first and
then other method and another method and
then we will just make a string so
public static final then we will name
our string so string and the name of the
string for example my my tag because we
are going to use tags and then we will
just name our string something so for
example we name our tag as my custom
message okay and now to lock this what
you can do is you can just call log in
your oncreate method so this is my on
create method inside my on create method
I will write log dot I and then my tag
name so my tag name is this one comma
the message I want to display so I want
to display for example I for the first
time and it's called I want to call this
on create method okay so this is simple
you know logging messages whenever this
method is called now we want you know
every method here so on create on start
on resume so you can do the same for
every method oncreate or and then you
can just copy this and paste it and then
do it for on start so this I have done
or I have you know written in my blog
all the method which you can call on
start on a resume on pause on stop all
these methods which are called here
right so that you don't have to you know
rewrite this code you can just go to my
blog and just see this code and you can
copy all the code up till on destroy
method and this is the whole code of
this Java file which I'm using right now
here okay so you just need to copy this
from on start to on destroy okay and all
the you know library is imported here
log util and this is just the same
example I'm going to show you so I'm
going to copy this and paste it here in
order to save the time now once you have
copied and pasted all the method these
are the method which are same as on
create so on create on start on resume
on pause which are listed in this
diagram right and now what we are going
to do is in order to display these
messages what we are going to do is
first of all go to your activity
underscore main XML file and in here in
the console you can customize your
messages so just go to this little combo
box here and just right click or click
Edit filter configurations and you can
use your own configuration for example I
want to make my a custom message for
example or my messages okay so I made my
own our own message configuration and
I can use the tag here so my tag was my
custom message right so in here you can
see in this the tag name was my custom
message or in my activity you can see
the tag name was my custom message right
so just go to the same configuration my
message and just paste this message in
the log tag category okay and just click
OK now what we are going to do is we
will run our Android application once
again and you can choose your tag by
filtering here so this is my custom
message you can choose your custom
message from here I will click OK to run
the emulator and just choose this tag
which you have created here ok so my
message was my custom tag and when it
runs suddenly it goes once again choose
this my message and let's see what
happens whenever you create your or
whenever you run your Android
application so you can see first method
which is called
is on create method which is this one
then on start method then on a resume
method in here once again and then
slowly whenever you go down then it's
called on save instance and then you can
see all the methods are called one by
one on start on resume on pause right so
you can see the sequence of these
messages in the same manner now once you
are you know click this button this
message will be to destroy the
application because it's closed and now
whenever we want to run our application
from here it will we will just click our
application name and it will be created
ok
and when we click this button our
application is not
destroy door closed but it's paused okay
and you can go to the other application
but the last application is not
destroyed so it's paused and it stopped
last messages pause and stopped but it's
not destroyed right so whenever you want
to open your application once again you
can just go to this application
double-click this and it's it resumes
itself so it's not created once again
but it resumes itself once again you see
resume ok so in this way you can play
with your app close it and rerun it and
see what messages are printed here and
this will give you the more clear
overview of this these method how they
are called and in what sequence they are
called so I hope you enjoyed this video
