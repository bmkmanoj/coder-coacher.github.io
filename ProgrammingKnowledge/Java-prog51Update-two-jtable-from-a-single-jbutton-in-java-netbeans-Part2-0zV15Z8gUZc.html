okay also I will change and even this
aid also I change to 24 and when I click
Update button while you is updated so it
is not rest rest because I have haven't
insulted my refresh method so let's let
it be for now we mean run the program
once again then you can see the I didn't
values in here and now we will try to
add it on decision-making tab just click
here so you want to add it because we
have just taken these three fields so we
can understand it these values insert
you have 50,000 and here by 5 5 5 and
this is the primary key so you cannot
change it using update so I just press
update
so I already told you that this is my
primary key so you cannot update this so
instead of pump ID we can change we can
take the volume flow for me also take
the volume flow text field name and
paste it here instead of pump ID because
companies are primary key and which can
not be edited and in here we will change
instead of pump ID we will change the
name volume flow column
and just to refresh my table instantly I
will copy this update table method which
I have shown earlier so when I press the
update we can see the values
instantaneously when I will add it and
then once again trying to from the
program I'll try to change the values
this you can see here the update takes
place and here because we have inserted
the primary key so we now change it to
volume flow and now I will try to change
the values for example for my d7 I will
change the value to 2 into a 2 a 3 and 4
for 4 and then I will press the Update
button and you can see
that this value is always changing all
the value obtained because I haven't
defined for which pump ID one want to
change the data so you have to write it
here after your update Queenie updated
using percent volume flow this code
where where your company pump ID is it
going to
so we will define one more tables for
pump ID here because we are we have to
give the name of your app ID number so
which pump ID in which you won't find it
you're not also write it here pump ID
and I will copy this copy paste it here
this one every changes the radio because
I pump ID here is value for stored in
value for so just right where pump ID is
equal to 4 and now I'm going to program
so for example I want to change the
value there for this tenth it will I
will change it as zero one two and when
I click the Update button our values are
updated only for this tenth field once
again for ninth I want to change values
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and here so I will press
update and you can update the values
here you can see the values are updated
I want to update the value for this from
the same update button so for example I
want to change this 8 employee-id
thatís why we named it as mark
I think mark John for example and I
change with age to 24 and when I press
update values updated and you can see
employ number 8 is updated so in this
way you can change or update the value
from same button in different tables so
I am updating the tables to different
tables from a single update button so
you can do that so I hope you have
learned something new today
and please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
