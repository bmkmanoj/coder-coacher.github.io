how to open a text file in your Qt GUI
application and show it into a cute text
edit or cue plain text edit or you can
show it in text browser also so let's
get started
for example I'm going to take this text
browser which is there in display
widgets I will just drag and drop it
into my form and I will resize it a
little and I will take a push button
from my toolbox of widget and I will
change its text or its title as open
text file okay and then I will just
right click go to slot and I will choose
the first option which is clicked and
I'm in the code-behind first of all I'm
going to import or include some files
which are include queue file for reading
the text file second is include queue
text stream for converting our file to
text stream and third is I'm going to
include queue message box for showing
any message if the file path is or not
correct or some other problem comes okay
so now the includes are done now here
I will write my code in this push button
click method so in here I will declare a
file object so i will write queue file
file and I will give the path of the
file inside this file object so for
example I want to open a text file so I
have this simple text file I will right
click and I will copy the path of this
text file and I will paste it here and
don't forget to change this path with
double slashes so the single slash is
not working if you want to open the file
text file in the inner text edit so just
add one more / - every slash okay now in
we are going to check whether our file
is open or not so in the second line I
will write if my file which is a file
object which is this object and dot open
and here queue i/o device and I will
give it read-only so my file is if my
file is not open then I will show a
message in a message box so i will write
queue message box and I am going to make
it as information so I will write
information and then the first argument
for the message
zero the second argument would be the
title I would say info for example and
the third option would be the argument
for file errors so I will copy once
again the file object and I will say dot
error string okay so if my file is not
open for some reason then I will show
show the message in the SEC's next line
I will convert my file into a stream so
that I can show it into the text box so
what I will write I will write q Q text
stream and I will give an object name
and I will pass inside this my file
object and I will say like this now once
I converted my file into a stream then I
can show this file into my text browser
so I will copy the name of my text
browser forms from here just copy the
name go to add it and go to this push
button click event and what I will write
is UI and the name of your text browser
which is text browser and I will say set
text and we will pass this in yeah or
stream here and I will write dot read
all there are some option if you want to
read a single line then you can royal
you can write here
the read line but I want to read all the
text file from the stream so I will say
read all so this is the code which is
required to open a file in a text so
let's try and run the code I will save
my file and build my code and it will
run my code and when I click this button
it should show the content of the text
file inside this text rouser so let's
click it and you can see all the content
of my text file is shown in this text
browser you can make your application
more interesting by adding a Q file
dialogues to open the text file so you
can choose the text file by clicking
this button and it will open the file
dialog and you can choose it I have
shown you how to use Q file dialogue in
the video number 24 I think so go and
watch that video and you will be good to
go so I hope you have enjoyed this video
