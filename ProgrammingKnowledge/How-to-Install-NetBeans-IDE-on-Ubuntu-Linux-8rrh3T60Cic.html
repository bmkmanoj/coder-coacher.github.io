how to install NetBeans IDE on your
Ubuntu Linux operating system so let's
get started first of all open your
browser and type in search NetBeans and
the first link which will come on your
screen is NetBeans dot o-r-g
so just click here to download and we
will be guided to the download link of
NetBeans IDE
now NetBeans IDE
can be downloaded in different packages
so here you can see different packages
for a NetBeans IDE so if you want to use
all the package then you can always just
download this and if you want to use
some specific package from or package on
technologies or mom in the NetBeans IDE
then you can choose according to your
use so for example I'm choosing Java EE
or Java SE from here
one thing I forgot to show you I go back
and here at the top you can choose your
language and you can choose the
operating system on which you want to
install so I have chosen this here linux
because we are installing it on arab do
that can be selected here and then go to
downloads okay so this download is
opening and now just you can save your
downloaded file from here just click OK
and it's installing or downloading so
now the download is done the file has
the extension dot SH make sure that it
has the Excel extension as edge now I
will just open the folder in which the
NetBeans file is downloaded so here it
is what I will do is I will copy this
file from here and go to my home folder
and I will make a new folder here so I
will right-click and write new folder
and here I will write
NetBeans and in this folder I will paste
my downloaded file okay so now it's here
now I will close so it's transferring my
file in a meanwhile I will open my
terminal from here and here I will go to
that NetBeans directory so I write CD
NetBeans and in here I will give the
command to change the mode of this dot
Sh files okay so I will write sudo chmod
plus x NetBeans dash star this star I'm
providing so that it will take whatever
extension after NetBeans - it has it
will automatically take the extensions
alternatively you can also just provide
the whole name of this file it will work
fine so just write this and press ENTER
and give the password okay so now my
mode is changed now I will give the next
command so I will write here sudo dot
slash NetBeans dash star okay and I will
click enter and now it is start
configuring my file one thing you need
to ensure before installing this
NetBeans is your JDK is properly
installed or not so in the last video I
will provide the link in the description
also how you can install JDK in your
to operating system so first you need to
install JDK and then install this
NetBeans so JDK is like a build system
for the Java environment and it has just
started the installer so create click
Next
and if you accept the license then click
this and accept the new license but
before that I want to show you that in
the last video I have provided the
environment in my bash RC file so just
when you create when you open this home
folder and go at the top and view show
all hidden files and when you open this
dot bash RC file and at the bottom I
have provided these two lines so in the
last video I have installed JDK for this
Java environment so first of all you
need to ensure that these two lines are
there in your bash RC file and then you
will be able to install this NetBeans
correctly so if you don't know what's
happening here just see the last video
and you will be able to know how I have
given these paths in this bash RC text
file so now I accept the license and
click Next and accept the terms and
conditions and click Next and here user
local it will create this install in
this path and it has found the default
path for JVM that's what I was talking
and then click Next
and click install and it will take some
time to install this NetBeans and still
installing so now NetBeans IDE is
installed in my system so I click finish
and I can find my NetBeans ID here so go
to your dash home and in here type
NetBeans and I can see the NetBeans IDE
7.4 here so I what I will do is I will
drag this symbol and drop it on my
toolbar here and I will double click it
it's opening NetBeans IDE in my Ubuntu
operating system so the IDE is open now
and from here I can create a new project
so I will click find new project and
depending upon your usage you can choose
java application Java FX and other
modules in Java so for example I select
some samples applications
I go to sample Java and I go to GUI from
example and click Next and I will leave
this name as default for example and
click finish
and it will create a new project for me
so you can see here it has created a new
project and it's coming the project so I
will run this program and try and see
whether it actually running or not so I
will right-click my project and click
run and you can see here run starts and
you can see our example gooey and Tina
is open now so congratulations you have
successfully installed and NetBeans IDE
in your Ubuntu operating system I hope
