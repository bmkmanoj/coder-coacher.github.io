video I will show you how to calculate a
relative time with the help of your
c-sharp application so by a relative
time what I mean is the time duration
from a certain date for example I want
to calculate the age of some person and
his date of birth is somewhere in 80s
and I want to calculate the date
compared to today so I want to calculate
the date of the person according to the
time or date today so let's see how can
we do that so first of all I will take a
button and I will show the example
itself how to calculate the age so you
will have the idea so I will change the
text as show
age
okay so I changed the text and now I
double click this button and in here I
will declare some variables to calculate
the age so first of all the date of
birth of the person so I will declare
date time and birthday I give this
variable name as both day bday so this
is the birthday of the person is equal
to new date time and in here we will
pass the date in this bracket we will
pass the date okay
so this I will take it as bday like this
and here I will pass the date so first
you pass the year so for example I pass
1989 this is the year then I will pass
the month so I will pass 0-6 then I will
pass the date so 28 so the person's date
of birth is 28 6 1989 now I want to
calculate his date today compared to
today so I will just once again declare
a variable date time and I will give the
name today
is equal to
day time dot today okay so this is the
date of birth of a person and this is
the date today
so whatever the day current date it will
take that date this variable now it's
very simple now to calculate the date so
I will just declare int variable and I
will declare this variable as age is
equal to then I will just copy this dot
here - this today variable dot yeah and
close it so this will show the age of
the person okay but there can be
difference in the month and the date so
we will give a condition F condition
here I will pass some argument so here
just copy this variable in this if
condition just pass it if birthday is
greater than this today dot
odd years and you know I will just copy
this age int variable and I will just
give it a minus sign and in this if
condition I will pass once again this
age variable and - - age or like this
age - - and now I will show this date in
a message box so I will write message
box dot sure and in the bracket I will
write first of all age is equal to plus
I will pass just this age variable so it
will show the age is equal to whatever
the ages so this is the date of birth
this is the time this is the date today
so then we calculated the age just we
subtracted that today here by the date
of birth here and if the date of birth T
is greater than today yeah then I just
do age - - so it will calculate the
correct age okay so let's try and run
the program according to our code the
age of the person should be from 1989 it
should be around 24 let's see so show
age it's showing zero so why
yeah here I have and I did it did
mistake in subtraction so just copy this
once again and paste it here so today -
both day now it will show the correct
date of birth once again show age I will
click this and the age of the person is
23 so our estimate is roughly correct
right so in this way you can calculate
the relative time with the help of your
si shop application so I hope you have
learned something new this time please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
