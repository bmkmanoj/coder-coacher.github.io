video I will show you how to use tooltip
with your C sharp windows form
application so what is a tooltip tooltip
is a suggestion or I will show you so
for example you go into this tool box
and when you hover over any tool it will
show the description that this is a
checked list box and it has a version of
four point zero point zero point zero
from microsoft.net component or you can
go to any menu item here and this button
is for save form one or so the
suggestion when you hover over any of
the item on your IDE or wherever
whatever suggestion comes this is called
a tool tip so the by name it's clear
that it's a tool for example this button
is a tool and how to use this tool the
tip the software will give the tip for
using the tool ok so let's get started I
have this button and for example when I
run the program when I click this button
it closes simply closes the application
so what I want to do is I want to show
the tool tip on this button so what I
will do is I will go to the toolbox and
I will search for tool tip and drag and
drop into the form and you will notice
the tool tip will not directly go into
the form but it will go down here you
will be able to see tool tip here and
for example you want to set the tool tip
this is tool tip 1 so set the tool tip 1
for this button select this button and
when you drag and drop this to your form
there is a new property added to your
button which is this tool tip on tool
tip 1 and here you can
have the description so for example this
button will close the form okay or for
example you want to give the tooltip for
this form so just select this form and
drag and drop another tooltip into the
form and it will go here and it this
will be your tooltip to select your form
and there will be a new property here
tooltip too so just select tool tip too
and give the description that this is a
demo for showing the tool tip ok so we
have given the tooltip for the button we
have given the tooltip for our form and
now when you run the program and when
you hover over your form just see this
demo this is demo for showing the
tooltip and when you hover over this
button you will see this button will
close the form so this is a little tip
when you come on the or hover over any
tool so that the user will see that what
is the use of this button this is the
detailed description of the use of
button so this is very simple to use and
very useful tool to have in your project
