tutorial on C programming for beginners
in the last video I've shown you what
are arrays in C and how to use arrays in
C and I have given an example to you how
to declare and use a single dimensional
array so I have shown you you can
declare an array like this and array can
contain more than one values of same
data-type in a single variable in a
similar way if you want to declare a
multi-dimensional array you can do it
like this so this is a single
dimensional array and if you want to
declare a multi-dimensional array you
can do it like this for example you want
to declare 2 cross 3 cross 4 3
dimensional array this is the
Declaration of 3 dimensional array or if
you want to declare a 4 dimensional
array you can do it like this but most
simplest form of multi-dimensional array
is a 2 dimensional array and this is how
you can declare this two-dimensional
array right so this is the Declaration
of two-dimensional array of 2 cross 3
here 2 cross 3 means this array if you
can imagine in the form of a square or a
table this 2 is like a row for your
array and 3 is like a column numbers of
your array so let's see how we can
initialize this array first so you just
give a bracket and the in these two
curly braces you can declare your array
so first of all we will define our rows
0 so this will be our row 0 and move
this up and draw one ok so I will just
define two rows first because of
our a contains two rows if we see this
and three columns right so columns are
like straight called lines or column
right so for example one comma three
comma two are the columns of row zero
and for example 5 comma 6 comma 8 are
the elements of first or second row of
index 1 and it has three columns like 5
6 &amp;amp; 7 so this is a two dimensional array
and it contains two rows and three
columns how it contains two rows this is
the first row so Row 1 of or index 0
right
so index of array starts from 0 so this
is Row 1 logically but if you see in
terms of C this will be Rho 0 right and
this will be Rho 1 right because index
of the array starts from 0 and then
these are the column so first column is
4 1 and 5 and second column contains 3
and 6 and third column contains 2 and 8
okay now in order to iterate over these
values you can use for loop but a single
for loop will not work
in the case of this two-dimensional
array you need to use two for loop so
loop inside a loop to iterate all the
values in this array so for iterating
over these values you can do it like
this so you can just write a first for
loop for
and then this for loop will be for the
rows okay so I will declare our variable
I or int I is equal to 0 and this will
be I will be less than 2 which is number
of rows right these are the number of
rows you have okay and then I plus plus
which is our increment operator and
inside this for loop we will declare one
more for loop so inside this curly
braces of this for loop we will declare
one more for loop for columns so for int
int J is equal to 0 and J should be less
than the number of rows so number of
rows in our case is 3 right so just
writes 3 here and then J plus plus okay
so this is loop inside the loop to
iterate the values so first loop will
iterate over the rows and the second
loop will iterate over the columns right
now in order to print all the values
inside your column for loop this loop
you can just write printf and the name
of your array for example this one just
inside the brackets just write this and
then just write percentage D here and
then percentage D here is equal to it
should be percentage D and this should
be equal to percentage T right so this
will be the value of our a and we will
also print the index of the array right
so we have
the here it will show the row here it
will show the column and here it will
show the value right so we have a row
here so rows are iterated by I so we'll
just write I here comma the columns are
iterated YJ so just write J here and the
values can be iterated by your array
index so just write the name of your
array and then the value of I which is a
row indicator and value of J which is
your column indicator right now
I will just give this next line here so
that it will iterate every time in the
next line okay I will compile and run
this program and it says the program
contains some problem let's see what's
the problem here yeah so I think this
curly brace is extra here this should do
right and these are rows and columns so
just compile it once again and now it
runs so you can see it prints the row
and index of the array right so at 0 0
so at 0th row and 0th column we have the
value 1 which is true this is at 0th row
and 0th column ok add row 0 and column 1
we have the value 3 this is right this
is rows 0 so row 0 is this one and
column 1 so 0 and 1 so column 1 is this
one value is 3 that's correct
rosy row and column 2 is this one and 0
1 2 so this is the value which is 2
which is correct here now comes the row
1 which is this
Rho value column zero which is this
value which is five in a same way it
will print all the values of your
two-dimensional Zarya so in this way you
can iterate over your array using two
for loop so this is a simplest kind of
multi-dimensional array array and it is
called two-dimensional array in a
similar way if you want to declare some
other array two-dimensional array with
some other dimension you can do it like
this for example your array must contain
three rows you can just do it like this
so Row 1 we have 0 and 1 we have and we
will just write the row third or by
index it's row - right and this is Row 2
okay so you can do it like this so I
hope you have understood the basic
concept of multi-dimensional arrays and
I hope you have enjoyed this video
