last video I have shown you how to use
if-else statements in Python so I have
given you a little brief introduction
how to FL statement but there is more to
FL statement which is LF statement and
nested if-else statement so let's see
how we can use those two so for example
I am going to just to take a new example
so I am going to delete all these stuff
and for example I want to compare some
names this time I want to have a
variable called name and I want to take
input from my user that he will give a
me a name and then I will compare the
name and I am going to show the result
okay
so what I can do is I want to compare
the name right so in my if condition I
will compare my name if my name and to
compare equality you use double equal
not this but double equal sign here okay
so always remember if you want to
compare the Equality of two string or
two values to just use not single equal
to but you use double equal to if you
use single equal to this means
assignment so a sign so this single
equal to means that assign the value
whatever user enters to the name but if
you double equal 2 it means that you
want to compare the two values okay so I
want to compare this value to for
example name called mark and I can say
print the name entered is the name
entered is and then comma name for
example
okay now I want to check some more names
if user enter some other names right so
for example if user enters some other
name I want to check it so I can check
it just I can check it by L if condition
okay so there is a condition called else
if this L if means else if okay and then
I can check one more condition for
example this name is this time John and
then I will print some other value so I
will just print the name of John here so
the name entered is John in a same
similar way I can have multiple health
conditions like this and just remember
to give the indentation and then for
example some other name I can compare or
some other name I can compare okay so if
you want to compare different conditions
you can use LF condition and else if the
condition is false what I can do I can
just print that the name entered is not
valid for example not valid okay
and now I will save the program and when
I run this it asked me to enter a name
or so for example I enter a name mark it
says the name entered is mark okay once
again when I run the program once again
and this time I enter some other name
for example Tom and press Enter it says
name entered is Tom because it goes
here so what's the flow of the program
so we are checking or we are asking the
user to enter any names when the user
enters any name this name it goes in
this name variable and then the program
comes to this place to compare this name
to the name called mark and the a if the
name is mark it will print this okay
otherwise it will go on to check that if
the name is John and if the name is John
it goes here and it print this otherwise
it will check if the name is Julie and
it can print this okay so not in this
way your if-else statement works or else
if or if else else if else if else if
else so LF means else if and you can
compare multiple condition using LF
right now for example I want to you know
have multiple if condition inside my if
condition okay so it is called nested-if
condition okay and I tell the user to
enter any name and if this name is let's
say name we assign this value this name
to for example
we have this name is equal to animal
animal and then this I declare another
variable animal name for example and in
the name and this animal name is dog ok
so I have a name which is animal and
then I have animal name is equal to dog
so first of all I want to compare if the
name is animal okay so if the name is
animal then I will I want to do some
some other I want to check some other
condition in this animal condition so I
will just I can just give mark one more
condition and check if this animal name
is equal to so W is equal to dog okay
dog and don't forget this : and then I
will print here so if your if statement
starts from here in the last video I've
shown you that you need to give the
indentation here okay if you write so
let me show you print you can just print
valid anymore valid anymore
okay so why this indentation here is
more important is because for example I
can just write printer like this without
I only give the same dentition so I can
say a name and third is
and mo okay so see the indentation here
here indentation so this statement
belongs to this if condition and this
print statement belongs to this
condition because this comes in the line
of this if statement right so whatever
you write here in line of this it will
be the condition of or valid condition
of this and it will print this one and
if you know the animal name is dog it
will go here and we'll print valid
anymore so what do you think what
happens let's see what happens I will
just run my program save it and say is
valid animal name entered is anymore
right so and just remember that whenever
you want to give the statement or code
for this if condition just make sure
that this is in line with this if and
whenever you want to give the code for
this if condition you just give your
statement in this or along this line
okay so indentation just remember
indentation and this is called the
nested if-else condition so what we have
done we have checked if this name is
equal to animal and if name is equal to
animal then we say that we compare one
more condition that if animal name is
dog and then we print this or in the
case of name any this animal name is not
dog we can just say else and I can just
print one more condition print animal
name I can just
to print animal name in valid okay so
this is my F else condition inside my
another F condition so this is like a
parent if and this is like a child
FX condition okay so I just change this
name some other name cat for example and
I save it and I run it and invalid
expression because here I forgot the
colon
save run it once again and now it will
print animal name is invalid because it
goes here and seized okay name is equal
to animal so I go to this condition but
animal name is not dog here it's cat so
it's it goes in this condition and it
says animal name is invalid and then it
just print the name entered is anymore
okay
so in this way you can use else--if and
nested else if statement in Python I
