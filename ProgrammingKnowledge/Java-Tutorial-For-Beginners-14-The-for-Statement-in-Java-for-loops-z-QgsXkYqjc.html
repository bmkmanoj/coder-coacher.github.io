tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use for loops in Java in the last
video I have shown you how to use arrays
in Java and we will see in this video
how we can use for loop effectively to
you know use them with arrays so first
of all how to declare a for loop for
loop is same as while loop or do-while
loop in a way that it executes the same
code again and again until some
condition is met but in here you have
more control over your conditions now
let us see what is the basic deflection
of for loop so you just write the
keyword for and then you just write
these round brackets and then in curly
braces you write your statement and in
here
you can give three different expressions
one is called
initialization so I will just do it
something like this comment in comments
first of all first expression is called
init init or initialization second is
your expression and third is called the
increment increment value okay so you
give these three expressions inside your
for loop so let's try to declare these
three expression so inside your for loop
you can define this integer value for
example int I for printing these value
for example we can declare the index of
the array like this int index
or in the last video if you remember
what I have shown you so in the last
video I've shown you how to use arrays
and how to print the elements all the
elements of the array using this while
loop and we have declared this integer
index here in the last video this
declaration we have done outside our
loop which was while loop but using for
loop you can initialize this index here
itself inside the expression so you can
assure initialize index is equal to zero
and then semicolon and then you can
check this condition which is index
should be less than 5 we were here so it
should be less than 5 and then the third
condition is the increment we were doing
increment like this but in for loop you
can increment this index inside this
expression value itself so for loop
solves three things for you
one is initialization which you have
done outside whenever you were using
while loop and then your expression
which is which will give you true or
false which comes in between and then
the increment which you were doing
inside your while loop but you can do it
right whenever you are declaring your
for loop ok so in this way you have more
control over your code ok and then you
can just print the value of your array
which is this one one by one based upon
the index so I will run the program and
it prints all the values in the array
which is 131 26 48 and 52 which are
these so how it works first of all for
loop initializes your variable for
example index is equal to 0 and then
it checks this expression where the
value of index is less than five or not
so because we have initialized it by
zero zero is not is less than zero less
than five which is true then it executes
your statement and then it increments
the value
okay so first initialization then
expression checking and then if the
expression is true it will print your
value and then it will increment the
value of index by one okay so first the
value of index is zero which is less
than five it will print it and the value
of array at index zero is one-hundred
right it prints one hundred and then it
will increment the value of index by one
which is which makes the value of index
is equal to 1 0 plus 1 is equal to 1 and
1 is less than 5 so it will print the
value of array at index 1 which is 31
and then it will increment the value of
index by 1 now index beta becomes 2 2 is
less than 5 it will just print this
value again and again right so this is
one way of using for loop but there is
one more way of using for loop and which
is like this if you are using
specifically arrays then it's more easy
to use this expression for for loop so
the declaration is the same but in the
case of array you can just directly use
this array here so for example you can
just write int element so this is your
name of the variable which will hold the
value 1 by 1 right and then you give
this colon here
and then you give the name of your array
for example like this so what this
expression is doing is it will go over
your array one by one and it will store
the value of this array one by one so
first at first when this loop will start
the value in the increment or value
which will be saved in this element will
be hundred and then once again it will
loop and then value becomes 31 here and
then value becomes 26 here and then
value become 48 so it will iterate over
your array and one by one it will
transfer the value of this array in this
element and then you can access this
element like this for example you can
just print this here like this and I
will just comment this for now and let's
see what happens I will run the program
and prints the same values like these
okay so this is other way of using for
loop if you have arrays to access the
values right so here comes the array and
it will transfer one by one your element
value in this element and then you can
access this element one by one
whenever loop will iterate over the
array okay so this is intelligent way of
you know iterate over arrays using for
loop and this is basic for loop which
you can use or to iterate over some
values so I hope you have understood the
basic concept of for loop and I hope you
have enjoyed this video please recommend
