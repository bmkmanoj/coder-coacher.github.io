show you how to install SQLite database
in your Ubuntu Linux operating system so
let's get started first of all you need
to open your terminal and in your
terminal you need to give this command
sudo apt - get install sqlite3
so this will install SQLite version 3 in
your system and then space lib sqlite3 -
Deb so this a Lib sqlite3
- dev will install SQLite development
library in your system so you can
develop different programs with your
SQLite database for example if you want
c++ support for SQLite then this library
will provide that so give this command
and press ENTER and it will ask for your
password so give your password and start
installing SQLite in your system so it's
the Nardo bay right now so now sqlite3
is installed in my system so i will
clear the terminal and i will check
whether Eska light is really installed
in my system or not so i will give the
command sqlite3 and press enter and it
will give the version of the Escalade
which is present in your system so if it
gives escalate version whatever the
version is then you know that SQLite is
installed in your system and you will be
able to see SQLite and then this greater
than sign and you know that your a
Salida installed in your system now you
can create a database and you can do
many things by the command line in this
open to operating system and you can
also make the databases and to quit your
database just write dot q UI T and press
ENTER and it will fit from your database
so for example right now I am in my root
directory so which is I will show you in
which directory M I am and then I will
create a database in that directory so
in I right now I am in my home directory
right and for example I want to create a
database in this folder which is my home
directory then I will just write sqlite3
and your database name dot DB and press
enter and create a database dot DB in
your in your folder where you have given
the command right and you need to give
some tables names and you need to
install in sort some other table
information and then you will be able to
use your SQLite database
now to check whether my database name
dot DB is really created I need to give
the command dot dat ABA SEF databases
and press ENTER and you see here you
have the database in this location home
and in my open 2 1 folder there is a
database called database dot BB right
and when I see here this database is
also present here so I know that my
database is created in my home folder
and there are some more commands which
you need to learn to query the database
to insert some data into table to create
a table and to update or delete the
content in the table that I will show
you in some other video so I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
