install and review C line which is a C
and C++ IDE from JetBrains
and why I am excited about this IDE
because the company behind this IDE
which is jetbrains is famous for making
I des and I am quite impressed with
their other IDs for for example
developing Java and other languages so
let's see how we can download and
install this sea lion so you can
download and install this sea lion ide
by just searching for c line c++ and the
first link i think you will find here is
www.ge.com is early access program I
believe and I'm going to download and
install and review this EAP build and
there is a QuickStart guide here also
and I am going to refer to get this
guide in order to install this okay
so I will just go to try EAP build early
access program you can see here and I am
going to install it for Linux so just
click this and I have already downloaded
this zip file it is a zip file and it so
it is not a very big zip file so you can
just download this zip file and I am
going to just see the Quick Start Guide
here for Linux and other operating
system it is a cross-platform IDE so you
can use it on Windows Mac or Linux and
right now I am using Linux and for Linux
it's available for 64-bit operating
system so I believe they don't have
32-bit support and the requirement for
the installation is you must have Oracle
JDK because this IDE is based on Java
because
company JetBrains is famous for making
java ide s and i think they are for the
first time they are trying c and c++ so
requirements are OpenJDK or Oracle Java
minimum 1.7 and you also must have GCC
or G plus plus which is a a compiler for
building our program or C line which is
also a compiler okay so I think I have
both these thing things Java and GCC
installed in my system if you do not
have just install it and just read this
line C line includes bundled C make now
what is C make here C make is a clock
cross-platform free and open-source
software for managing the build
processes for software using cross or
cross compiler independent methods that
means it's just like your make files but
it's more advanced and it's a
cross-platform software so it includes
the sea makes to build your programs
okay so which is very nice because I
have been using the C make and it's
really fast with C make to develop your
big projects okay so once you have
downloaded your zip file you just need
to extract it somewhere I have already
extracted this folder here which is sea
lion - 1.13 8.1 9 6 which is some number
so in this folder I have extracted my
downloaded file and it contains some
folder and the folder I am interested in
is this bin folder because here there is
a file called C line dot SH which I am
going to run so what I am going to do I
am going to just open my terminal I am
going to just
go to the place which is inside the sea
line folder and pin pole down ok and
then I am going to start this sea line
dot Sh by just running it sea line dot
Sh
it will stop in start my IDE by the
meantime I will just minimize all the
other things which are not required and
for the first time it looks like this
and which is looking very neat to me I
will create a first program and when I
am going to create a first program it's
giving me this message that is going to
create a folder called C Line project
and I will give the project name as test
for example so it is going to create a
folder called C Line project slash test
and I will click OK and now I will it
will start this project I think continue
and the first look is impressive I am
impressed I must say because I have
worked with other C++ I des like QT and
Eclipse and C code blocks and this looks
to me very nice this IDE so as I have
already told you that this IDE uses C
make to build this file so you will be
able to see our main dot CPP in addition
we will be able to see the C make file
which is inside your project file ok so
every project is going to have the C
make list file C make list or txt which
is which will help us to make our
program okay it's like a make file but
it's more advanced okay so what I'm
going to do I'm going to just run the
sample program first and let's see how
the output looks like an output is
printed here hello world which is really
good and now what I'm going to do I am
going to create a new file for example
here I will right click on my projects
new file and for example I want to
create a file called the polygon dot cpp
or polygon dots HPP for example and you
can see the file is created but it's not
included because whenever you want to
build your program with c make you need
to include this new file to your c make
list so I'm going to include it polygon
dot HPP and once I added this file I
will be able to see these two options
here reload changes or enable auto
reload I will just click reload changes
but I prefer this option much because
whenever you change it will your C make
will automatically reload your files so
once I did this I will be able to see
that this is include I think in my list
if the spelling is slight and spelling
is not right okay now I think it will be
included reload it once again now the
color changes that means it's included
and one more thing I want to do is I
want to split my view so that I can view
both my files which is which is mean
file and
my polygon dot CPP file so I am going to
search for this split window if I can
find here
okay so I will go to the windows yeah
added tabs split vertically now I can
see this polygon lot H P P and so in
both the views I can see the same file
right and I will check the intelligence
now it's really nice I just typed high n
and it gives me intelligence include and
for example I want to include iostream
and really good it's Auto completing and
I'm going to create a class for example
I will name it as polygon and once I do
this it's Auto completing my class so
which is very nice feature
and once again it auto-completed and for
example what I am going to do is I will
I am going to declare two variables and
with comma height and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to check whether it
generates my code or constructor or and
other things or not automatically I will
click my class and I will go to code
maybe and I will say general rate and
says constructor so I'm going to
consider generate the constructor okay
so in general it has generated the
constructor let's try to generate getter
and setter so I will just select one
parameter generate get a setter and our
we generate get a setter for both my
width and height and sets so it's really
fast to develop your programs like this
right for example I will just create a
function declaration for example void
set values and int a comma int B and I
want to have the definition for this
method or function go to code generate
and implement method and it
automatically finds your function which
you have defined it's implemented so you
can implement your method like this okay
so just search for the short keys how
it's going to you know work these short
keys because it's really handy to make
your programming fast or your project
development fast right so overall I'm
quite impressed with this IDE and I must
say I am going to you know develop some
of my project using this IDE so I hope
you have enjoyed this video please wait
commands
five and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
