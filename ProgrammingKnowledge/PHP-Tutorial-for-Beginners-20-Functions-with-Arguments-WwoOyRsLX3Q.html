last video I have shown you what is a
function how to declare function and I
have given you a small little
demonstration of basic function now in
this video I am going to show you how to
use function that takes arguments or
parameters okay so let's get started for
example I want to do something useful
with the function for example I want to
add two values in the function so I can
make a function like this function add
right so I can make a function call ad
and what it does is it adds two values
but I want to make this function
something like this that it can take any
values and add them any two values for
example so here in these brackets I can
pass arguments or parameters so that
those parameters can be added and
printed so for example I want to pass
first variable which we I call num1
comma so whenever you want to pass
multiple arguments you separate your
argument by comma so just remember this
and I will pass the second number for
example and they just bear in mind you
can provide any number of argument here
so it's not restricted that you need to
provide only one argument or two or
three it's not restricted okay so you
can provide any number of arguments you
wish but for now I am providing two
numbers and what I want to do is I want
to add these two numbers when this
function is called and print this so I
can just write echo and I can just call
these two numbers and add them num1 and
just i can add
with num2 which it this should be numb
and with this and symbol okay so and
let's let me concatenate this with a
break
BR okay so what I have done I have
passed two arguments to my function and
whatever I pass here as two numbers it
will add those two numbers and print the
result
so how can I call this function add so
just use the same name as your function
name and then you need to pass two
numbers because it's taking two
numerical values so I can pass two
numbers something like this 899 comma
thousand for example okay and let's see
what is the result
I call it once and I have a fresh map
Road program it gives me the result one
eight nine nine which is the addition of
these two number now suppose I want to
add some more numbers right so I have
the requirement of adding these two
numbers and for example I want to add
some more number so I want to add two
thousand plus one one zero zero and I
want to add some other numbers for
example six thousand and one three zero
zero okay and I'll save it and when I
run this I can get all these three
results and bear in mind there is only
one function which are we are using
again and again to perform a similar
task this that is the basic definition
of function if you remember right a
function is used to perform a particular
task again
and again and this function is doing
just that
right just we have just changed those
arguments and it's adding those two
values right and this is the very basic
you know importance of functions in any
language right
it makes your code really readable and
it makes your code not repeatable and it
makes your code to perform a particular
task again and again without writing the
code again and again so suppose this
function have some you know many numbers
of line you cannot write those you know
many numbers in buying again and again
it will make your program non readable
but using functions it can be done
easily so this is how you can use
arguments or parameters with functions
in the next video I am showing I'm going
to show you how to return value from a
function so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
