video I will show you how to make a
simple calculator with the help of your
visual beasts basic windows form
application so let's get started first
of all I will take two labels from the
tool box and then I will take two text
boxes from the tool box and I will take
a button okay so now I have all the
things let me change the font of all the
all the labels first of all a label name
I will change so first label name is
num1 label number one and the text is
number one okay and the font is font
will be a little bit bigger so let's see
bold and sixteen okay and same for the
text box for the text box font will be a
little bit bigger bold sixteen label two
font will be bit bigger and for the text
box also pick a font and for the button
also and let us change
texts of this labor this is number two
and this button is the result so button
text is result okay so now I have number
one and number two so whenever I enter
number one and number two and click this
result worth button it should show me
the result of for example sum or
addition or whatever now I will just
click this result button and double
click it and in here I will write code
first of all I will declare some global
variables so i will write dem number one
as these are integer is equal to first
of all I will not give any value to the
integer so in the same way I will
declare number two variable in the same
way copy and paste I will declare a
variable integer for answer okay once
this is done and then in the button
click event in this button click event I
will write the code number one is equal
to whatever we enter in the textbox one
so text box one dot text in the same way
for number two number two variable that
means this variable is equal to text box
- so these text box 1 and text box two
are the names of this text boxes
you see here Xbox one and textbox to
right so this is this and answer is
answer is equal to number number one
plus number two okay
and then we will simply transfer this to
the answer label or message box so let's
give the answer in message box so I'll
write message box dot show and inside
this message I will pass the answer okay
so this is done now this program will
add these two numbers and show in the
message box so let us try and run the
program for example I enter first number
as 20 and second number as 40 and I will
click this result and it shows me 60 or
45 it shows me 65 but for example when
you want to enter some integer for
example two point three four plus two
point five five it will still show me
the integer value not the decimal value
so for that if you want to show these
values as a decimal instead of here
instead of declaring these number as
integer you just change it as single
okay and change all these values as
single and then run the program once
again to point one two plus four point
five and now it shows me the result but
in the message box you need to is
showing the correct value but what I am
doing here is what you see here when you
give 2.2 to or as and for second integer
as two point three three or whatever it
will give me this type of integer but
when you enter to common this is
considered as point here and this also
is considered as point and then you see
here it's showing the correct visual 6.4
for now so just remember this while you
are making the calculator now for
example you want to subtract number two
from number one just just add here the
subtract sign and then run your program
and for example I want to subtract five
from twenty the result is fifteen now
for example you want to divide just give
this divided sign and now run the
program and first number is twenty
second is five result will be four okay
it's working and for multiplication just
gave this asterisk here and run the
program and 20 multiplied by five will
be hundred okay so in this way you can
perform mathematical expressions or
mathematical calculation using Visual
Basic
