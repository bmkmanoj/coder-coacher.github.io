video I will show you how to make a
simple HTML editor with the help of your
visual C++ windows form application so
first of all open the form and drag this
web browser into your form so like this
and then take a text box into your form
and just this arrow sign just click it
and just click multi-line so you should
be able to enter multi-line in this text
and you can just resize it
so what I'm going to do is I want to
enter a simple HTML text here and I want
to see the output of my HTML code here
okay this is a basic HTML editor so I
hope it will work for the basic HTML
testing so after taking these two just
double click your text box which is this
so I double clicked it and I reached to
the end of this text box okay and here
you need to write a code which is this
so here right this arrow pointer web
browser one which is the name of your
browser so this one you just click this
and take the name of your web browser
which is this and this web browser arrow
pointed document text is equal to this
arrow pointed text box name so this is
your text box name which is text box one
in my case you can change this name also
and arrow pointer text so just write
this line okay simple code only one line
code so just
copy and paste this line into your code
and now I think we are good to go so I
will run my program and see if it's
running or not
yes it's running so whatever you will
enter here as a HTML code the output of
your HTML code should appear in this web
browser so for example I enter the code
like this for the paragraphs and you can
see the output is simply displayed in
this web browser or else for example I
want to display a button and the output
of the button so I will just remove this
and I will paste the code for the button
and yes you can see the button so in
this way you can make a simple HTML
editor with the help of your visual C++
windows form application I hope you have
learned something new this time please

now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
