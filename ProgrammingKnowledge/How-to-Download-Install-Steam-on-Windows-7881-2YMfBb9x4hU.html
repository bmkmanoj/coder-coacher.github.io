show you how you can download and
install steam on your Windows operating
system I'm using Windows 8.1 for this
demonstration but you know you can use
Windows 7 or Windows 8 to install steam
so first of all what you need to do you
just need to open your browser and just
search for steam and the first link you
will find here is www or stor dots
steam-powered comm okay so you just need
to open this website steam-powered comm
and this will open this steam-powered
comm web site and from here you can
choose your language whatever language
you speak and then here is the option to
install steam so there is a small green
option to install steam so just click
this button install steam and then just
click this button install steam now and
save this file and I don't think this
file is really big so it will be
downloaded really fast and once this is
downloaded just go to the executable
file wherever you have saved and start
installation and click Next accept
license terms and condition and it says
you are above 18 or above 13 years of
age choose your language I choose
English click Next and this is the
location where steam will be installed
so by default location is C equal
Program Files axis 86 slash steam we can
change this by going to the Browse
button and change the location but I am
going to use the default location just
click install
and installation we'll start an
installation also will not take long
time and once installation is finished
just keep checked this checkbox and
click finish and steam will open so it's
open now you see it's updating and it's
going to open in some moment so I am
going to minimize this browser for now
and once this process is complete
hopefully steam will start updating
steam extracting packages and it can
take sometimes if you are installing
steam for the first time so I will pause
the video for this process to complete
and once this is complete we continue
and now this process is complete and if
you don't have steam account you want to
you have to create steam account in
order to use download games and also I'm
going to create a new account and I will
agree with the conditions and agree and
give your account name for example I
will hear my call name
and password we type the password and it
says powerful password too short I am
going to change it and once again click
Next and contact email it will require
my contact email I will give it and
confirm it I will click Next
and it says a valid email is required so
let us see you watch the valid email for
me and click Next and once you give your
correct email than last some security
question what is the name of your school
what is your favorite team and mother's
maiden name or whatever name of your Pat
I will choose name of my pet as Tiger
for example and click Next and it's
creating my account
and it's done so once the installation
is complete you can just go to steam
here and you may need to verify your
password you just need not password but
the email address it will show you some
warning that you need to confirm your
email address or verify your email
address just click yes and just go to
your email which you have provided and
just click the link which steam has sent
you and your address will be verified
and for the first time and you open
steam it will look like this and you can
go here to add games for example I want
to browse the steam store for games and
this will give me the steam store for
game and in here I can choose judge
honors of my game or whatever game I
want to purchase Oakley so I will choose
some free-to-play games let's see what
is the options can laser rocket was on
wheels
max gentleman deser
so you can choose any you know game and
just start playing it so for example I'm
going to choose this and then you can
just play it okay so I hope you have
