last video I have shown you how to use
FL statement in C++ in this video I am
going to talk about second type of
conditional statement which is switch
statement so let's see how we can use
switch statement in C++ so I am going to
take an example first of all I will
declare a variable called character and
I named it as grade and then I will
output a question to the user that
please enter the grade and I will close
this and end the line okay now I will
wait for the user to input the grade so
I will say cin insertion operator great
now on the basis of user-defined trade
or whatever user enters as a grade i
want to show some message so let's see
how I can do this with switch statement
so what is the declaration of the switch
statement so you need to write switch
and then these parenthesis and then you
need to give these curly braces and in
here inside this curly braces we are
going to define some cases okay but
first of all in this curly bracket we
provide the condition okay so our
condition is this grade on the basis of
this grade we are going to decide the
message we want to show right so in here
the right cases so just write case and
because we are evaluating the character
with grade which is a character and
character
we can write it as like this right
so if user enters character a then just
give this : this is not a semicolon but
that :
right so remember this and then you can
output your message C out and you can
say excellent okay and and the line and
in the same way on the basis of grade
entered you can define different cases
but there is an optional break point in
switch cases that you can declare it
like this break so what this does is I
will explain you in a moment but I will
copy this and paste it two or three
three times for different conditions so
if the grade is B grade enter this V you
can say very good and if the gate grade
entered is C you can show the message
that you passed okay
and there is a one more important
condition in switch cases that doesn't
fulfill the provided condition so what
happens if the user does not provide a B
or C what happens in the case user
provides some random character so what
will happen then so you can just deal
with that random character by
default and what is a default in any
case other than the case listed above
you are going to show the message see
out invalid entry okay so the user knows
that he has entered a wrong entry right
and I will just close it and break or go
I'd break here okay so now I will
explain what's happening here
so what happening here is this is a
switch statement so then a typo I made
it here so switch statement decide on
the basis of grade on the condition you
enter or user enters so it sees whether
user has entered a B or C and on the
basis of the provided condition it
decide what message he wants to print
okay
so let's build the program and run the
program program else building and now
let's run the program and for example I
enter the grade a so I should ideally
see this message excellent let's see if
I get it or not I am the a as a grade
and press ENTER and programs shows me
excellent once again I enter the grade B
and press ENTER it says very good and
once again if I enter some random err
random character for example D and press
enter it saves me invalid NP because
it's not fulfilling these listed
condition in case right now there is a
unique property in switch cases that
this break is optional right so for
example I give a new case here case
small a here okay so in the case of tips
the user enter small a I'm not providing
any condition or any break here right so
now what happens in this condition if I
don't provide any break after my case
what happens is it goes to this
condition if user enters small in and
then it sees that if the break is there
and if he finds the break it breaks the
switch conditions and go out of this
switch otherwise if the break is not
found in this case or in this condition
it goes to the next case and performs
the conditions here when tuition here so
which is excellent and then he sees yes
now I find break so he goes out of this
condition here so when you enter or when
the user enters this small a this code
will be executed which is the next
immediate next case of the switch
statement so let me explain or let me
show you by this example I will build
the example and run the program and for
example I enter small a small a and I
will press ENTER and you see the message
comes here is X
and and you can ask why this condition
is executed at other than this small a
condition because you haven't provided
the break here so if you don't provide
break after your condition or after the
case it will go and execute the next
code or next condition okay and when it
sees that yeah I get the break then it
goes out of the condition so always
remember that what do you want to do you
want to give the break or you want to
execute the next condition also okay so
this is the thing to remember in case
and always remember that you catch any
exception other than cases by default
okay so these are the two things to
remember in switch cases I hope you have
understood the concept of case and I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
