node.js tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how to use pipes
to serve your text which you are reading
from our text file to a browser for
example and we have learned some
concepts about pipes now let's use this
concept to serve a HTML page to a
browser for example so let's get started
and first of all we are going to create
an HTML page so I'm going to right click
and I'm going to name my HTML page as
index dot HTML ok so just create a page
called index dot HTML and in here we are
going to write our HTML code okay
so let's add our HTML tag first of all
and then we are going to add head and
body elements so just add head first and
let's add a body element also and inside
this body let's write something so
inside the body for example I want to
add a h1 tag and in this h1 tags let's
write something so for example or first
node.js HTML page for example okay and
let's give some style to this page for
example let's add first of all the style
element here instead of this just write
style and then inside the style let's
change the background color of our
webpage so we can just do it by just
changing the background color of the
body so just add body here and we will
change the background color right so
just choose background
kalo and which color we want for example
light green or something like this so
let's use light green is there any light
green here here this okay right so this
is essentially changing the background
color of your HTML page and it has one
h1 element which has some text here okay
now because it's in the same folder as
our project file so we don't need to
worry about any path here and instead of
this file dot txt we can just write
index dot HTML okay so just write index
dot HTML and instead of plain text slash
plain here now we are sending the HTML
content to the browser so just replace
this plane by HTML here okay
and we will be good to go so let's rerun
our saga so I'm going to rerun our
server and let's refresh our page and
now we have our first HTML page solved
using our node.js over to the browser
right so this is not really complicated
and if you want to make a static website
you can add multiple you know static
HTML page pages and serve it using this
technique but no chase is much more
advanced and the complex technology and
it can be used to you know do more
complex stuff right so this is the
simple way of just catering an HTML page
toward the browser in the further videos
we will see how we can use some more
complex functionality with no GS I hope
