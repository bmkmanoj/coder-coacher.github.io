video I will show you how to find the
sum of rows or column of a data grid
view so if you are following this video
I have made this form till now and in
here I have a dot data grid view in
which I am taking the values from the
data base and now I want the sum of all
ages so whatever ages are here I want
the sum of them so how can I show the
sum I will show you today so let me
close it now in here select your data
grid view and go to event and in the
event I will choose for example keydown
event so for every key down and when I
press ENTER it will give me no actually
it will be the good idea to take a
button to show the sum of Ages so I will
take a button and I will make a little
bit space here to show the sum okay and
I will change its text in the properties
so age some okay now I will double-click
this age some button and in here I will
declare a inter first int variable sum
and then I will declare a for loop so
for and in the for loop I will give the
condition into I
and I is less than Mike the data grid
view name so my daughter gridview name
is I will select this and I will go to
the properties and the data grid view
name is data grid view one once again so
I is less than data grid view dot rows
dot count and then third out given will
be the plus plus I okay
and any I haven't initialized this for
loop so I will initialize it and inside
the for loop what I will do is I will
take a sum
so I will write sum plus is equal to and
then I will write convert dot to into 32
so because I have taken this sum as int
variable that is why I need to convert
whatever the value is coming in to the
integer that's why I have written this
conversion and then break it and ragged
clothes and inside this bracket so in
here I will write this dot a gridview
name then the row dot Rose and I will
provide this square bracket inside I
pass the I variable okay then I will
write dot cell and this year will take
the cell number which I want to one the
sum of so I want the sum of my ages
which is the cell number three okay so
here goes the cell number I will also
show you how I get this cell number once
I run the program this is showing the
error because I don't initialize this
sum is equal to zero now after this for
loop go outside and go write message box
dot show and break it on back it closed
and inside I will write my some variable
- strength okay and racket emblica
closed so this whole goat will give me
the sum of my ages so let's try and run
the program username and password load
table and when I press this some age it
should give me the value of some of ages
so I have given the cell number three
because this is cell number zero cell
number one cell number two and cell
number three that's why I have given
here if you can see cell number three so
in this way you can count the cell zero
one two three and third cell is the cell
for ages so that's why I have taken cell
3 now I will press this some age eight
some button and it gives me some okay so
let's see what is the error I think
after this cell I must have given dot
value because I'm taking the cell
content but not the value so just go
after yourself and then add value now
run the program once again and load
table and it gives me the sum of all
ages okay now suppose you want not the
sum but the average of your ages so how
can you do that it's also very simple so
you have the sum and now first of all
this button I will change the name as
average instead of some I will write
average first AVG for example and I have
the sum and the average is sum by the
number of values right so what I will do
is I already have the sum now I will
count the number of rows so how will I
do this
it's simple I'm just counting the number
of row here also so I will just copy
this code from here and I will declare
into count count row for example and is
equal to I will give this value
okay so this will give me the number of
rows in my data grid view and what now I
need to do is I need to give the average
so averages sum by number of values so I
will give double for example is equal to
know double AVG first and then is equal
to sum divided by count row okay and
now I will just take this average from
here and paste it here so just I will
convert this average into string and
show it in the message box so let's try
and run the program and if it gives the
average or not - - which is not username
and password and let's see it gives the
average of my ages or not so yes my
average age of employee is 35 so in this
way you can count the number of our the
sum and the average of the column you
want to make the sum so I hope you have
