a new video series on WPF application
using c-sharp
so first question comes into mind is
till now we have been seeing or I have
been showing you how to make windows
form application using c-sharp and why
do we need WPF application using C shop
so windows form application when we see
like this and when I run it it takes the
styling and the appearance of the
windows version you are running for
example I'm running Windows 7 so it
takes the look and feel of Windows 7
window but some application requires
design designing their own design right
so for achieving that goal we use
windows form application of course there
are all other application of all other
advantage of using windows form
application and as well as advantage of
choosing WPF application so if you want
to learn more about what is the
difference between windows form
application and WPF then you can always
google it and I come across the first
link which is from Microsoft and
somebody answered the question WPF vs
windows form application and when I
click it you can see the nice
explanation he has given what is the
difference between or what is that why
they are used but this answer is
I mean given in was given in 2007 so
till now windows form application and
WPF also have been evolved a lot so you
can always go and read this difference
between them and decide what suits your
application so now too much talking and
now we are going to make our first
program so go to file new project and go
to visual c-sharp and we will choose WPF
application and I will call my
application as WPF app one and I will
click OK and one thing you will notice
is it's the design or the appearance of
this form is not as the form which we
have generated in Windows form right so
it's a little bit different I will just
make it a little bit bigger so you can
see so it generates this form in which
we can design our application view and
it also generate this XAML file which in
which we can write the code for
designing this form so let's see how
this changes when you design something
so what I will do is first of all I will
make it a little bit smaller so you can
see here and here is also one good
feature you can always make it bigger by
sliding this slider ok so now I will
take a button from here
and now for example I want to change the
properties so what can I can I do is
I will just click this button and go to
the properties right here or I can
change it from here also so when I drag
and drop a button in the grid tag it has
generated this code automatically so the
content or the caption of this button is
button and it has horizontal alignment
or on margin and all all the properties
are generated in this XAML file right so
you can change it from here also and you
can go to the properties and change it
from here also so let's try and change
first the content content is the caption
so for example test I write as a content
and here it changes here now for example
I want to change the name I can go here
in the button code this code is for the
button and I can change the name so I
can give the name as bTW and one for
example and see here when I change the
width the width also width and height
also changes here so whatever you change
here it will be affected here and
whatever change you make here here it
will be affected here so both are
changed if you make changes in one file
or one one perspective so now we want to
do something with this test button so I
will double click it you can always go
to the event and go come here from going
to the event I will show you that also
so I double click the button and for
example I want to show the message so I
will write message
just like using the windows form
application there also we write message
box dot show and here is the
first app for example and test first app
test okay so I will make it bigger so
you can see it so I have written this
code now I can just hit this green
button start debugging and it opens this
form so you can see it's the appearance
is totally white and when I click this
button it shows me the message box right
here so this was the first application
you generate it from your WPF
application you can always change this
properties of this button or this form
by going to the properties or from here
also so just click it and for example I
want to change you can change the layout
from here you can change the visibility
from here and brush from here so for now
I won't change the foreground and
background for example background black
is okay for me and foreground black is
okay for me and background for example I
want to change it a little green okay so
it changes this color and when I run
this now it looks three so you can
select and see all the properties from
here how the changes you can always play
with these properties and see what
changes occurs here so this was the
first video on WPF application in the
future I will also make some other
videos and probably I'm going to make a
simple project so if with each video we
will develop a project and you will be
able to learn more so I hope you have
enjoyed this video please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
