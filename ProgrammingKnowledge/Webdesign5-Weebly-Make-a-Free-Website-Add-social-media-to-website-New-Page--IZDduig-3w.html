social media to my website so Weebly
provides these when you go at the top of
your website here you can see Facebook
Twitter in and other social media
options you just need to provide the
title so i will instead of add a text
here i will add text and i will name my
thing as social media so whoever visits
my site will see this social media and
he or she will click this these option
and this option will open my social
media page such as net be at beans java
facebook page or twitter page so now i
just need to add my link here for
facebook and twitter so i will just copy

related to New netbeans Java series but
I intend to make more videos on other
languages also so right now I will
provide only netbeans Java videos link

tutorials and i don't want to hide my
face or leave them as it is and i will
save my settings and

it here also i will change the image was
