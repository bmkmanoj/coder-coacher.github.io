video I will show you how to create a
text file and write on it so for example
I will take a button from my tool box
and I will name it as create text file
okay
and I will resize my button so when I
press this button it will create a text
file and whatever I want to write in
this text file I could be able to write
so just select this button and double
click it and it will lead to the code
but before writing the code for the text
file you need to include this using
namespace system IO this is for the text
file and file management so you just
need to include this line in wherever
you're using namespace collection in
stairs so just add this line also there
okay and then once again come to your
I got button click event here and here
write the code so we need to write
stream writer
and then this cap symbol and then you
can give a name to your we're able so
out fine for outputting the file is
equal to GC new once again copy this
stream writer and paste it here bracket
and bracket closed and in here in this
bracket we will write the name of our
file so first of all the Bluecoats and
for example I want to name my file as
test dot txt file okay and you can also
provide the path of the file also
wherever you want your file to be
created the path
I just want my file to be created in the
project folder so I just I'm writing
this test talk dot txt so this will
create my text file in my project folder
wherever my project is there otherwise
you can provide seee and this type of
apart ok
and then in the next line just copy this
out file variable and then arrow
right and break it and break it closed
and in here you will write our code not
our code but our text so let's write
hello hello world and then in the next
line once again copy this variable and
paste it here and pointer closed so this
is the simple code to write hello world
first of all could we create a text file
called test doc daughter text and it
will just write one line which is hello
world and just close your file so let's
try and run up code 1 yes
and when I press this create text file
button it should create a file in my
folder so I press this and I go to my
project folder and it has generated this
text file in my project folder wherever
my project is there for this visual C++
application and then I will open this
test dot text file and you can see it
has written hello world in it for
example if you want to add some more
lines in your court so just copy this
and paste it once again and after your
first line here hello world we just need
to add / r / m okay so this two line
will change your line so this second
line will appear on the second line
otherwise if you don't provide this / or
/ and it will write your second hello
world for example - and hello world 3 it
will just write right beside this hello
world which only not not good right we
want our lines to be on different lines
so let's try and run our code once again
and when you press this create text file
and just open your folder once again
test I will open this test once again
and you can see hello world hello world
- and hello world three each on
different line okay so in this way you
can generate a text file and you can
write in it you can also generate dot
file or word file from it if I'm correct
let's see and check if it generates the
docx file also or not so run
and I press this button once again and I
will check the folder once again and it
has created the text not the text but
the docx file or Word file for us and
let's see if it has our and yes it has
our text and this document is a Word
document so you can try what files are
possible with this file writer or stream
writer you can I think you can generate
Excel files also what you need to check
whether I'm correct or not so I hope you
