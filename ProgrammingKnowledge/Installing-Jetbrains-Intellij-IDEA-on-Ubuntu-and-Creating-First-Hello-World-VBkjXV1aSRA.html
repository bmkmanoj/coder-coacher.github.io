show you how you can download and
install IntelliJ IDEA IDE on your open
to operating system and I'm also going
to show you how you can create your
first java project in IntelliJ IDEA IDE
so first of all before installing
IntelliJ IDEA you need to have Oracle
Java installed in ubuntu because
IntelliJ IDEA IDE requires in Oracle
Java installation on your open to
operating system so first of all if you
don't have a Oracle Java installed on
your system you can use these three
command to install Oracle Java I'm going
to post these three commands in the
description so that you can run these
commands and you will be good to go now
once you have a Oracle Java in your open
to operating system you can now download
this IntelliJ IDEA IDE by searching for
jet prints comm and in the result you
will be able to see IntelliJ IDEA you
can click this link and in here you can
go to get IntelliJ IDEA now and make
sure Linux is selected here and IntelliJ
IDEA comes in two versions or two
editions one is ultimate and one is
community ultimate is more advanced and
you know you can use this commercially
to develop commercial project in Java
and other languages and other one is
community edition which is free and open
source and you can use this for learning
purposes so I'm going to download this
and once you click this download button
you will be able to see this save
window so you can just click OK and save
it once you have already saved this zip
file you will be able to see this idea I
see zip file here now you can right
click and extract this folder and once
this folder is extracted you will be
able to run this IntelliJ IDEA by going
inside this folder so this folder is
extracted I'm going to go inside this
and inside this you will be able to see
these folders and the folder which we
require is bin and in here we will be
able to see a script called idea dot Sh
ok so we need to run this shell script
using terminal in order to install
IntelliJ IDEA so what we are going to do
is I'm going to open my terminal and I'm
going to go to this download directory
and then idea and inside this I am going
to go to bin folder and I can see idea
dot SSH file is here so I can run this
by dot slash and then idea dot as such
ok so give this command and press ENTER
and it's going to run this IDE
installation and for the first time it's
going to ask you do you have the
previous version of IntelliJ IDEA I
don't have it so I will leave it as
default and click OK
and now it will ask which theme you want
so but the default one is IntelliJ which
has this white background and this team
you will be able to see this here dark
allah has this dark team and gtk has
some other team so by default it's
IntelliJ and if you want dark team then
you can choose Dhokla but for now I'm
going to choose IntelliJ team here and
then I will click Next and it's saying
me create a desktop entry for
integration with system application menu
I'm going to click Next Next and now I
will just start using IntelliJ IDEA by
it clicking this button you can use
these extra plugin in order to you know
use idea whim which is a whimp which is
the integration for wim idea
or a scholar language but I'm going not
going to use them for now so I'm just
going to just click start using IntelliJ
and I'm going to minimize this terminal
and now you can create your first
project so just create a new project
click create new project and it's going
to give us this kind of window so you
just need to choose this Java from here
and in here you can choose the SDK okay
so for choosing your SDK what you need
to do is you just need to click this new
here and just select JDK okay so in here
you just need to choose a
this Java 8 Oracle so for me it's an
user slash lave /jv m / Java - 8 -
Oracle okay so just go to this Java - 8
- Oracle and click OK and it's going to
set up this path for you and now you can
just select this and just click Next and
in here create project from template we
don't have any so we are going to click
Next and give the name to your project
for example my first and click finish
and now my project is created I'm just
going to click close and I can see this
project here my first you just need to
click here on my first or whatever your
project name is and it's going to open
all these files we are interested in
source folder because we are going to
create our Java file in side this source
okay so what we can do is we can right
click to this source folder and we can
just create a package for example for
Java file so for example my pack for
package name and inside this package we
can create a new Java class or new Java
class and give the name to your Java
class for example my class and click OK
and it's going to create a new Java
class for us in a file called my class
dot Java ok so this is the barebone
class for us and inside this we can
write the code so inside this class we
are going to create our main method so
let's use a very nice shortcut just
write P as V M here and give a tab and
it's going to create a method for you
main method for you right so inside this
main method what I'm going to do is I'm
going to print something so I will just
write as out tab and it's going to give
me this code system dot out dot print
line and inside this argument brackets
we can just write hello
world okay and now we can run our
program by going to build and we can
make our program by clicking make module
my first or make project anything you
can choose and and now you can run your
program by going to this run tab and
click this run option here and you can
choose your class name my class and it's
printing hello world here now after
building or and running your program for
the first time you will be able to see
this green button here so whenever you
add it your program for example I will
just print hello world YouTube for
example I added this message and I can
just click this Run button so I can see
this message hello world YouTube so in
this way you can download and install
IntelliJ IDEA on your open to operating
system and create your first project
inside IntelliJ IDEA I hope you have
