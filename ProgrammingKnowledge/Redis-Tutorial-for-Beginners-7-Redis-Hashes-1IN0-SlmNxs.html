register tool for beginners in the last
two videos we have talked about string
values in red is now in this video I'm
going to show you how you can use hashes
as values in Redis now first of all what
are hashes hashes are map between the
string fields and string values hence
they are perfect datatype for
representation of objects in red is
every hash can store up to 4 billion
field value pairs now you may ask that I
have talked about key value pairs but
what are these field value pairs right
so let me show you a slide and then you
will be able to understand in a better
way so this was the slide similar kind
of slide I have shown you in the string
datatype also right so in the hashes we
are talking about hashes now so in the
case of hashes the keys are same which
are printable ASCII you can see here but
in the case of string we were using
string array here right and that string
array was about 512 megabyte right now
in the case of hashes we use this kind
of map of field value right so field is
this 1 and value is this one okay in the
cases of string it was like a like only
a string value right so I will give you
an example for example I want to store
our students database or students info
data then what I can do here is I can
say student 1 as a key so student 1 as a
key and then for example student has
what attribute student has for example
name surname age in which class he is so
here a field can be name and then for
example name is equal to mark value 1
can be marked right
age is the peel to for example in this
case and then for example 15 is the
value to here right surname can be
filled three here and then whatever the
surname of the student it will be value
three right so for every student we can
just provide this kind of map for his
information so this is how hash data
type as well you work in Redis right now
let's take a practical example and then
we will be able to understand this
concept so I'm going to just start the
Redis CLI and let me see what are the
keys there so I am going to just write
key is pattern and these are all the key
so I'm going to flush all so let me
flush all here so all the keys will be
deleted and now I am going to clear this
CLI and let's start with the hashes
right so as we have seen in the case of
strings we can just use this set command
to set a key value pair now in the case
of hashes we can use HM set to set a key
field value pair right so for example we
were talking about student information
database right so just right hm set H
stands for hashes here and set we have
already seen in the case of swings also
right so just write H am set and then
for example s tu1 for student 1 and then
for example I will just write name is
equal to max right and then I can also
give the second field value pair right
so for example his age is equal to 15
and then for example class in which
class he is so he is in for example 8
plus okay this is just an example
so this is student 1 information let me
just give this minus here so we will be
able to understand properly and then
when I press ENTER is going to say ok
and to get this value there are two ways
of getting so you can just say H get and
the key name for example s tu minus 1 is
the key name and you can give the field
name whatever field you want to get or
you can just say get a key name and here
get we have already seen in the case of
strings also and you just need to add H
before it and then the student key name
I says error because we just need to
give the field name also so what field
we want to get so we want to get for
example name of student 1 it says max
here right now if you want to get all
the information about student 1 you can
just say H get all ok and here you can
just give the student 1 key name it's
going to give you all the you know field
value information about the student 1 so
for example name max age 15 plus 8 okay
so let's add one more student for
example so once again this command H hm
set student 2 and then the name for
example Tom age is 12 for example and
class is 7 ok let's enter and once again
you can get the information about the
student to using s tu minus 2 right let
me clear the terminal so in this way you
can just set the hash value and get the
hash value right now there is one more
command for for example H exists
and this will tell you if the field
inside this hash types exists or not so
just write H exists and then the key
name for example s tu minus 1 and then
for example I am searching for surname
ok and surname field does not exist in
student 1 info right and then I press
ENTER it says integers 0 so there is no
information about the surname of student
1 right in the case of name this name
exists right the mean field exist in
this student 1 hash trap so when I just
give this value then it says integer 1
that means it exists so 0 it does not
exist 1 it exists right now for example
I want to delete our value what I can do
I can just say H de L and it says first
of all I need to give the key name so s
tu 1 and I want to delete for example
class from it so I will just write class
and then I can just press Enter
right and then I can just do H get all
and the student 1 key and now you can
see class doesn't exist here anymore
right for example I want to set once
again the same value I can just write H
M set and then the same student s tu 1
and then plus 8 ok and then press Enter
it says ok and once again H get all
student 1 and now once again the class
is added here ok so you can add and
delete the values from this hash like
this so for deleting you use H
del and then once again for setting you
just add this field value pair now there
is one more command called at set and X
so H set and X so this where this
command is used for setting the field
value if the field does not exist
so if the field does not exist this
command will be successful and if the
field exists this command will not be
successful so for example I will just
say st one name so name field already
exists right and i will just give some
other name to the student 1 right and it
says 0 so this command is not successful
because this command will be successful
only in the case of the field not
available right so if I do the same
command and I know that surname is not
there so I will just write surname and
some surname and then press ENTER and
return so integer 1 that means it has
created this field value inside this
student set right so once again when I
do get all st 1 now this student 1 also
have surname information now as in the
case of string we were using keys right
so we were writing keys Astrix right
same you can use for example H keys here
and then the key name for example
whatever key you want to give here as to
u 1 and it gives all the fields in that
hash so by field I mean the name and for
example age class and surname only the
field not the value of those fields so
it will only return the fields of that
key whatever
we provide here now as in the case of
string values we were having Dec are
II meant or incr for incrementing the
value so the same is available in the
case of hashes also so for example I
want to increase the age of some student
by some number I can do that so just
write H and then I n CR by and then the
key name s T u minus 1 for example and
the field name is age I want to in
Tremont his age and then right now the
age is 15 for example and I want to
increase the age by 2 and then press
ENTER and then once again when I do H
ket all st-1 now you can see the age
becomes 17 right so in order to
increment the value you just write H
incr by and the key and the field which
you want to increment now if you want to
know all that values of a particular key
then we can just write H Wells and then
the key name as to you 1 it will just
give you the values of that field value
pair right so right now it's not giving
name or age or class or surname it's
only giving the values of them which is
max and then 17 8 and the surname value
right so H mel's is small value okay now
if you want to know the length of some
hash for example I will just give this
command @l e n and then left you won the
key name minus 1 it will return you the
number of fields in that hash okay so
press enter and it returns for so I know
that student 1 key has number for number
of field name age class and surname so I
can just verify that with that okay so
for field so it will return number for
now
the last command I want to show here is
hm get so let me kick here the terminal
and then I just want to write H and get
and it will give you the result whatever
fields you want so for example for St
151 for example I just want to know the
name of that student I don't want any
other information about that student but
only the name then it will give me the
name right and for example I just want
to know the name and age even though the
student hash contains surname and class
also but I just want to know the name
and age that will just give me the name
and age when I use HM get than the key
name and the field name I want to see so
the PLM I want to see right now is name
and age so I just give name and age it
will give me the result of those field
only so in this way you can use hashes
in Redis I hope you enjoyed this video
