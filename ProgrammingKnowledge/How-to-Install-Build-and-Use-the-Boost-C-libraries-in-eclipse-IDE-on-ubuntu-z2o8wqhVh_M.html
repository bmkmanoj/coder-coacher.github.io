video I will show you how to install
post c++ libraries on your Ubuntu
operating system so why we use boost
libraries boost libraries are the set of
C++ libraries which helps you to write
some complicated programs suppose if you
are want to write a program which
communicate between two serial devices
or for example you want to write a
program which analyzes the file system
or a regular expression or many things
both libraries have which makes your
life simple while you are writing the
C++ program so that's why we use C boost
C++ libraries now let's see how we can
install these libraries on our open to
operating system so just open your
terminal and in here just give this
command so write sudo apt - get install
Lib boost - all - Dave so give this
command in order to install boost
libraries on your Ubuntu operating
system and press Enter and because I
already have installed these libraries
so it says me that these libraries are
already in the newest version but when
you install boost libraries for the
first time you will be prompted to give
some yes command or Y command and then
it will take around
- four minutes to install boost
libraries on your system and once these
libraries are installed in your Ubuntu
system you can go to your file system
here so click file system and in user
folder and in include folder you will be
able to see this boost libraries or
boost folder that means all the boost
libraries are installed in your system
ok so let's try and make a simple C++
program which uses these boost libraries
and we are going to use Eclipse for
writing our C++ program so I open my IDE
eclipse ID and make a new C++ program
and I name my program as boost test for
example and I will choose this hello
world project next next and next and
finish
and this will create a boost program C++
program for us so now it's here so we
have boost test program and we have the
simple hello world program so what I'm
going to do is I will remove or I will
replace this program with the simple
boost program which analyzes the number
of folder in your given path so I'm
using boost file system libraries for
that and right now you can see there are
so many errors while I'm used I'm
writing my code for boost file system so
what you need to do is you need to
provide the libraries which you are
using in this case I'm using boost file
system so that's why I need to give the
path to the libraries and the libraries
which I am using so just go to your
project right-click your project C++
project and go to the properties and in
the C build menu go to settings and in
the settings you need to go in this
cross g plus plus linker and in this you
need to go here in the library section
just click it and make it a little bit
bigger so it's waves visible properly so
go here this libraries in the cross G
Plus pass link
in the settings right and in the
libraries I will add the name of the
library which I'm using which is boost
file system so i will write boost
file system so these library depend upon
the program or libraries of boost you
are using if you are using regular
expression library or if you are using
boost ASI your library then you need to
change this library name from him so
click OK
and once again I will click this plus or
add button and I will include one more
libraries called boost system this is
the native libraries and library of
boost so you need to include this
library also in order to compile your
program so this library you need to
install because you are writing the
boost file system program and this is
the native library so you need to in
write include this to every program and
in this library search path you need to
give the path of the libraries so I
already told you that our library are in
user include folder right so I will
click this Add button here and I will go
to file system and in here I will go to
file system and search for user where my
boost libraries are so user include and
you can see my boost library is here so
you don't need to click this boost just
click user and include and press ok and
you see users I include just go that far
only don't include this
/ boost it will recognize it
automatically click ok and now you have
these two things so you have included
these two library names and the library
search path and click OK and when you do
that and when you save this program and
you build your program once again so you
can just right click and build project
also or you can click this button for
build and you will see that our program
will compile successfully
I hope so the process is going on right
now
I'm running this on my virtual machine
that's why it's giving me such a delayed
response but on your native open to
operating system it will be faster you
still see these error because you can
see here it's indexing those libraries
so when this will reach to 100% then
these error will go but our build is
successful there are no error here you
can see so there are no error in our
program and now you can see there is no
red lines because our program is
successful so this simple programs just
finds the number of files in your given
path so I will run my code or you can
see this code like this so if you want
you may also write this code so just
pause the video and copy the code if you
want and when I run this
it will give me the response so you can
see in the console my program is made
and I have 13 files in my home open to
folder ok so that's the program for
using boost file system so I hope you
have enjoyed this video and you have
liked this video please keep watching
these videos and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
