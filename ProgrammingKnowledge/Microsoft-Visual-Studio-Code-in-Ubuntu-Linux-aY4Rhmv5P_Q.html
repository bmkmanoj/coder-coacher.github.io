announced their new code editor called
Visual Studio code for building and
debugging modern web and cloud
applications and the most interesting
thing about this code editor is it's a
cross-platform code editor which can be
used on Linux Mac OS or Windows and in
this video we are going to download it
on our Linux operating system and see
how it works
Linux operating system already have good
code editors like vim or Emacs and some
other code editors but the learning
curve of these code editor which are
already there on Linux are really steep
so it's not easy to learn the and to
master them so let's see how easy it is
to use Visual Studio code so you can
download the preview of this video
Visual Studio code by going to the
Visual Studio comm website I'm going to
put the link in the description for the
download and you can see I can see this
download button for Linux so I'm going
to just click this and once you click
this you are going to download a zip
file which will look like this vs code -
Linux - x64 dot zip file so just
download it and then extract it wherever
you want so once it's extracted we are
going to go to the folder and what we
need to do is we just need to click this
code binary so just double click it and
it's going to open this visual studio
code so now this code editor or Visual
Studio code is open and you can see it's
a simple code editor which have some
really strong features like quick open
by pressing ctrl or ctrl ctrl tab
and then I it has the feature that you
can open multiple tabs side-by-side so
that you can evaluate your code and you
can even organize your files by double
clicking and the last thing is ctrl
shift P so when you press ctrl shift P
it's going to give you all the command
palettes or debugging options whatever
are present or whatever are is catered
by this code editor so what we are going
to do is we are going to create a new
HTML file for example so it's untitled
so we are going to title it
and it has created me this HTML file and
now let's write some code to check how
it works so I'm going to add first HTML
tag and you can see the intellisense
it's really quick and for example I'm
going to add the head now and when you
press this it autocompletes
right and for example let's add the body
also body and it autocompletes so it can
make your you know editing and
programming really fast right let's add
some paragraph here
and let's try to add some CSS content
here so let's start at style
it's really fast so intelligence is
really good here right now let's add
some style to the background so
I'm going to add background color so it
give me so many options by intelligence
and background color color this is the
most interesting thing I liked about
this is and I select some color the
color also appears what I'm going to
select so for example I'm going to
select red the color appears here or
some other colors for example blue you
can see the color appearing here itself
right so this you can do and for example
I want to change some properties of the
paragraph I can do it
so you can see it's really quick it
gives all the intelligence and
everything right and let's try to click
ctrl shift P now so ctrl shift P and
it's going to give you all the commands
available for the use for editing your
code you can see here it has a
integration with get also if you are
using get now when you click this button
here you can open the folder Explorer
and close the folder Explorer by just
clicking this app folder option right so
let's collapse this folder Explorer for
now and it has a nice formatting option
also for example I mess up my code and I
want to format my code now so I can
right-click and I can just click format
code and it's going to format my code
also right and now the other interesting
option here is you can open the single
file in multiple editors so I can just
click this button and it's going to open
my same file in multiple editors here
right and there are some other nice
features which you can explore by using
this code editor for example you want to
zoom in on zoom out you can set the
shortcut for this and you can zoom in or
zoom out your code like this ok so zoom
in and zoom out and for now they support
asp.net 5 and developing node.js so if
you require some help you can just click
this option and it's going to open you
this help how you can set up your node
application on this visual studio code
and you can read this and make your own
make your own node.js application
using this code right and if you like it
or if you don't like it you can give
your feedback by just clicking this
small button here you can just give your
feedback from here and send it to
Microsoft and they are going to look at
it so that's it you can explore this
visual studio code editor by yourself
and see if it fits your requirements or
not I hope you have enjoyed this video
