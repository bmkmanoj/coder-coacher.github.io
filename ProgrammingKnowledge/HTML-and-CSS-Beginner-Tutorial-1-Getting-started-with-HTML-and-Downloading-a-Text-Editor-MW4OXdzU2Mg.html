video I am starting a new video series
on HTML and CSS so those of you who have
never programmed HTML or who don't know
what is HTML the HTML language is
basically the basis of the majority of
websites on internet so basically you
make sweet and simple websites not
simple but a very good website using
esti HTML so for example on this screen
you can see this Google search page and

this sweet looking Google search page so
how can we verify that the HTML is
running behind it so just right lick
your page if you are on Google Chrome or
Mozilla and go here view page source and

sweet looking web page with the help of
HTML and CSS so let's see what is the
full form of HTML so when you see in the
Wikipedia HTML stands for Hyper text
markup language so this is a markup
language which is used for creating web
pages and there is a very good
information on this this page if you
want to learn more about this HTML
then you can always read this and HTML
just creates this text and all
paragraphs and tables on your web page
but what CSS do is CSS stands for
cascading style sheets so it provides
the style to your page like better fonts
and font style font size and many other
styling stuff is done with the help of
CSS so HTML and CSS go together to
create a good-looking website now for
