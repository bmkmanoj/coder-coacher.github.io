shown you how to deal with Reddy's in
your Microsoft Access database and I
have shown you how you can create query
in which you can calculate the bonus of
these employee on the basis of this pay
so now in this video what I'm going to
do is I am going to show you how you can
create a report on the basis of this
query or general report how you can
create general reports so what I'm going
to do is this query which I have created
in the last video in which I have
calculated the pay on the basis of not
the pay but I have calculated the bonus
on the basis of this pay where my pay my
bonus is equal to the pay multiplied by
50 what I'm going to do is I'm selecting
this query I am going to go to this
window button save save as object and I
will say employee data bonus query bonus
query and I will save it okay so now I
have this employee data I spelled it
wrong donors 20 but it's okay so I have
this query and I want to generate a
report on the basis of this query what I
can do is I can select this query from
here and I can go to create and I can go
to this report wizard here
so just take this report wizard and here
I can choose which query or which table
I want to have in my report so either I
can choose this so it will select the
whole table or I can choose this query
which I have created or I have saved
right now which is employed at a bonus
query and the fee in
I can choose all the fields from here in
this selected field and I can click Next
and this is the order in which it will
show right we click Next and if I want
to arrange my data on the basis of some
field or column I can choose it for
example on the basis of employee ID or I
want to show my data in ascending order
okay next this shows the layout you can
select the layout in which you want to
show your daughter
by default it's tabular and I will leave
it f default and I will click Next and
here you can choose your designs or
style within which you want to show your
data so I will choose one of the styles
and I will select next and here you can
modify your report title for example I
can say employ bonus the code okay so
this will be the title of your report
and I will say modify the report design
so I want to modify the report design so
I will click this and I will click
finish here so now I have this employee
bonus report here and when I go to this
print preview of this employee bonus
report I can see this how my report will
look like here so you can see here this
date of birth and this pay I cannot see
because the space of for the this is
little bit small so let's adjust this
first so I will go here once again go to
the design view and what I am going to
do
I can add just the width I can choose
this here and I will just make it
smaller a little bit and last name also
little little bit smaller just select
one cell at a time okay
and I want to make this date of birth
little bit bigger
select only one make it a bigger and the
bonus I will also make it bigger and pay
also I will make it bigger okay let's
see how it looks in print preview and
now it looks it looks fine okay so this
is the report suppose I want to
calculate the sum of bonus so total of
bonus and I want to show it in here how
can I do it I go to the design once
again right click and go to design and
what I can do is so I have the report
footer here page footer which is this
one right so what I can do is I can just
shift these things these things a little
bit down like this and what I can do is
I can so just note that I'm taking this
in the footer page footer so what I will
do is I will drag and drop our text box
will just select the text box and just
go to your page and create a rectangle
here
and just leave it as so it will create a
textbook and once again just note that I
am in the page footer okay and for
example I want to get the total of the
bonus right so what I can do is I can
give here the formula in the same way
you can give the formula in your excel
sheets so equal to sum and in the
bracket you can give the name of the
column you want the sum of so I want the
bonus some so I will write bonus um but
in excess you write the column name
inside a square bracket so just give a
square bracket and just write the name
bonus like this okay so let me show you
this expression once again in little bit
bigger font so it's just like this is
equal to some bracket and in the square
bracket your column name okay and then
what I can do is I can change the text
of this text box as
total bones right and then I going to go
to the print preview and now you see
here it's showing error
let's see whatever error so I will go to
the design view so why this error is
coming here is because we have included
this text box in our page footer so I
have already told you just notice where
I am placing my my text boxes so now for
example when you just select your text
box and put this these text boxes in
report put there is a thing called page
footer and there is a thing called
report footer and when you put your text
box in report footer let's see what
happens now you can see the some here
okay so now it will not show you the
error once again in the design view I
can change this title once again so this
title is bonus and let's change the
property of this this text box also so
that it can show this sum as few rows
it's already showing it I think but if
it doesn't show and you want to change
and format your order text box
what you can do is you can just click in
your text box go to format and search
for the format field here and just
change this format type to euro in my
case but you can choose anything okay
so that's why it's showing this in euros
right I can change the font size of this
or I can just change this report color
so that we
can see it also I can change this color
as from here like this and I can change
the report color by going to the
properties no-kill and I can change this
color like this or let's see what color
can choose okay like this and in the
preview now I can see this color here so
the point is you can take the sum of of
your rows and many other things you can
do for example when you go to the layout
view here and select this pay for
example and you select the Spain you can
see here a tab called or a ribbon called
total and in here you can take the
average of the pay count record count
values maximum minimum sec standard
deviation or way variance you can do
many things here for example I want to
show the average of the pay I can just
click this button and now you can see
you are seeing the average of the page
which is 24 so let's just add just this
bonus here and now you can also see the
average of the bone or average of the
pay also so this is also very good a
technique to get anything some averages
and other things right now once again to
the design view you can add other things
like logo to your report or you can
align this in the middle and you can add
charts and other things as you can add
in
the forms of these things so I hope
