how to install OpenSSH server on Ubuntu
and I will also show you how you can
remotely connect to this OpenSSH server
from your Windows operating system so I
have this virtual machine and in this
virtual machine I have open to installed
already and in this open to operating
system here I will just open the
terminal and I will just give the
command to install open SSH server so
it's pretty simple just write this
command on your terminal write sudo apt
- cat install open SSH server and just
press ENTER and it will ask for your
permission just say yes or why and press
Enter and violence installing I will
tell you what is the use of this OpenSSH
server so when you have this OpenSSH
server you can access this operating
system or this PC which is running on
this ubuntu from a remote location
so this SSH server creates a secure
shell which you can access from the
other of other computer which has assets
as client on it so let me show you how
you can do it so this SSH server is
already installed in my open to
operating system what I will do now is I
will check my IP address in here of my
Ubuntu operating system right so for
checking the IP address of my open to
operating system I will give the command
host I will clear
sorry clear the screen and I will give a
app.config so give ifconfig and it will
return you your IP address of your
Ubuntu operating system so you will be
able to see this eth0 and you can see
this IP address here okay so let me
first see if I can pink this IP address
from my Windows command line so because
I have this virtual machine so it is
automatically connected to my Windows so
let me show you just go to start here
and write CMD and press enter and this
opens your command line on Windows and
just right here pink and this IP which
Ubuntu has so write one some okay so I
will ping this Ubuntu operating system
from my windows and press enter and you
see it's giving me the reply so it's
connected to my open to operating system
my Windows operating system is connected
to my open to operating system now what
I will do is there is a very useful SSH
client available on the Internet which
is open source so it's free to download
so I will show you how to download it so
just go to your browser and right here
butI and it will give you some links and
you want to go to this
www.mooji.org
it and you can download this
perdy from here and installing put is
not complicated so just some next button
you need to click and then you can
install putty in your Windows operating
system
so what putty is it is a SSH client or
telnet client so right now what we have
done is we have installed as a SSH
server on our Ubuntu and then we will
install putty on our Windows operating
system which is a client so from client
we will be able to access our server
which is open to write so just install
putting on your Windows operating system
just download it from here just click it
and install it and after you install it
just go to your start and search for
putty here and here it is so just open
it and when you open it for the first
time it looks like this and here what
you want to do is just give this IP
address here so I will give my open two
IP address which is 172 dot 16.8 e dot
128 and this port will remain the same
right and just click open and for the
first time when you connect to this open
to SSH server it will show you this
warning so if you click yes then it will
never show this warning again but when
you click no it will show you this
warning every time when you try to
connect with SSH server so it's better
to click no because for security reasons
so when you configure this on on a
company server or something
like that for professional use then you
need to understand the security settings
so just click Next or no from here I'm
going to click no and now you are
connected to this open to server through
your putti client so just give your
login name for your Ubuntu operating
system here my login name for my Ubuntu
operating system is like this so I will
write ubuntu 1 which is my login name
and I will press enter and I will give
my password for the ubuntu right so I
will write my password and I am
connected to my open to operating system
from my Windows operating system so like
this I can access all the file system
and I can transfer file from my windows
to open to operating system just with
this SSH client so for example you you
will be able to see this this is same
open to one at the rate of 1 2 and here
also you can see the same command so
whatever you can do here on the command
line in Ubuntu operating system you will
be able to perform it all the same
command here also so you can access
remotely you're open to server from your
Windows client right so for example I
give the command list out all the
directories here so you can see all the
directories are all here and you can go
to some directory
so in this way you can use this server
and client object server inclined to
using SSH SSH server and client and I
hope you will be able to create this
network and I hope all the best for your
future project using SSH and just keep
