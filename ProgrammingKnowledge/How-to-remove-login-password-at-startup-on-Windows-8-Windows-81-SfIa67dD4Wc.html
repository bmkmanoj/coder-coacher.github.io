show you how you can disable your login
window when you start your Windows 8 or
Windows 8.1 operating system so let's
see how we can disable login window it's
really easy what you need to do is if
you are on Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 you
just need to go to the left bottom
corner here and if you have Windows 8
you will be able to see this icon but if
you don't have Windows 8 you will be
able to see a little section here you
just need to right-click this and you
will be able to see this run option here
just click this run option and in here
it will open this run search box so what
you need to do is you need to give this
command which is control user control
space user passwords - I will give this
command in the description so that you
can directly copy and paste this command
to open the user window so just give
this command and click OK and it will
open your user account ok there is a
other way of opening this user account
and this time what you are going to do
is once again we will go to this left
bottom corner right click run and this
time we can give this command called net
p/l biz ok so both the command I will
put in the description so that you can
just directly use either one of them ok
so both the command will open the same
screen which is user account and in here
what you need to do you just need to
uncheck this but this check box and this
check box is for user must enter
username and password to use this
computer right so just uncheck this I
uncheck this and I click apply and this
will disable your login screen you just
need to give your password so
I will give my password here once again
the password and click OK
and once you click OK here now once you
restart your computer you will not be
able to see your login window so let's
try so I'm going to restart my computer
restart and will restart my computer
because I'm using VirtualBox so it may
take a little bit more time but ah
restart can be restarted really fast you
can see I'm using VirtualBox to host my
Windows 8 operating system right now
it's restarting
and I'm also going to show you how you
can enable this login screen once again
so now my windows 8.1 operating system
is restarting and let's see if it gives
login window this time or not it gives
the welcome message and bam we are
directly in our Windows operating system
without any login ok now to enable back
your a login window you just need to go
back to this Start button or right
bottom corner or not right but the left
bottom corner and just click it once
again this run option and give the same
command either net plz or control space
user password - ok just copy these
command and paste in here click OK it
will once again open this user account
and you just need to check this and
click apply and now you your login
screen will show after login so once
again I can just restart my computer and
let's see what happens now restart
and this time hopefully we will be able
to see our login message or login screen
now Windows is restarting and now you
will be able to see the login screen
hopefully because we have already
enabled it yes we can see it so when I
click anywhere here I can see this login
window and when I give my password I can
access my computer so in this way you
can disable your login window while
starting your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1
operating system I hope you have enjoyed
