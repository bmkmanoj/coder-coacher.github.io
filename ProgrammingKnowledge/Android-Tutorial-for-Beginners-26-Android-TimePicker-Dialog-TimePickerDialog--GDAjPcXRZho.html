tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use time picker dialog in android
in the last video we have seen how to
use time picker in android and the main
issue you can say with time picker is
that it occupies a large space in
Android activity and time picker dialog
you can use when you want to you utilize
your activity space and this time picker
dialog can pop up when some button is
pressed so you can you know efficiently
utilize the space inside the activity so
let's see how we can use time picker
dialog in android so first of all what I
am going to do is I am going to take a
button and I will change the text of
this button as show time
picker dialog okay
and we just need this button in order to
open the time picker dialog so we will
directly go to the main activity dot
Java file so just go to your Java folder
and open your main activity dot Java and
in here we will write the code for time
picker dialog so first of all let's
create the object for button so button
button s T P D for show time picker
dialog right and we will also create
three variables for minute hour and
dialog ID
okay so let's create those three
variables first will be the dialog ID
which is an integer so let's create it
static
final int dialogue ID and I can
initialize it with zero and now we are
going to declare two variable which will
be holding the hour and minute for us
using time picker right so int hour and
int minute for example and let's add
some other texts two minutes
for example minute X and our X so that
it can be you know identified as user
defined variables okay so once we have
created these three variables what we
can do is we can create a method in
which we can call this button click
event and inside this button click event
we can call our show dialogue method to
show this time picker okay
so let's create a public method public
void show time picker dialog for example
and this is a user-defined method which
we are creating and in here we are going
to cast our button okay so button is
equal to
button find view by ID r dot ID dot
button now once you have casted your
button you can use this button object to
call set on click method ok so set on
click listener on the button object and
inside the set on click method we can
use new on click listener ok and once
you call this new on click listener
inside this on click method you can call
a method called show dialog and this
method you can use to pop up the dialog
ok and the dialog type we can define it
later but what we were going to do is we
will pass this dialogue ID in here in
show dialog ok now what we are going to
do is we are going to call our inbuilt
method like on create method there is a
method called on create dialogue similar
to this on create method which is a
built-in method right so you can even
copied this much amount of code from
here and what we are going to do is
let's create this method above this show
time a bigger dialog ok so let's create
this method here or you can create below
your show time picker dialog method
which we have created so just create a
method which is overriding protected
void on create dialogue ok so create
this method and this will take one
argument which will be ID okay and now
what you can do is let
turn our dialogue using this method so
in here just return our dialogue okay
because we want to show the dialogue so
we will return the dialogue using this
method now what we are going to do is we
will compare the ID which is passed as
an argument to the dialogue idv which we
have declared above right so if this ID
is equal to the dialogue ID which we
have declared which is this one then
what we are going to do is we are going
to return return new time picker
dialogue okay and this takes you can see
this takes 1 2 3 4 4 or 5 argument you
can see it here first is the context
context can be your class in which you
are working so main activity dot this
and the second argument is the time
dialogue so this for example right now
we create a variable which we are going
to define later okay so time pick a
listener for example okay third argument
you can pass our
which we have defined and minute is the
fourth argument minute acts and our X
these two variables we have defined
above right like here right so these are
two variables we will pass as third and
fourth arguments and the last argument
and the fifth argument it takes is what
format of unit dialogue time picker
dialogue you want to show is it our
24-hour format or 12 hour format so and
by default it tasks for the 24 hours
which we don't want so I will set it
false okay so once you have done now by
default if this condition is not filled
fulfilled what we are going to do is we
are going to return by default null if
this condition is not fulfilled okay in
any other condition we are going to
return false
okay now let's create this time picker
listener variable okay so what we are
going to do is we are going to declare
this variable so let's declare it it
will be protected and let's create some
space here and it will be time picker
dialog dot on time set listener and the
name of the variable is this one which
we are going to declare is equal to new
time set listener okay so on time set
list now okay so what we have done we
have declared a protected variable which
is time picker dialogue dot on time set
listener and we have declared the same
variable which we have passed here is
equal to new time picker
dialog dot on time set listener and it
will be created automatically and don't
forget to close this by semicolon and in
here inside this on time set method
first of all what we are going to do is
we are going to set the values of hour
and minute so just copy your our
variable which we have declared above in
here in on time set method is equal to
you can see here it takes two arguments
one is hour of day which represents the
hour of day as ninth name suggest and
second variable we can assign to this
minute underscore X variable which we
have declared is equal to minute here
okay which is the third argument here
okay now once we have assigned these two
variables we can call these you know
variables using for example toast to so
we can show what's the value inside
these two variables toast dot make text
and the context you can take this
context once again comma the the text
you want to show so for example you want
to show first of all our plus and then
colon minute value okay plus minute and
the third variable is the duration so
toast dot length short and then we will
show our dialogue okay now don't forget
to call this show time picker dialogue
method which we have created by ourself
so just copy this show time picker
dialogue method we
we have created and call it inside your
oncreate method
okay so copy and paste it here okay
now everything is done so we are going
to run our program so now our app is
running and you can see this button and
whenever we click this show time picker
dialog button so I am going to click
this button show time picker it's going
to you know show you this time picker
dialog okay and you can set the time
whatever you want so hours and for
example for our 30 minute and I'm going
to change time to p.m. and when I click
OK here you can see the time 16:30 okay
so in this way you can use a time picker
dialog in and in your Android activity I
