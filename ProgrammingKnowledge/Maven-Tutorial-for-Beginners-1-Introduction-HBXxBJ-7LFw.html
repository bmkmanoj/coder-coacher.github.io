maven tutorial for beginners now first
of all what is mavin mavin is a software
management and comprehension tool based
upon the concept of palm or project
object model which can manage project
bills reporting and documentation from a
central piece of information now if you
look at it all Bill systems are
essentially the same that means they
perform the same steps for making or
building a project
these steps are compiling the source
code copying the resources compiling and
running the tests and then packaging
your project and then deploying your
project and then clean up right now
people or developers of Maimon wanted a
standard way to build the project they
wanted a clean definition of what the
project consists of and an easy way to
publish project information and a way to
share jar across several project so that
essentially means that they wanted a
easy way to you know build your project
and share your project with the
colleagues or with the clients or
anybody else right as a result they come
up with a tool which is called maven
which is for building and managing any
java project right now maven is intended
to make the day-to-day work of Java
developer easier and generally help with
the comprehension of any java based
project now as I already said maven uses
the concept of palm now what is palm now
palm is a fundamental unit of work in
maven you can say a palm is an XML file
that contains information about the
project and configuration detailed used
by Maimon to build the
check so it's like a XML file which
contains some information and what can
be this information this information
describes a project in all and this
information contains the name version
artifact type source code limitations or
dependencies of a project it also
retains the plugin information and
profiles now as I already said it uses
XML by default but not in a way aren't
uses XML as you know and is also a built
management system now let's see what are
the important objectives of maven now
the first objective of maven is to make
the build process easy and to provide a
uniform build system providing a quality
project information providing guidelines
of best practices development and
allowing the transparent migration to
new features and all these objectives
and benefits of maven we'll see from the
next video when we will see how we can
create our first maven project and we
will see how bomb works in details right
so stay tuned for the next video please
