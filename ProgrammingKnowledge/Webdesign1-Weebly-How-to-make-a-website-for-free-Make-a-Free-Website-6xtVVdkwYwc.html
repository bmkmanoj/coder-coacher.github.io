I've been showing you how to make your
own project in with the help of Java
NetBeans and from this video I will be
starting a new video series which is
called how to make a website for free so
most of the guys who are watching my
videos want to see my code and want to
know me personally also so I decided to
make a website through which I can show
my code also and I can see your
suggestions and you can get to me you
get to know me personally also so I
decided to make a website for that and
this journey of making a website I will
be sharing with you so that you would be
able to make your own Maps website for
free so generally what happens if you
want to start your website is you need
to buy a domain name for that and
generally you need to pay some dollars
per month or per year for or owning that
domain but there are some options
through which you can own your own
domain name for free and one of which
which I found very good I will share you
with you right now so this I will go to
my browser and I will type Weebly and
the first option come says www.ge.com
it's a free website
in provider so with the help of this you
can make your own website for free and
for that you don't even need to know a
bit of programming also so generally a
professional website it requires that
you need some HTML Javascript of some
programming web programming knowledge
but for this you don't need any
programming knowledge so it's a good
thing and for new comers and from small
businesses it's a very good option so
generally if you are a student you want
to make a personal website for yourself
or for example showing your academic
profile to the companies or if you are
owning a small business you need to
create a website and you don't want to
be for creating a website you just need
it to contact your customers so for
those kind of website it's very great
option and when you are finished with
your website it will look very
professional so it's not very
unprofessional thing so I will show you
right now how to start making your own
website so just click weebly.com here
give your information name email and
password and sign up I will hide this
section from you or I must not find
maybe I will not hide my name from now I
must hide I don't know maybe I will hide
yeah
so this is the option for providing your
title name when you when you provide
your email ID and password this is the
next option you just need to provide the
title of your website which will be
shown first on the website so I want to
name it as having knowledge because it's
my youtube channel name and this will be
whatever we can choose the category and
choose
and just click continue to make our
website and here they have two options
one is paid and one is unpaid this is a
free option which will be extended by
dot B bleed calm and if you want don't
want this dot Weebly option you need to
go and register for the professional
version and for that you need to pay
something so I will obviously go with
the free option programming knowledge
this is my channel name so I will give
it the website name as well the same
also so it's not available so I will
right side for programming knowledge
site so it's available and just click
continue and
this first step of making a free website
you have crossed and in the next video I
will show you how to use these all
templates and tools so keep watching and
in the future I will show you how to
make this website professional so please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
