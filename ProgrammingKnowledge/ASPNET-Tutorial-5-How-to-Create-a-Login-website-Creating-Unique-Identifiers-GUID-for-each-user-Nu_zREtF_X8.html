last video I have shown you how to
connect your registration page with your
database so for example when some new
user registers himself to your website
this data goes into the database and you
can see the data in the table but you
have noticed and I have already have
also told you in the last video that for
the ID field I will show you a technique
or the trick to create a globally unique
ID or in general it's called GU ID or
grid geo ID is a globally unique ID and
it is considered to be unique all around
the world and if you want to learn more
about UID you can just see on Wikipedia
globally unique identifier or good so
it's a unique identifier for each data
so and it looks like this it's 32 bit
long string and it looks like this you
can see it here now in this video I will
show you how to generate this globally
unique ID and save it into the database
so that for each user you have unique ID
assigned for the new user or each unique
user so let's get started how can we do
that so in the last video if you have
remember in the last last video we have
created to the database let's see what
is the data types of the database so go
to the solution Explorer and go to your
table right-click it and open table
definitions so you have here right now
when I when we have created the database
would be having here the dot dot type
integer or orc this character ten but
because this geo ID is 32 characters
long so we can increase the character
form here or we can choose and we're
care fifty from here
okay so just change the data type of
your ID and now what we do is we will
save this data type so just click this
Save button and it will show the message
that if you want to change your database
you need to clear the prevent saving
changes options so I will show you how
to avoid this warning just go to your
tools and click options here and then go
to database tools here and then go to
table and database designers and click
it and in here there is an option called
prevent saving changes that requires
table recreation just uncheck this
checkbox and click OK and now save your
table and now it will take the changes
which you have done so what we have done
is just change the data type of this ID
so that it can take a 32 bit long
characters or string now in the
registration form so we have this
registration form and when we double
click the submit button in here we in
the last video we have written a code to
insert the data into the database here I
will change just a few things here first
is we will generate our
GUI D or grid from your asp.net code so
what you need to do is inside your try
block and at the top of your code just
right
GUI D good and give your good name so
for example I say new good or GUI D is
equal to once again good dot new grid
and break it and break it close so what
it will do is every time you will click
this submit button it will create a new
unique ID and save it a new grid so we
have created a new good and that now we
need to save it into the database so
this is the code for connection and open
connection and we have passed a query to
insert the data into the database I will
make it little bit bigger so you can see
I have written insert into your table
name whatever you is your table name and
then the columns which is username email
password and country so this I have
written here in here just add one more
column which is ID so I will write ID
comma and then rest of the column
username email password in country and
then after bracket close there is a word
called values and then we opened our new
bracket and we are passing the values
here in here also just write at the rate
ID and give comma okay and now we just
need to use this and we just need to
save this new newly generated unique ID
to the database for each user
so after this
SQL command comm code just copy this
code which we have written last time for
inserting the data into the database and
just paste it there at the top and we
will copy this ID from here at the rate
ID and paste it here and instead of any
text box or anything we will pass this
new geo ID here as a second argument and
just write dot to string so it will
convert your new geo ID to string and
then it will save it into the database
now let's try and run the program and
let's see how it generates the new good
and how your new grid looks in the table
so just run your program and I will
create a new user so for example new
user and some email ID and password and
password configuration or confirmation
and country and I will submit the form
and now you see here a unique ID is
automatically generated for the new user
and this unique ID is only for this user
and is this is unique for every new user
you will create so for example one mode
user we can create so the name of the
user is something and the password
and the country and submit it and it has
generated a new globally unique ID for
the new user so every ID is unique in
itself and it will be assigned to only
one user so this in this way you can
generate a new ID for every user and use
it with your database table so I hope
you have enjoyed this video and in the
next video hopefully we will create a
new login form and I will show you how
to validate login page so stay tuned and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
