once again in this video I will show you
how to make a chat application with the
help of your see shop windows form
application so for demonstration I have
made this chat application which two
clients can use so I have two forms one
as a client one and one as client - and
when I want to send text from here I can
send text from here and it appears on
the next client so right here also and
now it appears on the client one so by
using this application to client can
talk to each other in a network if they
are connected to the network then they
can chat each other so let's see how I
made this giant application first of all
I created a new project and which is a
windows form application and I named it
as chat
chat client app for example and then
click ok and here I have a form now in
here I have to take some of the
component for IP addresses I know all
these things so what I will do is first
of all I will take two group boxes and
then I will take text boxes 1 2 3 4 and
the fifth one at the bottom then I take
a list box in which I will show the list
then I will take two buttons one for
starting the connection and other for
sending the message ok
and I take labels to give labels so I
have 4 labels now I will change the text
and the name of these text boxes and by
the meantime I will pause the video
because it will take time and I will
just demonstrate all the things after
that so I renamed all of my labels and
text boxes and buttons also so first
group box I named it as client one and
second group box I named it as Kline -
then I name the labels as IP and port
for client 1 inclined to then for client
1 text box for IP I named it as
this text local IP like this okay and
for the port for client one this is a
port so I name it as text local port in
the same way for the client to IP IP
text box I name it as text friend IP
friend's IP and the port for Kline to
text box name is text friend's port now
the list box which will contain our
message
it's name is list message okay and the
text box in which we will type and send
our message
it's name is text message okay
and I just change the caption of these
buttons one this is for start and this
is for sending the message so now my
form looks like this so just change
these text box names and message box
names according to your convenience now
we will go to the code section of this
form so first of all at the top of your
program you need to import some
namespaces which are these so import
using system dotnet and using system
dotnet dot sockets these two namespaces
you need to import then just go inside
your
method here above this public forum one
and here we will declare some variables
so declare these two three variables one
is a socket variable so right socket SKT
give it a variable name and I'm the
point
so I declared one local endpoint and one
remote end point so EP local and EP the
remote then I will go to the forum
initialization method where my forum
initialize component method is there
right here and in between this method
here just below the initialize component
method I write my initialize component
method which I want to initialize at the
runtime so just below your initialize
component write this SKT which is socket
variable is equal to new socket and
inside the bracket of this socket
function it takes three argument one is
address family so we are going to use
inter network address family comma
socket type so we are going to use
socket type D Graham Datagram so write
this socket type dot d Graham comma
protocol type we are using protocol type
UDP okay so just write this and in the
next line just copy this variable socket
dot set socket options and in the
bracket pass once again three variables
one is socket option label dot socket
comma socket option name reuse address
and third argument will be true so just
add these two
Nine's in your initialize component
wherever your initialized component
method is there just below that okay
now when I run the program it it looks
like this and here I need to enter the
IP addresses so because I'm making this
app on one computer so I need to know
the IP address of my computer or local
IP address right so instead of typing
something like 192 dot something it's
better to know the IP address by some
program so you don't need to go to the
start command and you need to type
something to know your IP address so now
I will make a method which will directly
directly return IP addresses to these
text boxes so you don't need to worry
about the IP addresses which are local
IP addresses so just below your form
public form method here I will make a
method new method so name this method as
this private string so this method will
return string and the name of this
method is get local IP okay which will
return string so string I it will return
IP address local IP address in the form
of string which we can set in the text
boxes right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
