scarlet roll for beginners in this video
we will talk about reduce fold and scan
methods all three methods we can apply
on collections and they comes in
different forms so the reduce fold and
scan can be used as reduced left reduce
right fold left hold right or scan left
and scan right
in general all six method can be used to
apply a binary operator of each element
of a collection and the result of each
step is passed to the next step now
let's talk about reduce method first of
all so reduced method takes an
associative binary operator function as
a parameter so let's take an example and
let's see what is the result when we
apply reduce method on our list so I
have two lists here one is the list of
numbers and other is the list of
alphabets so let's use the list to first
of all to use the reduce method so what
we can write here is the name of the
list and then let's say we want to apply
a reduced left method so we can just
write dot reduce left and what it does
is we can apply as I said a binary
operator as an argument so here I can
just give underscore plus underscore
which is going to add all the elements
of this list so let's run the code and
let's see what's the result is so the
result is a BC which is the
concatenation of a B and C same reduced
left a method we can apply on the list
one also and result will be the sum of
all the numbers in that list so you can
see the sum of all the numbers in this
list is 41 and the concatenation of all
the alphabet is ABC in the second list
so basically what's happening here is
the first two element of the list is
passed here as parameter one and Parham
- and then they will be added and the
result will be passed as the first
argument here and then we take the third
argument which is three here as the
second argument of this list and it will
go on like this so let's do this in a
more explicit way so we can see what's
happening here so we will apply the
reduced left method on the list 1 itself
and instead of writing this we can just
give this function here which takes a
and B or let's say X comma Y as
parameters and what it's going to give
us is first of all it's going to print
something for us so print Ln and let's
say we want to print the values of x and
y so I'm going to just write X then plus
and then in double quotes I will give a
little comma symbol and then plus and
then Y and after that what I want to
return is the sum of x and y so I'm
going to just write x plus y here so
let's run the code and let's see what's
the result is so I'm going to run the
code and you can see now what's
happening here so as I said the first
two element of this list is passed as
the first two element here and then the
sum of 1 and 2 is 3 so it's passed as
the first argument of reduced left and
then the third element is 3 here so 3
and 3 and then the sum is 6 so 6 is
passed as the first argument and the
second argument is 5 here I will go on
until we get our result so as I said
reduced left or reduced right method
takes an associative binary operator
function and then applies that on the
elements of the array so let's apply the
reduce right also on the same list so
I'm going to just write reduce instead
of left and
you just write reduce lie right and then
the operation we want to perform is the
same and the answer will also be the
same because we are just performing the
addition if we want to perform the
subtraction let's say so I'm going to
just first of all apply the subtraction
using the reduced left and then I'm
going to apply the subtraction using the
reduce right you can see it like this
and then what will happen here you can
see the answers are different because we
are applying the reduced left from the
left hand side and the reduce right from
the right hand side so the reduce right
is applied from these two elements from
the right hand side and then the result
will be fed as the first argument and
then it goes to the seven which means
the reduce right method goes from right
to left we can prove this using our
method here explicit method and let's
say we want to just apply the reduce
right method and let's say we just want
to write minus here instead of plus and
I'm going to run the code and now you
can see reduce write is applied like
this so 10 and 13 which are these two
and then whatever is the result of the
subtraction of these two numbers which
means 10 minus 13 is minus 3 is applied
here and then the next argument comes
which is 7 like this and then the
subtraction happens and then argument is
passed here and the next element so this
is how you can apply a reduce left and
reduce right to your list now let's talk
about the whole left and full right
method now basically the for left and
full right method are doing the same as
reduced left and reduced right are doing
but the basic difference between reduced
left and reduce right and four left and
full right is that we can pass our
initial argument in the four left and
fold my awright so let's see how we can
do this so I'm going to just take the
list once again which is my list and
instead of reduce less left I'm going to
just write dot fold left and as you can
see this fold left takes initial
argument so I'm going to pass for
example 0 here and then it takes the
same parameter as the reduce left or
reduce right so I'm going to hover over
this fold left method and you can see
the signature of it so what it takes is
the start value and then the parameter
which is our binary operator so let me
run the code and let's see the what so
result is so you can see the result is
41 which is same as the reduce left but
the only difference is we have passed
the initial value here which is 0 so we
are adding 0 to the sum of the reduce
left let's say now for example I just
write hundred here and then run the code
so let's see what happens here is now my
result becomes 141 because my first
value is the start value so start value
is hundred and then the list elements
are applied as the reduce right only
reduce left element so my first value is
hundred and then comes for example one
here so one will be added to the hundred
and then the sum will be applied to the
second element and so on now this will
become more clear when we use this whole
left function on the second list which
is the list of the characters so I'm
going to just write let's say Z here as
my first value which is small Z and then
I'm going to run the code and you can
see first of all it print Z and then the
rest of the characters in the list which
is ABN
see so basically the difference between
reduce and fold is that in fold we can
pass the extra element as the start
value and then apply whatever operator
binary operation we want to apply on the
rest of the list elements now at last
let's talk about the scan left and scan
right method so same as fold the scan
left and scan right takes the starting
value also and then it will apply all
the binary operation on the rest of the
list elements
so let's write scan left first of all so
scan left and here also scan left but
the basic difference between fold and
scan is scan is going to give you the
map of intermediate result also so let's
run the code and let's see what's the
result here is so you can see it's going
to give you the map of the intermediate
result also so first of all when we
applied the scan left method on the list
of numbers then you can see the first
result is hundred which is the starting
value and then the result become 1 0 1
because 1 is added 200 and then the
result becomes 1 0 3 because 2 is added
to 1 0 1 which becomes 1 0 3 and it will
go further so 3 is added to 1 0 3 which
makes it 1 0 6 and so on similarly in
the case of lists of characters first of
all our initial value is Z so Z is
printed and then the Z a is printed
because the concatenation of Z and a
occurs and then the concatenation of B
occurs with Z a which makes it Z a B and
so on so basically the scan is going to
give you the map of intermediate results
and the last value of the scan left is
the final result
as we have got with the fold or the
reduced method which is that ABC or one
for one so this is how you can use
reduce fold and scan methods in Scala I
