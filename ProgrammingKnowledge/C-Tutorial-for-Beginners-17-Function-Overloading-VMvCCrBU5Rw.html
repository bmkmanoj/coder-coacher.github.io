video I am going to show you what is
function overloading and how we can use
function overloading and what is the
logic of using function overloading so I
will take an example which I have
already used in our earlier programs so
I will make a function to add two
numbers so I'm not going to return
anything and I will take a function and
this will add two numbers so I will give
in first number and int second number
okay
and I want to print the sum of these two
numbers so I will say C out sum of
integers is equal to and then I will add
these two numbers first number plus this
second number okay and then I will just
give end line and that's it so what I
want is I want to add two numbers that's
easy what I will do is I will just call
this function sum and then I will I can
add two numbers like this 235 and 675
for example and it will add these two
numbers and show the result here right
so when I compile this program and run
this program it will work fine as we
have expected okay like this but what
happens when you want to add two decimal
number
so what our decimal numbers of water
full of float numbers decimal numbers
are two sixty five point seven five six
and two sixty five point something like
this so what happens if you want to add
decimal points and you want to add
integers also and different kind of
numbers and when you compile this
program it will be compiled fine but
when you run the program it will only
show you the integer values and not the
decimal value and this result is wrong
because we wanted to add two float
values and should show the result as a
float value so now the concept of
function overloading comes so according
to function overloading you can declare
a same function with the same name two
times or more than two times with
different arguments or different return
type so for example this function is
adding two integer I can just copy this
function and paste it just below it to
add to float so I just change the
declaration here float and float okay
and now when I run the program
I will compile it showing the error
because now the program doesn't know
this function you are using is it
initialized by this integer or is it
initialized by the float value what you
can do is you can declare two float
variables so I will declare load a is
equal to and note B is equal to : and I
will just pass these two values here is
equal to 265 0.75 and
B is equal to 675 0.76 and I will pass a
and B as an argument so now we have
implicitly specified that the this a and
B is a float value so then your program
knows that okay I need I have been a
there are two parameter which are float
inside my which are passed as a
parameter in me so I will go to these
function and see which parameter can
take float and you can see these
parameter can take float so then this
will this program or this function will
be executed right so I will say here
float the sum of float is this Plus this
now for example once again I will
declare two int X is equal to some
integer and Y is equal to some other
integer and once again I will call sum X
comma Y so these two functions this time
the function which takes the integer
will be executed and when you use
integer as a parameter integers as a
parameter and when you use float as a
parameter this second function will be
used okay so now I will build my program
and I will run it and now you can see
both result first is the sum of float
that means we are in this function and
it will show the result and then the sum
of integers that means we are in this
function sum of integers is equal to
whatever the sum of these two integers
here right
so this says how you can use
function overloading you can declare a
function with a same name more than two
times or more than months and you can
pass different kind of parameter inside
this function or you can return
different kind of parameter from this
function and whenever you pass note
inside this it will work as this
function and whenever you pass integers
it will know that you have pass integer
so it will use this function so in this
way you can now declare multiple
function with the same name to use them
differently so I hope you have
understood the concept of function
overloading and how could you have
