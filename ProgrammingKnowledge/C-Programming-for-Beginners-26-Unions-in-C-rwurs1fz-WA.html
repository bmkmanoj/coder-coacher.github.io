tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video we will see what is a
union and how we can use Union NC now in
the last video we have seen how to use
structures in C and Union functionally
work like structure but there are some
key differences between structure and
Union which I'm going to discuss so
first of all let's comment this
structure for now we are going to
declare our Union okay so as structure
unions are also declared with a keyword
Union and then you can give any name to
the Union for example my Union and then
comes these curly braces like these and
then this semicolon okay
and in here comes your variables like
you declare in the structure okay and if
you know whenever we declare a variable
it has some size size or depending upon
the data type so integer has a size of 4
and character has a size of 1 byte okay
so for example if we want to declare
this Union Union let's define the Union
type also you you and I for example and
now we declare a Union here uni and then
we can use you and I to cave values to
our my int variable and my care care
variable for example my int is equal
four and then you and I dot my care is
equal to nine
okay and now let's compile if it works
or not and you and I have the problem
here so let's see what's the problem I
should use something like this not here
but Union my union is equal to uni okay
now compile the program it works fine
okay
so now we are going to print the value
of my care and my int here so we will
just write print and inside the bracket
we will just write percentage I slash
and for the next line and then we just
print the value of my care first okay
you and I dot my care here and compile
and run the program it here should be
semicolon I forgot and run the program
and what's a problem here the problem is
warning implicit declaration of
something the problem is here in print
app it should we print F and when I run
the program it gives me five which is
correct
new uni dot my care we have assigned the
value of nine which is giving the answer
but let's see what happens when we try
to access the value of my int okay here
we will try to access the value of my
int instead of my care it gives us the
same result which is nine which is not
true so what's happening here so
whenever you define a structure like
this it locates its variable or member
variables to some memory space so for
example you have defined
variable minds my int and my care in
your my struck structure then it
allocates four bytes of memory in some
memory space in your computer for my int
and it allocates one byte of memory for
this character in some other memory
space so when we see in the memory map
for example it will look like this one
two three four so these four bytes are
for your my int my int right my int
variable or integer valuable okay and
this one byte is for care okay now
whenever you use Union the memory
mapping is little bit different so
whenever you declare a Union it has the
size of the variable whose size is
maximum so the maximum size of a
variable inside this Union is 4 which is
from integer my int because 4 is greater
than 1 so the size of Union will be 4 in
this case
so Union allocates the size to itself
from a variable whose size is maximum so
the Union size in this case is 4 so
inside our this is struct for example
and for Union the memory Maps will be
something like this 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so it look
its memory this memory to the in
and integer and in a say in the same
memory it can allocate the one byte for
the character okay so they share so
members inside a union share this memory
space or size but inside structure they
are located at different places okay so
that's why whenever you assign four it
will be assigned in these four bytes and
so you have for the first time when you
assign four in the integer it will be
assigned here but as soon as you assign
a nine to this character then it will be
overwritten to these four bytes okay
that's why we are getting the answer 9
here so this is the main difference
between structure and Union structure
allocates different memory location to
its variable but Union allocates the
same memory location and the size of the
Union is the maximum size of a variable
inside it so if my int as the maximum
size the size of the Union will be the
same now to prove this we can just print
the size of these structure and the
Union okay so let's try to print the
structure size and union size okay so
for printing the structure size there is
a function called size of and using this
you can calculate the size of the
structure so our structure name is
record in this case so we will just
calculate the size of record and in this
in
Union case our union name is uni right
so we can get the size of uni and let's
say here the size of the sigh size of
struct and just below it we can say the
size of Union okay
and compile the program and run the
program and says the size of structure
is 8 and the size of Union is 4 ok now
you may be wondering that the size of
structure should be 5 because the size
of integer is 4 for integer variable and
the size of character is one for the
character variable where does this 8
comes from as a size because whenever
structure whenever you provide some
variables to the structure it calculates
the memory or size by adding the size of
this variable plus it gives the padding
plus it adds some padding so that it can
become the multiple of 4 or 8 or
something like this that is why it the
you are seeing it here because 5 is not
the multiple of 8 or 4 ok so structure
provide or C provides some padding to
the structure so that its size become 8
instead of 5 but the size of Union is 4
as I have told you that the site it's
the size of the variable which has the
maximum size so size of Union is 4 in
this case and you may also be wondering
where we can use Union if they overwrite
the stuff every time you
Eck's try to access them the union are
mainly used in embedded programming
wherever you you know try to access some
memory or something like this there it's
mostly used but you need to read about
this where can you possibly you know use
this Union so I hope you have understood
the basic concept of Union and I hope
