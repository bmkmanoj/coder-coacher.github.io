video I'm going to show you what is
method overloading and how we can
overload a method in c-sharp so for
example I have this program here and I
already told you how to create a method
in c-sharp so I have this method which
is adding two integers here but suppose
a tomorrow somebody wants the addition
of two floats or two double values also
how you can use the same function to add
two double values or for instance you
want to add two string because you know
that this plus symbol Khan can
concatenate two strings right so you can
add two strings also and somebody wants
that by the same function name you want
to add two strings so how you can do
that with the same function name you can
use function of method overloading for
this so what is method overloading so I
have this function for adding to integer
so suppose I want to add two double
numbers or double values then I can just
copy this method and I will just go down
and I will paste it here and instead of
adding two numbers now I will use two
doubles so I will write double and here
every place where I have used integer I
will just replace it with double and
this method and this method you can use
to add two integers and two double
values and this will not give you any
error because whenever you use the sum
in the main method your initialization
will decide whether you are using this
sum or this sum method so let's take an
example
suppose I want to add two integers and
two double values and I want to print
them what I can do is I can just write
this kind of code that console read or
write line sum of two ends and in the
placeholder you can call this method
called sum and depending upon the
initialization you can give you see here
you have two options the double its
returning double and it's taking two
double values which is one of two and
the second is it's taking two integer
and a returning integer for example we
are using or we are initializing it with
two integer for example 45 and 64 okay
so this method now automatically detects
by the initialization that you are going
to use this method
similarly for example I want to add two
double values what I can do is forty
five point four five sixty four point
six four for example and these are two
double values so for your initial from
your initialization c-sharp recognizes
that this is the method which is adding
two double values you when you hover
over this you can see here this is
showing double values and returning
double and when you hover over here it's
showing it can take two n Senate table
returned integer and so whenever you run
this program it will work fine
first is adding two integers and second
is adding two double values right so by
using function overloading you can use
the same method name sorry I use I'm
using function and method
interchangeably because these function
and methods are same in some languages
methods are called function and so in
some languages yeah
method or goal method so whenever I say
method its function and when I say
function it's a method so don't confuse
on that so method overloading allows you
to use same same function name but on
the basis of initialization your c-sharp
code will decide that whether you are
using this integer addition or you are
adding two double values okay suppose
you want to add to string you can do it
in a same manner I will just copy this
function paste it here instead of double
I can say string and I will replace this
double by string every at every place
and this function will add two strings
let's see how I will just copy this and
paste it here and I will just give two
strings here for example hello YouTube
so this from this initialization your
code will recognize that this is string
initialization so this will go to this
function and add two strings once again
when you run the program it will run
fine first we'll add two integer second
we'll add two double values and third
will add two string values so in this
way you can use function overloading in
c-sharp to for perform a same logic on
different kind of values with the same
name okay so hope you have understood
the basic concept and I hope you have
