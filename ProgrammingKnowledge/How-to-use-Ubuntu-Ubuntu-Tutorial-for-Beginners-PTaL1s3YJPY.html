give you and brief overview of Ubuntu
operating system so this video is
targeted to the audience which has
recently installed Ubuntu and want to
know how things works in Ubuntu so let's
get started so this is the window you
see when you log in to open - and first
thing you will see here this is called
the bar and here you can find some of
the pre-installed software like
Microsoft or this LibreOffice and Ubuntu
Opera Software Center and this open to
Software Center will be your one
destination to install software in
Ubuntu so let's start with this soft you
open to Software Center just click this
open to Software Center here and it will
open this window and it will give you
the list of software you can download
from open - because when you install
Ubuntu it doesn't come with all the
software installed you need to install
each and every new software we just
thought the party software by yourself
so for example when you want to play
some video you need to install VLC
player so just go to the search here and
just write VLC and you will see here you
can see here a VLC player right now I
have installed this VLC player that's
why I don't see any install button but
if you are new and you you have freshly
installed Ubuntu you will be able to see
here our install button so you just type
in your
the software you need and then you just
need to install it for example I want to
install this genie IDE I just select
this and you can see here there is an
install button here and when you press
this install it will be installed in
your system so for example I install
this genie in my system it will ask for
my password and now it'll start
installing right so once it's installed
it will go or you will be able to find
this software in your dash home here so
let it install and we will see how we
can find this genie IDE in this open -
here so once this is installed you will
be able to see this remove button here
and you need to go to this top icon
called - home just click this and you
can see here whatever software you
already have installed and you can
search for the software you already
installed in your system so we have just
installed Genie and when I write type in
here something and it matches whatever
is installed in your system it will show
the result here and you can see here
Genie is here genie ID is here and when
you want to frequently use these
software you can just drag and drop this
into this bar here okay so in this way
this software Center you can find many
good software's and they are most of
them are free of course because open -
is all also free so most of the software
on Ubuntu you can install it for free
but some of them
cost a little so just see whether they
have any cost like these or they are
free like this you can see here free all
the software's of free which are here
okay now when you start using Ubuntu you
need to deal with the terminal so this
is the terminal so for this first time
when you login to the Ubuntu how you can
find the terminal just go here and just
type terminal and you will be able to
find it and just drag and drop into your
bar task bar here and this terminal will
help you in many things this terminal
will help you to install all the
software to navigate through all the
directory so basically whatever you do
you can do here in Ubuntu Software
Center for installing the software you
can install it with this terminal ok so
just learn how you can use this terminal
to install the things and navigate
through the libraries now as you can
already see you can I mean make it out
that this button you can shutdown
suspend logout or long your screen right
so this is simple stuff there is a
printer here and you can mute and mute
of control volumes volume from here this
is a Wi-Fi battery mail and other things
now if you want to see the properties
like you can see in control panel of
windows you can just go to this button
once again and go to system settings and
when you open the system setting you can
set appearance like this
or you can set the keyboard brightness
language support and other things it
will show you the network settings it
will show you the details of the
software you have so in veneer when you
click this detail you can see right now
I have open two 12.04 LTS 64-bit C so if
you want to see some details of your OS
or audio of your computer you just go to
detail time and date setting user
account so it has many things you you
can see here so just played with these
settings colors displays and mouse
bluetooth and this will be also very
helpful whenever you first open your
open do now instead of Microsoft Office
which is which we use in Windows Ubuntu
has this LibreOffice so this LibreOffice
writer is the alternative of Microsoft
Word you can open it and there's
something called libreoffice CLC calc
which is the alternative of your Excel
Excel software and there is something
called LibreOffice impress which is the
alternative for the PowerPoint in on
windows right and you can install many
other things from the software Center
for example I have installed this
chromium web browser from here from my
Software Center will - Software Center
so
just type in whatever you want you can
see here chromium web browser just click
the install button here and will be
installed it's from Google Chrome so if
you want or if you are used to Google
Chrome you can install it from here
yes search for the software whatever you
want in here now you want to navigate
through folder I already told you you
can navigate to folder using this
terminal but by bees this mouse how can
you navigate through the folders you
have you just need to click this folder
home folder and you have this desktop
document these are the PI default folder
which you will get and there is a root
folder like we have in Windows CE
directory Ubuntu doesn't have this C
directory it has a root folder so to go
to root folder what you need to do is
once again I will go here you what you
need to go to do is go to home and click
this small button on left hand side of
home and when you click this once again
you can see many folders here and these
this is the basics where all the of your
software and all of your Ubuntu
operating system is stored here and
users and many things which is related
to installation of software's are here
so whenever you install some software
probably it will go to the user local
been its binary will go here ok and so
this is the file system you can you have
this so picture folder video folder here
and other folders here and there is
recycle bin here also just go and
navigate through it you can see this
recycle bin so whatever folder or
whatever file you delete
you can just go to this recycle bin and
find it there so this is the little
overview of Ubuntu operating system for
beginners I hope you have enjoyed this
