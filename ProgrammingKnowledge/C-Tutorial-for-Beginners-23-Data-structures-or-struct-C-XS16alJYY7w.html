video I am going to show you how you can
use data structure or simply structures
in C++ so first of all why we need to
use structures in C++ so in the earlier
videos I have shown you you can define a
variable in C++ like this int and the
name of the variable and this semicolon
for care and the name of the variable
and the semicolon so this int and care
are the predefined data type which is
provided by a C++ to us so we haven't
defined these int or this care now
suppose you want to define your own data
type you can use structure to define
your own data types so let me give you
an example now for example you want to
define a structure for a book a book can
contain name book name book author or
book ID and you want to use beaser name
author and ID as a data type or book as
a data type then how you can define a
structure for the book so the basic
syntax of the structure is you just
write struct and the name of the
structure you want to define so in our
case we are defining book or books will
be appropriate and then just give the
semicolon and this colon to complete the
structure now this is the basic
definition of structure and now inside
structure you did you can define the
traits of the book for example book has
some name book can be written by some
author
book out some ID so you can define it
like this care name of array 50 but it
can contain 50 character for example
care of author which also can contain 50
character and for example int to define
the book ID like this so now you have
defined a new data type called book and
now you can use this data type in order
to call these members of your structure
so how you can call this structure from
in your min you just need to once again
use the keyword struct and the name of
your structure we just book and then you
need to give the name of the variable
you want to give to your book data type
so for example I will define book 1 has
a variable name and now for example I
want to assign the value to my folk one
variable which is a kind book of the
data type of book one variable is books
right so I want to assign some values to
my book now I can assign value to my
book like this I write the name of my
variable book 1 and when I use dot which
is called dot separator then you can see
the option I can call any of the 3
members using this dot separator for
example first of all I will call this
name and then I can give equal to and
give the name of the author
so not the name of name of the author
but the name of the book so
name of the book for example we can give
C++ C++ tutorials okay but one thing one
more thing I want to show you that this
type of assignment to the character
array is not very efficient in order to
copy a string inside a character array
efficiently there is other way of
copying this array inside your character
array so what you can do is you can use
the keyword string copy and as a first
argument of this string copy you can
learn give the name of the variable
which is book 1 dot name in which you
want to copy the string and as a second
variable you can give the name give the
string which you want to copy in this
character array variable so this is the
more efficient way of copying the string
into a character array right so avoid
using this type of assignment whenever
you want to assign a string inside a
character array just use the code like
this this is more efficient ok so this
is a good practice in C++ to use string
copy instead of directly assigned by
equal to now and one more thing in order
to use this keyword string copy you need
to use this library so just write
include C string library just include
this library in order to use this
keyword string copy I will just copy
this once again and paste it here and
this time I want to give the name of the
author for example I will give the name
of the author else
programming knowledge okay and then I
want to assign the ID of the author so I
will write book one dot ID equal to one
for example right now for example I want
to access the data which is contained by
a book variable right what I can do is I
will write C out book one name and then
you can just access it by this book one
dot name okay
copy it and paste it here and just give
the regular and line right I'm going to
just copy this two more times and I will
say book one author and here also author
and book one ID and here also I do now
when I compile the program
hopefully it will compile successfully
yes it compiles with zero error M zero
warning now when I run the program
this will show whatever I assigned to my
book dot abide you can see you can
access this content in this book
variable by book dot book one dot name
book 1 dot author and book 1 dot I so in
this way you structures allow you to
define your own data type in our case we
have defined the data type
and this Carter type book has the trade
name author and ID right and then using
this data type we have defined a
variable like we we define it like this
so we have the data type the data type
in our case book and the name in our
case is book one right and then we can
assign values to our variables like this
and like this
and when we want to access the values
inside the variable you can just access
it like this book one dot whatever value
you want to access so you want to access
books one's name then you can write book
one name book one author and book one ID
okay so in this way you can access the
structures content and you can define
more book books like book 2 book 3 and
you can assign values and you can access
the content inside this books so in this
way you can define your own data type
using struct and by the way you can also
use functions inside this structure this
is a little bit high level programming
so for basic it's okay to use just the
default data types I hope you have
