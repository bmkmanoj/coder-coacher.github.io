video I am going to show you how you can
show the number of row count up India in
some label at real time so for example I
have this table here right and I want to
know how many rows of data I have and I
want to show it here in the message
because this data will change you will
you know delete some data you will add
some data and in case of a big data for
example thousands of rows if you need to
know of how many rows or how many the
number of that I have or how many
employees I have in my case then I can
show it here
and I will show you how you can do it ok
so what you need to do first is just go
to a pull back box and search for the
tool called timer and drag and drop into
your form and as soon as you will love
drag and drop this timer into your form
you will see it will not go directly
into your form but it will go here at
the bottom ok so it's fine that it goes
here and its name is timer 1 ok so just
remember the name now the second thing
what you need to do is just select your
form as a whole so you need to select
your form anywhere not any tool but the
form form as a whole ok and double click
it and you will reach to the form load
event of your your project ok so just
see that its form load event and in here
just go down and in here
you need to write timer 1 which is our
timer name dot
stop and what this code will do is as
soon as your form will load or as soon
as you will start running your program
this timer will start okay so this is
the code which will start your timer
okay now once again go to your design
view and in here select your time or
tool from here just select it and double
click it and you will go to the timer
one tick event okay and in here what we
are going to do is we will declare a
variable which is int so we will say
them count as integer okay and in the
next line I will say count is equal to
and then I will take the name of my
employee binding source so my employee
data binding source name is employee
data binding so swipe I will say
employee data binding source dot count
okay and now in the next line what I
will do is I will show this count in the
label so I will go to my design view and
I will take our label for my tool box so
search for the label label there if it
is so I will drag and drop a label here
in my tool box and I will increase the
font size of this label so we can see it
I will go to the label properties here
and I will search for the property
called font click this property
and in here we'll select bold 14 or 16
okay so now we will be able to see
unlabeled better okay and now what you
need to do is once again go to this time
or take event or just select a time of
one and double click it and in here we
will write label one which is the name
of our label okay in case you don't know
how to know the name of the label just
select your neighbor the label and see
in the properties what is the name of
your label by default it will be label
one but now you can see it like this so
you can say label dot text is equal to
count okay so you can just show the
count or number of rows in your label
but just to make it a little bit better
I can add the text to it so I can say
there are and then I mean queue up plus
sign here which will concatenate r dot R
string and discount and once again I
will give a plus sign and I will once
again they give these double quotes and
I will say there are this much amount of
employees for example in my case you can
change this text according to you on da
top right okay now when I run the
program and it's not showing anything
right now
and it shows error let's see what's the
error and it says conversion from string
there are two double is not valid right
this is true because we are trying to
convert our integer value to a string
what you can do is just go to the code
once again and in here we have written
there are and then plus count so this is
an integer and this is a string and this
is not valid that you can con can it you
cannot concatenate string and integer in
the same line so you need to go to this
count variable and just write dot to
string so this will convert your integer
to your up to the string and that now it
will work fine hopefully I'll run the
program and now you can see there are 12
employee right so I can count the number
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 right so it
gives me the right cut off for example I
will add a new data so I will say add
new and I will give a new data for
employee ID 14 some name some surname
and country us a phone number and pay
and I will say save save data that I
save and now it will refresh so you may
have observed that whenever I click this
add new here your count will increase so
I will once again
add new and to account will increase and
for example I will add 15 employ name
and country name here ok once again and
I want to choose this here this date ok
and the phone number and the pay and
save ok so you will see the number of
employed changing here whenever you add
some data or removed some data so for
example I will select this and remove
this your number of employee immediately
updates right so in this way you can
count the number of rows in your order
table add real time I hope you have
