video I will show you how to convert
image formats using your c-sharp windows
form application so I have this basic
project made and for example I have some
image like this in some folder and the
image format is right now
PNG you can see here type PNG I want to
convert this image into a jpg or a BMP
file or gif file or any other format
which see shops supports then how can I
convert it in other formats so let's see
how can we do it with the help of C shop
so first of all I will drag and drop a
button here and I will change its text
as change image format okay and let me
change its font size a little so you can
see it so pond and it's taking time okay
so 1 16 so we have this button and we
want to change the file format from PNG
to add the format by clicking this
button I double click this button and I
reach to the button click event here you
see the windows form application project
already have this system dot drawing
namespace which we are going to use in
our project if not just add this and
here I will right
system dot drawing dot image and I will
give a image name so for example image
itself is equal to new not new but once
again system dot drawing why it's not
coming dot drawing dot image dot from
file yes and bracket and bracket closed
so here we have created our image object
from system drawing images and we need
to provide the path of the images image
from which we are taking our image ok so
I will just make a double quotes and I
really provide a at the rate so I don't
need to change the slashes and then I
will go to the folder where my image is
there I right click it go to the
property
and not here but this property and I
will go to the security and I copy the
path of my files go to the C shop
project and here I paste my project in
from file argument okay and if you give
this you don't need to change this / -
double slash okay now I have my file in
this image object now I will use this
image object so I will copy this image
and paste it here dot save and here I
will save it in some folder once again
so this save takes two argument one is
the path or the name of the image so I
will right at the rate double quote and
here I will provide the path and second
it takes the system image format okay so
first let me provide the path I will
just copy the path of the image where I
have this image so I will create my
image in the same folder okay and here
is the image path and I want to give
this image name as image one dot jpg for
example so I want to convert my image
from PNG format which is this format to
jpg format okay so I have provided path
and then second item comes here it takes
system dot drawing dot image
dot file format so I will write file or
image format I think what so here it's
not image but imaging and then it will
take image format okay
and dot the image format which we want
is this JP eg format so I will write jpg
and in the same way you can provide
different type of file names which you
want to conveyed so I pasted it four
times and the second file format for
example I need is the BMP file if it's
there yeah it's here third file format I
want to convert this PNG file to the gif
file and the four fourth file format I
want to convert this to a TI FF 5 TIFF
one okay and I will just copy the
extension here and BMP file and this is
JP gif file and this is di FF file so
this PNG file should be converted to 4
file format for other file format jpg
BMP gif and TI FF let's see if it
executes the same action or not so I
have this program running I open the
folder also so you will be able to see
if it creates other file while I am
clicking this button or not so see here
I am clicking my button
and you can see other four formats are
created here first is BMP gif and the
jpg and T iff so all four formats are
created here so same same image I have
but in core formats so in this way it's
very simple to convert one image format
to other image format and I think it
will be somewhere helpful in your
projects so I hope you have enjoyed this
