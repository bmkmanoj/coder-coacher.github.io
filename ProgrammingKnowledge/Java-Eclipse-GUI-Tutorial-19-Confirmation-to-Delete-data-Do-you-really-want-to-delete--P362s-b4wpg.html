video I am going to show you how you can
provide a je option pain which asked you
to confirm some action so for example I
want to delete some data I just select
the dis data and when I when I click
this delete data and data is deleted and
there is no no confirmation that user
want to really want to delete the dot or
not suppose user has you know by mistake
click this delete button and then data
will be gone but I want that the user is
I mean sure that he wants to really
delete the data so how can I achieve
this in my Eclipse GUI I will show you
in this video so I will go to my form
and I will select my delete button and
in here I have shown you in the previous
video how to delete data in the database
right now all the code will remain same
but we want to add a J option pane to
confirm some action right that we want
to show some mature message that do re
do re do user really want to delete the
data right so in this action perform
method of delete I will declare for
example int
and I will say this int will be my
action is equal to J
option
Ben
dot
confirm
or God so confirm dot
show confirm dialogue
and in this show confirm dialogue they
it takes two arguments or three
arguments I think two arguments so this
show can - just in this show confirm
dialogue first argument I will write it
as null this is the class which it
expects and so you when you hover over
this show confirm method
it says parent component and then object
message so the message I want to show
here is for example I want to show the
message
to
you
really
want to
delete okay so now I want to show the
user when he is deleting the data I will
show this message do we really want to
delete this data then I can even give
the title to my title to my J option
pane so I can write so this will be the
heading of my J option pane and I also
can decide which kind of J option pane I
want to show so there are different kind
of J option pane you can use in this or
in this
with you I want to use J option
Payne
dot yes No so yes no option I want okay
and what this yes no option do the CS no
option will give the user the two
options first as yes and second is no
and this action will I mean this method
will reply this action guess or know
whenever user clicks it and if this
action is zero this action is if this G
option pain reply is 0 that means user
has clicked yes or otherwise user has
clicked no so in the case of yes
wherever my action is zero because when
this message is shown and user clicks
yes then action will become zero so the
value of action will become 0 so I can
just write F action
is equal to zero then I want to perform
all the code inside my delete button
action perform method otherwise I do not
want to do anything okay
so I just want to show the demonstration
first
it will run the program and for example
I want to delete this employee ID 6 I
click delete and it says me do you
really want to delete right this is the
message we are we have written here and
this is the yes or no confirmation and
if I say no nothing will happen
my daughter will not be deleted right so
once again it asks me do you really want
to delete the data which is this message
and the title is delete which is this
title which we have provided and yes no
option are given by this option
joptionpane yes no right and when I
click yes see what happens yes dot are
deleted and dot or deletes ok I can save
it once again and for example I want to
delete it once again and when I say no
nothing happens right
no nothing happens but when I say yes
that are deleted ok so in this way you
can provide a J option pain which asked
the user to confirm some action and then
takes the stamp
ok I hope you have enjoyed this video
