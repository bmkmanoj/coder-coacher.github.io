video I will show you how to use date
and time with your QT C++ GUI
application so I am going to make a
digital clock which will run as our
simple digital clock runs and I will
show you how you can show current date
and time and how to make a watch which
is running as our digital clock so for
example this digital clock is running
and it's showing the second changes so
I'm going to make a something like this
as a digital clock so let's get started
for example I will take a label from
here and I will make it bigger so that
you can see and I will change the text
of this as digital clock okay and maybe
I will change its text also clock and
let me change the font size so it will
look bigger so bold and let's choose 26
okay so now our label is done then what
we will do is I will go to this add it
just click this Add button and I will go
to the header files in your project and
I will go to the main window dot H so if
you have created new fresh project it
has a main window dot H or whatever
project name dot H and it will have your
project name dot CPP and it will have a
main dot CPP file so I will go to the
project dot at
header file and I will go to this
private slots here
go to private slots and here I will make
a method called void show time rank it
and record close this is the Declaration
of method I'm going to make in the CPP
file so now once this is done I will go
to this may main window dot CPP or your
project dot CPP and I will go at the top
let me make it a little bit bigger so
you can see okay so I will go at the top
and I will include include queue timer
once again queue timer and let me add
one more thing include queue date time
also okay so I have included two header
files one is Q timer and second is you
dead time and now what I will do is
first of all I will make the the show
time method here so whatever I have
created this show time method
declaration I will copy it from here
just copy it like this and I will go to
the main dot CPP file paste it there and
I will just give the main window
declaration and then I will make these
two brackets curly braces okay so this
is
in these bracket we are going to make
our method so anyhow what I will do is I
will declare a variable so i will write
q time time is equal to q time and then
i can choose the type of time i want to
show for example I want to show current
time I will choose this current time and
break it close and then I will declare a
Q string Q string and this will be time
text for example is equal to and then I
will copy this time Q time variable or
object and I will write dot to string
and inside this bracket we can provide
the format of the time we want to show
so for example I want to show the time
time like this so double digit ours
double digit minutes and two digit
seconds so i will write h H and then I
will give a space and the semicolon then
I will write mm per minute and then I
will give a space I will give a
semicolon and then I will write SS for
second so this is for R this is for
minute and this is for second so you can
change your time format according to see
yourself it's not necessary that you
should write here semicolon you can give
- also here or whatever you want to give
you can give star or it's upon you but
this format should be consistent okay
our minute and six seconds now what I
will do is I just want to set text to my
label label so I have this label which I
have declare whose name is digital clock
right have you copy the name and I will
go to the method which is Showtime once
again and I will write UI and then I
will select the digital clock label and
then I will say set text and I will copy
this cue string time text and paste it
here so now my show time method is done
and now what I want to do is I want to
update this method continuously every
second ok so right now for example this
is the constructor of your project so
this is for example you have the project
called main window or whatever
it creates the header and CPP file
called main window and this is the
constructor of your file okay so in this
constructor wherever your UI and arrow
pointer set up UI is there and it just
just below that what you can do is you
can copy the show time method and paste
it here
and give the semicolon and now you can
run the program and it should show the
current time yes it's showing the
current time but there is one problem
it's not our running time we want a
digital clock which is running it's
showing the correct time you can just
verify it from here the same time it's
showing but it's not showing the running
time so we want to show the run running
time so what we can do is I will just
delete this show time method from the
constructor
and what I can do is I can use signal
and slot method here to update my time
which I have shown you in one of those
starting videos so what I what I can do
is I can write Q timer and I can write
timer and let me make it a pointer so I
will write pointer is equal to new cure
time' break it and break it closed and
this bracket i will say this
so this indicate this form and in the
next line I will use the signal and slot
method so I will write here connect and
make it a bracket and break it closed
and I will pass for argument first
there's the signal argument and comma I
will write whatever is my signal so I
will write signal and in the bracket I
will pass the method called timeout okay
and I will leave it like that and the
third is third argument would be this
and the fourth argument would be my show
time method so whenever this timer takes
a my show method is also called so I
will write slot and in the bracket I
will pass my method which is show time
which is this method okay and the last
line what I will write here is I will
start my timer so I will just
be my timer object from here and I say
time start so it will start my timer as
soon as my constructor is called
and my constructor is called whenever I
run my program so just write these three
lines in your constructor and just make
this show time
method let's try and run the program and
let's see if it's giving us the running
time or not and now you can see the time
is running and you can match it's the
same time which is running here okay so
in this way you can show the running
time one more thing you can do is you
can use this time as you want so if you
want to show this current instead of
current time you want to show current
date and time you can show there that
also so I will show you one more
interesting thing here so I go to your
show time method and after your the
Declaration of your time object if you
can give this condition if you give this
condition so right if and in the bracket
pass time dot second so it will see
every second and then give this % and
give two so it will divide your time by
two is equal to zero so every second I
want to tick this colon sign so you see
here a my this is my zero index of this
text so I will just replace this text by
time text because this is a time text
and it should this
should come below this because my
declaration of time is here so what I
can do is I can because if it's this is
an array then the index of this array is
first it this is 0-1 and this space is 2
and this semicolon is 3 so I will write
it as 3 and this space is for first time
is five second M is six space is seven
and the second semicolon is eight so if
you give this condition you can make
your digital clock more interesting just
run your program once again and now you
can see it's working like a real digital
clock with this semicolon comes and goes
every second okay and what else you can
do with with time you can also show
current datums on time so I will take a
label once again here and I will change
it font once again and I will show you
how to show current date and time also
so I will change the label as date time
and we copy this and then what I can do
is I will go add to add it and go to CPP
and once again I will go to the
constructor where I have declared this
timer and what I can do is here also I
can declare Q time
and I will say it date time is equal to
Q time and then I can choose date time
from here so just search for the date
and time I can't find the date and time
this should be Q date time so I will
write Q date time then I can show the
date and time okay and I will copy this
yeah and then I will write now I can
choose the current date and time from
here just choose this current date in
time and once again I will declare a Q
string Q string and I can write date
time text for example is equal to this
date time dot to string okay and now I
can show it in the other label so I can
write UI and then I'll choose my date
time label and then I can say set text
and I can set the current date and time
in the second label and when I will run
my program I have this digital clock and
I have this current date and time
printed here also
there should be a little bit bigger and
it will show the year also so let me
make it bigger and I will make this
longer and I will run it okay let me run
it so it should show the 2013 here
I haven't make it bigger what so I think
you have understood how can how you can
display it date in time so I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
