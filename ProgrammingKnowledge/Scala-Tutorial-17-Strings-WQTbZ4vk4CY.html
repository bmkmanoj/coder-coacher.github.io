Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video we will talk about strings in
Scala so first of all what are strings
strings can be defined as the sequence
of characters and how we can declare
strings in Scala simply as we have done
with integers or doubles or any other
datatype so we will just define a well
or of I our keyword and then we will
just give the name to your string for
example STR 1 is the name and the data
type which is string in our case equals
and the value of that string for example
hello world now strings in Scala are
same as Java strings and hence the value
is of type Java dot Lang dot string
right so Java classes are available in
Scala and Scala makes use of Java string
without creating separate string class
in Scala now similar to Java strings are
immutable in Scala that is the object
which cannot be modified now let's see
some of the method which are related to
strings which we can use to use these
strings in a better way so first method
we are going to use is the length method
so just use your variable name inside
print line and then we will just write
dot and you can see different methods
are available for the strings so you
just need to see these method and
whatever method you want to use you can
use them and the signatures are also
given here and then in the side of this
method you will see from where this
method is coming so it's coming from
Java dot Lang the string you can see so
there is no special scala string class
it comes from this Java dot Lang dot
string right so let's use the first
method which is length which is going to
give us the length of this string and
let's so just print
Ellen and we're going to use the second
method for example for concatenating the
string so I'm going to declare the
second string let's say STR - and this
time this string is HelloWorld
for example max we want to concatenate
okay and then I'm going to give the
space so we have the space between
HelloWorld and Max here okay so I'm
going to just use STR 1 dot and then we
are going to use the concat method you
can see here this is the concat method
which takes the other string as argument
I'm going to use this concat method and
then we are going to just give the
second string variable which is string 2
let's run the code and let's see the
result of the length and the
concatenation so length is 11 for this
hello world and the concatenation result
is this one hello world max okay so in
the same way you can use this dot
operation to see in the intellisense
which method you can use in the string
so now the question is how will you
understand what each method does ok so
let's say I have this concat a method
and I don't know how to use it so what I
will do is I will just press control key
on my computer and then I will hover
over this concat method or the length
method whatever method you want to see
and then click on that method which is
going to you know redirect you to that
method definition okay and here you will
be able to see what this method does so
you can see the definition of this
method concatenates the specified string
to the end of this string right and what
it returns a string that represents the
and a nation of this objects characters
right so if you want to know more about
the method you just need to press ctrl
key and then just hover over the method
and then click on that method and you
will be inside that methods definition
and you will you know read more about
that method so let's move on
so concatenation can be done with this
plus operator also right so you can just
write string 1 plus STR 2 which is also
fine and I'm going to just run this code
and you can see the result is same so
when you hover over this plus operator
for string the signature is this one and
it can be used to concatenate two
strings also now let's talk about the
formatting so string formatting so
string formatting can be done using two
methods in Scala which are print F and
format method so we are going to see
both of them so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to just define a variable for
example num1 which is going to be a
decimal value let's say 75 and then I'm
going to define well number two is going
to be for example a float value so I'm
going to just write 100 0.25 okay and I
want to just format this number and the
other number and the string in some
format so how can I do this so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to just define
a variable here and I'm going to just
say result is equal to and then I'm
going to use printf function and then I
can format this numbers and the string
in a desired format so let's say I want
to just write something like this so
inside bracket
want to just write num1 and then um - so
I'm going to just use this mod symbol
and then D which is for the decimal
value and then after space I'm going to
just give two - and once again I'm going
to use mod F for this float value and
after two dashes I'm going to just print
the string value using mod s okay and
then you just pass these values one by
one as the other argument so the first
is num1 for the decimal then the float
value num2 and then the string which is
STR one for us
okay we're just going to print us the
number and then these two dashes and
then the float value and then these two
dashes and then string one value okay
now this other way of doing this is
let's just print this result first of
all so print line and then I'm going to
just write result here and then let's
see the other method which is println
and here I'm going to do the same thing
using a format method so I'm going to
just just copy this format from here and
then I'm going to just write dot is
going to just show us once again all
those method and in all these methods we
are searching for the format method so
you can see the format method here so
I'm going to use this and then the
argument so arguments are the same which
we have passed in the printf a method
which is num1 num2 and string 1 okay so
you can use this format method to format
string also so I'm going to run the code
and you can see I see these results now
in the result you can see
these two results are different so this
is printing this desired result and then
these two extra brackets and the format
printf print line is showing us the
desired result which is in this format
so because this print line is a function
which returns unit through unit means it
doesn't return anything so when we call
this printf function inside print line
it simply means that we are just calling
that function that's why it's just you
know adding these two brackets here when
we use this printer directly so I'm
going to just copy this is going to
print this formatted string let's see
the result first of all so you can see
the result is there is a desired result
so you can just directly use printf
instead of just assigning it because it
doesn't return anything so that's why
it's just printing the functions so in
this way you can use strings in Scala
whenever you want to use some method
related to string you can just use the
string and then use this dot notation
and see which ever method you want to
use in your string and then you can also
see the definition as I showed you okay
