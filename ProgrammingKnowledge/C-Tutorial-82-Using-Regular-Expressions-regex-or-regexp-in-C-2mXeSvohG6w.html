video I will show you how to use a
regular expression with your C sharp
windows form application so what is a
regular expression when you see on the
Wikipedia page and when you see there a
regular expression or it's also
abbreviated as a rag X or reggae X P is
a sequence of text which is used to
match patterns okay so I will give you
an example then you will be able to
understand fully but it's a pattern
which is used to match with certain
pattern so reg X helped us to match the
patterns right
and Wikipedia page has very good
explanation how to use a reg X and what
is reg X so if you can read this page
you will be able to understand fully
what is a regular expression but now
let's let me give you an example and how
you can use this regular expression with
your C shop application and then maybe
you will be able to understand so right
now I have this application where I
login and I have this page loaded and I
can see the images I can load the table
I can load the charts and I can insert
or save delete or update values right
and I have here some fields like
employee ID first name last name age
gender and date of birth and for example
now I want to add a new field here for
email ID so I want to enter the
mail-id of an employee so how can I do
that
first I will not show you how to save
email id in your database because it
that you already know if you are
following these videos one of the
beginning videos I have shown you how to
save the data but in this video I will
show you how to use rag ex with your
email id expression and validate your
email ID with the help of rag X so for
example I want to enter the email ID of
an employee here so what I will do I
will first close this and I will add a
text box yeah and I will name it as in
the properties I will name it as text
email okay so I have this text box whose
name is text email and let me take a
button this is just for an example after
you understand the concept you can
always go and use this text box
information to save the values so this
is just for example how to use regular
expression oh okay
so first thing you need to take is this
text box and this button just double
click this button and here we will add
the code for the regular expression so
first I will go at the top I need to
import one namespace here so go at the
top and import using system dot
text dot regular expression okay so see
shall provide this library to use
regular expression now once again I will
go to my form let me change this button
text also so it will be clear so I will
name it as validate drag X for example
okay so this is my validate rag X just
double click it once again and in here I
will write my code so what I will write
is declare our rag X variable like this
rag X I will give my variable name as
our X for rag X is equal to new rag X
and bracket and bracket closed and
inside this bracket I will pass the
expression which I want to match so this
is the textbox for the email and I don't
want the user to be able to enter any
anything so for example when I run the
program and this is for email so the
user can enter something bla bla bla and
it will take this text when you save
this text it will take this text
literally as this entered text and it
will not validate whether it's a valid
email ID or not but I want to validate
this email ID so our email ID has some
format like alpha
numeric at the rate alpha numeric
dot-com
so our email ID has this format right it
has the username at the rate of the
email provider comm right so I want the
user should enter email ID in this
format only then it will be saved
otherwise it should not be saved so how
can I do that
with the help of regular expression I
will show you so I will paste the same
format here so email ID takes alpha
numeric value a to z capital or
lowercase and numerical values one to
nine right and here also a to z capital
or lower and numerical values and after
dot it takes three uppercase or
lowercase letter not number but letters
right so now this is my reg ex code and
in here I want to enter that format
which I want to validate which is this
format of email so what I will do here
is I will enter first I will enter this
square brackets and inside this I will
give my limits right I will give the
limit the first letter can be
alphanumerical which can take a to z
uppercase or lowercase or numerical
values so I will give a to Z and without
giving any space just give capital A to
Z and without giving any space
gave 0 to 9 so this is the type of
format which this word can take a to
that lower case a to the upper case and
0 to 9 numerical values then it has to
take a at the rate symbol so I will
write at the rate and then once again it
takes the Alpha numerical values but
before that we can also give the length
what length this can take here we can
also define so here define just I will
cut this it will be here so at the rate
is outside my square bracket right but
before at the rate I can define my
limits so for example I want the limit
for this word to be 1 to 20 letters so
you can enter up to 1 to 20 characters
or numerical values in the first letter
then at the rate and then once again I
it's alpha numerical value so I will
just copy this thing and paste it after
my at the rate then comes the call this
dot sign okay so I will give dot here
and then comes it can be comma or a calm
it can be cold it can be some two letter
word or three letter word right so this
will come as it is small letter or
capital letter but it cannot contain 0
to 9 values right so I will delete it it
can take a to Z capital or a to z
lowercase of the disk dot
then here I can define the length so it
can be it cannot be a such big value
like 1 to 20 it can be two letters or
three letters so two to three letters
the last word can have after this dot
right and when you are when you are
writing a regular expression you start
with this cap symbol and end with this
dollar sign okay so I think you may
understand this and if you are not able
to understand just read a little about
regular expression on the Wikipedia page
it's it has a very good explanation what
this cap is what this dollar is and how
to use these rags right and then you
will be able to understand so I write
this and now I match this with what so I
will give a condition if and close it
with these brackets and I will write
here not equal to and then I will copy
this our X variable from here to here
dot is match and then our value so what
is our value this regular expression we
are matching whatever we will enter in
the email text right so this is the text
I will copy the name of this text which
is text email from here go to the code
once again and inside this is match
bracket I will pass it
dot text so it takes the email ID from
this text box it checks for the format
if it is correct and if it is not
correct it will give you some message
like message show so you can write here
email format is not correct else
you can write once again in the message
box you can give email format is correct
okay so if we enter the wrong email
which is not in this format it will give
us some error like this email format is
not correct so let us try and run the
program so run it user ID password is
correct
now I enter here some wrong email ID for
example I write ABC at the rate gmail
dot and other dot I don't give anything
but it according to my condition it
should take two letters right so it will
give me error so I pray when I press
this validate rag X it gives me email
form it is not correct but when I give
dot-com for example and once again I
press this it saves me email format is
correct let's check here also first
alphanumerical values it takes 1 to 20
so I am NOT giving any anything so once
again it gives me error email form it is
not correct and when I give something
once again the messages email is correct
similarly for this when you delete the
second alphanumerical values it gives me
email form it is not correct and when I
give some correct value it shows me
email is correct
so with the help of reg X function you
have validated the format of this
email-id okay so that is the advantage
of this reg X function so from the next
time whenever you come across some kind
of validation just consider the regular
expression code first because it might
help you in some way or the other so I
hope you have enjoyed this video and now
just the saving of this data or email id
is remaining so just double click it and
you if you are following these videos
you know what this code is and you just
need to add one more field for the email
here right so you can do that I'm sure
if you are following these videos so
that I am NOT going to cover but I think
you understand the concept how to
validate some pattern with the help of
reg X so I hope you have enjoyed this
video please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
