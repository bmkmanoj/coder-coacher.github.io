last two videos I have shown you how to
connect a combo box with the data base
values so I have shown you in the ninth
video I think how to populate this combo
box with the data base values and in the
last video I have shown you how you can
select some values from the combo box
and show the corresponding values for
this
Nahum for example in these text boxes so
you can choose any values and the
corresponding values to that name will
appear in these text boxes now in this
video I am going to show you how to do
it with the list box so how to populate
the list box I will show you first and
then how to select any value in this
list box and show the corresponding
value in this form in this text boxes ok
so let's get started what I am going to
do is I will take a list box tool from
here this is a list box
and basically list box and the combo box
functionality is same but the list box
will give you whole list and you will be
able to see the whole list from the list
box and the combo box its retractable or
you know you can collapse and expand con
combo box it's a bit this is the basic
difference otherwise the functionality
is almost the same so in the video
number nine what I have shown you how to
connect your database value with the
combo box right so if you don't know how
I've done that just watch the video
number nine because I'm going to just
use the same code from the video number
nine okay so I will select my form as a
whole and double click and this was the
code I have written in the video number
nine and this was the code which we have
used to populate the combo box
from the name values okay now in order
to populate the list box it's the same
thing right in your form load event this
code will remain the same the connection
we are opening the connection we are
creating the command we are providing
the connection to the command and we
create the query in which we write
select first name which we want to show
in the list box or the combo box from
your table name and then we pass this
query to the command and then we will
read the value on the basis of this
query and we will read while we have
this data okay so what you need to do
here is just take the name of your list
box okay as you have done with the combo
box and just paste it below your combo
box which I have shown you in the ninth
video right and just write dot sorry dot
items dot add it's the same thing as you
have written in the combo box with you
just need to just change the name combo
box with the list box right now when I
run the program and login and password
you see all the values are listed in
this list box right so the functionality
of the list box in this combo box are
same but the list box shows you all the
values in front of you and this combo
box is expandable and collects
collapsible ok so you do not see all the
values ads when it's collapsed
now in order to in order to show the
values in the textbox right I have a
like I have done with the combo box like
this so for example I choose some values
and the corresponding values will come
in this in these text boxes the same
functionality I can do it with this list
box so for example you will choose some
well leaders values in the list box and
the corresponding value should appear in
the text box it's also really very
simple if you have watched my last video
ok so in the last video what I have done
is I have just double click this combo
box and in that combo box selected index
changed event I have written this code
ok so just watch the last video I
explained all the things in the last
video and just go to the list box double
click it and paste it here ok and this
is this is the same code which will work
for the list box also the only change
you need to do is you need to change the
name in here so the query or query was
like select star or restricts from the
table name where your column name in our
case its first name is equal to earlier
it was combo box but right now it will
be the list box right so just go to the
list box copy the name of the list box
which is list box 1 and paste it here ok
and everything or in the code will
remain the same from this try block to
the end of this catch block right once
again run the program
and when I select some name to see
corresponding values that you come here
okay so in this way you can either use
combo box or the list box to manipulate
your database values now in the next
video I am going to show you how you can
connect your database with a table or
data grid view so stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
