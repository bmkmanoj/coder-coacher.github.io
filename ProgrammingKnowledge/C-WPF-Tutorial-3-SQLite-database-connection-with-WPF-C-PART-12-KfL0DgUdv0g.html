once again in this video I will show you
how to link your WPF c-sharp application
with SQLite database in the previous
video tutorials which I made for windows
form application in c-sharp
I used MySQL database and in this video
series of WPF c-sharp I want to use
SQLite database so you will be having
the idea of both databases so why we are
going to use SQLite we are going to use
SQLite because it's a server less
database of whatever application you are
going to make with the help of SQLite
database it will be a standalone
application so it doesn't need any
server for its it's functioning that's
the biggest advantage of using SQLite
database so you can transfer your
application from one computer to another
without worrying or without worrying for
deployment of the server and all so
that's about SQLite if you want to learn
more about SQLite I have made a video
tutorials some weeks ago which is called
beginners SQLite tutorial and you can go
to my channel programming knowledge and
in the playlist you will find this
beginners SQLite tutorial so you will be
having some idea how this SQLite work
and how the queries are passed now when
you want to deploy SQLite on this WPF
application the visual studio doesn't
have any tool for directly connecting
this WPF with your SQLite
so we need to download some third-party
dll's
which will help us to connect it with
our application so it will be as
open-source dll files and it will be
free for to download so you don't have
to worry about the cost and all so we
are going to download this for free so
go to your search google search and
right there
this finisher SQLite fi ni sa R and then
SQLite and first link here will open
will be a a do dotnet SQLite dot
sourceforge.net you need to open this
website and here is the website which
provide open source DLL files for
connecting dots net application with
SQLite so just go to your download here
in here and just click this first link
latest version and first we are going to
download this first zip file and it
leads us to this SourceForge and it
downloads this step file now I'm going
to open this zip file and in here there
will be three DLL files right one two
and three so what I'm going to do is I
will go to my application WPF
application then I will go here solution
Explorer I will click the solution
right-click it and I will click this
open folder in Windows Explorer so it
will open my project folder where my
projects is there so go inside this
project and then go inside this bin
folder and there will be a debug folder
so in the inside this debug folder your
s your Exe file for your project will be
there when you click this your
application opens like this so just open
this folder and now just open this zip
file and just select all these three
SQLite dll files and drag and drop here
so in your project folder go to bin and
then debug and wherever your Exe file is
there you need to copy and paste these
three dll files there okay now that's
done I will close it now what you need
to do is you right-click your WPF app of
your project name and you will click add
resources so click Add resources and it
will open this dialog box go to browse
here browse and we will search for our
dll file so go to a project and bin and
debug folder we have all these three
dll's what dll we need is this SQLite
dot net dot DLL so select this SQLite
dotnet dot DLL and click OK and when you
see here in the resources folder of your
project the SQLite dotnet DLL is added
here ok now we need to check whether
this SQLite file or Eskil IDL work or
not so what I will do is I will use this
button to check where
my SQLite connection works or not so I
will double click it and what I will do
is I will go to this website once again
which is finish finish a SQLite ad o
dotnet dot SQLite dot SourceForge from
where I have downloaded these SQLite or
dot DLL files for SQLite go here and
click this document and examples and
then go here in the code example below
here and it will open an example so they
have provided an example how to work
with SQLite using C sharp code so just
copy this code we are going to use this
code in our application just to check
and then I will show you how to use it
correctly
so first just copy this using finisher
dot SQLite this first line and go to
your project code section and here where
all the using namespaces are there just
add this finish using finisher dot
SQLite here ok now once this is done now
once again we will go to our forum
section or main window section so I will
just double click it once again and I
have written this message the dot show
code earliest which I am going to come
int and in here I will I will copy the
code which this site has provided which
is this finish not escalate example side
so I will just copy this all code below
this using finish dot SQLite all the
code from here
to the bottom and just go here in your
button click event and I will paste it
here so it will work without any error
if you have provided this using
namespaces now I need to change
something in this code because it's
giving me output in this console and I
want the output in the message box so I
will change a little bit this code so in
your code just go wherever your while
loop is there and that good there is a
while loop where you have this while
loop argument SQLite underscore data
reader dot read and in here they have
provided this code so instead of this
code I will comment this code here and I
will declare a string variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
