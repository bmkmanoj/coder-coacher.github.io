today I will show you how to open any
document for example PDF Word or any
images or anything into your software by
clicking a button or by clicking any
menu items for example in my previous
program I want to open help by clicking
this Help button when I click this Help
button the help in the form of PDF file
opens so this I will show you today how
to open any document by clicking any
button or any J menu item
let's close thing go to your J frame we
will make one more J menu item we will
remittance help help and now we add
a menu item in here called
help
five and in the shortcut you when you
press ctrl H the help should open so
this a shortcut and now we are making
the code for that right-click the help
file I click go to event action action
performed and in the action perform you
have to write first of all make a
try-catch blocks which I am need ID in
order to save some time and the try
catchment you have to write
run-time not get one time dot e x x ec
and the exe is in method you have to
write this so and exe see metal you have
toid you indeed ll 32 space you are l
dot DL L comma file protocol
good
and after that add a plus and in after
this plus you have to give the path of
the file we want to open
for example I want to open frequently
asked question PDF I so go to that
folder and copy the path of that folder
I'll copy the path of the location of
that PDF file and copy and in double
quotes
you have to paste that
this is a good thing now and after that
we also have to copy the name after the
part we have to copy the name also of
this PDF file content
frequently asked question
in which kind of file is this it's a PDF
file so add dot e t DF
but our lime still shows the error it's
because whenever you provide some path
you have to give these double slashes
here everywhere you use single slashes
you have to make them double slash
double - double slash
building snitch
slash
/
so you can see the error has gone we got
here added double slash everywhere so
let's try and run program believe it or
not you just need to write only this in
order to open any file from all but
words so we try to run that
and here is a help when we click a help
tab something should happen
nothing is opening so we have some
mistake so let's check what is the
problem so I think from this here
instead of file protocol header you have
to hide my protocol and love and learn
and after that double quote you have
posed before after five protocol handler
you have to give one space by pressing
this space of tab button
so after five protocol handler you have
to give one space in between and then
let's try to run our program
I will fight and hear your file is
opened its again in trying to open a
file
you can do it from a button also just
take any button called
and go to its action perform and just
paste the same method you've created a
move so once again this is a very
important line you have to write in
try/catch block the run time not get run
time dot e^x easy and in the bracket you
have to write in double quotes are you
and the Ln 32 space you are not dot dl l
comma file protocol handler space and
then plus and then double quotes you
have to give the path of your file and
don't remember to meet the single
slashes double slashes otherwise some
arrow like that will come and do in from
them so that was the small tutorial on
how to open any file by clicking the
button on menu bar I hope you have
enjoyed thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
