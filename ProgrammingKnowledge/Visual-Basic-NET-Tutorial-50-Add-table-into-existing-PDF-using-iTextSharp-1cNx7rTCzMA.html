last three videos I have been showing
you how to create a PDF file using your
visual basic windows form application
and a third-party DLL called high tech
shop and in this video I am going to
continue with this I take shot DLL to
create the tables so in this video I'm
going to show you how to create a table
inside your PDF file and I think you
will be familiar with this code because
I've been writing this code in the last
three videos so I'm not going into
details for this code and if you want
you can just copy this code also and
then in this code just go where I have
declared PDF doc dot open and PDF doc
dot close and inside this PDF dot doc
dot open I am going to write the code to
create a table so this is the code to
create a table I will explain this code
line by line so first of all declare
variable called the table which is
instance of PDF P table class which is
from i-tech shop and inside this bracket
just give the number of columns you want
in your table so this is the number of
columns you want in your table drive and
in the second line I have declared a
variable called cell as a new PDF P cell
and inside this argument I have passed a
phrase so just write new phrase and give
the heading of your PDF file table name
so just this is the table header you are
going to write okay
just write this line to give the header
and now
you will define how much columns
it will contain so this is the problem
and this is the column span okay so this
will decide after three columns or after
three items of cell it is going to
repeat on it is going to add a new row
okay
so just write cell dot-coms call span is
equal to 3 which is like this same as
this right and now in the set of second
line on the next line you are going to
define the alignment of your header
files so just right cell dot horizontal
alignment is equal to 1 and if you write
here 1 your header will appear in the
center of the header cell okay so these
3 lines I have I think you have
understood so first line is to create
the column or PDF table of column 3 and
in the second line you are giving the
header to your table and in the third
line you which whatever cell you have
created you are giving the span to your
table header so because you have three
column table so we are going to spare
spend your table header to the three
cells okay so it will cover all the
three columns and in the fourth line we
are defining the alignment of the header
so we want to show our header in the
middle of yourself that's why I have
written 1 if you write here 0 in place
of this it will be aligned left and if
you write 2 in place of 1 here it will
be the header will be aligned to the
right okay now in the next line just
copy this table variable and just add
your cell which contains the header so
just write table dot add fell and copy
and paste this variable here now we are
going to add rows to our table so
because this is a three column table we
are going to add two rows for example so
just write table dot add cell column 1
Row 1 so the first cell will be column 1
Row 1 second column will be column 2 Row
2 and third cell will contain column 3
row 3 so for now for example I will
delete this code which I have written
below and I will run this code here and
I will say create PDF and when my table
is created it will look like this so
column 1 Row 1 column 2 Row 1 and column
3 Row 1 which has this is Row 1 and this
is column 1 column 2 and column 3 and
you can see here your header is hello
header cell is has a span of 3 columns
so it's stretched from here to here
which covers one column one column two
and column three that's why we have
written column column span is equal to
three what example I write column span
is equal to 2 here so I will break my
code and I will write column span not
here but columns call span is equal to 2
and once again I will run my code here
and create PDF file and I will open my
PDF you see here your column
or header will be span to two columns
right and it's a hotchpotch it's created
because it's thinking that this column
will start from here column cells will
start from here so generally whatever
your column number is you assign the
header size according to that right and
once again I'm going to paste the second
row code just add table once again table
dot add cell column one row two and in
the similar fashion we will write the
column 1 2 3 and Row 2 okay so therefore
the code to add table to your PDF file
at last what you need to do is just add
this table to your document so just
write PDF doc dot add table and this
will add your table to your document
right so this is the whole code to add
table to your PDF file and finally when
I run the program and I will say create
PDF once again it will show the error
because my PDF is already open once
again I will create the PDF and once
again if you see I have a header and I
have two rows in a similar way you can
add multiple rows to your PDF files so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
