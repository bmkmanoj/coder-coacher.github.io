bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can use and add
glyphicon to our bootstrap web page now
cliff accounts are also a set of icons
which is provided by bootstrap which we
can add to our web page for example I
want to add some button and instead of
this text I want to add some icon on it
I can use glyphicon for that we have
already learned how to add font awesome
icons to our website like this for
facebook twitter or google+ and in this
video we will see how to add glyph
equals to our buttons or any other
components so for getting glyphicon you
just need to search for bootstrap
glyphicon x' and the first link will be
for that which is bootstrap comm slash
components click this link and in here
you can find over 250 icons from
bootstrap and you can add these icons to
your buttons or other components so for
example I want to add this icon to my
button click me and thank you and I will
go to my HTML file and in here I was
using this click me and thank you button
ok so to add a glyphicon you need to add
a span just before this text click me so
just add a span here and in here you
need to add this class is equal to the
name of the glyphicon okay so you need
to go to this page and choose your
favorite icon for example I want to
choose this glyphicon user item so just
copy this class name and paste it in
here
last name in your span okay and you can
save it and you can refresh your webpage
and now you can see this icon added to
your button for better visualization you
can add some space here so it will be
spaced evenly like this and we can add
in the same way for our second button we
just thank you some other glyphicon okay
so we can go to here and for example I
want to add this okay clip it on or for
example you can choose some other
glyphicon whatever you like I'm adding
this for now and I will go to my page
and instead of this I will replace this
by okay okay and save it and refresh
your page and this is added to our
button now changing the size of this
glyphicon is exactly the same as
changing the font or style of any other
component for example you want to make
it a little bit bigger you can add style
here so just add style and for example I
want to change the font size you can
just change the font size as you can
change it with any other text okay so
font size is equal to 30 px for example
I will save it and refresh it and the
size of this icon is changed okay
in same way I can change the size of
this other button and for example I want
to change the name to blank for example
I have no name I just want to show the
icon I can just remove the name from
there and it will look like this which
looks really nice right now in order to
change the color you
just need to add one more attribute
color is equal to for example the red
and save it and refresh it and the color
of this icon becomes red ok or you want
blue or any other color you can add it
in a same way okay
so save it and refresh your web page and
it will become blue so in this way you
can add glyphic ones to your bootstrap
components I hope you have enjoyed this
