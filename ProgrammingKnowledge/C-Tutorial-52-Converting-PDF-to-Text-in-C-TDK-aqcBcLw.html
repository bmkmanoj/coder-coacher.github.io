last video I have shown you how to read
your PDF file and convert it into the
string and show it into the text box on
rich text box so I will show you what I
have done in the last video I click this
read PDF button and I can choose any PDF
file from it so I choose this file for
example and it reads all the PDF file
and it pass the content of PDF file and
show it into my rich text box in this
video I will show you how to convert
your PDF file into the text file using
your ITEX shop DLL so for this I would
need the code for which I have used in
the last video so if you don't know how
I have written the code for reading the
PDF then go to the last video and just
see how I have written the code for
reading in the PDF and I will just
include some more lines in that code and
I will use most of the code which I have
written in the last video so in the last
video if you remember I have created
this text box and this read PDF button
and when I click this button I have
written this code in the last video okay
so
in that video I was able to convert my
PDF file into the string and now I want
to convert that string into the text
file so indirectly I am converting my
PDF file to the txt file right so first
of all we will write the code for
writing that string into the PDF into
the text file so go at the top for that
we need this using namespace so write
using system dot IO if you have already
have this namespace then just leave it
like that or otherwise just add this to
your code okay once again I will go to
the code I will just double click this
read PDF button and all the contain
content will remain the same from this
open file dialog to the end of the cache
block and do that and of the if code
what I will do is after this if
condition ends here outside this if
condition I will write the code for
converting my string into the text file
so write stream writer and give it a
name pi is equal to new stream
screen writer so here not screen reader
but stream writer this one file is equal
to new streamwriter break it and break
it closed and in the bracket you can
give the path of your PDF file and the
name of a PDF file so you can give like
see something like this double quotes
and then see and then
the f to text dot txt because it's a
text file so you can give the path like
this and this is the name of the text
file which we are generating but because
I am generating my text file in my
binary folder what is a binary folder
just go to your project and right click
it and click open folder in Windows
Explorer and it will open your project
folder go to bin and go to debug if you
are running a programming debug mode if
you are running in release then go to
release mode and in here my text file is
generated will be generated that's why
I'm not providing any path I'm just
giving the name of the file ok and in
the next line write or copy this file
variable listed here dot write and in
the bracket bracket closed in here we
will pass our string so if you remember
in the last video we have written the
code to show our past PDF text in the
rich text box which is this rich text
box so what I will do is I will just
copy the name of this rich text box copy
and paste it here dot
texts okay so what this will do is file
dot right in this code contains the or
this code writes the string or whatever
you pass in this bracket inside the
sorry inside your text file so whatever
you write in this bracket will go into
your text file and what we are passing
here is whatever text which is there in
the rich text box which we have passed
from the PDF file we are transferring
all the text and writing it into the
text file so it's indirectly converting
your PDF into the text file and then
after just right PI dot close bracket of
writing so just write these three lines
and this is of course the rich text box
dot text which contains your past PDF
text and now I will run the code once
again username and password and first of
all I will open that debug folder so you
will be able to see also that the text
file is generated or not so I will click
this read PDF and see here also I will
just select this text or PDF file and
open it
and you see here it has generated my
peep PDF to text text file so whatever
is here in the PDF or whatever we read
from the PDF and we are showing in the
rich text box it's converted into a text
file so just open it and it will be
having the same contain content as your
text box so vocabulary list vocabulary
list general and topic areas general and
topic areas one two five two so same
text so in this way you can convert your
PDF file into a text file I hope you
have learned something new this time
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
