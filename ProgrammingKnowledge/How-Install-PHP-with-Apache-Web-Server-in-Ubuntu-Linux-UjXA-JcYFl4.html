seen how to install Apache web server
which with your Ubuntu Linux operating
system and now the Apache web server is
configured and running let's install PHP
a scripting language so that we can
script our server so PHP is basically a
server-side scripting language which we
can use to script our server so let's
get started how to install PHP with your
Apache web server so first of all give
this command which is sudo apt - get
update to update all the repositories
and give you a password once the updates
are complete now I will clear my
terminal and I will give this command to
install Apache or PHP with my Apache web
server so just write sudo apt - get
install and then PHP 5 and then - Lib
Apache - - mod - PHP file so give this
command in order to install PHP plus the
libraries of PHP with Apache and press
ENTER it will ask for your permission
say yes and press Enter
once PHP and Apache library for PHP is
installed in your open to once again I
will clear my terminal and I will
restart my Apache server so i will write
sudo et Cie in it
dot d / apache to restart and press
enter and you see here it has shown us
the message restarting webserver apache
- so now our webserver is restarted and
configured PHP let's make a PHP file and
just see how can we run this PHP file
using Apache right so let me show you
first where do we need to create this
PHP file Oh
so when I open my folder I need to
create my PHP file in the VAR slash www
folder so let me show you in the folder
structure and then we will create this
PHP file so in our root folder we have
this VAR Holdem and involve we have www
folder and in here we have index dot
HTML file which we have modified in
order to see the apache web server web
page in this VAR slash www we will
create a new PHP file so I will write
here in my terminal pseudo touch
and then the root for the folder which
is slash var slash you slash and then
the name of your new PHP file so for
example I want to give the name to my
PHP file is test dot PHP so and press
Enter
now when we see here AB new PHP file is
created right and now we need to modify
this PHP file ok so let's try to modify
this PHP fine
so we will write sudo gedit and then
this file path so VAR slash www test dot
PHP its dot so test dot PHP and press
Enter so now our PHP test dot PHP file
is opened here we will write a simple
PHP scripting so I will just write here
this angle brackets for PHP and then I
will write PHP info this function gives
all the information which your server
has using PHP so I will just save my
file here just write this and I saved my
file I don't need to restart my server I
think so I will just go directly to my
web browser and here I will write
localhost /
test dot PHP and press enter and here
you can see all the information which is
coming from PHP info function right so
it has all the information IP support or
whatever information is required by the
server and in the real life you don't
want to show this information to the
other users but what checking what is
the configuration of this server then
you can see and use PHP info so in this
way you can install and run PHP files
with your Apache web server I hope you
