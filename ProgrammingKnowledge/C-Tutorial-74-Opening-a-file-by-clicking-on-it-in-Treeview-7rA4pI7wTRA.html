last video I have shown you how to add a
folder structure or directory structure
which is present in your computer in
your tree view so when I click this
button it gives me the folder which I
want to show so I have in my computer
this HTML dot CSS folder so this folder
I wanted to show in my tree view so I
have created this program to show the
directory structure of my folder in my
tree view ok in this video I will show
you how to open selected files for
example you want to open this avi file
or you want to open PNG file or any
other file whatever file which is
present in your folder you will be able
to open by this code which I am going to
show you so let's get started first I
will take a button and drag and drop
here and I will change its text from
here so I will name it as open selected
file ok so this I have done and I will
double click this and in here I will
write my code so if you are following
this video in the last video I have
shown you this code in which I am
showing the directory structure and I
made this function called last list
directory and I am passing my tree view
name and the path of the file which I
want to show ok of the path of the
folder which I am wanted to show so
this path what I will do is I will make
a global variable so you can make it at
the top of your program wherever you
want to make I am just making this at
the top of my function so it will be
visible so just above this button action
perform where you call this function
list directory this is I have shown you
in the last video so just above that or
declare a string variable called path
and is equal to just copy the path which
you were passing inside this directory
structure okay and paste it here and
close and just copy this path variable
and paste it here why I have done this
because I wanted to make this path
variable global so I can use this path
variable inside this selected open
selected file button action perform also
so here also I should be able to access
the selected path that's why I have used
this global variable so this path will
be global and it is seen by all the
functions so do that and then I will
delete this part but I will use it and
in here what I will do is I will declare
a string variable so i will write string
tree
node name so the variable name is tree
node name is equal to my tree view name
so my trivia name is tree view one dot
selected node dot two string and close
this bracket and close this so I have
declared a string variable which will
take the selected node name okay so I
have done this now I will declare one
more variable or in this variable also I
can do that so just after this to string
you can write dot replace and in here I
will replace something so first of all
before replacing this I wanted to show
what I want to replace so I wanted to
show get the treeview name so for
example I will write a message box to
show it dot show and in here I will pass
my this tree Union which I declared okay
and when I run the program and when I
show this directory structure I select a
file and I click this open selected file
it gives me tree node : the name of my
file but I just want this file name only
the box model CSS dot avi I don't want
this tree node : in my code so that's
why I want to replace it with original
name instead of this tree node so what I
will do here is I will delete this first
this is was just for showing you
and I will right here replace and in the
bracket I will pass that tree view so
right
tree tree node like this and then the
semicolon also : also I wanted to
replace and then on the space also so
three node : and one space and what I
want to replace it with I want to
replace it with empty string so right
string dot empty okay so I have written
this code I have declared a string
variable and then I is equal to tree
view name dot selected node dot two
string dot replace and I am replacing
than node 3 node : and space with empty
now what I will do is I will write
system dot Diagnostics dot process dot
start and inside this what I will do is
I will pass my path variable which I
have declared here which takes the path
of my folder so copy this path variable
and paste it here and then write plus
and then give these two double quotes
and write this slash sign okay
and after this slash sign I will pass
the name of my file so it will take the
folder name and after that it will give
a slash and then it will
gave the name of my file which I
selected okay
so let's show it in the message box also
message box not show racket and racket
closed and I will just copy this all to
show the path of the file I selected and
so I have written these three lines of
code to open my file so let's run the
program and first of all I will show the
folder which I wanted to show this is
the show folder now what I will do is I
will take this file for example I want
to show open this HTML parte 2.avi I
will select it and I will click open so
first of all it shows me in the path it
is the same path which I wanted to open
and I will click OK and it opens the
file ok now for example I want to open
some other file for example this PNG
file I select it and click open it shows
me the message in the path and it opens
the file ok in this way you can open the
selected file in your selected folder in
the tree view I hope you have enjoyed
