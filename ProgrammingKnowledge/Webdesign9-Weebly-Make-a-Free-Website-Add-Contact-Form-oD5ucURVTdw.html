last videos I have shown you how to add
a playlist of my videos and let's see
how my website looks like till now this
is the home page which will show a
little bit about this website and this
will show the first project in NetBeans
Java and this is the video which is
taken from YouTube and when I click to
the videos and tutorial page it opens
this page and here is a button which
shows NetBeans Java playlist which has
122 videos and when I click it my Java
playlist opens I haven't added all my
list I added up to 11 and I will add all
my playlist in future I have I think 122
videos on that beans Java till now I
will also make more videos in the future
so this number will increase in future
and when you click these links it opens
the youtube links in YouTube channel so
according to the name the specific link
will open now I want to add a new page
to my website which will be called
contact us page
to which you will be able to contact me
and ask me your questions so what I will
do is I will go to page add new page and
I will name it as contact us and I want
to show it on my navigation menu so I
won't hide it and I will save settings
so you can see contact us page here I
will click this contact us and I will
change the image of my default website
like this and now I want to add a
contact form so in this toolbar you can
see this contact form this is a very
useful tool for contacts so just drag it
and drop it or drop it here so like this
and this will give you a contact form
automatically so you don't need to make
a contact form and my contact page is
ready it's so simple so I will publish
it and I will show you how this contact
form works I will publish it publish
we open the web page now and I will
click contact us and here I will write
my name it's my red whatever and my last
name my email address at the rate the
rate gmail.com whatever ideal host name
last name email ID and your comments and
just some it
and it will show thank you your import
information having been submitted and if
you are admin where you can see this
question it will not come to your mail
it will come in your Weebly website
itself so in this contact form click
this contact and you see here
here you can see new entries and when
you take this view entries you can see
here the list of all the means you
received or all the context and all all
the comments you received here it will
even show you the IP address from which
this mail or comment came so this is
very useful tool for contacting your
viewers so I have added this this also
provides some form options that if you
want to provide your email ID and it
will also you can also provide your
email ID also and Save Changes
so in this way you can add a contact
form to your website I think that's it
