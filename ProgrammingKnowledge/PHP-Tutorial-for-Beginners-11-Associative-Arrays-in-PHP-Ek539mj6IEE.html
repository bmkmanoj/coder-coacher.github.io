last video I have shown you how to
declare and use array in your PHP code
now in this video I'm going to talk
about associative array and this is a
kind of array which makes your array
declaration and usage more flexible so
right now for example in the last video
I have shown you how to declare an array
and how to provide this elements to the
array and each element according to
their position has the key so this will
this name mark has the key of 0 John has
one and Bob has the key of a 2 right so
key starts from 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 right it's a
really rigid value 0 1 2 but if you want
to make this array more flexible and
more useable you can use associative
array and on the by using those
associative array you can change these
key according to yourself and values
also according to your self right now
these values are rigid 0 for mark 1 for
John - for Bob but for example you want
some flexible key according to which you
which you can use right so how you can
define this so for example I want to
show the weight of each person here I
can use
now these names as a key and the value
as my weight so how can I assign this
key now I want to make mark as a key or
name as a key and weight as a value ok
so how can I make it you just need to
include this equal to sign and then this
greater than sign and you can add the
weight of each person so in a similar
way you can assign the value to this
John key some other weight
and to this Bob key some other weight
okay and so now this name or this name
mark is no longer a value it has become
the T and this weight is now your value
okay so now in the earlier whenever we
were using arrays the index earlier was
decided by PHP for us so the name was
the value and this was decided by PHP
right now when i refresh this you see
this key is it now new key is the name
and the value is your weight whatever
weight you're each person has right so
this gives you the flexibility to you
know decide your own key and assign a
value to it okay now for example you
want to print the specific value I want
to print the weight of mark for example
I can just write echo and then I can say
weight weight of mark is and you can use
this concatenation operator like this
and then just use this variable array
name and with a within the square
bracket just provide the key now key is
Mark right just copy this key paste it
inside these brackets and you can give
this semicolon here so now when you just
run this you will be able to see weight
of Marcus 56 and I can also give a
little
break here break tag so that second line
will be printed on the second line and
now when i refresh it you see the weight
of mark is 56 so you can print all the
array values on the basis of key and now
your key has become this name and the
value is this so this is called
associative array and this makes your
usage of array more flexible so I hope
