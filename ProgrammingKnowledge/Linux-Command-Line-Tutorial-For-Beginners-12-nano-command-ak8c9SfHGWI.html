Linux command line tutorial for
beginners in this video we will see how
we can use Nano command in Linux now
Nano is a small and friendly text editor
and beside the text editing Nano offers
many extra features like an interactive
search or replace and it also has some
other features like go-to line or column
number it can show or it can you know
give you the indentation in the file or
some other features so let's see how we
can use it so first of all I'm going to
just change my directory to desktop and
in here for example I want to create a
new file
first of all Nano can be used for
creating a new file also so just write
Nano and then you just need to write the
name of your file for example file dot
txt I want to create this file right and
I will press ENTER and then this is
going to open this file and create this
file in the terminal right now you may
observe here that the file is open but
it's not you know shown here okay so
this file is not shown because we
haven't saved the file so Nano has
created a file for us but we need to
save it in order to you know see it here
on the desktop because we are in the
desktop right now right so for example
we write something here for example ABC
and for example b c d and e FG for
example some random text okay now in
order to save this text inside this file
dot txt what you need to do is you need
to press ctrl o ok you can see this
command is given here which means write
out ok so when you press ctrl o it means
write out that
means writing out to the file so just
press ctrl oh and this ctrl o will give
you this kind of information which says
file name to write and the name of the
file so our file name is file dot txt
which is okay so you just need to press
ENTER and it's going to save the content
of the file and as soon as I press ENTER
you can see file dot txt is created here
and when I open it is going to show the
content of the file which we have
inserted using nano right now Nano has
some other controls for example control
G will get the help or control X when
you press the control X is going to exit
from the Nano command so let's press
control X first so I'm going to press
control xed and we are out of the Nano
c'mon once again once the file is
created then we can added the content of
the file by the same common Nano and the
file name and you can see we have
written this content to our file and now
for example I want to add it so I will
go to this line for example and you can
see there is a command called control K
for cut right normally and the normal
editors we have control C for control X
for cutting and control you know V for
pasting right but in here we have
control key for cutting a line for
example so I will just press control K
it's going to cut this line and for
example I want to go down and paste it
here I can press control you you can see
this command which is control you which
stands for uncut so whatever you have
cut I will press control you you can
paste it like this okay and then press
control o to save the content which is
going to ask you if you want to save it
when you press ENTER the file content
will be
and you can see the effects here and you
can see like this
okay so nano can be used to create you
know a different kind of files and for
example I will just exit from this menu
command and for example I want to create
a C++ file so I will just press nano and
I will just say a b c dot cpp for c++
file right
cpp is the extension of c++ file and
when i press enter and in here for
example i want to write some code so i
will just write the IAO stream for
example and we need to include it right
so hash include iostream and you can see
here it's giving us the color so nano
has already recognized that it's a CPP
file so it's going to show you the code
highlighting for your CPP code right so
here I can just write int mean and then
I can just give these curly brackets and
for example I want to print something so
I can just say hello world by STD C out
hello world in the double quotes right
and you can see it's doing the
highlighting for us so Nano is good for
you know editing some you know files
which contains some code so it can
recognize if the file is a CPP file or C
file or Java file or different kind of
files okay and it will do the
highlighting or code highlighting for
you also and it can recognize these code
files also that's why also Nano is
you know beneficial to use whenever you
want to add it some kind of code right
so this is how you can use Nano c'mon I
