I've shown you how to save the date from
DT date chooser into your database and
now I'm going to tell you the new
information about just get chooser so in
the 9th tutorial I have shown you
whenever you click your J table how to
get data into the text field like this
what are changes so but here we don't
have me then fused JDate chooser
so using jaded chooser it's a little bit
different programming so this is I have
shown you in the ninth - torie and today
I will show you how to do this by
clicking table using jaded chooser also
so I've already made a program for this
but because my dear jaded truth is here
and this is not a text field I get some
error so
how to rectify this error so go to your
table right click event
mouse mouse click so this is the code I
already made but here it shows some
error this code I made on the basis of
tutorial of number nine or video number
nine so if you don't know how to do how
to write this code you can see with your
number nine and only forge a date
chooser this error is coming so what you
should do is instead of here
you need to declare this because jaded
chooser we are inserting date so this
variable name should be date
and because variable name is dead so we
have to be RS we have to do RS dot I was
not get did you say don't get text and
here also because we are setting dates
instead of side text we must write
we must try it
set date so these two changes you have
to do in order to set your date when you
click your J table once again I will
repeat what I did I change this variable
name from string to date and after
declaration I write is equal to RS dot
get date instead of get strength and we
know I copied the name of my jaded
choose a dot set depth instead of set
text these two things you have to do and
now and run your program your date will
be represented here when you click the
table
so this was the tutorial on how to send
the date using JDate user and when you
click your entry table row it will be
shown here so I hope you have learned
something new and please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
