two videos I have shown you how to save
your data and how to add it here data in
the database using your QT C++ GUI
application so there is one more thing
that I want to show you in this video
that is how to delete your data from the
database using a push-button and using
your QT Greece C++ application so let's
see how we can delete data in the
database using your QT so for that I'm
going to take a push button and I will
rename this push button as push button
push button delete and I will change the
text of this button also as delete okay
and to make it more visible I can change
the font size also okay so now it's more
visible so once you are done with that
just right click it go to slots and
click OK and we reach to this push
button delete button click event okay
and if you have seen my last two videos
I am just using the code which I have
written in the last video that is the
code for editing or updating your data
so I will just right click and go to
slot and click OK and this is the code I
have written in the last video so if you
haven't seen my last video just go and
watch it and just copy the whole code
within the function within this push
button and added clicked function
and just copy and paste it in this new
function on push button delete click
function okay so I have just copied and
pasted all the code here and here I just
need to change this query so what I will
do is I will delete all the query here
because this was for the update or added
the data and I want to change the
message also because when I delete that
I just want to show the message that
data has been deleted so I give the
title to my message box delete and here
I can show the message deleted
okay and now we come to the query so we
have this database as you are seeing in
the last videos that I'm using the same
database and if this database contain
one table whose name is employee info
and it has several columns so for
deleting the data I will write the query
here delete from my table name my table
name is employee info right this table
name so delete data from the table name
and we need to give the condition that
which data we've need to delete so for
example I want to delete the data where
my employee ID is whatever employee ID
can be one two or 11 or I can delete the
data on the basis of name or I can
delete the data on the basis of age so
you can choose any one column on the
basis of which you can
delete the data so for simple
demonstration I am going to choose this
employee ID as the basis to delete my
data so what I will do is delete from
employee info which is my table name and
I will give the condition where my EE ID
which is my column name of employee ID
this column so write a ID is equal to
single quote then double quotation then
plus plus and inside the these plus plus
sign or between these plus plus sign we
will pass the value we are entering in
our employee ID line added or text box
so I will just copy this string in which
I am transferring my employee ID which I
enter or which user can enter and paste
it here and this is my query for
deleting the data this you can change it
with name if you want to delete the data
on the basis of name then right here
name and just pass this name string here
or is right here age and pass age string
here and these three string I don't want
to use so I can just comment them so it
will make more clear that I am just
using this string which is employee ID
so let's see how it works so I will just
build my project and run it in the
meantime I will just open my database so
that we can verify that our data is
actually deleted
so my program is still building and now
it's running and I will give the
username and far password first and it
opens the second window I opened my
database I have 11 entries in this
database so for example I want to delete
this 11th entry in the database right so
I will write here 11 in the employee ID
because I want to delete the data on the
basis of employee ID the rest of the
information if you don't give then also
it will delete the data so I just enter
the employee ID and I press Delete and I
can see the message deleted
so my data is deleted now what I need to
be do now is just to refresh this
database so I will just click show all
and you can see my database is like this
and here there is no employee ID with
employee ID 11 right so my data is
deleted once more for example I want to
delete this employee ID 10 I will just
write here employee ID 10 and click
delete my data is deleted i refresh my
table and you can see there is no
employee with the employee ID 10 so in
this way you can delete your data from
the database using yours QT C++ GUI
application I hope you have enjoyed this
