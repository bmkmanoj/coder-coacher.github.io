how to install Java JDK in your Ubuntu
Linux operating system
so let's see which is the latest version
of JDK so open your browser and the
right in the search Java JDK and the
first link which comes is this from
Oracle Java SE download and I will click
it and at the time of making this video
let's see which is the version of Java
JDK so Java JDK 7 is the latest version
so we are going to install Java JDK 7 in
our Ubuntu operating system so I will
just minimize my browser and I will open
my terminal and I will write this
command sudo apt - get install open JDK
- the version you are installing so we
are installing version 7 so we write
here 7 - JDK ok so just give this
command and press ENTER and give your
password and here I have already
installed this - open JDK 7 in my
operating system so it's saying that
Java JDK 7 is already in the newest
version but when you install this Java
JDK in your system for the first time it
will ask you that it will download this
much amount of data and if you just need
to type Y which is like allowing the
data to be stored in your system and
then it will be installed in your
Ubuntu operating system now once you
have installed just open JDK in your
system which is version 7 you can check
whether it's really installed in your
system or not by giving this command
right Java and - version + + enter and
you can see here I have Java version 1.7
point 0 in my system and here open JDK
runtime environment is also there in my
system and open JDK client also there in
my system so generally when you install
this JDK in your system you can find it
in the directory which I am going to
show you so here go to the root
directory so this is your older system
and here when I click here at the corner
we go to the root directories and here
in here go to user and then go to Lib
and here all the libraries are installed
so we search for the JVM so here is JVM
and you can see here I have Java 7 open
JV JDK they are already installed right
so now you can verify this that if this
is present in this directory then its
installed in your system and when you go
for the inside it has bin folder so this
path we are going to provide it in our
export or an ARB bash file which I am
going to
show you now so once you have installed
JDK we will do some post installation
setups so once again open your folder
and I will open my home folder from here
and in here right now you can see only
the visible directories so what we need
to do is we need to open all invisible
directories so what I will do is just
hover over this line strip or pool strip
and you can see it here you and when you
click it and just click show hidden
files and now you can see all the hidden
files here so what we need to do is we
need to search for this dot bash RC file
and just right click it and open with
text editor okay it will open the bash
file with your text editor and here we
need to do some Java home settings or
you need to provide the system path for
the Java home so go at the bottom of
your file just at the bottom and make
some space here and we need to provide
here the path to the JVM Java JDK files
ok so just type here at the bottom this
line export Java home is equal to your
JVM path so with bitches I have already
shown you where is it in your user lip
Lib and here it will open
this here so this is your JDK part so
here you will just right-click and go to
the properties and we will provide the
path here so just copy this user slash
limp slash JVM and paste it here and
also you need to go one file down so
just copy this also so this is the name
of this folder okay and give a slash
once again and paste it here okay so
this is your Java home environment and
one more thing you need to type here
just below this Java home export is this
line so right export path is equal to
dollar paths and this colon and once
again copy the same path from here you
can copy the same part from here and
paste it here and we will go one file
down and put a slash and we are going to
give this bin folder path so here all
the Java executable files are there so
we will write here bin ok so just add
these two lines in your dot bash RC
libraries or bash or RC a file and just
save save your file and you can go to
the terminal and just type here Java C
and press Enter and if it gives you the
response that means your JDK is
correctly installed in your system so I
hope you have installed
this java jdk in your system and i hope
