JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will see how to use switch
statements in JavaScript so let's get
started for example I have a variable
called score okay and this indicates the
score of some student and I will
initialize it with 90 right and I'm also
going to initialize our variable called
result to print some result okay now the
syntax of switch statement so switch
statement is also a kind of statement in
which you evaluate some expression and
then on the basis of expression
you give your result or you perform some
piece of code okay so let's see what is
the syntax of switch statement so you
use the keyword called switch and then
inside these round bracket comes your
expression and then inside the curly
braces comes the cases on the basis of
which you execute some code okay so this
is some expression an expression means
some condition on the basis of which you
decide which case you will perform
okay so expression can be score here
okay so for example a student is scoring
some marks and on the basis of marks we
want to display some messages okay so in
this case score is an expression and we
are evaluating scores and on the basis
of scores of student we will perform
some code and inside the switch
statement comes that cases okay so you
can add a case something like this with
this colon and then you can perform your
code so for example I just want to
assign result is equal to some text for
example very good okay and once your Kuh
is finished you break your switch
statement with a keyword called break
okay now in front of case comes your
value so for example we want to say if
our score is equal to 90 then we will
return a result very good so here comes
your value okay
now you can define multiple switch cases
inside a switch statement for example
something like this and here you can say
students scored 60 here you can say
students scored 44 even for example and
here we can just return good and Fe
scores 40 we can return okay right now
for example student doesn't score 90 or
60 or 40 then in which case it will go
okay so for this we have a default case
right so just write a default keyword
here and then you say result is equal to
unknown okay so default condition is
executed when neither of the cases are
true okay so if the student doesn't
score 90 or 60 or 40 then it will go to
the default case right now let's return
our result and print it using this
document dot get element by ID and demo
is the ID of this paragraph tag here and
I'm just assigning a result which is
this variable here okay so save your
code and just notice here that score
right now is 90 right so I will refresh
my webpage here and say is very good
because score is 90 let's say score is
now 60 save your code and refresh it
once again and now the message is
printed good right
now let's say score is 45 which doesn't
satisfy any of the cases then when we go
to our webpage and refresh it it says
unknown right so this situation is
handled by the default condition right
now you can also use some situations in
switch cases without the break keyword
right so for example I can also write
case is equal to hundred here and for
example one more case ninety five here
and if you notice here I am NOT writing
the break keyword after this switch case
right so what happens when you don't add
a break keyword after a switch case so
let's save our code and let's say our
score is 95 okay which is this condition
and save our code and refresh the
webpage and it says very good okay so
what's happening here so in the case
where the break is not added then it
will jumps to the next case and whatever
the code in the next case it will
execute that code okay so the program
flow will be something like this our
switch case will ever aloo 800 and the
case is not hundred so it will go to 95
and it finds that 95 is the expression
we are looking for but there is no break
here so I will switch to the next case
and in here the case is 90 and here this
message is assigned to the result and
then if we find that here is the break
and then the switch case is broken and
then you got your result okay so if you
don't add a break after your case it
will jump to the next case and perform
the code which is under the next case
and then if it has break then it will
break your switch statement okay so if
you want to you know
evaluate multiple expression
continuously then you use case without a
break so in this way you can use switch
statements in JavaScript I hope you have
