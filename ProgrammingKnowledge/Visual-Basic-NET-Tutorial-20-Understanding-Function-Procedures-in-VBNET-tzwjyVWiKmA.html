last video I have shown you how to use
subs with your visual basic windows form
application and in this video I will
show you how to use functions with your
visual basic windows form application so
first thing is what is the difference
between subs and the functions
procedurally or basically the both
execute the same kind of code but the
basic difference between subs and
function is the subs does not return any
value and the function returns the
values now let me demonstrate what I
mean by returning the value so I have
this basic form and I have taken two
text boxes text box 1 and text text box
2 and I have this button from the last
video which have the text execute sub
but I'm going to change this text in
this video and I'm going to the text
property and I say execute function this
time ok now I'm going to double click
this button and in the last video we
have seen how to execute a sub with the
help of this button click event and this
was the procedure which we have created
which was the sub procedure in this
video also we will create a add
procedure but with the function
procedure so let's create a function
just go below your button click sub or
you can make function above here also so
in between your class starting in class
and you can make the function anywhere
you want okay so let me start by
creating a function
so I will say private and then I will
use the notation function and I will
give the name of the function which is
add function this time and I will just
give the bracket and press ENTER and you
see here it will automatically creates
this end function code for you now it
also takes so I have told you that the
basic difference between sub and the
function is that it returns a value so
we can define what value we are
expecting from the function by just
going after this parenthesis and write
as and what value we are expecting for
example VX we are expecting integer okay
so we can define here what return value
we are expecting from the sub okay and
we can pass the parameter to these
functions as we can pass the parameters
as we have seen last time that we can
pass the parameter in these brackets in
the subs so I will just copy it and
paste those two values which is by a
value a which is a name of one value as
integer and by well B as integer okay
and we will just copy the last code
which what was it was doing is it was
taking a and B and adding those two
integers and put it it patek put it into
this some integer okay but now the
difference here occurs between function
and sub that we return so we write
return and we will say sum which is the
integer right
so we already defined here that we are
going to return integer here so we are
going to return some which is an integer
right and now I will delete this sub
which was already there in the button
click event once again we come to the
button cake event and this time I am
going to call a function called add
function but first of all let me create
the variable called dem result as
integer okay and why I have created this
because I will store my value which is
returned by this function in this
variable so I will write it result is
equal to and I will call this add
function from here
so I will write add function which
appears here automatically and I will
pass my values here so I will pass the
values from the textboxes which I have
right so I have text box 1 and text box
2 you can see the name from here the
name of the text boxes and I will write
here textbox 1 dot txt comma text box 2
dot txt okay so what I am doing is what
I whatever I will enter in these text
boxes what it will do is it will add
those two values so I am passing these
two values from here to the function and
it will add two values and P
is it in this some variable and it will
return this sum as a function and this
return value we are catching int in this
integer variable right okay now I want
to show the message which contains the
result so I will write message box dot
Show and I will say double quotes the
result is and I'll give this ampersand
sign and I will pass my return variable
okay and so this is how this function
will execute from here and pass the
result in this variable and which this
value variable in the message box it
will give the result once again I will
run the program and I will give some
integer values here and here and when I
run the program it will give me the
addition of those two values right but
this time it's by using functions so
just remember that the basic difference
between subs and function is the
function returns the value and subs just
execute the piece of code and it doesn't
return any value okay so I hope you have
understood the difference between the do
and you have understood the basic
concept of functions so please keep
watching these videos and please create
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
