video I will show you how to add VLC
media player to your C shop windows from
application so I have this sample form
windows form application made and I want
to embed a VLC media player inside this
and so I will be able to play some
videos using this windows form
application so how can I do that just go
to your toolbox and right click here and
go to choose items and in here go to
comm components here and in here we
search for the video land VLC active as
X plug-in be - okay so just choose this
video land VLC active as X plug-in v2
and just click OK and when you click OK
you will be able to see this video LAN
VLC ActiveX plug-in tool in your toolbox
you can drag and drop this tool in your
form and you have VLC tool in your form
so suppose we want to make our
application so that we will be able to
browse a video and play pause and stop
the video so I will take button for
loading the video and I will take second
button for starting third is for stop
and fourth is for pause so I will change
the text of these we take these buttons
first is
load second is start third is stop and
the fourth is pause okay so I have this
four button created now just
double-click your load button and first
let's see what is the name of this VLC
media player
it's a ex VLC plug-in 21 okay so I click
this load button and double click it and
here I will write the code to load my
video file so I'm going to use open file
dialog to load my video file so what I
will do is I will write Open File dialog
I'll make it a little bit bigger so you
can see so I will just write here Open
File dialog and give it a object name is
equal to new Open File dialog and then I
can set a filter to my file dialog so
suppose I want to open mp4 video files
so I will copy this Open File dialog
object and I will say dot filter is
equal to in the code in right bracket
star dot mp4 bracket closed and then
this or sign and write star dot mp4 and
just close your code from here and then
I will check if my file is for file is
okay or folder which I selected is okay
so I will write an if condition to check
whether this file dialog is giving these
perfect results so right if open file
dialog dot show dialog
is equal to dialogue result dot okay and
in here I will load my mp4 files so I
will select my VLC player in this design
view copy the name of my VLC player and
in this if condition I will write the
name of this VLC plugin dot playlists
dot add and inside this bracket I will
pass three arguments one is just copy
this Open File dialog object dot file
name yes
and the second is once again the Open
File dialog dot save file name so that
it will only select the save files and
third third argument will be null okay
so pass these three arguments in here
first is open file dialog dot file name
second is open file dialog dot save file
name and third is null so this will load
your VLC file of or mp4 file on any of
ELC player now we are we want to start
our file we has selected so just go to
the button start and just double click
it and once again copy this VLC plug-in
to one dot playlist dot start so we will
select start which is not there
oh okay this is clay not start but play
so just write this so this will start
playing your video now if you want to
stop this then just go to this stop
button double click it just copy the
above code and instead of this play I
will add stop okay
and third is pause so just click this
pause button double click it and I will
copy the same code here and paste it in
the pause dot toggle pause so this
toggle pause what it will do is for once
if you click this pause it will pause
the video and once again if you click
this pause then it will unpause the
video so these three we have done and
the code is ready now so let's check if
it works or not so I will run the
program and it's
now I want to load the file so I will
just click this load button and I will
browse for the file it should be mp4
file you can see here it is filtered as
mp4 and I will select this file and I
can click open now I want to start my
video so I will click this start button
so I and you can see the video start
playing and because I have played the
pushed this pause button it is stopped
or paused when I click this pause button
once again it will start playing once
again let's see
yes it's starting and when I click the
stop button it will stop so it will stop
once again let's see once again the
functionality start pause unpause and
stop okay so your VLC media player is
working one thing I have observed is
this VLC media player in my computer
works for mp4 files for some reason I
don't know why it's not working with AV
dot avi files so this is the warning I
want to give you if you find any
solution for it just comment below if it
if you are able to run dot avi files or
not so I hope you have enjoyed this
video please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
