Android app development for beginners in
the last video we have seen how we can
apply styles to your components using
style dot XML file now in this video we
will see how we can inherit from one
style to another style in Android using
style dot XML file okay so this is the
example I have shown you in the last
video so I will go to the style dot XML
file here and this was the Styles we
have created in the last video now for
example if you want to make the style to
inherit from other style then what you
need to do is for example I want to make
this style as a parent style I need to
add the attribute called parent and then
I need to give the name of this
attribute for example I want to give
this attribute called
text appearance dot large attribute
right now in order to inherit from style
one - style - all the properties can be
inherited from style 1 - style - if you
take the name of style 1 and put in
front of style - name separated by this
dot ok so now all the properties from
style 1 can be inherited to the style -
right
so for example I will delete this layout
width and layout height property from
the style - and then I will go to the
activity main.xml file here and I will
go to the text and in here also I should
give this my style 1 dot my style - in
the button attribute ok otherwise it
will give you the error right now when
you see in the design this style is
applied to the buttons also which was
inherited from the style 1 right because
these button did not have their own
layout width and height but it's taking
from the style 1 ok now in the same way
what you can do is you can remove
these attribute for example textile and
text color right so I will remove this
and then once again I will go to the
activity XML file and in here you can
see the style from style one is
inherited in these buttons also right
now you may have observed then when I
add some attribute which are similar in
style one in style to then style two
attributes will be preferred right
so style one attributes will be
overridden by the style two attribute if
they have the same item name here right
so the preference is given to the child
attribute over the parent attribute so
now our button will become green and
italic right because the preference is
given to the child attribute over the
parent attribute if they have the same
attribute right but this parent
attribute will be preferred even in the
child attribute for example I have this
text appearance large here and text
appearance for example I make it small
here it will not change it so still the
our text appearance is large here right
because the main parent attribute is
this text appearance and it's large here
right for example I make it small like
this and I go here now the text
appearance will become the small okay so
in this way you can inherit styles from
one style to another style attribute in
Android I hope you enjoyed this video
