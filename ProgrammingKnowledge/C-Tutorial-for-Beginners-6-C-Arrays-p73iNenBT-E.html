video I am going to show you how you can
use arrays in C shop so what is an array
array is a collection of similar data
type values which you can store in a
single variable so let's see how we can
declare arrays in C shop and how we can
use them so for example you want to
declare or you want to have a collection
of numbers in a single variable so for
declaring the array you can use int as a
data type because we want the collection
of integer values and then give this
square bracket in front of the array and
then you give the name of the array for
example my array and then you initialize
it like this is equal to new int and
then you give the size of the array
whatever number of value you want to
save in the array for example for 4
values you want to save so this is how
you declare array this is the data type
and this square bracket tells c-sharp
that it's it's an array this is the name
of the variable array which is which
contains int we can see it from him and
we initialize this array with the value
4 so this means that this array will
contain 4 values or can be able to
contain 4 values now to assign value to
the array what you can do is you can
just copy your variable here and you can
paste it and in the square bracket the
array there is something called array in
X so whatever you write here inside this
square bracket is called the array index
and array index starts from zero right
so for example I've right
my array or at index 0 is equal to some
integer for example 3 okay in a same way
our array can contain 4 values right so
I can just copy this and paste it three
more times and I can change it
this index 2 1 2 3
because it starts from 0 so these are 4
values 0 1 2 3 and we can only save 4
values like this you can also give any
other number for example 50 if you want
to save 50 values but for this example
just use we are just using 4 values and
you can just change these values for
example 34 37 65 so in this way you can
assign values to the array so at the 0th
index this value will be placed at the
first index of the array the value 34
will be placed so in this way you can
assign for every index of value now in
order to print the array or a print the
values in the array or in order to
access the values in the array what you
can do is you can access it by using
console' thought right and you can
access it directly so inside this
bracket just use the name array and
whatever index you want to access for
example we want to see the value at the
index 1 so just you can give this square
bracket and you can say I want to see
this value at the index 1 so we are
expecting the answer 34 because we want
to access the index 1 of my array right
I will run the program and let's see
what's the answer
yes 34 is the answer right in a similar
way you can access this value at the
second index which is this one it will
show yourself 37 right now what are the
advantages of four it
advantages of array are whenever you
want to store the collection of similar
data type values you can use array okay
so this data type can be double or float
or string so any built-in data type you
can use with the array right so it can
be initialized like this string and
string so it will be array of string
values so if you declare it died like
this now you cannot assign these a
string array of integer value so you
need to have something like double
quotes and then you can assign string
values to string array right so just
remember if you declare a string array
you can only assign string value if you
declare int array or double array you
can only assign integer or double values
right so advantage is you can store more
than one values in an array so if you
have the collection of similar data just
save it now the disadvantage of the
array is you cannot if you have
initialized the array with an index you
cannot assign the extra value to an
array for example we have initialized
our array with 4 so it can only contain
4 value if you assign fifth value to
the array for example for and this can
be anything then once we try to run the
program it will show us the error or
exception not at the build time but at
the run time so for example I want to
access this for and I will run it it
will give us the error make sure that
maximum index on the list is less than
the list size
okay so it's giving us this error so
this is the disadvantage of using array
you cannot increase the length of the
array if you have already initialized it
there are other method or other classes
in c-sharp which you can use which are
which works better than array but for
now just I want to demonstrate how you
can use arrays in C shop that's why in
this way you can use arrays but in the
further videos in the later videos I
will show you the better ways of using
the collection of similar data in C shop
so I hope you have enjoyed or I hope you
are understood this concept and I hope
you have enjoyed this video please rate
