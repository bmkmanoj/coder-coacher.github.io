video I will show you how to use
multiple document interface or MDI with
your windows form c-sharp application so
MDI you can use it for hosting multiple
form inside a parent form so for this I
will create a new project and this will
be my windows form application and I
will name it as md i one for example and
create a new project it will open a form
1 and this form for example we want to
make this form as MDI parent so just
select this form go to the properties
and there is one property called is MDI
container false just make it true and
when you make this is a MD a container
true and go to this form one you will be
able to see that it has converted to MDI
container so for demonstration I will
create two more forms form two and form
three so this will be my windows form
form two I will keep my form two name as
default and I will create one more form
add new and form three so I have created
two more form first form is my MDI
container and second and third form I
will show inside my MDI container form
which is form one well demonstration I
will take menu strip and I will name
this menu strip as new and I will open
form to form two and form three inside
this form one
and I will show you two ways of opening
first is with only one instance of this
form and second opening multiple
instance of the form so first
double-click this form too and we will
go to the code above this method just
declare form 2 f2 variable and inside
this form - tool strip menu item click
event write F bracket and like it closed
first f2 is equal to null then we will
open new instance so f2 is equal to new
form
- I get and make it closed and we need
to declare with what is the parent of
this or form - so write F 2 dot MDI
parent is equal to this so this will
tells this form to that form 1 is the
parent of this and then we will just
show
this form or else if the form is already
opened we can say that just activate the
forms of form to not activate like it
and I get close and you can also provide
the form closing event form closing
condition so just go after this MDI
parent is equal to this just write F 2
dot form closed just write plus and is
equal to and either just click this new
form closed event handler or just press
tab button two times one and two it will
create our this f2 form close event
automatically and in here there will be
a code inside through new not
implemented exception so just comment it
and just write f2 is equal to null so
when you close your form it will set
this f2 variable as null so this will
open only one instance of your form to
let's make the code for form 3 opening
and perform 3 we will open multiple
instances of this form so I will double
click this form and I will write form 3
F 3 is equal to new form and I will
declare the form 3 MDI parent
is equal to this and I will just show
this form so f 3 dot show so this code
will open multiple instances of form 3
and the code for F 2 will open only one
instance of form 2 so let's try and run
the program I have this form 1 and I
have this 2 menu item button and I click
this app - it will open F 2 form once
and I can open F 3 form multiple times
but if I want to open this F 2 form once
again this will only activate this form
- it will not open the new instance of
form - okay so it just it opens the form
- only once so in this way you can use
MDI for containing multiple forms inside
your mean MDI form I hope you have
