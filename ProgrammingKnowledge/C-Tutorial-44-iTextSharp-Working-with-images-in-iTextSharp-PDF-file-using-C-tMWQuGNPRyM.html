last video I have shown you how to
create a list inside of PDF file using
ITEX sharp and C sharp application in
this video I will show you how to insert
images in your PDF using ITEX sharp so
for example I want to add some image at
the top of this PDF file so how can I do
that I will show you right now so first
of all I will go to the code once again
this is the button click event and this
is the code I have written in the last
two videos and if you want to add a
picture on the top so this all goes in
sequence so we have added paragraph
first and then we have added list so we
want our image to be at the top so
before this paragraph I will add the
image so just go to doc dot open where
this code is there just below that we
will write the code for inserting image
so first of all we need to have some
image so I will go to my desktop and I
will copy the image and I will go to my
project folder where in my debug file so
because I am running this C shop program
in debug mode so go to your project then
bin then debug file and wherever your
PDF file is generating just paste that
picture there it's not not necessary to
paste a picture like that if you don't
paste your picture in your debug or
Wrigley's folder then you need to give
the path correct path of your picture so
I don't want to give
any extra path to my picture that's why
I have added the picture inside my debug
folder where my Exe file and other files
are there okay so now I return back to
the code
so after this doc dot open code write
this so right eye eye takes shop dot
text dot image and give it a variable
name for example PNG image and is equal
to and then once again I take sharp dot
text dot image and dot get instance okay
and break it and break it closed and in
this here these brackets we are going to
pass the name of our picture okay so if
it's the picture is not in your debug
folder of your project then you can give
some path for your picture for example
see something like document but because
it's in my debug folder I don't need to
give this path I just go to see the name
of the my picture and in the detail I I
can see it's a PNG file so I will copy
the name of the picture and I will paste
in this get instance dot PNG because
it's a PNG picture ok and in the next
line I will write
docks which is my this variable name
which is my document variable name dot
add once again bracket bracket closed
and I will copy this image variable and
paste it here inside my add dock not add
okay
and now let's see how our PDF looks like
so user name and password and I click
this create PDF button and I will open
my PDF file and you can see it has added
the picture into my PDF file ok so this
is how you can add a picture to the PDF
file now sometimes you want to your
picture to be bigger or smaller so we
can do this that resizing of the picture
also so just go to your code where you
have declared your image variable and
where you have added your image variable
in the document just below your
Declaration of the image variable and
above your document edition just go
there and in between those two codes
write this so this copy this variable
and paste it here dot scale percent so
this line will resize your code
according to the percentage so for
example I want to resize my picture to
25% of the original size so that's why I
have written 25 so the image
should look smaller this time so I will
run the code and create PDF and when we
see the PDF you see the image is now
one-fourth of its size and on the other
hand for example I want to make the
picture bigger
for example 200 times so once again I
will run the program and we click this
PDF and I will see the PDF form and my
picture is become 200 times now now so
in this way you can resize the picture
also okay now most of the time or
sometimes you also want your picture to
be placed at an exact position where you
want to show the picture so for example
I want to show my picture at extreme
right of the PDF file extreme right and
top of the PDF file so write this code
then it's just after your scaling of the
picture so I will make this picture once
again when no 50% for example and then
right PNG dot set exit absolute position
and in the bracket first of all we will
define the width so horizontally the
position we will define so just right
dock which is your document variable not
paid size dot width so this is the total
width of your page and then you will
provide the position so right - and
whatever position
you want to provide for example 36 app -
72 F comma this is the total height of
your page document dot page size dot
height and now - 36 - 216 for example so
this you can change according to the
position so you need to experiment a bit
to get the exact position and once you
get the exact position then the picture
will be placed at that exact position so
write this code and now when I run the
program and I will press this create PDF
and I will open my file once again let
me small make a small so see the picture
is pleased and the position I have
defined so just play with the position
and just get the values or set the
values according to the position and you
will get your desired position like that
okay so this is also very important when
you are using pictures and for now I
will not use this so I will come into
this and now I will show you how you can
give the exact size to the picture so
earlier we are just making our picture
small or bigger according to the
percentage but now for example I want to
make the picture a rectangle or
according to my size so 30 by 40 or
something like this this will not
give you the exact size this is this
will just scale your picture but uh if I
want the exact size image I want to make
the picture to the exact size so how can
I do that I will show you just comment
this line in this line because this will
not be required now and just after your
picture declaration here for example I
will add a new code so what I will write
so I will copy this image variable here
dot set No
so dot scale to fit okay so this will
scale our image according to our given
parameters so for example I want to give
the image 50 F comma hundred F so this
will make our image some kind of a
rectangle right now if you look at the
image earlier it looks like a square now
I this will look like a 50 by 100
picture so let's see how our picture
looks like so username and password
create PDF once again and I will see the
text image
and it looks like this so 50 by 100 so
now I will also show you how to give the
border to your pictures picture so for
now I will make it 250 by 250 picture
and just copy your PNG variable for
image and then right
PNG dot border and is equal to
rectangle dot box for example
so it's giving me some error that this
error is because of its conflicting with
c-sharp username and I text username so
I will just copy this I text sharp dot
text from here and I will place it here
also and now I think this should go yes
this box should be capital I think yes
so write this so it will give a border
to your picture now I also want the
color to the border of my picture so
write this line
PNG dot border color is equal to I text
dot text base color dot your desired
color so I am giving a yellow color
border okay I can also provide the width
to the border of the image you need to
write just this PN G dot border width is
equal to whatever width you want for the
border of the picture so just write
these three lines for the border and
when once again when you run the program
create PDF and you will see the PDF and
I will make it little bit smaller so you
see it has created some nice border to
our picture which is which has some
width and it looks nice now so in this
way you can play with images and insert
images to the PDF using ITEX shop I hope
you have learned something new this time

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
