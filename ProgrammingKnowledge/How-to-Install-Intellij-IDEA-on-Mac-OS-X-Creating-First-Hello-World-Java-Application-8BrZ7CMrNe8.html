you how you can download and install
IntelliJ IDEA IDE on your Mac OS X
operating system IntelliJ IDEA IDE is an
IDE IDE stands for integrated
development environment which helps us
to develop our code and IntelliJ IDEA
IDE is mainly for developing java
application right and the company behind
IntelliJ IDEA has also made some of the
very popular IDE like Android studio and
web strong and pycharm
all are made by IntelliJ IDEA company
which is JetBrains
right so let's see how we can download
and install IntelliJ IDEA so the basic
prerequisite for installing IntelliJ
IDEA is to have Java installed on your
system and if you don't have Java you
can check whether Java is installed on
your system or not by going to System
Preferences so just click on the Apple
icon here and then click on system
preferences and then once this System
Preferences opens we can see here at the
bottom that there is a Java icon also
here right and this means Java is
installed on my system but if it's not
installed you just need to install Java
first and come to this video because
after installing intelligent we are
going to see how we can develop our
first hello world application using
intelligent I have also made a video how
you can install Java JDK on your Mac OSX
so just watch that video and you will be
good to go so to download IntelliJ you
just need to open your browser and
search for download IntelliJ IDEA and
the first link which will appear here
will be from JetBrains comm forward
slash idea and forward slash download
because we are searching download
IntelliJ IDEA right so there
link will open which is JetBrains
dot-com power class idea for slash
download I'm going to click this link
and this is going to directly lead me to
a page of download right so here you can
see few downloads and you can also see
this cookie warning and if you land to
the main page which is jet brave calm
you can go to the I des and you can see
these are the ID is made by this
companies for example by Cheung gap
storm and other so we want IntelliJ IDEA
so just click IntelliJ IDEA and then you
will be able to see this page and you
just need to click download and you will
come to this page right now there are
two versions of IntelliJ IDEA one is
ultimate version which is a paid and
commercial version which we are not
going to install we are going to install
the open source Apache License version
which is a community version it's little
bit limited to just developing java
application and android application be
even and it's integrated with git
subversion and mercurial but if you want
to have more features which are listed
down here then you may want to buy this
ultimate version so we are going to just
download the free version which is the
community version which is open source
and just scroll down and we are going to
download the dot dmg file so just make
sure that it's a dot dmg file and then
click download button here is going to
download the dot DF dot dmg file and you
can see the download has been started
and this is fairly big file you can see
it's 399 megabyte files so you need to
wait for some time to let it download
and once it's downloaded we will see how
to install it so now the download of
this dmg file is complete so I'm going
to double click on this dmg file
and I'm going to minimize the browser
first of all it's going to open this dmg
file and it will verify and in some
moment we will see our window and it's
going to look like this and it's really
easy to follow this window it says you
just need to drag this icon to the
Applications folder ok so just select
this IntelliJ icon and drag it to the
applications and it's going to copy this
IntelliJ to the Applications folder and
once it's copied we are going to start
IntelliJ and then we will see how we can
write our first hello world Java program
in IntelliJ IDEA ID so now the copy is
complete so now we can just launch
intelligent what you can do is you can
go to this launch pad and you will be
able to see this IntelliJ IDEA icon from
here or otherwise you can go to the
finder and then go to your Applications
folder and launch it from there also so
I'm going to just launch it from here
IntelliJ IDEA from the launch pad and
it's going to start for the first time
and we will see the normal warning which
Mac gives you whenever you install
third-party applications so first of all
it's verifying IntelliJ IDEA and then
you see this warning which says IntelliJ
IDEA is an application downloaded from
internet are you sure you want to open
it yes we are sure so just click open
and once you click open IntelliJ IDEA
IDE is going to start for the first time
whenever IntelliJ IDEA IDE starts it's
going to ask you one question which is
to import the projects or not so you can
see empower import IntelliJ IDEA
settings from custom location config
this folder or you
can just use this option we save do not
import settings right so you just need
to leave it as default which is do not
import settings and then click OK and
now you just need to agree to this
license terms and condition just read
this document if you want and then click
accept and now this IntelliJ IDEA
customization window will start right so
here you can choose what theme you want
default or dark color I just want the
normal default theme but you can choose
whatever you want and for now I'm going
to just click this button we say skip
all and set defaults ok so I just want
everything as default so I am going to
just click this whatever it says skip
all and set defaults and now it's going
to start IntelliJ IDEA and you will be
able to see this kind of window and it
opens so let's create a project just
click this button we save create new
project so in the next window we will
choose Java first of all and then it's
going to automatically detect whether
Java is installed on your system and
it's going to appropriately select the
Java version for you if you don't see
anything here you can just click new
here and then choose JDK from there ok
so you can see you can choose new and
then you just need to give the location
of your JDK folder ok and this is by
default selected in my case if you
already have Java it will be selected by
default
and I'm going to click Next and it says
what kind of project we want we will
just choose the command line version and
you can see when you check this checkbox
you will just use the command line app
so we wanted to create the command line
app which is ok so just select it and
then click Next
now you can give the name to your
project so I'm going to name it as hello
world here and by default it will be
saved at this location so at your home
folder there will be a idea project
folder and then your project name will
be save so if you are creating the hello
world project the same name directory
will be saved inside this project
directory so now I'm going to click
finish
off or if you want to change the
location you can change it from here
right so I'm going to leave it as
default and click finish it's going to
create the hello world project for me so
now you can see this project is created
I am going to just close this tips
window and I can see this main dot Java
files right I can just double click here
and I will be able to see the project
structure also here so it has created
this directory with the name hello world
and this directory we have the source
file and the source file we have the
package the package name is comm dot
company by default and then our main
class is created so main dot Java class
is created by default for us and in this
main class we have our main method which
is public static void main so if you
already know this beam method is the
main entry point for your java project
right so I'm going to just print
HelloWorld we just want to print
HelloWorld
just right here as out and then press
tab it's going to create this code for
you this is the auto completion feature
of IntelliJ IDEA and then just give
double quotes and then just print hello
world here okay and then save your code
you can just go at the file and then
save it from there you can see save all
option so it will save your Java file
and then you can right click on your
Java file and run it from here
you can see this option which says run
mean and you can just press this green
button and it's going to build your
project first and it's going to just run
your hello world project after its build
okay so you can see it's scanning
everything and now you can see hello
world is printed here so you know
everything is working fine in your case
right now from the next time you can
also press this green button from here
also
it's going to print the the same hello
world right you can see the same color
world is printed and once again I'm
going to show you this shortcut you just
need to write s out and then press tab
and it's going to give you this method
and I can say hello world again and then
save your code from here file save all
and once again run your code and you
will be able to see hello world and
