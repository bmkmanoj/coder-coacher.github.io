javathread tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how we can
create threads by extending thread class
now in this video I'm going to show you
the other way of creating threads in
Java
by implementing runnable interface so
let's get started first of all I will
create one more package in my project so
package and I will name it as lesson 2
and inside this package I'm going to
create a class which I will name it as
demo itself and this is going to contain
main method and first of all let's
create a class which implements runnable
interface so class I can say this is my
class and which implements runnable
interface so that's how you can create a
class which implements runnable
interface but right now it's giving me
this error bulb so just click this and
it will tell you to implement this run
method so just click this and as we have
seen in the last video when we have
extended from the thread class this run
method has to be implemented in this
runnable interface also this run method
have to be implemented right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to just remove
all the things I am going to go to the
last code which I have written inside my
run method this is from the last video
and I'm going to copy this and I'm going
to paste it in my run method right so
basically we want to do the same thing
we want to print this number 10 times
and we want to print the ID of the
thread and I want to pause this thread
by 100 milliseconds right now I'm going
to go to my main method here and here
I'm going to create a thread so I will
instantiate a thread object is equal to
new thread and inside this constructor
we are going to pass our class object of
this my class so just pass it like this
and this is going to create the thread
object for your class and let's do it
one more time so we are going to create
two threads and just take t1 here and
once again we are going to call a start
method on this t1 and t2 also we will
call a start method on t2 so here also
remember that you don't need to call run
directly on your thread object you need
to call start method which will start
your thread and then it will call your
run method here so let's try to run our
program I'm going to run it and it has
printed the same way as we have seen in
the last video so it's printing thread
one and value one thread one value two
and then try to value one and then so
it's printing in concurrency right so
this is how you can implement runnable
interface to create threads now
sometimes you want to create a single
thread which contains only one method
and for that this long class is not
required you can create a thread
directly in your main class like this so
let's see how we can create a thread
inside the main class itself without you
know creating an extra class so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a new
package and I will call it lesson 3 and
inside this I'm going to create a class
and I will call it demo once again
and it's going to have mean method and
in here what we can do is we can just
call or create the object of thread and
for example t1 is equal to new thread
and then just call new runnable and less
close this first and here you can
implement your run method like this so
you can just create your run method
inside this runnable constructor and in
here you can implement your run method
so you can just click this bulb and
implement the method and in here you can
just call the same code which we are
using for printing ten values and just
paste it here okay and then just outside
your constructor of your thread you can
just call this t1 object dot start okay
and it's also going to start a thread so
let's run this and now it has printed
ten values using a single thread okay so
these are the different ways of creating
threads in Java I hope you have enjoyed
