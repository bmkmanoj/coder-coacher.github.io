video I will show you how to open a
website or a web page using your QT C++
GUI application so let's get started I
will take a button from here which is a
push button and I will change its text
as open web page for example and then I
will go I will right-click it and go to
slot and I will click this clicked and
press ok button and in this push button
click event I will write the code to
open a web page but first I will include
some of the header files so I will
include first of all include Q so
include Q Desktop Services and second is
include Q URL ok so import these two
header files one is Q desktop services
and second is Q URL ok and then we will
write the code in this push button click
event so I will write here first of all
let me make it bigger okay so the code
is first line we will declare
q string and I will name it as link is
equal to whatever link I want to open so
I will write www.google.com for example
and then in the second line I will write
here Q Desktop Services and then open
URL and inside that I will write Q URL
and inside here this Q URL I will pass
this link here okay and I will close it
and in here this Q URL U is capital and
the link I should write here HTTP colon
slash slash I think okay so I hope the
code is complete now so just import
these two lines and these two header
files and then write this code to open
the web page let's try and run the
program and see if it's running or not
they'll they successful and when I click
this button it should open the web page
so let's click it and yes it opened this
www.google.com/mapmaker so pin web page
and you see once again it opened the
website once again so in this way you
can open a web page using your QT C++
cui application I hope you have enjoyed
