last two videos I have been showing you
how to use function template in C++
now in this video I am going to show you
how you can use templates with classes
so I am going to show you how you can
use class templates in C++ so let's get
started first of all how to declare a
template class it's just like declaring
a template function you just need to use
template keyword and then in these angle
brackets just write plus and just give
the data type which is T in my case I am
giving then you will give the class name
so I'm I'm calling my class name as math
class maths class for example and in
this class for example I have two
variables one so because I have this dot
dot type in my initialization of my
class template I can use this T to
define my variables for example a comma
B for right so this t will be replaced
by whatever initialization you will give
to this team
for example int or float or whatever
right now I will define a public method
public and I will define the constructor
to the class math and this constructor
for example will take two arguments and
I will pass T because T is my daughter
type and this T is the data type of a
and B so I can define T X X is my
variable name argument name and T is the
capital T is the data type fine
and I can initialize this and I can then
just say a is equal to X and B is equal
to Y okay this is simple function or
constructor right we are initializing
the constructor with two arguments and
we are just setting the value of a and B
to these from these arguments right now
for example I want to calculate the
maximum of these two values once again I
will take T and I will define a function
called Max value and then I will close
this okay but for defining this function
definition what you need to do is as in
class implement class function
implementation a class member function
implementation what you do is you just
write the name of the class for example
math class and then with these colon
values you can call your functions like
this right but because we are using
class templates in our case this will be
for example returning T here and
whenever you use class template you need
to define this signature of the class
template everywhere okay so in here
above your function you need to give
this template as we have seen in the
last videos that whenever we define
function template we need to use this
keyword in the angular bracket we need
to pass this class and the dotted I'm
whatever which is which depends upon us
right
in addition you also need to give tea
here okay so this tells this C++ that we
are using the member function of the
class with this data type okay so don't
forget to initialize the member function
with this template keyword and don't
forget this angle bracket and the data
type okay now I can just return return
maximum value right and I can calculate
the maximum value but to only the
operator if a is greater than B question
mark which decides then I will return a
otherwise I will return B okay now in
order to use the instance of the class
to instantiate our class you may think
that I can just use this math class here
in my mean and I can define a object
like this but let's see what happens and
I compile my program it will give me an
error here because this error and let's
see what if the error first this error
says expected semicolon so I haven't
given semicolon or what yeah so it's
giving me some weird error and this is
because whenever you use class template
you don't ever forget this angle bracket
with your data type T in here and this T
will be replaced by the value or data
type you want to pass for example you
want to pass two integers this int will
be replaced here in and this 2 will be
instantiate this to a and B variable
will be in
and she ate it as an int variable and
then we can call this math or max valued
member function to calculate the maximum
of the value right so I can give for
example 45 comma 67 and then because
it's returning something to me I can
just calculate this max value right so I
can just see out see out not here but
here see out and I can call this number
function here and I can use this
instance of the class or object of the
class to print this right so now I
compile my program and hopefully it will
work and I will run my program and gives
me maximum value is 67 which is true now
in order to instantiate these a and B as
double values we just need to write
double here and you can just pass two
double values point something and 67
point something right compile it and run
it it will give the answer right so
don't forget some basic things that
class instantiate in class template
isn't instantiated like the function
template that this template keyword and
these angle brackets and your data type
and whenever you are declare or whenever
you provide the definition of your
function member function of a class
don't forget this template either there
also and whenever you define member
function you need to add this angle
bracket with
the starter type with your class okay so
I hope you have understood these basic
concept and I hope you have enjoyed this
