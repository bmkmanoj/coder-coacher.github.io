video I'm going to show you how to use
get variable in your PHP script so first
of all I will make a new document and I
will save it as for example get dot PHP
and I will save it and in here first of
all I will give you a little demo of get
how to declare get variable in PHP so we
can declare this get variable like this
we just need the salt dollar symbol and
then this underscore and whatever you
write whenever this variable starts from
under school it's generally a super user
variable of the variable provided by
your PHP script so just we just write in
capital letters and we just use these
square brackets to get the values and in
here comes the name of the index you are
expecting so for example I can just name
it as name and I can save it okay and
this get is also called a super global
variable or automatic global variable
this simply means that it is available
in all the scopes throughout your pre
PHP script so you can use it anywhere in
your PHP script right it's a global
variable now how to use this get record
so for example I want to echo whatever
is passed as a value of name so this get
will be will be catching the name which
is pass from your URL I will save it and
I will give you an R demo so now I have
this get dot PHP I will click it and
first of all it will give me an error
because I'm not passing
the value which is it is expecting so
what I'm going to do is I will just in
my url just go to your URL here this is
my URL and give a question mark here to
give this question mark and then give
the name of your variable which is name
in our case actually just me well we can
change it as ftu underscore name so it
doesn't conflict so in our case this is
st you've gotten name okay
and after this question mark so you have
your URL just give a question mark then
give the name of your variable you are
which you are expecting here and then
give the value of that variable or a key
so you need to gives question mark the
variable name or a key name then give
this equal to sign here and then here
then well value so for example I pass it
mark here and press Enter we will be
able to see let's see what's the problem
here
okay so this I think this key should be
in double quotes enter instead of these
single quotes and then it can process
the name of this variable so I will pass
the same query once again question mark
and then the name of your variable which
is st you underscore name is equal to
the value y which you want to give so
for example I want to pass student name
is equal to mark here and I just reload
this and I will be able to see mark here
so this is really showing the dynamic
nature of PHP so whatever you are
passing as a URL as a value it's
printing the value in your PHP page okay
or it's returning the value
as a result not to make this this
execution little bit more interactive
and user-friendly what I want to do is I
will just create a new PHP page for
example I will save it as for example
student student dot PHP okay and in here
I will just start my PHP code PHP and in
here I will just close it and for
example in here or I don't even need to
do this I will just make a HTML form
which can take some values so if you
have a little bit knowledge of HTML you
will know what the form is and if you
even don't have that knowledge I will
just show you how to make a simple form
here so you just need to make this kind
of a form HTML code starts from this
HTML tags I think most of you just know
this and then it has the body it has the
head which I am not using right now and
in the body you can provide your tags
whatever you want to print okay
so this is the basic skeleton of HTML
code right and I want to print a student
info in in this form okay so I will just
make a form inside my HTML page so I
will just write form and I will just end
this form first
form and in here I will just give the
path of my file which I want to invoke
from this HTML page which is get dot PHP
so in this form action action is equal
to I will pass the name of my PHP file
which is get dot PHP right get dot PHP
get dot PHP for example this is the path
of my PHP file I'm telling this form to
call ok and then we give the method so
you can call different method using this
form summation and because we are
learning get variable we will call a get
method from here so just write get here
but in double quote and basically in
this form what we want is we want to
submit the name of the student the age
of the student and the weight of the
student for example so we have this
title called it student info and in the
capital letter or in bold we can just
pass name in bold and similarly we can
do the same for age and weight age
weight and in here after this name I can
just pass some name here so I will use
input tag to give the input input and
the type type will be a text box so the
so I type is equal to double quotes text
text and the name of this input we will
name it as for example name itself okay
is equal to is equal to for example St
you name tu underscore name and this s
tu name is the same as this s tu name
just copy this and paste it here
okay in a similar way I will pass the
age and the weight okay so this will be
all text but this will be s tu age for
example and this will be s tu weight
okay and the same tag I can use it here
so for example I can echo this Plus this
Plus this and this should be age age and
wait wait
but let's concatenate let's use
concatenate operation and just print
name and dot and here we will give our
break BR and same we will do here and
here for printing page and for printing
wait and we will use this break here and
maybe here also okay so there is a
simple form I will save this form and I
will just request this form from here go
back go back and refresh it I have the
student dot PHP I can call it and you
can see I can I have the simple form
and I can see name and this textbox is
in this text box and wait then this text
box and I want a little button also so
first of all I will provide break here
so I can see a button on the next line
and then I can provide once again input
but this time this will be a button so I
will just say type type is equal to sum'
MIT okay submit so this will be a button
and once again when we refresh our code
you can see submit query right so we
have a PHP page in which we have some
HTML code and we are expecting student
name age and weight and we want to
submit this and this because we have
provided the path of the PHP file as an
action it will go to this PHP file and
you'll see if this student name is there
and then it will print to the name age
and weight let's see what what happens
so I will just write mark as name and
the age 19
and weight 46 and I submit this and I
see some problem here let's see what's
the problem yeah so problem is single
quotes here sometimes forget this but
don't forget this okay so once again we
go back we have named mark page 19 wait
46 submit and now we can see name is
equal to mark age is equal to 19 and
weight is equal to 46 and you can even
see this URL modification that st you
name is equal to mark and this little
and symbol lists just provided by a PHP
and this and represent that there are
more than one variable you are passing
in this get request and then we have our
second variable s tu age is equal to 19
and then we have third variable which is
s tu weight is equal to 46 so this is
the request get request you are passing
to your PHP page and then this request
comes to your PHP page and this is
printed according like this right but
for example you don't even pass anything
here I will just for example I will just
leave it as blank what happens it just
print blank blank names and age and
weight right for example if you don't
want to you know want user to do
something like this what you can do here
is you can use another is another group
global variable in if condition so I
will just give if and this is a
predefined variable which is called is
sent and it just check that if the value
of the variable is set or not so we want
to check if the value of get student
name is set or not so I will just write
it like this and I also want that so I
will give this and symbol here I have
shown you how to use this M and and
these logical and comparison operators
in the earlier earlier videos right so
and then I also want to check whether my
age field is have some value or not and
have in the same way I want to check my
weight field has some value or not and
if they have some value I want to print
it
otherwise else I will just say that I
will just echo please enter all feed
please enter all fields
okay so now when I submit this form as
blank I will just submit it and it says
you can use null not equal to XC what's
the problem here is set okay so I know
the problem we need to dis use this if
that function for every get method so I
will use the dis is set with this ket
method and is set with this get method
okay now once again let's try I will
just reload my page and submit this and
now I can get this name because I also
need to check whether these names are
empty or not so what I can do here is I
can declare name variable is equal to
get student name in a similar way I can
declare age and weight it takes student
age and student weight and I will check
one more thing if and there is one more
function in bill function in PHP which
is empty function so it checks whether
your variable is empty or not so I will
just say
so if not MD you see I have given this
not symbol here right so if this name
variable is not empty then and once
again I will just copy this two times
more and for age and the weight and if
name is not empty edge is not empty and
weight is not empty then I want to print
this okay I will just enclose it this
form now or this if condition and once
again when I try to run this hopefully
run once again reload pass it and say
some error yeah because this ket is
missing this M and symbol right and
symbol and simply save it once again go
back and hopefully this time it will
work so we see nothing here right
because we have submitted nothing as of
here
right but we are not able to see this
this please enter all fields we call I
think this else should move after this
so this s condition should be else
condition for this if condition other
than rather than this okay and once
again and query and it says please enter
all the values right but whenever we
provide some value for example name age
and weight and it prints the values okay
so when no value are printed or when no
value is submitted by form it says
please enter all the values and when we
enter of when we submit some values and
pass the query it prints the it prints
the name age and weight
you can also see the modification in the
URL which is done by PHP so in this way
you can use get variable in your PHP
script I hope you have enjoyed this
