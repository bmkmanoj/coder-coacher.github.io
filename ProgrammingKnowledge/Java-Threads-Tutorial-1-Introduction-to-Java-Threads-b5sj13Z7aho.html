introduction to threads in Java now what
are the objective of this course the
first objective is to give you the
overview of threads in Java and this
video is all about that in the next
video we will see how to create our
first application which uses threads and
we will get familiar with the Java
thread syntax and API and when we have
the knowledge of how to create threads
in Java we will move to little advanced
topics in Java threads like
multi-threading synchronization or
thread rules and some of the advanced
topics now first of all we need to know
the difference between multitasking and
multi-threading now what is multitasking
multitasking refers to the computer's
ability to perform multiple jobs
concurrently and one of the examples you
can say is your UNIX system or your
operating system itself so for example
your computer can run different
processes like you open Google Chrome
you open PDF viewer or you open some
presentation you want to see a video in
some media player so these are all
different processes and the ability of
your computer to handle these different
processes or different tasks is called
multitasking right now on the other hand
a thread is a single sequence of
execution within a program and we will
see what this means in the later slides
but I will give you an example of thread
for example your computer is running
some browser for example Google Chrome
and this is considered to be a process
so Google Chrome is a program
right now whenever you want to open
multiple tabs these tabs are working in
parallel right and to achieve that you
can say these tabs are working on the
treads right so a thread is a single
sequence of execution in a program so
you can say different tabs in your
browser are different threads and your
browser itself is a program so
multi-threading refers to multiple
threads of control within a single
program for example multiple tabs and
each program can run multiple threads of
control within it as I have given you an
example of this browser now what is the
difference between concurrency and
parallelism now consider you have one
CPU in your computer and you want to run
two processes
now how your CPU manages this is using
concurrency so your CPU allocates the
priority to the processes and whichever
process have the more priority at the
given time of interval it is executed
first so whenever your CPU have some you
know time to execute the second program
and it has the priority it runs the
second then the first then the second so
it utilized the full capacity of your
CPU now in the other case for example
you have two CPUs and you want to run
two processes you can run one process on
a single CPU right so process one on CPU
one and process two one CPU two and
these processors are independent of each
other so this in this case we can say
this is parallelism and this is
concurrency right now
two terms one is process and one is
thread and what is the difference
between threads and processes
once again I give you the example of the
CPU so you have single CPU and as I have
given you an example in earlier slides
your CPU can run different processes for
example process one is your PDF view or
some kind of PDF your process
two is your media player process three
is your browser for example google
chrome process for is some kind of
presentation is running on it right so
these are different processes running on
it so what is a process and executing
instance of a program is called process
so process one process to process three
and process four so these are the
executing instances of a program now a
thread is a subset of a process so for
example we take the process 3 which is
running Google Chrome and this process
can run different threads for example
different tabs are running on the basis
of different threads right so a single
process for example google chrome is
running different tabs for example
different threads right so a thread is a
subset of a process now threads shares
the address space of the process that
created it so processes have its own
address space so this process have its
own address space this process have its
own address space and other processes
also have their own address space but
multiple threads share the address space
of a process so different threads in
this process will share the address
space of this process right so this is
the difference between processes
and threads now there are threads good
for so there are different situation in
which threads are good so first of all
to maintain the responsiveness of the
application during a long-running task
so for example you write a program which
collects some data from some device and
you want to give this data on the basis
of requests from client for example
right so you want to collect the data in
parallel with the catering of the
clients request so in this situation you
can use threads right second is to
enable the cancellation of separable
tasks for example you are collecting
data with two devices and you no longer
want the data from one device so you
want to cancel this task right but you
don't want to you know cancel the task
which is collecting the data from the
first device right so you can cancel
this thread using you know some piece of
program or code right now the next is
some problems are inherently parallel so
you cannot do anything about this for
example I have given you the example of
tabs right you want to run two tabs or
two videos in two different tabs of your
browser and both are running in parallel
so how will your browser handle this you
it can create a thread for that right
next is to monitor the status of some
resource for example your database or
some API is and system demands it like
your swing applications in Java demands
it right so these are the situation in
which you can use threads now what is an
application thread so as we all know
that whenever our Java program is
created its run on the JVM which is Java
Virtual Machine right so whenever we
execute a java application the JVM which
is Java Virtual Machine creates a thread
object whose task is to define a main
method and it starts the thread as we
all know every Java program has at least
one main program and only one main
program so whenever you create or
whenever you execute this program your
JVM creates the threads whose task is to
define this mean method right now the
thread executes the statements of the
program one by one until the method
returns or this thread dies right now in
the last how we can create multiple
threads in our program so each thread
has its private runtime stack and if two
threads execute the same method each
will have its own copy of local variable
the method uses however all threads see
the same dynamic memory okay so two
different threads can act on the same
object and the same static field corn
currently now how we can create the
threads in Java this we will see in the
next video programmatically how we can
create the Java threads by writing some
program right but basically there are
two ways to create our own thread object
one is sub classing from the thread
class so there is a thread class in Java
and then instantiating the new object
of this class okay so sub classing from
a class called thread and we will
instantiate a new object of this class
and then we can create the thread or
otherwise there is an interface called
runnable so implementing this runnable
in interface will create a thread also
but in both cases we need to call this
method call run which should be
implemented right so this run should be
implemented in both cases and this is
what we are going to see in the next
video how we can create our first
program using threads so that's it for
this video I hope you will see the next
video also so please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
