video I have shown you how to retrieve
your image from the database SQLite
database so when you click the table it
will change your image all the
respective employee today I will show
you how to save the image with the help
of Save button so you don't have to go
to your database again and again and
save it save the images from there so
let's get started what you have to do
first this is my attach button which
whose poured on whose program I have
shown you in the forty-ninth video so if
you don't know the program go there and
see the program I right click it event
action and action platform and this code
I have written in that video so we just
see and copy that code here and I want
to do just one thing I will copy this
file name string final name because I
want to make it global so I will delete
string here and let it be here and I
will go at the bottom of my program and
in here after these declarations I will
declare my string file name and is equal
to null so my file name has become
global now so it will be like this will
convert into click green color so you
can understand it is a it has converted
into global variable one more thing
in here in the bottom you have to lick
lick two more will be variable one is
int s is equal to zero and bite
person underscore image is equal to null
so declare these two variables also and
the bottom so it will be nucleus as
global variable and just go to your
attach between actionperformed
and after your path dots at next
filename make a try-catch block so I
have already made my try-catch block in
order to save the time you have to make
this try-catch block and inside this
try-catch block you have to write pi
image is equal to nu pi and semicolon
close and just copy this file name
variable and paste it in here in the
brackets okay then right sorry
wait
by input
string which is f is equal to nu I will
copy it paste it here and make it rolled
and copy this image variable and paste
it in the bracket yeah so we have
declared a output stream which will
convert our image into binary stream and
then you provide byte array output
stream we will name it as u s is equal
to
new the same name lighter it on the
stream I get lost okay this is showing
some L let's see what does that cannot
find the symbol so I think I made some
spelling mistake here I think it is a
and also a
it's not tonight spelling let's see what
is the right spell so I think it's the
right spelling but I'm a missed some
imports so I will right click and click
picks imports yes
and now the error is gone so after this
you have to write white buf is equal to
mu by it and inside the square brackets
you have to write one zero to four
okay I think I have to guide the square
make it here also and then we will make
a for loop for condition now in the for
loop you have to write a condition here
in read num
then we come bracket right read num is
equal to F by s which we have declared
above dot lead and one more bracket and
inside bracket right both okay
and then after these brackets like which
is not equal to one so I think this is
our condition a semicolon also we don't
need here third condition so in here you
will just write V of S which is this
binary output stream square brackets bu
f which we have defined Y of UF and is
equal to MU oh sorry you have to write 0
s dot right right by this one so mu s
dot right buf comma this is 0 comma read
now
which is this valuable so in the for
loop you have to write this and outside
your try catch block you have to write
or copy your variable from here which is
white person image we have declared
initially copy this and go to your code
and after your try/catch block paste
your variable is equal to boss dot too
byte array like it and lick it close so
write this but our code is showing some
mistakes so I think we have to include
this code inside our try-catch blocks
why we do that
and yes the error is gone so you have to
write this code in order to convert your
image into the binary stream of array
and when you press attach button your
image will be converted into the bar
binary stream of array now in next video
I will show you how to attach it with
save action button perform because the
time for the video is over now so please
wait on see my next video and that I
will show you how to connect it with the
Save button so you will be able to do
press the Save button and save your
image by attaching your image so for
example
and I run the program I will attach any
image file anyone here
and then I will press the Save button my
image will be saved so yes all for now
this tutorial I will show for the save
action performing next tutorial so bye
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
