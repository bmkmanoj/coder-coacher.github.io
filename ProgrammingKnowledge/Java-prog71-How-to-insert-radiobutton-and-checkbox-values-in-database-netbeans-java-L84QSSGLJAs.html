tutorial I will show you how to add your
check box selection values into the
database so let's get started so what I
will do first is I will add one more
column to my database table I am using
SQLite you can also use whatever
database you want so what I'm doing is
I'm ending one column whose name is
gender and that is of care type and I
will press add column and press yes so
my column gender is added so in this
column I will add whether my employee is
male or female okay so go ahead and do
that and then come to your jframe go to
your source code and go to the bottom of
your program and below your these
declarations north you have to declare
one or two more variable right private
string and one the variable name is
gender sorry
gender so I have declared one variable
string called gender in here and then I
will go to my jframe I will right click
my meal radio button go to event action
action performed so whenever I click my
meal radio button my variable gender
should become me so what I have done is
I have assigned my variable gender a
value called meal so whenever I click
the radio button male the value is
assigned gender then the value s assign
me and whenever I click female so go to
your human radio button my click action
and action performed and once again we
go the same but this time I will assign
female value do it
okay
so I have assigned for meal ready but
the mean value and female radio button
female so I have done that and now I
will go to my design palette or jframe
and I will go why we click my Save
button sorry I will click this and this
is the method I have shown you earlier
how to save your data into the database
so in case if you don't know just see my
previous tutorial in which I have shown
you how to insert data into the database
with the help of the button so
right-click it event action action
performed and in here you reach to your
insert code which I have already shown
earlier so I have added one one more
column into my database so go to your
string SQL query string and I will add
here one more column called just
balanced in gender and in here after
values I will add one more question
marks mom so in case you don't know how
to insert values into the database go
and see my previous tutorial when I have
shown so what I am done is
one more column gender and I added one
more question mark in the values and in
here what I will do is I will write so
this is all the method for inserting
employee ID text names or name and
whatever age now I want to add my gender
so I would write the st dot set string
says string because my variable type of
gender is string variable i have divined
and bonnie and this is my sixth column i
want to insert in one two three four
five six and in here
you will copy your gender variable name
which you have assigned to these male
and female radio button so you will copy
this go to your save method and paste
here after your sixth column number
so you have done that and now we are
ready to run our program so let's
program
it's taking time I don't know why so
till now have 12 employees we can see
gender is also shown here one more
column is added we have ended it just a
few minutes ago and now I want to add
employee number 13 because I have 12
employees already why number 13 his name
is I don't know what his name is
told the surname is no his age is
whatever you want to select and he is a
meal for example and I will click Save
button
my daughter is saved and you can see my
boy number 13 is added and he is a male
so I have successfully added the gender
of my employee into the database for
example I will add one more employee my
number 14 this time his name is Adam his
name is Adam and his surname is Smith
his age is 20
okay I want to select a female named
Julie for example and she is a female
and I will click Save button
my daughter's saved and she is a female
so in this way you can use your radio
button to add data into your database so
this was a tutorial on the radio button
and databases I hope you have learned
something new today
