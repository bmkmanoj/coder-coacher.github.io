how to write a simple program to convert
text to speech using your visual basic
windows form application this will be a
very basic of converting text to speech
but like later on you can build upon
this application and make your bigger
application using this so what I will do
is I will take a button from here and I
will take a text box and I will change
the text of this button as speak okay
and now I will select this button and
double click it and in here I will
declare a dim object variable and I will
name it as sappy as object and now I
will use this sappy object to create an
object is equal to create object and in
the bracket I will pass a string so
write double quote and write sappy dot
SP voice okay and in the next line I
will write
sepi which is my object dot speak and
inside this and we copy the name of my
text box which is textbox 1 dot txt ok
so when I run my program now and when I
enter some text inside this text box so
for example I will write text-to-speech
and when I click this button it will
give me the output as a voice I don't
know if you can hear it but let me so it
converts the text-to-speech
application it's a demo of
text-to-speech application and it's a
very simple demo and you must be
wondering what this sappy is and what is
this SP voice so when you go to your
browser and just right here sepi visual
basic you will be able to see some links
of Microsoft so sepi is a project from
Microsoft which convert text to speech
and it has lot of capabilities you can
make a full-fledged text-to-speech
converter from this application you can
increase the volume you can pause the
the voice you can make your the reading
faster and many other application you
can make with this sappy object so if
you want to learn more just go to this
page and you will be able to see many
more code and many samples from here
also so this was just the basic which I
want to show you here and I wanted to
show you that this is the capability and
this thing also exists in visual
basic.net so I hope you will build upon
this application and make use in your
project so let's that's it for this
video please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
