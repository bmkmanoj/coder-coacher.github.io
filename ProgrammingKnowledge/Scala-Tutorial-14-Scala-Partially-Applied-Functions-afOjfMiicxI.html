Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn how to use partially
applied function in Scala so first of
all what are partially applied functions
but before understanding partially
applied functions we need to understand
how function works so when you invoke a
function for example this anonymous
function which have three arguments and
it gives us the addition of all three
numbers or integers you are said to be
applying the function to the arguments
okay so these are the arguments three
arguments and you are said to be
applying that function so this code to
these three arguments and when you use
this function like this so you use the
name of the function and then pass all
three arguments this kind of functions
are called fully applied function that
means you have applied all the arguments
to the function so this is called fully
applied function now what is a partially
applied function so in the same example
for example you just provide few
arguments let's say you provide just two
arguments and third you keep it as
default or a wild card some kind of a
wild card then it's called a partially
applied function so let's see how we can
use partially applied functions in Scala
so this is the normal usage of this some
function you just declare this function
some function and then you call this
function with all three arguments right
now what I do in between here is I will
declare one more function and let's say
this function name is F and then I just
call this some function and then I just
pass for example 10 as a first argument
and then 20 as a second argument and the
third argument I am going
keep it as a wild card in the last video
we have seen that we can use underscore
as a wild card right so just write
underscore and then colon and then
datatype of that argument okay so what
we have done is we have fixed first two
arguments here and the third argument we
said that we will just pass it whenever
we call this F function okay so now what
we can do here is we can call F function
instead of sum and because we have
already passed first two arguments in
the sum function when you just pass 30
in the F function then it will be
applied to this wild card okay
so let's save the code and run it and
let's see what's the result of this
function and you can see the result is
60 so first two arguments here are fixed
and the third argument we are
considering it as a wild card so this
whatever number we will pass here for
example I pass 100 here it will be
applied to this sum function and then it
will show the result in a similar way if
you want to just apply one argument and
pass two arguments as wild card you can
just write underscore colon and then int
for the second argument also and then
you can just pass two argument for the F
function so 100 and let's say 200 we
passed two arguments here and then run
the program and it gives us 310 which is
the sum of this this and this and this
is called partially applied function now
this was a very simple example now let's
say in a real world example you want to
log something so let's define one
another function here above the main
method so I'm going to define def log
and what we want to do here is we want
to log something now right so log
function generally we use to log some
messages in some situations so for
example if your code throws some error
we want to log something and we want to
know at which time this log is created
right or if you want to show some
information to the user of the code then
we use log or in the case of warnings or
some critical condition is happening in
your code then you can use a log
function right so what are the argument
we want to pass in the log function so
the first argument we want to pass is
the date so we want to print the date
and time at which this log is created
and the second argument will be the
message itself now to use date we need
to import the date library so just write
import Java dot util dot date okay this
is going to import the date library and
here the data type of date will be date
and the second argument here will be a
message let's say and the data type of
message will be the string and what it
does it just prints this log message
okay so what we want to write here is
print L N and then we want to just first
of all print that date first of all and
then plus and let's give some space
between date and message and then plus
message okay so what it does is this log
function just print the date first of
all and then prints the message so now
let's create a partial function out of
this log function okay so what we want
to pass into this log function first of
all we want to pass the date so we can
just define date first first of all and
then we will write new date which is
going to give us the date and then we
will just define a new variable
let's say the new variable name is Val
new log okay so new long is our new
function let's say and then we are going
to apply a log function here so log and
then we will apply date here first of
all and the second argument will be
partially applied so underscore colon
string okay so what we have done we have
created a new function new log and then
we have just assigned this log to this
new log and we have already applied one
argument to the log function but the
second argument is the wild-card here
okay so now what we can do here is we
can call new log and then we can just
give our message for example so let's
say message 1 let's say ok and then
let's run the code and it's going to
print first of all the date and time and
then our message now we can call this
new log message multiple times like this
and let's say message to here message 3
here and message 4 and then when we just
run the code is going to just print the
date first of all and then it's going to
print our message right now the date is
looking same because there is no delay
between these messages but in real-world
situations for example this message will
be logged at for example 20 to 24 15
second and for example the other message
can be logged at 16 second and 17 second
and 18 seconds so in real-life
situations this date is really
beneficial to know at what time this
message is logged okay so this is how we
can use partially applied functions in
Scala I hope you've enjoyed this video
