video I will show you how to use notify
icon with your C sharp windows form
application so let's get started first
of all go to your toolbox and take our
notify icon tool from here and drag and
drop into the form and you will notice
that it will not go directly into the
form but it will show up here okay so
now what I'm going to do is I will
select my form this whole form and I
will go to event this in the property
and go to events and then scroll down
and I will go to size change event and I
will just double click this side change
event double click and in here I will
write the code for the form size change
event so what is the meaning of size
change is when your form is running and
when you minimize or maximize your form
it is considered to be size change so I
want to show some notice as we can see
some of the applications shows notice
when you minimize or maximize them or
any other action when you perform they
show some message here in this section
of Windows so I want to show when I
minimize or maximize my form I the
notify ICANN should come here and it
should notify me that I have minimized
or maximized
my form so let's see what is the code
for that
so in this form size change even just
write this code so this all code is for
size change event so first of all give a
if condition and in this if condition
write this dot window state so when you
write this dot window state it checks
the state of the window if it's
maximized or minimized so this dot
windows tail state is equal to form
window state dot minimize so this is the
condition to check if the form is
minimized and if the form is minimized
we are going to show the notify icon so
right notify icon 1 which is the name of
my notify icon dot icon is equal to
system icon dot application so this will
show the icon here the notify icon okay
now in the second line once again the
name of your notify icon dot balloon tip
text so this is the type of notify icon
which will show up here I am taking
balloon tip text is equal to the text
you want to show so for example I am
showing your form has been minimized so
here the notification will come and it
will say your form has been minimized
and then once again the name of your
notify I can dot Show balloon tip and in
here just write thousand okay now this
is the condition form minimized
else if now this the other condition is
for checking if the form is in the
normal state or maximized state as we
see so right else if in the bracket
right this dot window state is equal to
form window state dot normal so if the
state of your form is normal and it's
opened then we are once again going to
show notify icon dot balloon DEP text is
equal to some message whatever you want
to show so in this case I am showing
your form has come back to normal okay
and in the next line right notify icon
one dot show balloon tip and in the
bracket right thousand so you just
provide these two conditions to show the
notification when you maximize and
minimize your form so let's try and run
the program so run and just see here
just when I minimize the form so I
minimize the form and it says your form
has been minimized okay and now I'm
maximizing my form it says your form has
come back to normal so in this way you
can use notify again one more thing you
can do is when you double-click this
notify icon this is the icon for eat the
notification okay so now I will show you
when you click this I I Tom what should
happen so right now you are clicking
this and nothing is happening and when
you also minimize it
and when you are clicking this icon
nothing happens you can also set this
icon also first of all let's see how to
set this icon so just close your
application and just select your form
and go to the properties and here search
for icon and just click here and you can
choose any picture or icon for your form
so right now I don't have any icon for
my form or any icon so I am NOT choosing
it but just for the information that you
can also choose the icon so I can means
this small picture you are seeing this
is called icon and it will be set here
also these are all icons okay so you can
choose icon for the form also now when
you click the notify I can what should
happen so just select your notify tool
notify icon tool and double-click it so
when you double-click your notify icon
my I want my form to come to the normal
state it means it should come to the
maximized state so right here this dot
window state is equal to once again
form
form window state dot normal okay and
just close this so when you click your
notify icon the form on which you are
working on will come to the no normal
state if it's minimized so let's see how
it works I'm running my program and I'm
minimizing my form now it is showing me
the notification here your form has been
minimized and when I click this notify
icon here so I click this notify icon
double click and my form comes to normal
okay once again minimized and I double
click this notify icon once again and it
comes to normal okay and you can also
change the properties of this notify
icon like if you want to change the text
like info and something else then you
can show and here you can also show info
icon or warning icon for example I
choose warning icon and you can also
show the balloon tip title or and
balloon tip text so just write any text
here and it will show there okay so for
example form one form one which is the
name of my form so I write here and now
I run the program
and when I minimize my icon you can see
the info icon comes here right and you
see that when I hover over this icon it
shows me the title info right and when I
once again maximize it shows me icon
once again and form title so in this way
you can play with this notify I can and
make your cool application I hope you
