tutorial on android app development for
beginners in this video we will see how
to use date picker dialog in android so
let's get started
first of all I'm going to take a button
and I'm going to change the text of this
button as show date picker dialog and
when I click this button the date picker
dialog will appear and we will be able
to select some date using the step time
picker and we can perform some action on
the basis of this day selected okay
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go to my Java folder and inside my
java folder I am going to go to my main
activity dot Java and in here I'm going
to declare first of all object of button
BTN and then I'm going to declare three
variables one for year one for month and
one for the day of the month so int year
X month X month should be month like
this and the day underscore X okay now
one variable more I'm going to declare
to hold the dialogue ID of our dialogue
okay so I'm going to declare us static
final int dialogue ID and I'm going to
initialize this dialogue ID by 0 okay
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go below a little bit and I'm going to
declare a method which I will call
inside my on create method so this
method will be a public method public
void and I will name it as show dialogue
method ok and inside my method first of
all I'm going to
cast my button so button which I have
declared above is equal to button find
view by ID r dot ID dot button okay now
I am going to take this button instance
or object and I'm going to call set on
click methods so BTN dot set on click
listener and inside this we will call a
new on click listener and inside this on
click method what we are going to do is
we are going to call our show dialog
which is a inbuilt method in you know
Android so let's little bit change this
method as show dialog on button click so
that we will not be confused by this
method which I'm going to right now
right now so show dialog and this takes
the ID of the dialog so we have declared
the dialog ID it should be dialogue ID
so I will just copy this dialogue ID
which we have declared and pass it here
okay now what I'm going to do is I will
create or I will call our on create
dialogue method which is our in build
method so I'm just going to just copy
this over write-protected void on create
just like this and just below I will
paste this and then on create dialogue
and then inside this on create dialogue
I'm going to write my code and I'm going
to give one argument to this on create
dialogue which will be an integer
ID and if this integer or and this
returns our dialogue right so we have to
return dialogue here instead of void
okay and now what I'm going to do is if
this ID or in on create dialogue is
equal to the dialogue ID which we have
defined then I am going to return a new
dialogue okay so new witch dialogue I'm
going to return a new date picker
dialogue okay so date picker dialogue
and it takes few arguments and let's do
alt enter so that it can fix our imports
and it takes few argument first is the
context second is the date picker
listener or date picker yeah you can say
listener and we are going to define our
date picker listener later let's give
the name to the state picker listener as
d picker listener for example okay and
then the other argument it takes is year
and then the month and then that day
okay and if this ID doesn't match our
dialogue ID I am going to return null
okay so if the ID does not matches I'm
going to return a null okay and now what
I'm going to do is here I'm
going to declare this variable which is
our date picker listener variable okay
so I'm going to declare a private member
private date picker dialog dot on dates
at listener and then this will be our
dates at listener is equal to new on
dates at listener it's going to
automatically create this method for us
when we enter press Enter key and just
don't remember to close this variable
here by semicolon and inside this you
can see I can see here it in the on date
set method arguments are here month of
the year and date of the month or day of
the month okay so what I can do is I can
assign so I have declared three variable
here X month X and DX right so I can use
or ask I can assign the value of year X
is equal to this here which is taken by
this that date picker dialog right in
the same way I'm going to take the value
of month X is equal to month of year
and I'm going to take the value of day X
is equal to day of the month okay and
now what I can do is I can display this
year month and day using a toast or
something other like text box or added
text or something like this right I'm
going to choose a toast so I'm going to
take this toast dot make text and it
takes first argument as the class
context or
context of this class itself so
mainactivity dot this and the second
argument is the text itself so I can
pass here first plus and then / then
month and then + / once again and then +
day X so it's going to show me the day
date comma the third argument toast dot
length short duration dot show okay now
what I can do is I can call this show
dialog on button click method so just
copy this show dialog which we have
created just copy this method and call
it inside your oncreate method here okay
and that's it our code is done so we can
run it I'm going to run my program so my
program is running now and I can see
this button and when I click this button
I will be able to see the date but the
date here whenever you select the date
it will not be the current date because
we haven't set any date to our date
picker dialog okay so what we can do is
we can set date to our date picker
dialog which is the current date by
using calendar class ok so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to my
code here and remember I have declared
your month and day variables right and
if somehow I can pass the current date
to these three variables I will be able
to see the current date in my date
picker dialog
so what you can do is you can go inside
your oncreate method and in here you can
create an instance of cleanser final
calendar Cal is equal to calendar dot
get instance and then I can use this Cal
to get the current year month and day
okay so I'm going to take the year is
equal to Cal dot get and inside this I
can take
Cal and we go back I will take calendar
this one dot here is going to give me
here and then in the same way I can pass
month also
so Cal dot get and Cal dot month
not much but dot month and the third
variable is day of the month so day is
equal to and I'm going to just copy this
and this should be dot day of month okay
in addition you need to do one more a
little thing here whenever you print
your date using your toast you can you
know get this month but by default month
start from zero here okay
so what you can do is you can add a one
to your month here and it will give you
the correct month ok and now I'm going
to run my program and my program is once
again running so I'm going
- click this and you can see the current
date and the year and month is showing
here today is 25th of March 2015 and I
can see and I can verify this date and
then when I click OK I will be able to
see this month date and year here ok so
in this way you can use date picker
dialog in your Android app I hope you
