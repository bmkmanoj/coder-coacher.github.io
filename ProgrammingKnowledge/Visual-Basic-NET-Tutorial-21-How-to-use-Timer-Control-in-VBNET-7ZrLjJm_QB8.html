video I will show you how to use timers
with your visual basic windows form
application so what is a timer generally
we use timer when you need to give some
interval to some function or some
procedure so for example you want to
show a message every 1 second or every
10 second you can use timer to execute
this or for example you need to increase
a value by 10 every 1 second then you
can use timer for that so let's see how
we can use timer in visual basic so I
will go to the tool box and I will
search for the timer and I will drag and
drop to my form and you will notice when
I drag and drop this timer to my form it
will go down here and not directly to
the forum because it's not a visible
tool it's a invisible tool right and now
for the demonstration I will take a
button actually I will take two buttons
and I will take a text box from here ok
now what I will do is I will change the
text of this first button as start timer
and the second button text as stop timer
and I will change the text of this text
box and I will give the value 1 here ok
and let me change the font size of this
button so we can see it better
ok this is the stop button and this is
the star
timer button and we have this text box
so I will change text box font
okay now we have start timer button stop
timer button and this text box and this
timer now first of all I will go to this
timer I will select this timer and in
this time word take event I will write
text box one which is the name of my
text box dot text is equal to once again
text box one plus one for example okay
so this means that whenever I add here
ba got the text okay so whenever I enter
something of any number in the text box
which is already there which is one it
will increase that number by one
whenever this timer ticks now we need to
start and stop the timer also right so
we have this button and here we will say
double click this button and we say
timer 1 which is our timer dot start and
if you don't know where this time of one
comes from just select this timer and
see the name of this timer its time of 1
right and same we will do for stop we
will say timer 1 dot stop ok so this
button
start the timer and this button click
stop the timer but how does the timer
know that after how many second or after
how much interval
it should take so let's see how we can
set this time time I in double just
select your timer and in the properties
you will see a property called timer
right so you can set the interval from
here now this interval is in
milliseconds so when you write 1000
milliseconds here it will tick your
timer by one second right so I have set
it here thousand milliseconds now I will
run the program to demonstrate and when
I start the timer it ticks and it
increases the value of the text box by
one every second right and when I stress
stop button it stops the timer once
again start the timer it starts and when
I stop the timer
with this button it stops so in this way
you can use timer with your usual basic
windows form application and in the next
video I will show you how to show real
date and time which is running every
second using this timer tool so stay
tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
