video I am going to teach you about md5
encryption in PHP now what is encryption
and why do we use encryption so I will
give you a little example in the last
three videos I have shown you how to
create this database and how to link
this MySQL database to your PHP and we
have created this table called user info
and in this table there are some column
called ID names her name age username
and password but when you see this data
for the password carefully you will see
that any user who have the access to my
PHP my admin login or MySQL login he
will be able to see all the password and
he will be having access to all the
password or all the user data in my
database right and this is not we want
or this is not the we desire right we
desire to protect our users data and the
password is the only way we can protect
it so we don't want to you know show
this password to the outside world and
we want to protect it and one way of
protecting this is by using encryption
and there are different kind of
encryption and one of the encryption is
called md5 right and what this md5
encryption does is it converts your
string into a hash value and it is a
one-way encryption so you cannot convert
this hash which is generated by a string
back to your original value but what you
can do is you can compare two hash let
me give you an example and then I will
move forward so you may understand for
example I create a variable called
password is equal to and I will give the
new to this variable password as a pass
for example this is my password right
now this is visible to all or the all
the users who have access to my database
for example now in order to protect it
what I can do is I can use a function in
PHP called md5 and this md5 is a
function which convert your text to or
convert your string to a hash value that
will pass this to my md5 as an argument
this string value as a argument to my
md5 function and let's echo this okay I
will save it and I will go to my md5 dot
PHP and what you can see is a kind of a
hash value okay and this value is you
know you cannot make it the reverse to
this pass you cannot convert this to the
original value which is pass right so
the only way is to you know compare or
to authenticate that this value is pass
or this word pass you need to generate
one more value using this and you can
match these two hash value and then
validate it okay so what you can do is
for example I will give a small little
example I will make a form outside my
PHP file and this form
we'll be for example have the action
which is md5 itself is equal to md5 M
the five dot pH pH P which is the same
pile as my this file right and the
method will be method is equal to let's
see what can be the method
let's take method as post okay and you
already know what this post does in PHP
in the earlier videos I have shown you
how to use this post and I will close
this form and I will take our input so
this input will be and this way input
will be text in type so type will be
type is equal to text and the name will
be for example password okay so name is
equal to password and I will give a
little break here and once again I will
submit this form using a button so now
input and type will be submit by B is
equal to and name you can give the name
as
so let's not give any name for example
ok let's see what is what is the result
of this form and we can see this simple
form and a button right and now what we
want to do is we want to compare this
password with this hash value which we
have right so let's copy this hash value
from here and let's for now just paste
it somewhere so that we can see this
afterwards right and then what we can do
is we can just compare this by using if
this value both password is set and this
is a post so we can just use post
underscore post to and this will be a
post third and what it takes it takes
the name of your submitted form right so
in the square brackets you can just pass
this password and you can also check
whether this is empty or not so and my
password is not empty empty and we'll
just take this post and paste it here
okay
and if it's not empty and it is set what
I can do is I can compare this by my
hash value right so I can say if my md5
hash which generated the hash right is
equal to or my password value so let's
transfer this password value to a
variable password is equal to post
password which is this variable and then
what we can do is we can just compare
this password with our password okay and
let's rename it as because we have
already used this password variable
above so let's swing in a else new
password you want the score password for
example okay and if it's matching then
we can just display password pass okay
okay and this is set must be like this
and let's save it and run our program
md5 and I think it will not give a
correct answer I will submit it and it's
not giving the correct answer why
because this pass must be converted to
hash value first right so we need to
convert this to md5 md5 and then
then here are we just close this and
let's give else condition also else we
want to echo pass not okay not okay okay
save it refresh the page or what we can
do is we can just give this pass once
again submit this and it shows some
error let's see what's the error
let's choose these predicates first of
all and this should be md5 of ma5 okay
refresh the page and once again give
pass for example which is this one pass
value submit and you can see pass okay
that means your password is okay so what
we have practically done is we converted
our password to a hash and this hash we
match to the value of password which is
entered by us right which is this
password and we converted this password
into hash also and we have this password
hash from this okay so we compare both
the hashes of both the values and if it
matches then the password is correct
otherwise the password is wrong so in a
way we get we are comparing the hash of
our string values to check the password
right so whenever you will use this in
real life situation this password will
be some kind of a hash value and once
somebody has the access to this table he
will not be able to see this password
directly but he will be able to see the
hash value like this okay
and this hash value only matches a
single string okay
for example this pass is converted to
this hash and this hash cannot match any
other value or any other string right
only pass has the hash of this kind okay
so this is unique for every word and
this is one direction encryption so you
cannot revert this but you neck cannot
get this string from this hash what you
can do is you can compare the this hash
with other hash and if those two hash
are you know equal then you can say your
password is correct right so this is how
you can use md5 encryption in PHP but
this is not I mean one of the best a
best way of encryption by using rule
because nowadays we have super computers
and by using brute force you can always
you know get the password which is
generated by md5 function so they are
better way of you know hiding your data
but this is one of the way or you know
which you can use and which is at least
better than this showing your real
password to the world you can just
convert it to the hash and then save it
to the database so maybe in the next
video I will show you how you can save
this into I mean in the database and
then use this hash from the database to
create a login page okay so I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
