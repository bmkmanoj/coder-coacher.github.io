tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what is Java why do we care about
learning Java and if time permits or we
will also see how we can install Java in
our Windows operating system so what is
Java Java is a high-level programming
language which was developed by Sun
Microsystems in early 90s so as any
other high-level programming language
like C sharp or C++ Java is also a
high-level language but it's a little
bit different from other languages in a
sense that it's a cross-platform
programming language which you can
develop and run on multiple operating
system like Windows Linux and Mac OS or
any other operating system and it runs
its program using a special virtual
machine called java virtual machine
which is this one so this Java machine
is responsible for running Java programs
and whenever you install Java on your
operating system like Windows or Linux
you also install this Java Virtual
Machine and this java virtual machine is
same for every you know operating system
so your program runs on this java
virtual machine and not on the native
you know Windows or Linux operating
system so this Java Virtual Machine is
same for every operating system that's
why it's it runs on every operating
system which Java supports right so if
you compile a Java program on Windows
you can run it on Linux or Mac OS using
this java virtual machine that's why
before developing java we
or need to install Java JDK and JRE on
our operating system okay and Java is a
object-oriented programming language so
we will see what object-oriented
programming is and what are the features
of object object over into programming
but yeah it's object-oriented
programming and we'll teach you more
about the programming we will see what
is this so now first of all we need to
install Java on our system and it may be
possible that Java is already installed
on your system or it may be possible
that you have never installed Java on
your system so how to check whether Java
is installed on your system it's easy so
you just need to if you are on Windows 8
you just need to right click your Start
menu button and open command prompt from
here and in here you just need to give
this command Java C ok so give this
command Java C and press Enter
and if this command response that Java C
is not recognized as an internal or
external command then Java is most
probably not installed in your system
and you need to install Java on your
system ok so like my operating system I
don't have Java so I will install it so
just open your browser and just search
for java jdk or simply Java also works
and in here the first side will open
hopefully from oracle.com
just click this link and in here you
will be able to see two options one is
Java JDK
other is NetBeans with J Deakin so Java
is you know the the platform and
NetBeans IDE
and you have the option to install Java
with this development IDE but I will not
choose this option but I will choose
this option for now and at the time of
making this video Java 8 is the latest
version because yeah it's the latest
version right and when you click this
Java button here so once again Java
button I clicked in here you need to
accept this license end and condition in
order to download this Java so just
click this small radio button which
calls accept license agreement and then
choose your operating system so my
operating system is Windows 64 if you
have windows 32-bit operating system you
need to choose x86 but right now I have
x64 operating system which is 64-bit
operating system that you can check if
you are on Windows 8 you just need to go
to systems so search for systems not
like this but systems system and in here
I can see that my system type is 64-bit
operating system so if it's 60 32-bit
operating system you need to download
32-bit executable file so mine is 64-bit
so I will just click the 64-bit link and
I will save this so it will take some
time to download this Java executable so
once this will be downloaded we will be
ready to execute this executable and
install Java so my download is complete
now so I will run this executable file
and I will minimize all the other things
and this installation is really
straightforward so you just need to
click Next and we check the status and
all and then it will start installing
Java on your system and
it's really straightforward so you don't
need to worry about anything while you
are installing Java and while installing
it will ask you the destination folder
where ever you want to install Java on
your system and JRE on your system JRE
stands for Java runtime environment and
JDK stands for Java development kit so
these are the two things which will be
installed by this Installer so I will
generate and leave them as default and I
will click Next
and then wait for the installation to
complete so now Java is successfully
installed in our system you will be able
to see this message and then I will
close this and once you install Java you
can check it while going to the C folder
of your computer and then go to Program
Files and in here you will be able to
see this Java folder and in here you
will be able to see two folders one is
JDK folder and the other is JRE folder
okay so JDK I already told you is Java
development kit and JRE is Java runtime
environment right so I will change the
name of these JDK and JRE to you know
make them short and really easy to you
know understand so I will rename my JDK
folder as JDK 8 okay so it's just JDK 8
and I will rename my JRE folder as JRE 8
because the version of this Java is Java
8 ok and here I can just make them view
as large icon so you can see or
extra-large so you can see that I have
named this as JDK 8 and GRE 8 folders
right so once you have
I've done that you need to set your
environment variables so that whenever
you run your Java program it will
recognize these JDK and JRE and then you
will be able to compile your programs
right so for that for setting your
environment variable what you need to do
is we just need to go to your systems so
go to search and search for system once
again if you are on Windows 7 or Windows
XP we also need to search for system in
control panel and then go to advanced
settings and in here go to environment
variables ok and invite an environment
variable in system variable here you
will be able to find a variable called
path you just need to click or double
click this path or add it or click this
Add button and in here you will be able
to see variable name is equal to path
and the variable values there will be
already some values in here and you need
to add some more value here which is the
JDK so go to once again program file and
Java folder wherever you have installed
it and then go to JDK 8 which is the
folder vini renamed and in here inside
this JDK 8 go to bin folder and this
destination which is C program file Java
slash JDK 8 slash bin you just need to
copy this path from here and then in
your variable value just give a
semicolon and paste your path which is
the same path you have copied from here
right once again go to your Java folder
once again and then this time go to JRE
ok and in here also you will be able to
find a binary folder bin folder and then
copy the
part from here and then give semicolon
to your variable value whatever value is
present already here and paste this path
also okay so you need to give this C
program file slash Java slash GRE eight
slash bin folder and C program files /
Java slash JDK eight slash bin folder
path here in environment variable and
why do we set environment variable is
whenever you compile a program whenever
you compile a program if you set
environment variable your compiler knows
the path of these binary files which are
responsible for compiling your program
and it will be straightforward to
compile your program now once you have
done set your environment variable we
will open once again command prompt and
check whether Java is really installed
in our system or not so it once again
give Java C and press ENTER and this
time I can see a big you know response
in response to my Java C command and I
can see that it's saying that the uses
of this Java C is you need to give some
options and source file so Java C is a
command to compile a program or Java
program so whenever you give a Java C -
some HelloWorld dot Java file it will
compile or Java program and then you can
run your Java program right that's why
we use this Java C command so in this
way you can install Java on your system
now in the next video I am going to show
you how you can install an IDE which is
called Eclipse IDE which is widely used
to develop Java programs so stay tuned
