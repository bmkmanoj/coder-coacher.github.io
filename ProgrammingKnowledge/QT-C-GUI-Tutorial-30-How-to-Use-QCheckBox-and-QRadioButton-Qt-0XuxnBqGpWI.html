video I will show you how to use radio
buttons and checkboxes with your cutie
GUI C++ application and I will also show
you what if difference between radio
buttons and checkboxes so let me give
you an example so let me build my
example first and then I will illustrate
my example I will take two group boxes
in my window
and resize it and first group box name I
will change it as the title of my group
box as age and second group box title as
likes okay and now once again I will go
to my widget box or toolbox and I will
take some radio buttons and drag and
drop into the age group box so inside
this age group box and I will pick up
some check boxes and drag and drop
inside my like group box and I will
change the title of this radio button as
above 18 and second radio button as
below 18 okay so this is the title of
the check box and likes maybe movies and
sports food for example so now I have
the check boxes with age ages radio
button and the check boxes with the
likes okay now how can we use this radio
button and checkboxes so first of all
let me demonstrate what is the
difference between these two when I run
my program so inside this groov box when
you take these check boxes and radio
buttons you can see the behavior of this
radio button you can only choose one
option at a time inside this group box
but when it comes to checkboxes you can
select multiple checkboxes even if they
are in the group box so this this is the
basic difference the radio button are
used when you need to choose only one
option out of many and the checkboxes we
generally use when you need to check
some multiple options right so this is
the basics difference and now let's use
them so I will take push buttons here
and I will just go to the push button
slot and go to the click event of this
push button and here I will write if UI
radio button is clicked then what I will
do is I will show a message box saying
that age is above 18 so I will right
bitches so I will just paste the code of
message box and say this is age message
box and the comment is age is above 18
okay
and if my second radio button is clicked
then I will say age is below 18 and this
is radio button - so this is for radio
buttons and now once again I will go to
my UI and I will select this push button
and go to slots and click OK and I will
copy the same code here and I will just
change the checkbox so instead of radio
button I will just write UI checkbox and
you H Xbox 2 and UN checkbox 3 and then
what was my items movie sports and food
okay so you go to my code first and here
I will write likes with K and here also
likes and like and I'll say first of all
movies sports and food okay
when I run the program it's showing me
some error so let's see what is the
error here okay so this is saying that
radio button 2 is not a member of this
UI so let's see what is the name of our
radio button it's radio button
underscore - ok and here also we need to
add underscore because our name of the
checkboxes combobox
underscore
- and comm box on the score three now
when I run the program hopefully it runs
okay and for example first of all I want
to check check age so age cannot be
multiple right it can be either above 18
or below it you know whatever so for
example I click above 18 and click the
push button and it says ages above 18
but likes can be multiple so a person
can like movies sports food at the same
time so when I check all these things
and when I click this push button it
says likes movie like sports like food
and when I uncheck either of them then
likes are only movies and when I check
two of them like some movies and sports
but here I can check only one of them
right this is the basic difference and
in this way you can use combo box and
check boxes with your QT GUI C++
application I hope you have enjoyed this
