you how to use timers with your visual
basic windows form application in this
video I will show you how to show
running current date and time with your
visual basic windows form application
using the timers so let's get started
first of all I will take a label from my
tool box and I will yeah I just need a
label and let me change the font size of
these this label and let's make it a
little bit bigger okay so I have a label
and I will change the text as date time
it doesn't matter what if the text on it
because we are going to change the step
text okay so now we have the label and
we will take our timer from our tool box
and drag and drop into the form and it
will go here and now what we are going
to do is we will just select our our
form as a whole and double click it and
that leads us to the form load event
okay and in here we will write timer
time of 1 which is the name of our timer
dot enable is equal to
true okay so when our four form loads we
want to be a thus the one that our timer
should be enabled right and now what I'm
going to do is I am going to select this
timer and double click it and in here in
this timer take event I will write the
name of my label which is label one dot
text is equal to date dot now dot two
string okay
and in this string parenthesis we are
going to pass some argument to show the
date and time so here we will pass the
format of date and time we want so this
can be decided by you for example I want
to show the date as day - the month of
the year so mm capital mm for month
- here so here for showing here you you
can show it in two digit or four digit I
am going to show it in four digit and
now for the real time I must give the
hours so hh4 hours and w cool minute
small M for minutes or small mm and then
the second so small SS for the seconds
now you can also change the interval of
time to the tick of the time so select
your timer and make it thousand
milliseconds which is one second and now
when I run the program
you see my timer is ticking
and it's showing the current date and
current time which is running time and
you can also change the format of this
date and time according to your custom
string for example I want to show the
month in 3 values for example so you
just write month and here I instead of
this - I don't want to show I want to
show spaces right so now when I run the
program it shows a little different
date date is same but the format is
change right so we can customize our
time and date format according to
ourselves
just remember the day takes DD M month
takes capital mm here takes small Y
overtakes double-edge smaller minutes
takes smaller m m and seconds take
smaller SS right so now you have running
digital clock with your visual basic
windows form application I hope you have
