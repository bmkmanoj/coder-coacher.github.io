tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video we will see how string
works in C and what is a string now what
is a string first a string is a single
dimensional array of characters which is
terminated by a null character now let's
see how we can declare string in array
and then we will look this definition
once again so what I have said a
character array so character array you
can declare it like this care and for
example my string this should be string
and then character array so square
bracket for example we define the size
of this this RA as 6 is equal to and
here comes these curly braces and inside
these curly brackets braces you can
define the initialization to these
characters right or you can do something
like this
ok so this is called a string once again
the definition a string is a array of
character so this is the array of
characters which is null terminated so
in this slash 0 and C is called
null-terminated character okay and so
this hello is the string and our string
is terminated by this null character
that is why we are saying our string as
null-terminated character array right in
other terms you can define a string with
a character array of
non definite size for example care my
other string and we give our array a non
definite size which is not defined and
you can just write something like this
and it's also totally valid okay so you
can define string in two ways in C one
is like definite sized array and you can
initialize it like this or undef init
sized array of characters and you can
initialize it like this now to print
these string we can just use printf not
this part printf and i can just print my
string so i can write my string value is
equal to percentage s so here we are
using percentage as to print string
right and comma we will just use this
variable and let us see what is the
value of this variable and let's give a
line break to the message we are
printing so that we can print in the
next line the next message and in here
we will just write my other string value
and we will print this second variable
like this okay and let's compile and run
the program and it's printing the same
value right my string value is equal to
hello my other string value is equal to
also hello right so in this way you can
define string in array now there is a
header file in C called
string which you can add to
- your main dot see and then you can use
some function from this header file and
you can perform some different
functionality using this header file so
first of all we will include this header
file in our C main dot C file so just
include and then we will add string or
string dot H right so this is the header
file in C which we can use to perform
different functionality with string okay
now the first function from this string
dot H we are going to use is string copy
as TR c P Y okay this is this function
and this function what it does is it
enables us to copy one string to another
okay so for example we have a string of
some size for example let us say we have
a string so string
string1 for example and we give this
array or size of 4 12 and let's delete
for this for now
and then we will declare in a same
manner string 2 of size 12 and I will
tell you why I am taking the size as 12
okay
in a moment and we will declare a third
string it's also of size 12 but we are
not initializing it okay this should be
string 3 ok and now using this string
dot H had had the file we can use this
function called string c py and it takes
two argument one is the destination and
one is the source ok so for example we
want to copy this should be for example
let's change this to world
ok so for example I want to copy string
1 to strength 3 so this string copy
function copies string 1 string 3 in
this way so you just write or you just
take a variable in which you want to
copy first as a first argument of STR
copy and then you take the second
argument this second argument is the
variable whose value you want to copy
okay so in other other word you can just
think like this as TRC py and it's used
to copy to be est which is destination
from source
source this should be source okay so to
the destination from source the source
is string one from which we want to copy
and destination is string three and to
which we want to copy okay now there is
another function in string dot H header
file which is called string cat st r c8
t and this function allows us to
concatenate two strings for example we
want to concatenate this first string
and 2nd string we can concatenate it
like this so just take a first string
comma 2nd string okay so we want to
concatenate 1st string and just after
that you want to join 2nd string to it
you can do it like this ok and when you
hover over this what it says this says
that this also can return some value
okay so what's this string cat basically
doing is its adding string to 2 string 1
ok
so add string to 2 string 1 it should be
like this string to 2 string 1 ok now
there is a another function in C in this
header called s TR L e n and this gives
you the length of the string
okay so for example you want to get the
length of the string length means number
of character or size of this character
or a for example right so we will do
this also and this we will save in
another variable for example we name
this variable as integer length in
length string 1 is equal to okay so this
STR length returns the string of the
variable which you pass it as an
argument let's try to print all these
values so first of all print F and this
is the result of string copy we want to
print form now for example string copy
is equal to and percentage F put the
percentage s and then we will just see
the value of this string 3 because it we
are copying in to string 3 from string 1
using this function now in the same way
let us change the line here in the same
way we will see how this string cat
works and we will see the value of
string 1 because we are adding string 2
to string 1 so let us see the value of
string 1 and we will also see the length
so we will also see something like this
so we will also verify this STR le N and
this will be verified by this but this
is the integer so we will write
percentage D here let us try to compile
the program and run it and it says
first of all the string three value is
hello which is true because we are copy
we have successfully copied the value
hello to string three okay so this is
printing hello now second string STR cat
have concatenate of a concatenated of a
first string and second string which is
hello world so it has added a second
string to the first string the third
well new blue turns us 10 why it's
returning time because now our string
one has a size of 10 because it's hello
world one two three four five four hello
and one two three four five forward so
string size is hello world now for
example we want to see the size of
string three it should be 5 because it
only contains hello in it right
compile it and it says 5 because the
size of string 3 is a tll Oh which is 1
2 3 4 5 characters that's why it's
showing 5 here ok there are other
functions in this header file for
example string compare or some other
functions for example you want to
compare two strings you can use STR cmp
and this compares the two strings so
follow this string dot H file is a very
important header whenever you are
working with string files I hope you
