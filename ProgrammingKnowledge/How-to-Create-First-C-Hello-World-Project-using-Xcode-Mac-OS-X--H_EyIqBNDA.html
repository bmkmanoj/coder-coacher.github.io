you how you can create your first C++
HelloWorld program using Xcode so let's
get started and let's see how we can
create our first C++ project using Xcode
and then I'm going to show you how you
can compile and run your C++ project so
first of all open your Xcode and then we
are going to create a new Xcode project
so click on this option which says
create a new Xcode project this is going
to open this kind of interface to you
now on the top when you see you will be
able to see iOS and watch OS TV OS Mac
OS so what we want is we want to open
this tab which is for Mac OS so just
select Mac OS from the top here and then
you will be able to see these options
here now for c++ we are going to create
a command line tool or command line
program so you need to select this
option with this command line tool okay
so Mac OS and then select command line
tool and then click Next and now you
just need to give the name for your
project so for example on creating a
hello world project so I'm going to name
my project as HelloWorld
and then you don't have any team right
now so I'm going to leave it as default
and organization name also I am going to
leave it as default and now at the
bottom you will be able to see the
language so this is important steps you
just need to select C++ here okay so
because we are creating a C++ program so
we need to select C++ here and now we
need to give the organization identifier
so just hover over the organization
identifier and you can see what this
means so this means your organisation's
bundled identifier key fix I think so
for a for now I'm just giving CPP here
you can give anything any name here as a
prefix for now I'm just giving CPP okay
you can give any identifier here as you
wish now I'm going to click Next
and now you just need to give the
directory in which you want to save your
project so you can create a new
directory for this or you can just save
it wherever you want so for example I
want to save this project on the desktop
and I'm going to create a new folder
here and I'm going to name my folder as
CPP okay and then I'm going to create
this directory and then select this
directory and then just click create and
this is going to be saved in my desktop
on C++ or cpp directory okay now I can
see this warning which is not very
important but anyway this says Xcode
would like to access your context and I
will just say don't allow for now and
then I will just say okay okay and now
this project hello world is created for
me and in this hello world project there
is a folder called hello world which we
have created which is the name of our
project and then there is one main dot
CPP file so I'm going to just double
click on this main dot CPP and you can
see there is some program here so I can
just close it for now and you can see
it's there also the same program is
there also so when you double-click on
the CPP file is going to open in the
another tab and if you single click on
this main dot CPP is going to show you
a file inside your Xcode editor right
now here Xcode is intelligent enough and
it's going to create a sample HelloWorld
program for you right so I'm going to
explain now what this code is so the
first line of code or whenever you see
this line of code these are the comments
here so whatever which starts with
double forward slash is determined and
this is not the part of the code it's so
it's just for some information giving
some information about the code right so
you can even ignore these comments for
now or you can give these comments it's
on you
right so comments are just the way to
provide the information about your code
now the first line here is to include
iostream library which is a built-in
library which is used to you know
provide you these method for example
this namespace STD and for example this
c out method inside STD right so if you
remove this library include then this
code will not work right now this is the
main entry point for your C++ program so
the main method so here you see int main
and then in the brackets some argument
for the main for now for printing
HelloWorld you don't even need this but
Xcode will you know provide you the
proper implementation of main methods so
you I will leave it as default but main
method is the main entry point for your
code right and then STD colon colon see
out is used to print some text so after
STB see out you just give
these angle bracket double angle
brackets towards the text and then you
can just write whatever you want to
print so for example once again I just
want to print hello world so I will just
fix this for the world and remove the
comma and then just save the code and
once you are done with the code you need
to compile your code okay so how you can
compile your code to compile your code
you just need to go to the product tab
here and then you can see the build
option here so you can just click this
option which is build and then it's
going to build your program and to run
it once again go to product and then
click on the run and then you click run
then it's going to once again build the
program and then print the output on
this console here which is hello world
right now there is another option to run
your code and this option is this one
which is like a triangle here triangle
icon you can just click it and it's
going to build your program and it's
going to run your program and show the
output once again right you can just
modify this
hello words so for example this is my
first CPP project right and then I'm
going to save this and then I'm going to
build this program and now it's going to
print the same text which I have written
there so you can see the same text is
printed so in this way you can create
your first C++ project on Xcode I hope
