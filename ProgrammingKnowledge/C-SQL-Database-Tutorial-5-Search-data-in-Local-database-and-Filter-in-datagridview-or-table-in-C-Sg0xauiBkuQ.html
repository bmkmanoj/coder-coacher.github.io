we have our application in which we have
connected to the local database with our
c-sharp windows form application and in
this video I will show you how to add a
search option to your application so I'm
going to add a new text box and the
button so whenever you enter some name
or on the basis of whatever column you
want to search and when you press the
button it will filter all the data and
it will show you the result which you
enter in the search text box so let's
get started just select your table or
data grid view from here and you will be
able to see a small arrow at the top of
your data grid view at the right-hand
side top so just click it and just
select add query from here so for
searching the data we need to add a
query so that we can pass the query and
filter the data on the basis of query
you can do it in two ways you can
directly write a query from here or you
can use a query builder to build your
query so I'm going to use the second
option and I will use the query builder
and for example I want to search on the
basis of name all the data so first of
all I will give the name of my query so
I will write search name query or
whatever you want to give the name of
the query and then I will click this
query builder and because I want to
search on the basis of name so I will
select this name row from here and I
will go to this filter column in the
name row and I will write a query here
so here I will write like and then space
and then I will write at the rate and
then the name of the column which is
name and then right plus and then space
single quote and this person sign and
then single quote okay so my query looks
like this I will show you like space at
the rate and then the column name on the
basis of you are searching so this is
name here plus space single quote
percent and single quote okay now let's
try and check if this query we have
written is working or not so just go
this go to this execute query button and
if you see this dialog box then your
query will work so for example I want to
search the name mark in my database so i
will write mark here and i will say okay
and it will search for mark and it will
show the result here and if you are able
to see some result which is there in
your database then you your query is
executed successfully so just click OK
and ok it will generate automatically
some code for you so you see here it has
generated a label a text box and a
button front for you okay and you can
change the text of this button or you
can change the name of a name or text of
this label also so you can change the
properties of these things or these
tools or you can add your new tools from
here also ok and now when you run the
program you can just filter your
daughter so what you can do is for
example I want to search for this name
Julie
all right and I will just click this
search name button and you can see it's
searching for the data right so in this
way you can search the data in your
database there is one more thing you if
you don't want this auto generated code
what you can do is you can take a button
and you can take a text box and you can
perform the same option like this so
button and a text box just I will change
the text of this button and I will leave
the name of this text box as text box
one here so first of all I will click
this auto-generated button which was
generated automatically when we have
written the query and I will copy all
the code inside this search name tool
strip button click event and once again
I will go to the design and I will
select this button this time which we
have taken from the toolbox and double
click it and I will paste the same code
inside this button click event but one
thing you need to change is the name of
the text box here this text box was this
is the name of this text box but now we
want to change this text box to this
text box which is taken by us from the
toolbox so just copy the name of this
text box and replace it replace it here
okay so you have replaced name of the
text box so whenever you write something
in this text box now you will be able to
search the data in the same way so I
will run
program and once again I am search for
Julie and press the Search button and
you see here you will be able to see the
filter data here also and you will be
able to see this filtered data here in
the text boxes also so I hope you have
enjoyed this video and learned something
new this time please keep watching these
videos and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
