last video I have shown you how to use
CSS with your HTML code and I have given
you some example by which you can style
your web page now in this video I will
show you what is box model in CSS so I
have a basic body of HTML head and this
style I have shown you in the last video
and I deleted all the style code between
this and what I have right now is I have
the image tag in from which I am showing
the image this I have shown you in the
previous videos how to show the images
and I have the dev tag this is new dev
tag is a division of something so dev
tag divides your whatever inside this
from the other code so this is division
tag so this you can use also for
dividing one tag from other tank now I
am showing the HTM this HTML dot PNG
file and this dev paragraph for example
so just save it and run the code and my
code looks like this so only the image
and this sentence now I want to show
this div tag whatever this content in in
the tag I want to give some padding or
margin to this tag so what is padding
margin or all this so this you can
imagine as a content of your
tag or this is a box if you can imagine
this content as a box I will make it
easier to imagine so this is the content
in which your dev tag is there so this
is the div tag and what you will provide
is this padding this padding gives some
space around your tags or your box and
the border this is the border
so after border comes after padding
comes the border and after border comes
the margin so you you can style your
content like this also you can provide
the padding to your content you can
provide the border to your content and
you can provide margin also to your
content so how can you provide these
things with the help of your CSS code I
will show you so first of all in this
style tag you want to provide this style
to our div tag right so here you will
write
dip which is this dip and dot the name
of the class you can class give in the
name of the class as I am anything
for example e^x and give space and these
curly braces and you can give the space
here also right and to this deep content
I want to provide the margin the padding
and what was the other thing border
yeah margin border and padding to this
div content so what I will do here is
inside this property class or your style
class this one the inside these brackets
just write this so you are providing the
bit to your div tag width is for example
220 pixel you're providing padding to
your div tag which is 10 pixels you're
providing border to your tip tag which
is 5 pixels solid gray border so this
also a here you are seeing that you can
provide the property and the value and
you can provide more than one values at
the same time by separating them with
her space so 5 pixel border is solid and
border is gray ok so these three values
to one property you can provide a tough
time and margin I want to provide first
I want don't want to provide any margin
and after running this code we will
provide some margin to the code so just
save it
and run the cord and it doesn't look
like anything is not happened I think
why we see here yes because we haven't
provided this class to this div so what
do you need to do is just make a space
in this dev tag and the right class is
equal to double quotes and your name of
the class which is e^x right so give the
name here and now save the program and
now let's see yes it has provided the
margin - you're not a margin margin was
zero but the border do your div content
the padding to your dev content and now
let's provide some margin also so margin
for example you want to provide 10 now
how it looks like let's see I will just
refresh this page and if you can see
here on the left hand side there is a
margin this from this border to this
corner there is a margin so this is the
margin we have provided let's increase
this margin to 50 then it will be more
visible so 50 save and run once again
now you can clearly say that there is a
margin to the left side right so in this
way you can use a box model of CSS with
your HTML code and this will be helpful
for when you are designing your code and
you want to provide different blocks to
your web page so I hope you have enjoyed
