Linux command line to troll for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how to create users in Linux using
command line now in this video I am
going to show you how you can really
move users using command line terminal
so first of all let's see whatever users
we have so I am going to just give a
less and then /home and you can see here
we have three users one is mark one is
my username and other is tom so in order
to remove a user what we do is we use a
command called user del ok so this is
the command to delete users and then
whatever name you will give for example
I want to remove this user called mark
so I will just use the user name mark
right and then you need to use a root
permission so you use sudo before this
command so just write sudo userdel
command and then the user name you want
to delete right and I am going to press
enter here then I am going to give my
password and press enter and once again
I will see if the user is deleted or not
so I will just Alice and /home now you
will observe even if you have given this
command user del which is used to delete
the user the home directory for this
user is not deleted right so what this
command is doing is its going to delete
the user name the password and other
data for the user but it's not going to
delete the home directory for the user
and it's also important some time
because for example our employee resigns
from a company who have a account on a
Linux operating system for example of
that company and then he resigns and for
example administrator wants to delete
his username but wants to keep his data
whatever he work he has done
right so this command is used to delete
the user so the user is deleted but the
data home directory is still here right
so this command is used to delete the
user but the home directory will not be
deleted but it's also really easy to
remove the home directory as well as the
user and for this you just need to use
sudo and then the command userdel and
also the name of the user so for example
this time we want to remove the user
point Tom so I'm going to just write the
name Tom and you need to use the flag -
are with this in order to remove the
home directory also right so this home
directory will also be deleted if you
use this - our flag with this come on
and I'm going to press enter and you can
see it shows that Tom mails pool not
found so we haven't even created the any
mail spoon for this user
so this warning is okay it's you know
not important in our case right then
let's go to the home directory once
again and let's see what's there and you
can see home directory is also deleted
and the username and you know all the
data for the user
tom is deleted so if you want to delete
the user and also the home directory of
the user then use - our flag with
userdel' command otherwise use userdel'
with the username right now for example
we want to remove this home directory
for the user how we can do it so it's
also really simple but be careful with
this command so just write sudo RM so
remember we have learned remove command
or RM command right so we will use this
command so RM minus R and then power
slash home and forward slash the user
name right but I once again tell you
that you need to be careful with this
command because it's going to remove all
the data of this user or otherwise if
you type you know wrong then it can
remove the data from the other user also
so be careful with this command right
and press Enter
once again we will list all the users
and now this is also removed right so in
this way you can remove user using Linux
command line terminal I hope you've
