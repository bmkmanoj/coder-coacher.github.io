show you how you can install Android SDK
on your Ubuntu operating system so let's
download Android SDK get first so just
write in your favorite search engine
Android SDK and search for it and the
first link you will find here is
developer.android.com slash sdk slash
index dot HTML just click this link here
and you will see here different flavors
of Android SDK bundles it's available
for windows 32-bit windows 64-bit Mac OS
Linux 32-bit and Linux 64-bit and one we
are interested is in a Linux 32-bit
because I have 32-bit OS type that is
why I am downloading 32-bit the bundle
but if you have Linux 64-bit just click
this 64-bit bundle here
so just click this 32-bit and in here it
will show you on Thomson condition you
can read them and just like this I have
read an agreed the terms and condition
and just like this download button so I
have already downloaded the zip file so
I am not downloading it for the second
time but just like this and it will take
about one minute to download because
it's relatively big file about 500 MB
and once this file is downloaded in your
system it will look like this zip file
okay
so what we are going to do is we are
going to just double-click the zip file
from here and we are going to extract
this file so just click this extract
button and just extract this file in
some specified folder so I have already
made this Android SDK folder here but if
you don't have this folder just create
one for you and give it a name and just
go inside this folder and click this
extract button so your zip file will be
extracted in that
Android SDK folder okay now in order to
run Android apps you need to install JRE
and JDK so to install JRE and JDK we
will open our terminal first and in here
we will give this command so just give
sudo apt - cat install open JDK - seven
- gr e space open JDK - seven - JDK and
space ice-t plugin so we are also going
to install ice-t plugin so just give
ice-t - seven - plugin so just give this
command in order to install JDK and JRE
and ice-t plugin in your system which
we'll help you to run and develop
compiled Android apps and press ENTER
and right now I can see that I have
already installed these ice-t plug-in
and JD Kench are in my system that's why
it showing the message that this plugin
is already in the newest form but for
the first time when you are installing
in this these are JDK and JRE in your
system you need to give you a password
because you are using sudo and you need
to just give some yes commands to just
complete the or finish the installation
once you have finished this installation
and once you have extracted this file in
your specified folder in my case Android
SDK just go to that extracted file and
you will find two folder here one is SDK
which contains tools and platform tools
and extras and build tools here and
other is the Eclipse IDE so just go to
this Eclipse folder here and in here you
will find an executable table seq table
called Eclipse here so just double click
this Eclipse executable
and for the first time when you are
running this Eclipse IDE you it will ask
you to define the default box place were
space is nothing but the space where it
saves your project so the default
workspace is home slash Ubuntu slash
workspace but you can change this
workspace by browsing your specified
location and click OK
and now the facts DK has started and he
gave this pop up for contributing
contribute uses statics to Google if you
agree to it just give your statistics or
if you don't just give no and finish and
now you can develop new Android apps in
this Eclipse IDE so when you want to
create some new app just go to new and
create Android application project and
give it a name test
and click next next
and next
next and finish
so in this way you can install Android
SDK in your open to operating system I
