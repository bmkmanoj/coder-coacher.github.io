Linux command line tutorial for
beginners in this video we will learn
how will we can use rmdir command and
how we can use RM command in linux so
let's get started we will start with
rmdir command
now this rmdir command we can use to
remove the directory or directory
structures so let's see how we can use
it so you just need to give rmdir
command in order to use it and the
option you can give so you can just
write options here and then the
directory name so I will just say there
okay so this is how you can use it now
for example I will just CD to my desktop
for example and then here once again I
will create a directory by mkdir command
and I will name it as ABC and my
directory is created you can see here
right so for example I want to remove it
so I can just use rmdir command to
remove it so just write rmdir and the
directory name and press Enter
is going to remove your directory now
for example you have a directory
structure for example I want to create a
directory structure for example mkdir a
/ b /c / d / e for example so this is
the directory structure i want to create
and for this i need to use - p command
right for parents and then + enter and
then it is going to create this
directory structure or to see this
directory structure you can just write
LS - capital R and when you press ENTER
it is going to show you the directory
structure so you can see at the top we
have directory and inside directory we
have directory and inside directed me we
have see
and say see we have D and inside D we
have e okay so this is the directory
structure which we have created now in
order to remove it you can just carry
the same command for example RM dir and
then just give a slash me /c / d / e for
example ok and when you give this
command it's going to you know remove or
try to remove this directory but you can
see it hasn't removed this directory
actually right and what it does is let's
see once again
LS - capital R that it hasn't removed
this directory it has only removed the
top-level directory which is this one
which is e directory e right now in
order to delete the whole directory
structure what you need to do is you
need to use this flag which is minus P
which we have seen in the last video
also for parent right and E is already
been deleted with this command without -
D so without - P it's going to remove
only the top-level directory which is at
the top which is e in our case right now
in order to remove the whole directory
structure you just need to give minus P
flag and then press enter is going to
remove the whole directory structure for
you okay I'm going to clear the terminal
and then once again I want to create the
same directory structure I want to show
you one more thing so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to just create this
directory structure and in order to
execute the previous command you have
executed you just need to press up a key
or up arrow P and it's going to give you
the last command you have executed right
and I want to create this directory
structure once again
and I will press ENTER and creates the
directory structure once again and then
I will just do LS capital R and you can
see the directory structure is created
and then there is one command which is
this rmdir - P and then for example you
want to you know remove the command and
see the output
okay so you can just give this flag
which is for verbose okay so this flag B
is called verbose flag and this verbose
if you don't know what is verbose
verbose refers to the mode or setting
that this place or gets extended
information so it will give you what's
happening in the background the
information of all that right and then I
will press ENTER and you can see how
this rmdir command is working so first
of all it has removed the top level
which is e directory then D then C then
B then a so it works from the top level
directory to the you know parent
directory you can say okay so if you
want to you know display the extended
information you can use this V flag with
P okay now for example once again I will
just give the clear command which will
create my terminal and once again I will
create this directory structure which is
a / b / lee / leave / e and it's going
to create it and once again I will give
this command which is LS - capital R so
our directory structure is created right
now for example I want to CD to for
example a to the B directory okay so now
I am in the B directory okay and here I
want to create a file so I will just
right cat and I will just say ABC dot
txt file I want to create and then I
will just give some remnant xed here and
I will just press control D to indicate
the end of the file and now this B
directory contains this ami d c dot txt
and this we can verify by once again LS
- capital r command and now you can see
in our P directory we have ABC dot txt
so let me go back to directories above
so we are in the desktop so it will you
know go one directory back right if you
remember how we can use CD then you know
how to use this dot dot also right and
these double or dot means we want to go
one directory ahead or to the parent of
the current directory okay so now we are
in the desktop and then once again we
will give LS - capital R and you can see
the directory structure so we have a
then we have B directory inside a and
inside B directory we have this text
file and then C directory you can see so
this is the directory structure and once
again for example I want to use this
rmdir command to remove the directory
structure and let's see what happens
when I press ENTER it will give me the
error in between so it says failed to
remove directory a slash B directory
does is not empty or directory not empty
right and this is due to the fact that
if the directory contains a file the
rmdir command will not work for that
directory so if the directory contains
any file you cannot use rmdir command
direct
right so I will just give this command
which is Alice - are once again let's
see what it gives so you can see it has
deleted the directory II D and C for us
because they are empty and removing
start from the you know the top level so
it has deleted e because it was empty
then it has deleted D because it was
empty and then it was has deleted C
directory because it was empty
but when it's trying to em you know
delete the B directory it contains a
file so it cannot delete this.b
directory and that's why this error is
coming right so it removes the file in
our structure right so you can see at
this moment it has given us this problem
or error because it's trying to delete
the directory but directory contains a
file now if the directory contains a
file there is another command you can
use which is RM command and this command
we can use to remove the files and
directly directories ok
so just give RM and then your directory
so now we only have a and b directory
because c d e directories are already
deleted right and if you want to delete
the whole directory structure you just
need to give this flag which is minus r
and it stands for a recursive ok and we
can just add this v flag also for just
displaying the information what's
happening in the background as we have
done with this MK rmdir command right so
if you will give this command it's fine
but if you want to print the information
you can give this V also with you know
RM command and press enter and you can
see it has removed the text file first
and then it has removed the directory
structure now you may have observed here
that it has only deleted our text file
and the B directory because in order to
use the RMR you know command you just
need to give the parent directory name
so you just need to give RM and then
minus r and then a would be enough to
delete this directory and the child or
subdirectory inside this directory or
whatever file it contains inside this
directory okay so you just need to give
the parent directory and nothing else
and I have given the parent directory as
a /p so it considered the parent
directory as this B directory inside a
directory so it has only removed the txt
file inside B directory and B directory
not a directory if you want to remove a
just give the parent directory which is
a itself and press enter and it's going
to remove this directory so this is the
brief information about using RM command
&amp;amp; RM dir command you can use man pages
or you can you know refer to man pages
to know about more about these commands
okay so I hope you enjoyed this video
