tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use seekbar with your Android
activity so what is a seek bar seek bar
is like a progress bar or you can say
it's an extension of progress bar with a
thump attached to it ok so let's take an
example how to use seek bar and let's
see how to do it so first of all what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my
palette and search for a widget called
seek bar it's in the widgets and here it
is you can just drag and drop into your
activity you can also change the
property of the seek bar so that it its
width it's adjusted to the width of your
layout so go to the property called
layout underscore width or layout colon
width and instead of wrap content you
can change this width layout width to
fill parent and it will fill the parent
or the layout okay now the second thing
we are going to use here is our text box
and we are going to take a large text
box and in here we can show the progress
of the seekbar or what's happening in
the seekbar
now let's go to our main activity dot
Java and let's write some code to our
main activity dot Java file so I'm going
to go to my main activity dot Java so
now I am going to declare two variables
one s seekbar and other is textview okay
so now we have declared two variables
one is seekbar and other is textview and
let's declare a method which we can call
in our on create method so it will be
public void seek bar for example and
let's write some code inside this method
and first of all we are going to cast
our seek bar and textview variables so
let's cost them
so now our casting is done and now we
will add the listener to this seekbar
but let's first set some text on our
textview so that it can print the
progress of the seat bar so textview dot
set text and inside we can just set some
text for example covered some amount of
seekbar
or something like this plus the seekbar
variable and we will check the progress
so get progress of the seekbar
so let's check the progress of the seek
bar and then we will show this progress
against the maximum you know value the
seek bar can show right so let's show it
against the maximum value so plus C bar
dot get max okay now what we are going
to do is we are going to take our seek
bar and add a listener to this seek bar
so take the seek bar dot set C ball
change listener and in here we will add
a new C bar change listener so new on
seek bar change listener and you will
notice that whenever you press ENTER it
adds three method to your on C bar
change listener one is on progress
change other is on start tracking touch
and third is on stop tracking touch so
this one first is for tracking the
progress of your seek bar second is
tracking the start of your seek bar and
third one is for tracking the
stop of your seek bar okay so now what
what we are going to do is in this set
on click change seek bar listener let's
create our variable
in progress value progress value for
example and this we are going to use to
you know store the progress of this seek
bar now we are going to go into this
method called on progress change method
and in here you can see a variable
called progress and this will give you
the progress of the seek bar so we will
assign this progress to our user-defined
variable which is progress value so
progress is equal to progress okay and
now we will assign this progress to the
to the textview also okay so what we are
going to do here we are going to copy
the same text which we have set on the
textview but let's see what is this
error this error or when we hover over
this progress underscore value
it says the variable progress value is
accessed from the inner class that means
you should define this inside your seek
bar method in here right or better you
can do it even inside here okay and then
what we are going to do is we will copy
this text view dot set text and paste it
here and instead of this cat progress we
will just pass this progress variable
here okay so this will show us the
progress of our C bar in the textview
okay the same we are going to do in the
stop tracking touch because whenever
the seekbar process or seekbar
drag is stopped we also want to you know
show this value on the text box but this
is store in this progress value which is
a global or variable for these three
method so change it to the progress
value and then we can also show some
text message using toast okay so we will
use toast dot make text which takes
three argument first is your last name
or your context so may not give 'ti dot
this second is the message for example
seek bar bar in progress
okay and let's add the third argument
toast dot length long and we will show
this write the same messages we can add
to our other two method here one is for
start tracking so in here seek bar we
can say start tracking or seek bar in
start cracking and in here we will just
add same toast or message and we will
say seek bar in stop tracking okay now I
think our method is done so we just need
to call this method inside our on create
method in here and we just need to run
our program so let's run the program so
now our program is running and you can
see initial status of our seek bar is
zero and the maximum value of the seek
bar is hundred right so because it's on
the Left top left end of the you know
seek bar that's why our progress is zero
right now
against 100 now let's try to drag this
thumb towards right and let's see what
happens so I drag it and you can see it
changes this value which is covered and
it changes the message or toast in here
right so the process changes and the
message here also changes right you can
see the process changes and here the
message according to the change of the
seat bar appears right so in this way
you can track the process of seek bar
using get process of the get process
method of seek bar and the process
method and that's it for this video I
