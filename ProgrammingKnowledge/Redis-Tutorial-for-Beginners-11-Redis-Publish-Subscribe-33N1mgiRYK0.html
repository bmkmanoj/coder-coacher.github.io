register rule for beginners in this
video we will learn how to use Redis
publish/subscribe so Redis
publish/subscribe implements the
messaging system where sender is called
the publisher and the receiver is called
the subscriber right now in Redis a
client can subscribe to any number of
channels so let me give you an example
and let me show you how you can use
Redis publish/subscribe so you can see I
have opened three ready CLI terminals in
three different terminals right so this
is ready CLI first terminal second
terminal and third terminal now first of
all I am going to subscribe to a channel
so I can just write subscribe here and
then it takes a channel name right and I
can give any channel name for example
Redis or any other channel name so for
example my channel and I can subscribe
to this channel okay so the name depends
upon you right so for example I
subscribe to the channel called Redis
and I just press enter so now this is or
this terminal is subscribed to this
channel right now from the second CLI
when I publish some message to this
channel so let me publish something so
to publish a message you can just use a
keyword publish as we have seen in
subscribe so to subscribe you use a
keyword subscribe and then a channel
name for publishing you use a keyboard
publish and the channel name on which
you want to publish right so I want to
publish on the Redis channel and then
your
message for example hi right and I press
ENTER and you can see on the subscriber
it gets the same message so first of all
it will just show you what kind of
message is coming so it's a message and
then on what channel it's coming and
what is the message itself right now if
you want to send a big message you can
just enclose your message inside these
double quotes so for example hello world
here and then press ENTER then it's
received here okay now it's possible to
subscribe to any number of channels
right so you can see I am subscribed to
Redis from one channel now I can just
copy the same command in the next
terminal here and then I'm subscribed to
this channel so now there are two
subscriber subscribe to one Redis
channel so this is the channel and I'm
subscribed to that Channel right so
there are two subscriber for the channel
name Redis and when I just send hello
world
again for example now it is received by
both the subscribers right so you can
see hello world is received here and
hello world is received here okay
so this is how publish/subscribe method
work in Redis now when you are doing or
using Redis in the programming then it's
really important or it's really useful
so for example recently I created some
kind of API where I wanted to listen for
any event for save in Redis so whatever
is saved whenever
some command comes and something is
saved in Redis I wanted to subscribe to
that save event right and I have used
this publish/subscribe method from Redis
in that API and it worked fine so it's
kind of listening to the trigger for
examples for saving the data or some
delete deletion of data you can
subscribe and then you will get this
message on the next side which is
subscribing and based on that
subscription you can trigger some event
okay now let me just close this CLI and
once again open the CLI once again and
let me clear the terminal once again and
there is a command called P subscribe so
you can do P subscribe and then it takes
the pattern so for example I can just
write R and then s tricks are s tricks
here means any publisher when it's
published on the channel name which
start with r it will receive that
message so for example I am publishing
this publish Redis because this pattern
matches this pattern so s tricks is some
kind of a wild card here so it's
whatever so for example I'm subscribing
to our s tricks and I'm just publishing
the same message again and you can see
it's receiving that message because it's
just matching the pattern whatever
publisher publishes on the pattern which
matches our s tricks for example R and
whatever comes after R this is matching
that pattern so it will receive that
message for example I can just do
something like this I on our X for
example this also matches this pattern
right because we just want to
match the first letter of that channel
and whatever comes after that it will be
matched automatically so this is kind of
a pattern matching in Redis so P
subscribe is used to pattern matching
and whatever publisher channel matches
that pattern it will be receiving that
message so you can see this is receiving
that message but this CLI is not
receiving so because we have subscribed
to a concrete channel layer which is not
a pattern so whenever we just give the
raddest channel itself then only it will
receive the message and this
automatically receives the message
because here we are just matching the
pattern okay so in this way you can use
publish subscribe in Redis I hope you
