video I will show you how to download
NetBeans IDE in your windows-based
system so to download and install
NetBeans IDE in your Windows System
first of all you need to download the
installer for that so just go to your
google browser and write NetBeans and
then the first link that will open is
from NetBeans oog so in here you just
click this link and you will see the
NetBeans page and at the time of making
this video the netbeans ide 7.3 worsen
is the latest version so you just click
at the download and here you will be
presented some options for download so
if you want to develop Java SE programs
you can choose this and Java e for Java
EE you can choose this so every download
has its own speciality so if you are are
interested in developing only a specific
part from these four options then you
can choose the download here for the
specific language or specific programs
but if you are interested in using this
NetBeans IDE for a long term usage then
you must download this all package from
here so it's on 198 megabyte program so
just click download and when you click
download here you will see the download
will start here and you can see here my
download is already running here so and
it will take some time to download in a
meantime if you are using this NetBeans
IDE for the first time and you wish to
develop Java based program you must
write this you must read this note here
below so this says for running these PHP
and C++ you need this bundle for this
NetBeans IDE to run this PHP and C++ and
to run Java programs you need to install
this jdk in your windows app system to
run these java based programs so jdk is
just a tool chain to compile and run
java based program so basically i am
interested in running java based program
in my NetBeans IDE so I will select this
standalone JDK and will guide me to the
oracle page in which there are different
options for the jdk toolchain so what I
want is the JDK toolchain for NetBeans
so I will select this NetBeans plus JDK
7 so it will take care of my compilation
and run so I will click this also
and it will guide me to the next page
and in here you just take this accept
License Agreement from here and then you
can choose the system so we are
installing this on Windows PC that is
why I will choose this last one okay
so how you can decide that if you want
this x86 installer or x64 installer so
what you can do is go to your start and
go to control panel and no not to the
control panel but the this computer sign
and right-click and go to the properties
and in here you can see it's a 68 bit
operating system okay so I want to
download this x64 from here just click
it and this will also start downloading
so for running the Java based program
this JDK should be installed in your PC
also so I will wait for this to download
ok so both JDK and NetBeans are
downloaded now so first I will click
this JDK 7 and it will open our
installer click yes and it will start
installing JDK in your windows system so
it will take some time to install
and it's installing conferring
configuring the Installer and press next
and accept the license agreement click
Next and choose the default location
click Next and if you agree with this
location then click Next
and just click install
and it will take some time to install
this JDK in your system
so installation process is going on
right now so if you can notice this JDK
+ NetBeans installer install your JDK
also and NetBeans IDE also so it
installed both at the same times so you
may not need this
NetBeans installer separately this
NetBeans installer with JDK will take
care of your NetBeans IDE installer plus
your JDK tool so the process is going on
right now so once this is downloaded
just click finish and see on the desktop
a newly installed NetBeans IDE you can
see here just click it to open the
NetBeans IDE and say yes
and the NetBeans IDE is now opening and
here you can see a newly installed
NetBeans IDE here so from here if you
want to check some project just go to
new project and you can go to the
samples based on your project whatever
what project you are making there are
sample programs here so for example I
choose this reform example and I will
click Next and the default name I will
leave it like that only and I will press
finish and it opens the project here the
other project are for my old projects so
this is the project sample which I have
opened so before I was using NetBeans
NetBeans seven point two point one and I
uninstalled it and I reinstalled this
NetBeans seven point three that's why
these other project it imports
automatically so let's check this sample
GUI program just right-click it and run
it so please wait while classpath
scanning the process so here you can see
when this will become 100% then it will
run so we will wait for this to scan the
whole projects so once the scanning
process completes here just right-click
your project once again
this is your sample project and run it
once again and you can choose
your main class from here so I will
choose this an Tina example da 10 Tina
and click OK and you can see here the
program is running so it will appear
your GUI in a moment so here is your GUI
so this is the example project and this
type of project you can make with the
help of your NetBeans IDE and I have
many videos on making these kind of G
wise in my programming knowledge YouTube
video channel so go and check that and
you will be able to make a cool-looking
project at the end of that a playlist
series so I hope you enjoyed this video
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
