video I will show you how to find your
IP address with the help of the c-sharp
windows form application so by IP
address what I mean is the local network
which you are connected to that IP
addresses so the simplest way to find
your IP addresses are if you are on
Windows just go to this Start button and
just open CMD and press ENTER and it
will open the command prompt and in here
if you type I P config and press Enter
it will show you the list of network IPS
you are connected to this is a local
network IP s so this is ipv4 address 192
168 0 1 0 3 so this is the IP address I
am talking about and I have one more IP
which I am connected to is a Virtual Box
host network which I created in
VirtualBox
so that IP is 192 168 56.1 so I want to
find or I want to show these two IPs
with the help of my c-sharp application
so how can I do this I will show you so
first of all take a button and I will
change its text as show
I piece and now I will just double click
this button and in here I will write the
code but first of all I will go at the
top and I will add some namespace here
to obtain my ie so write using system
dot net okay so this namespace we are
going to use in our codes that's why
just declare it at the top now once
again double click this button and in
here you will write your code and here
we will declare some variables which are
these so right I P host entry and give
it a variable name in my case host and
then declare a string variable which
will show the local IP address of which
will show the local IP address is equal
to some some initialization so I have
done this question mark and then write
this copy this host variable is equal to
DN s dot get host entry and in the
bracket right DNS dot get host name
bracket and bracket closed now in the
next line what we will write is this
code so this is for each loop so just
write for each loop and declare for each
and in the bracket IP address IP in host
dot address list so
this will hold the IP address and so it
will keep on looping until all the
addresses in the list are there so so
write this and then in the next line
write if condition and in the if
condition argument you pass this IP
variable dot address family dot to
string is equal to in the double
Courtwright internetwork okay and in
this if condition I am just copying this
string variable and I'm just
transferring my IP in the form of string
in this string variable so right local
IP which is this string variable is
equal to IP which is this variable to
string bracket and rank enclosed and I
am just showing this local IP in the
message box this you can show in the
list box ox also it will good to see the
whole list but I will show it in the
message box so let's see how it runs I
run the program and when I click this
button it it should show the IP
addresses so I press this show IPS first
is 192 dot 168 56 1 when I see this IP
config it gives me the same value 192
168 56.1 and once again when I click
this message box because it's a list so
I will click this message box ok and it
will show me the second IP address which
is also in here 192 168 0 1 0 3 so these
are local network IPS
so in this way you can show the IP
addresses of your local network instead
of this message box if you want just I
will take a list box from here and I
will just copy its name this list Spock
and once again I will go to the code
instead of this message box I can add
this list box dot items dot add and in
the bracket I will pass this same local
IP string variable okay
and now when I run the program it will
show me the IP address in the list so
now this is blank and when I click this
button it should show me a list of IPs
so I just press this and it shows me the
list like this okay so in this way you
can show that I IP addresses in the list
also so I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
