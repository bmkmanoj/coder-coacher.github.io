video I am going to show you how you can
link your Microsoft Access database
values from a combo box tool in c-sharp
so I will just go to my tool box and I
will take a combo box from here and
suppose I want to list out or populate
this combo box with the column values in
my database so for example I want to
list out all the first name in this
combo box I want to populate all the
data from this column to my combo box
how can I do it I will show you in this
video so we have this combo box you can
change the name of this combo box as you
wish I will leave it as default as combo
box one right now in order to link this
combo box with your database value just
select your form as a whole so just
select your form and double click it and
you will reach to the form load event of
your code or of your form right so in
this form load event what I am going to
do is let's copy all the code we have
used in the last videos so for example
in the last video I've shown you how to
delete the data in the database using
your c-sharp code so I will just copy
whatever is there in this button click
event from try code block to the end of
catch write and I will go to this form
load event once again and I will paste
it and by now I think you know what this
connection is doing how to make this
connection and how to pass the queries
so once again I will go through it
really fast this connection is our oledb
connection which we have declared in the
earlier videos if you don't know still
how I created this connection you need
to know so you need to see my last
videos
okay so we will open the connection and
we will create a command for executing
this command so this is a command object
led B command is equal to new command
and then we will give a connection to
this command so we will write connection
command got connection is equal to
connection which is our oledb connection
then we will create a variable string
which we call query and here we will
pass our query right now I will leave it
blank and we will make our query for the
combo box in a moment and then in the
next line we will just pass this query
to this command so come on dot come on
txt is equal to query which we are going
to create here and then for showing to
the showing data to the combo box we
need to write a select query so we need
to fetch some data from the database so
in here we will write I will just delete
this message but we don't need it and
instead of writing command dot execute
non query this execute non query is used
for the insert delete or update which do
not return any values from the database
so for taking or for reading the values
from the database
I will come command dot execute reader
and what this execute reader does is it
will read the values more than one
values from the database and then we can
use those values but these values we
want to save it in some reader so we
will write le DB reader or data reader
we say oh le the P dot or reader and we
will name it as reader for example is
equal to command dot execute freedom
and this will be like this and once this
command reads the value and place it
into this reader or points this reader
will point all the values one by one we
can iterate this value by a value
so I will write while reader dot read so
this is this reader got read will give
us a boolean value and what this reader
dot read will do is it will keep on
reading data Y until and unless this or
read or read value is true you see its
returning boolean value so until analyst
this condition is true that will keep on
looping in this loop right and now in
this loop what we want to do is just
copy the name of your combo box this is
my combo box and the name of my combo
box is combo box 1 and its form load
event in this while loop I will paste
this combo box and I will say combo box
dot items dot ad and what we are going
to add in the combo box the values which
we read from the database so just write
the reader and then we will write this
square brackets and in this square
brackets you can see here it's take you
can call two kinds of values one is on
the basis of index of the data and
second on the basis of a string you see
string name right but first let's
construct our query so you just need to
pass a simple query here just write
select star the star or s tricks will
return all the values which you have in
the dot of a star means all the columns
right otherwise you specify the name of
the columns okay
so select star from your database table
name which is employed data in my case
like star from employee data just this
this will be our query and for example I
want to list out or populate all the
first name from my database what can I
do is I can just copy the name of my
column which is first name and in here
in the square bracket I can pass this
name of the column so this will return
the name or dot off which is there in
the first name column one by one until
and unless it reads the data or it read
all the data and this will return this
is an object and we need to cast it to a
string so we will write read a dot to
string okay this will convert your data
to a string and because this combo box
takes a string that's why you need to
give the string here now let's try to
run the program and I will give the
username and password and let's hope
it's it doesn't okay so we need to close
this database first which is opened
because as you know access can't open to
connection at the same time once again I
will just close this and run it once
again
and once again username and password and
you have the second form and once you
see this you will be able to see all the
names which are there in the database
okay so let me open this database once
again and we will tell you our means
database is open now and now you can see
this is the list of first names mom John
Julie Paul or whatever and here also you
have the list of name are John Julie
Paul all the names are here right fitted
which are there in the database now
suppose you also want to show the last
name of the employee also oh you can do
it you can just go to your fourth post
and you can concatenate use connect
catenate operator which is plus and in
here you can write you can give a speech
little space and you can once again use
this reader dot to string and instead of
this first name i'll give this time the
last name which is this one okay so it
will show first name and last name and
let's close our database and let's run
it and username and password correct and
now you see first name and last name are
coming here with a space okay so you can
show your data in the database columns
like this there is one more way of
showing the data in this combo box and I
will show you that also so if you want
you can use it so you can select you can
change your query like this select first
name and this ready when you write
select first name from
your table name this will only select or
this will only fetch you the first name
column values okay and now you know the
that you will only get the first name
column values then you can just write
the index of this as zero and then I
will once again run the program and you
will also get the same result by the
index also now for example you want to
also you also want to fetch the last
name so you can just give a comma and
give last name here so just this worry
is let's first name comma last name from
your table name and you can just use
once again this concatenation operator
here with a space and now this reader
this index will be one right because
this is the 0th index and this is the
first index run the program give
username and password and now you see
result the same and once again just a
little hint that if you write last name
so you can you write select last name
from this and you will see give the
index 0 here you will see the last name
ok so index depend upon your query
see the last name okay so this index
depends upon your Prezi so in this way
you can use these two ways to patch data
from your database into your column okay
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
