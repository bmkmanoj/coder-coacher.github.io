show you how you can solve this vamp
server error which says for bitten you
don't have permission to access route on
this server so I'm trying to access my
server using the IP of the server and my
web server is on some other location
right and this gives this error which is
permission denied so how to solve it so
first of all go to your vamp server
where it's installed and then open the
web server options from here so left
click on this web server icon and in
here it's going to show you these
options so go to the option called
Apache and then open httpd dot pump file
here okay and in here it's going to open
this httpd.conf file and then scroll
down a little and you will see the
option called document root here and
just below this document root you will
see this directory element and just
scroll down once again you will see this
directory element and then in front of
this there is a attribute called C colon
slash vamp /ww okay so in here what you
need to do is you just need to scroll
down a little and in here you will see
at the last the option called online
offline tag - don't remove okay and by
default it's require local ok so instead
of required local you need to change it
to require all granted okay so earlier
it was require local and you need to
change it to require all granted okay so
change it and then save this file ok so
just save this file and then restart
your vamp server so just
open this vamp server icon and then
click this option which says restart all
the services and it's going to restart
all the services in the web server you
can see here and now when you see green
here on the web server then you can
refresh your web page once again and now
it's going to show you these options for
the web server ok
so in this way you can solve this
forbidden problem now there is other way
of solving this problem which is I'm
going to show you right now so I will
once again revert it to this local right
so required local and I will save it
once again which gives the you know
forbidden problem right so what we can
do here once again go to this web server
icon and in here you are going to see
put online option right so when you just
click this portal online option it's
going to automatically change this to
require all granted and then you will be
able to access your web page also so
there are two ways right either
just put this option online or otherwise
go to your httpd.conf file and change
this required local option to require
all granted ok so that's how you can
solve this problem I hope you enjoyed
