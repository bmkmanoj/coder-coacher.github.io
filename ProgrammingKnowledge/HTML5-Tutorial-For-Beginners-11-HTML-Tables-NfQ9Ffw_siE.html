HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
in this video we will see how to use
tables in HTML so let's get started
first of all to add a table you need our
tag called table to add it and inside
the table you have some more elements so
for every table we have rows so we need
to add our table row element first so
just add TR which stands for table row
okay and inside the table comes our
columns right so for columns
use a tag called TD which stands for
table data okay and here you can provide
your content for example we are making
some table for name surname and the
marks scored by a student for example
something like this so the first column
here is the name and the second column
we are going to add is the surname and
the third column we are going to add
here is the maths code by him so for
example 90 marks right so TD you can
think of it as a column TR is the table
row and table is the parent of all right
so you can add in a same way multiple
table rows inside your table something
like this one row below another right so
right now we have a table with two rows
with three column each right so we are
going to save our code and refresh our
page and it looks like this now you will
see here there is no border in the table
so to add a border you need to add a
attribute to your table which is called
border itself and you can provide here
one then
we'll have the bottle so save it and
refresh your web page and it's going to
give you this kind of a border now if
you want to stretch your table to the
width of your browser web page what you
can do here is add an attribute called
style and add an attribute called width
here so width is equal to hundred
percent okay so just add one hundred
percent here save your web page and
refresh it and it will stretch to
hundred percent okay now if you want to
add heading to your table what you need
to do you can just add one more row
something like this and instead of using
TD which stands for table data you can
use th which stands for table head okay
so th th th for column and here also
th th and th and here you can give some
heading for example name surname and
marks okay and save it and refresh our
page AZ will give you the heading to
your table okay there is one more
element which you can add to the table
which is called caption so just add a
element called caption and inside the
caption you can give the caption to your
table for example my name table okay
save it and refresh our page it's going
to give you a caption for your table
okay
now to add more styles to your table
what you can do here is in your head you
can add a style element inside the style
element you can add the style for a
table for example so table and include
table head and table detail here so th
comma T
d okay and for example I want to remove
the border from here and I want to add
it in the style attribute here what I
can do here is I can add a border like
this okay so the width of the border is
1px and solid and it's black okay save
it and refresh your page and you have
the same border now you can see here the
border is of two lines right now if you
if you want one line here you can
collapse your border so you can add an
attribute here border
- collapse and then add collapse here
okay and save it and refresh your web
page it's going to collapse this border
like this okay now one more property you
can add here is the alignment for your
text so you can add text - a line and
you can align it to the left for example
so left and save your web page and
refresh it and it will align your text
to the left you can do the same for the
right so just add right here save it and
refresh it and it's going to align your
text to the right right so I will use
the left one for now now there are three
more special elements you can add to
your table element which our table had
table body and table foot okay and these
will give you the ability to have extra
styles to your tables okay so for
example for the table had you can add
attribute like tea head okay and just
close it at the end of your row or for
your header right so end it here and
same you can have
the body so just add tea body it'll add
a body for your table and end it at the
end of your body content it can have any
number of rows right for the footer you
can add an attribute called tea foot and
end it here and this is one not going to
change anything in your table so when I
save it and when i refresh it it's not
going to change anything in the table
but now it's really easy to use them to
change the style for example I want to
change the style of table head I can
just use th for table head and then
change the background color for example
background color is equal to red okay
and same I can change the style for
table body and table foot so tea body
and color is blue and the foot and the
color I choose is yellow okay and save
your web page and refresh it and your
row color has been changed okay
now there is one more property called
column span so that you can have one
column in two column spans okay so I
will give you an example for example I
want two headings and not the three
headings so what I can do is I can
remove this middle heading from here and
I can add an attribute called column
span and I can give the span of two so
that it will cover two columns at the
same time right and save it and refresh
your web page and you can see now marks
heading is taking two column spans
like this okay so in this way you can
use tables in HTML I hope you enjoyed
