video I am going to show you how to pass
values from one form to another in your
visual basic windows form application so
I have this sample blank project made
and first of all what I am going to do
is I'm going to make a second form so I
will right-click my project and I will
go to add new item and in the new item I
am going to add a Windows form and this
form name I am will leave as default
which is formed to and I will click Add
so that my second form is added now to
my first form I will click my first form
and in this form what I'm going to do is
I am going to take our textbox and a
button so what I want is I want to send
whatever I write in this text box and
when I click the button I want to pass
the values from home 1 to form 2
whatever I write in this text box so let
me change the font size also so I will
select my control and change the font
size first bold and 18 ok and to the
text box I am going to change text as
pass string ok now
just go to your form - and in here just
add a label so I'm going to add a label
here and this label also I'm going to
change the text as first of all let me
change the font size and I will change
the text of this as get string okay
now whatever I sent from the forum
number one I want to set this text to
this label so what I'm going to do is I
will right click my effect form - and I
will save you code and in this view code
of form - I will declare a public
variable so just go to form - and in
here in this public class form to just
write public prototype and whatever the
name of the variable you want to give so
for example
string pass this is the name of my
string which I want to pass as string so
this is a public variable in form to I
have declared and just remember this
string variable name now I am going to
go to form number one and now I am going
to just double click this past string
button here and in here what I am going
to do is I am going to declare an object
of form two so I will write them obj as
new form 2 so this form 2 is the name of
my form class form to class right and
then I will write object dot the string
global string which I have declared here
so just copy the name of this string in
which we have declared here so this
global string just copy the name from
here and in this button click event just
write obj dot string pass is equal to
and whatever we write in our textbox so
form one textbox name is textbox one so
I will copy the name of the textbox one
and I will write here dot text so in the
form one what I have declared of
instance of form two or the object of
form two and then I have assigned the
string variable or I have xx the string
variable which I have declared in the
form two as a public variable is equal
to whatever I write in the tech
box one right now I just need to show my
form too so I will write obj dot sure
and if I want I can hide this form by
writing me dot hide this is not a
necessary step but if you want you can
hide this form and just show the other
form right and in the second form code
what I need to do is just go to the form
- and just select your form as a whole
so and click anywhere in the form and
just double click it and in this form
load event what I'm going to do is I
will copy the name of my label which is
label 1 okay and in this form load event
I will say level 1 dot text is equal to
this strength pass which is my global
variable now when I run the program and
whatever I write here for example I will
write simple string and I will say
passed string so I will click this
button and you will see here whatever I
have written in the form 1 it's passed
to the form 2 so once again what we can
do is we can unhide this form so we can
see both the forms at the same time now
once again for example I write hello
YouTube and then I will pause the string
to the second form so I will press this
posturing and you can see here whatever
I have written in my form 1 it's passed
to the form 2 so in this way you can
pass
not only string but you can pass integer
or or other variables from power from
from from one to form to okay so this
need not only be the string variable
this global variable it can be integer
it can be float decimal whatever you
want you can declare it so I hope you
have learned something new this time
please read command and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
