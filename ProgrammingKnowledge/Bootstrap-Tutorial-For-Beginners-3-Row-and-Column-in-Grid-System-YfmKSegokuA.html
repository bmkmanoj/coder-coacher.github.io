tutorial on bootstrap tutorial for
beginners in the last video we have seen
what is a grid system in bootstrap and
how we can use containers in bootstrap
now in this video we will see how we can
insert rows and columns inside of a
container in bootstrap so last time I
have told you that each bootstrap web
page has this container and inside this
container you can use rows and columns
and this is what makes the basis of grid
system in bootstrap so let's try to add
some rows and columns inside our
container here so I have a little sample
for you how you can add the rows and
columns inside your container div
element so I have told you last time
that you can add as many as rows you
want in a web page so there is no
restriction on adding the number of rows
and how you can add these rows you can
just add this div element and take this
class called row and then it will add
this row to your container okay and you
can add multiple rows so for example I
will just add some paragraph here random
paragraph and I will save this and I
will run my web page and in here I can
see this Row is added and I can add as
many number of rows as I want so one row
below other row below other okay so you
can add you know you can copy and paste
something like this and it will add as
many rows as you want so I will save
this and run it and add rows like this
okay now in order to add columns you
need to do inside the row okay so for
example I will delete all the rows
except for one and in here I want to add
a column okay
so how you do this you do this like this
so this class you need to import which
is which start from Co L and then comes
some wild card or Asterix which you can
change or which you have multiple
options for so for the first Asterix
after this column comes the size of this
column and it depends on the device you
want to use or device on which you want
to use this column for example you want
to use it on phones then you use access
instead of this Asterix so for example
for phone you use XS or if you want to
use it for tablet you change it with SM
if you want to use for desktop of normal
size then you use MD and if you want to
use it for larger desktop then you use
LG okay and the next Astrix is the
column number for example we want to add
some columns so the we already you know
have discussed that maximum number of
columns we can add to our web page is 12
in bootstrap right so you can just say
it can be of 6 size so whatever number
you write here it will take it as number
of columns okay so for example I write
as here 6 it will take it as 6 columns
so let's make it for desktop here and
I'm going to just copy this and paste it
inside my row
okay and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to add this paragraph once
again inside this column div okay so
inside this column div I'm going to
paste this paragraph and I'm going to
save it and run it once again and you
can see it captures or it takes the half
the size of your page width okay so for
example I gave here 12 maximum 12 I can
give as the column you know number of
columns right and i refresh my webpage
it takes the whole width like the row
okay and when I do something like for
example two number of columns is equal
to two it takes two columns here so like
this okay so you can vary this number
from one to twelve okay so for twelve it
will be maximum and for one it will be
minimum like this now you can add
multiple columns inside your row for
example I want to add some more columns
for example three columns and for this
first column I gave the width of two
second column I give the width of four
and third column I give the width of 6
for example so total of these columns is
12 two plus four plus six is equal to
twelve right and I will refresh my page
and you can see this is equal to two
columns this is equal to four columns
and this is equal to six columns okay or
what you can do is you can do something
like four four and four it depends upon
you the size you can vary so 4 4 4 will
be equal for you know our text 1 and X 2
and X 3 are all equal okay or you can
vary
you one and eight and three for example
okay save it refresh the page and it's
going to take the width as you specified
right so in this way you can use rows
and column in your bootstrap one more
thing you for example you want to add
one more row containing this columns you
can just copy this row for example and
you can add multiple rows something like
this okay and when i refresh this it
will give you three columns from first
row other three columns from second row
and other three columns from third row
so in this way you can use rows and
columns in bootstrap I hope you have
