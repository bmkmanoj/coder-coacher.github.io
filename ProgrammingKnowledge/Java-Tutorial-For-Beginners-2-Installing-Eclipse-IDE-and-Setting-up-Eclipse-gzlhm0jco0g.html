tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how we can install Java in our Windows 8
or Windows 8.1 operating system same
will be the procedure for installing
Java on windows 7 also now in this video
we will see how we can install Eclipse
IDE on our windows operating system
now IDE stands for integrated
development environment which helps you
to code your program so for example IDE
is an editor which will help you to
write your program and compile your
program and eclipse is one such IDE and
most used IDE in terms of Java
development so let's see how we can
install Eclipse IDE on our windows
operating system so first of all open
your favorite browser and search for
Eclipse IDE and the first link hopefully
comes here is www.pevs.com load button
click this download button and in here
you will be able to see different
versions of Java so not different
versions of Java but different versions
of Eclipse IDE
so Eclipse IDE comes in different
versions for example Excel Eclipse IDE
for Java developers Eclipse IDE for Java
EE developers which is basically for web
development and all such programs there
is Eclipse IDE for C++ or PHP and other
languages also but right now we are
interested in developing java
applications so we will download this
first option which is Eclipse IDE for
Java
development okay now depending upon the
system type of your computer if it's
64-bit or 32-bit you need to download
one of these zip files so to check which
system type you have you can just search
for system on your computer and in
system type you will be able to see that
mine is 64-bit operating system but if
you have 32-bit operating system you
need to download this thing so I will
click this windows 64-bit and then it
will redirect me to the mirror location
which is nearer to my PC's location so
this is the nearest location to my PC
but other mirror locations are down so
you can choose your mirror location I
will click this link and then I will be
able to save this zip file so it's a zip
file so don't be confused that it should
be executable it's not an executable
file but it's a dot zip file so I will
wait for this to download and once it
will be downloaded we will see how we
can configure Eclipse on our Windows
operating system so my download is
complete now now I can just open this
zip file so I will just open this zip
file and I will minimize everything and
this zip file contains a folder called
Eclipse so this safe while we are going
to extract in our C folder so I will
just extract this to our C folder okay
so just expect to the C folder and I
will wait for the extraction to complete
and once this extraction is complete I
can see this Eclipse folder inside my C
folders or folder of my computer so and
see I
can see this Eclipse and in here all the
Eclipse files are extracted now in order
to run this you can just double click
this Eclipse icon and you can also
create a shortcut or to it and then you
can drag and drop to your desktop and
then you can double click this tour
shortcut or you can click this Eclipse
icon from here also so I will double
click it and this is the error which is
commonly you know occurs while you are
installing Eclipse and you you know it's
your first time when you install Eclipse
so don't worry this error is JVM
terminated exit code is equal to 2 and
this error comes generally whenever you
have something wrong configured in your
path or environment variable and
generally from somewhere you have
configured this part c / program data /
oracle / java / java path in your
environment variable remember in the
last video i have told you to set
environment variable for java jdk 8 and
GRE ate those environment variable are
not responsible for this error this
error is the due to the environment
variable setting of the c / program data
/ java program and this okay so I will
open notepad or WordPad to you know give
this location to you so that you can see
it
exact part so this part if you see this
error this error then you need to go to
this path and see whether this location
exists or not so I will just copy this
path to my folder Explorer and I can see
this path exists so most probably this
environment variable exists in my
computer so I will go to my system
search for system and then go to
advanced system settings and here go to
environment variable and in here go to
path okay and I can see directly here
the first path is C slash program data
slash Oracle slash a Java slash job of
path so just double click this path
variable in system variable and you need
to delete this part which is wrongly
configured right so just search for this
path in your environment variable here
so I can easily find this part I can see
that this path is there so I just need
to delete this part from my system
variables and click OK here ok and up
once again click OK and click ok so once
I have done that I will be able to run
my Eclipse once again so I will click
this Eclipse icon once again and now
Eclipse runs so I wanted to you know
intentionally reproduce this error so if
you see this error you will be able to
find the solution now first for the
first time whenever a clip starts on
your computer it will ask for the
location where all your project will be
saved and by default that will be saved
in C slash users in slash whatever your
computer name is slash workspace so by
default all your programs will be saved
in this folder if you want to change
this folder you can change it but I will
leave it as default for now I will click
OK and then eclipse will open in some
moment now eclipse is open on my
computer right
so I will just maximize it and I will be
able to see this message welcome to the
Eclipse IDE for Java developers and you
can see they have some tutorials samples
overview and what's new so to create a
new project in Eclipse IDE you just need
to go to this file option here and go to
new and we are going to create a new
Java project so just click Java project
and in here in project name you just
need to give the name to your projects
for example my first project ok and just
you know for the simplicity you always
give your name to your project in
camelcase starting with the capital
letter each word so my in my m is
capital first F is capital project PS
capital so it is called camelcase
so it's convention to give names like
this and just all things are ok you can
just click Next and in here you will be
see that this will be your project
folder and that there will be a source
folder it's okay
click finish and once you do that the
eclipse will create a my project folder
for you okay so you can click at the
corner and open this perspective it's
called perspective and in this my first
project you will be able to see there is
a folder called
source now in this folder we can create
a simple class and this is just for
testing whether eclipse is smoking the
in the next video I will show you how to
properly configure a project and how to
create your first Java project you know
in a proper way so in this source
just right-click the source and create
new class and gave the class name so you
can give the name like my class for
example and just click this option which
is which method subs would you like to
create just check this option which is
public static void main option here ok
so just check this option here which
will create a main method we will see
what our classes and main method in Java
but for now we just want to check
whether it's working or not just click
finish and we create a class called my
class called Jiao dot Java and in here
you will be able to see this kind of
class and in here we are going to print
something so for example we want to
print something we can just write here
system system not SZ but this thumb
system dot out dot
print the ln4 print line okay and in
this print line we will just print hello
world so I will just print this but let
me change it to my keyboard layout and
we will print hello world okay so I will
explain this in detail for but for now
we will just check it and then we are
going to run this program but first of
all we will Braille this so I will
right-click my project and I am going to
for example run as java application and
then it will give me this save and
launch option I will click OK and now I
can see hello world printed on the
console here so that means Eclipse IDE
is properly configured in my system and
I will be able to compile my Java
program so that's it for this video in
the next video we will see how to
properly you know configure our first
Java project and what are all these you
know names classes and methods means in
Java so I hope you have enjoyed this
video please rate comment and subscribe
