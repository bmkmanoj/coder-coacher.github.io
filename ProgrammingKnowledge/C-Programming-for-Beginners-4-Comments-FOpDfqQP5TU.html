video tutorial on C programming for
beginners and in this video I am going
to teach you about comments so as the
name suggests comments are used to
provide a description of your code and
comments are generally not executed by
your C program and for example you want
to give some description of your program
what is it it is doing or what is the
purpose of your line of code you use
comment too so in order to give comment
to your C program you can use two ways
one way you can use is for multi-line
comment multi-line means more than one
line comment and this is just right
forward slash Astrix and then Asterix
and forward slash okay and in between
whatever you will write it will be
called a comment and it will not be
executed by your program or it will not
be compiled even by your projects
program it's just used to describe what
your program is doing so for example I
can say that this program is and then I
can go to second line and I can just
write more description this program is
printing hello world for example so in
this way you can provide multi-line
comments like this and this comment
which is inside this forward slash
Astrix and Astrix forward slash will not
be executed or compiled by your C
program it just for your reference or if
any other person sees your code by
seeing these comments he will be able to
understand
what your program is doing and what you
want to do in your program now in order
to provide a single line comment for
example this line what this line is
doing particularly I can give a comment
to this line just give two forward slash
and then you can write a comment so this
is a print F function okay so you can
write this command kind of comments in
your single line comments or you can you
know place it here so you can place your
comment anywhere in your code just keep
in mind you need to provide double slash
or s /a strikes and asterisks forward
slash and with strict forward slash and
start with a strict posit forward slash
and Astrix so in this way you can use
comment in c programming i hope you have
