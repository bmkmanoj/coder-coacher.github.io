how to show custom message when you
close your application so for example if
I'm doing some work and by mistake my
cancel button or this close button I
press my mistake then my application is
stopped immediately without asking me
whether I really want to exit or not
so I'm want to make sure that I really
want to exit my application and I want
to show the message that yes I want to
exit and then my application should exit
not when I randomly click this close
button so today I will show you how to
show this custom message that do you
really want to close the application and
then close your application so let's
start one other thing is if you pre
press this close button you see our
application is not exiting because it's
still running
we haven't tell our application to exit
so we need to go to debug and stop
debugging this problem solution also
will be covered in this video so what
you need to do is go to your forum which
is a second forum in which we are doing
so many stuff and just select your forum
as a whole so this is my home and I will
click here not selecting anything just
select the forum
and then go to the properties and click
this event events button and in here
search for the home closing event this
is the one which I am looking for so
just click it and double click it so it
will directly lead me to the code of
form to closing method or function so I
will just make some space to write the
code here you need to provide some code
to show the custom message so just write
this code this whole code in here you
need to write if in the bracket message
box WLAN show your custom message in my
case that I will show do you really want
to exit this is your message and this is
your application name whatever your
software application name or whatever
title you want to give you a message
this is that and by the way this here is
a comma and then provide a comma and
then message box buttons double colon
yes or no so this will give you the
ability to question okay comma message
box I can double pulley questions this
will show the icon of question mark on
your message box is equal to system
double in Windows double colon form
the balloon dialogue result is equal to
yes so if this is yes my system I will
show or I will exit my application by
writing this port application that will
colonize it else if I press cancel
button so just do nothing just close
that message box okay so if you want you
can just pause your video and copy this
code and now let's try and run our
program once again whether it still
works or not
and
it's taking some time because my
notebook is slow so use an event
transcript correct
and yeah now I want to exit my
application by clicking this button and
when I click this this way asked me
first do you really want to show exit
your application and this is your
message icon which we have said and if I
say no my home will not be closed and if
I say yes my application is exit so in
this way you can leave with this custom
message and you can change the icon
whatever you want to show and some
really cool different things you can do
with this so I hope you have enjoyed
