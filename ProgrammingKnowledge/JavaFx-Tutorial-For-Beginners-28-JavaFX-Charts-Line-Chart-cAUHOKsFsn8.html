Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use line charts
in Java FX so let's get started first of
all what I have done is I have created
this sample java fix project in which i
have this application package and inside
this application package i have this
main dot java class in which i am
calling this main dot F XML file as I
always do right and then I have this
blank main controller dot Java class and
I have this main dot F XML file so first
of all what I'm going to do is I'm going
to open this main dot F XML file using
scene builder and in here first of all I
am going to resize the anchor pane so
just select then capping and just resize
it for example 500 by 500 here okay
press enter and then next what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go to the charts
here and I'm going to drag and drop a
line chart control inside my anchor pane
and let's resize our anchor pin and now
what I'm going to do next is I'm going
to go to controls and I'm going to take
a button from here so when I click this
button it's going to load this chart so
the text of this chart I'm going to name
it as load chart okay so load chart and
I'm going to change the FX ID of this
line chart here so go to the code and
give some FX ID to your line chart for
example line chart itself okay and then
you have some properties for line charts
so go to the properties here and you can
see there is a title which you can give
for example line chart and press ENTER
and it's going to show this title
on the top you can move the title to the
bottom or the left or the right but
let's you know stick to the top right
and you have this legend also if you
want to show the legends then you can
choose by clicking this checkbox here if
you want don't want to show the legends
then you can just uncheck this okay and
this is the position of the legend where
it will be shown okay there are some
more properties here which you can you
know experiment with so just experiment
with these properties and then see how
it looks like okay the last property
here in this section is x axis so leave
it as default okay because we are going
to use XS series for our line chart okay
so next what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add the controller to this F
XML file so just go to the controller
here and select the application dot the
main controller dot Java file right so
once everything is done save your code
and go to your project and refresh it
and then go to main controller dot Java
class and in here first of all we are
going to define this line chart so just
right at the rate of XML and then line
chart just call the line chart variable
and it takes two template argument one
is x-axis and other is y-axis okay so if
you go to your main dot F XML file in
your Eclipse IDE you can see it has two
elements here one is x-axis element
which is category axis by default
created by the scene builder and second
is number axis right which is Y axis
okay so category axis means you can give
the first argument here or datatype here
as string
okay and the second is the number axis
you can see so number means you can give
here number so you can just write number
here okay and then your ID so we have
given the ID to this chart as line chart
so just take the same name from here and
just close it okay and now I'm going to
create a method for the button click
event so just create a public void
method so it's going to return void and
the name of this method I'm going to
name it as BTN okay and it's going to
perform this action event so just call
action event event and inside this
button click method first of all what we
are going to do is we are going to
declare our X our x-axis series okay so
just call XY chart here just call it
something like this and then before this
template argument we are going to create
a series so XY chart dot series and we
are going to give the same template
argument which we have given for the
line chart which is string and number
okay and then name your series for
example series itself is equal to new
series so just copy the same thing and
paste it here and close it okay now you
have your series so in this series you
can add some data so just call this
series variable and then call a method
called at get data and then we are going
to add at the data and it's going to
take this XY chart data variable so just
write new and then take this XY chart
from here dot data and data will be of
same type so just
these two template arguments here and
you can see here it takes the string and
the number so you can just give a string
here and the number as the second
argument so for example we are making
some line chart on the basis of some
month okay so for example we can just
write Jan and for example the earning of
January is something so for example 200
okay and in a same way you can add more
items to this series okay so we are
going to just paste it four times and
then we have a fab and March and April
right and the earnings for example 500
300 and 600 here okay and then once you
have created your series then you can
add this series to the line chart so
just call your line chart and then call
a method called get data and then add
the series to it so just add this series
variable here okay and then semicolon
now one last thing which remains is we
need to add this function to the F XML
file
okay so just open your app XML file in
scene builder select your button go to
the on action category here and choose
this button method okay and then save
everything and refresh your project from
here and then run it and our app is
running now so when I click this load
chart button is going to load this kind
of a chart right now when I click this
load chart again you can see a new line
is added and you have two late legends
here right and then third legend and
fourth legend and you can see the
legends are increasing one by one right
so to solve this problem what we can do
here is we can go to our button method
and then at the top at the start of our
method we can take our line chart and
then get data and then a clear our chart
okay so this is going to clear our chart
every time we click the button first and
then load the chart so this problem will
be gone so once again run your app and
once again click load chart and now only
one axis is there and you can see only
one legend here now you can even set the
name of the legend using series so you
can just take this series variable and
then you can just say set name from here
and you can give any string variable
here for example month pay here okay and
save your code and run your app once
again and load chart and now you can see
it's showing month pay okay now one more
thing you may ask here is how you can
give the label to your x axis and y axis
here so let's see how we can give the
labels to x axis and y axis so what you
can do is you can go to your main dot F
XML file in here you have x axis and y
axis right so go to your category axis
first and in here you can give any label
by this attribute called label here okay
so label is equal to some name for
example my X label for example and same
you can do for the y axis so go to your
y axis and and with this number access
property you can add this attribute
called label once again and say my Y
label okay save your code and run it
once again and load your chart and now
you can see on the y axis you can see
the y label and on the x axis you can
see this label right x axis label so
this is called label this is the legend
right so legend is different then label
label is this one and this is called
legend okay so in this way you can use a
line chart in Java effects I hope you
