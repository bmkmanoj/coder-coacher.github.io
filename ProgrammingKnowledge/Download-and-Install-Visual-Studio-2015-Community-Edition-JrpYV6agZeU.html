show you how you can download and
install Visual Studio 2015
Community Edition on your Windows
operating system so let's get started
first of all open your favorite browser
and search for visual studio and the
first website which will appear here
will be from visual studio comm just
click this link here and we are in the
visual studio website now we have three
options here Visual Studio Visual Studio
online and Visual Studio code so to have
Visual Studio community you can just
click the first option which is this one
and you just need to click this button
download community 2015 so click this is
going to download an executable file and
save it and once your executable file is
downloaded you just need to run your
executable file so run it and I'm going
to minimize my browser
and this is the location where it will
be installed and by default it's typical
just let it as it is and click install
now it can take few minutes to some
hours to complete this process of
installing Visual Studio so you need to
be patient while installing Visual
Studio
you
now after the setup is complete you will
see this kind of screen which says you
need to restart your computer so you
need to click this button and restart
your computer once your computer is
restarted what you need to do is you
need to go to search and search for
Visual Studio and click Visual Studio
2015 from here
and now Visual Studio will start
and then you will be able to see the
screen which says you need to sign in
with your Microsoft account or your
visual studio account so it's advisable
to sign in with your Microsoft account
so just click sign in
and give your email id and click
continue
and then you need to give your password
you
and then you will be able to see this
screen which says host your next project
in Visual Studio online but for now we
don't want that so I will say not now
maybe later and then you will be able to
see this screen and here you can choose
the Visual Studio theme for you there is
a blue theme there is a dark dream and
there is a light theme so you can choose
either of them for now I am going to
choose this light theme and click start
and now Visual Studio is ready to use so
