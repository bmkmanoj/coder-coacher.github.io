you all have made your NetBeans project
and now you must be wondering that you
want to make some set of file for your
project so today I'm going to show you
how you can make the setup files for
your project so that you could be able
to run it without opening NetBeans or
you can run it on the other computer
which have Java so first step we need to
do is go to your source folder where
your all NetBeans files are there and
you can find these folder in your source
folder build this and be project and
source SRC and all the other files which
you have saved in your folder so this is
my project folder in where my NetBeans
files are saved so here you must have
your database file my database file name
is project 1 2 3 dot SQLite you may be
having different name for the database
file it could be dot DB extension also
so if this database file is in the other
directory other than your project folder
then just copy that database file and
paste it into your NetBeans
project where your so source and build
file folders are situated so this is the
first step you need to do now we go to
our NetBeans project and then go to your
NetBeans project in here and wherever
you have made your database connection
just click that file and you must be
having the connection code like this
this is I have shown in one of the
beginning videos and you have provided
here the path so if you have copied and
pasted your database file in your source
folder then you don't need this long
path just remove all the path from C
folder to here and you just need to have
the name of your database because it
recognizes the database from your source
folder automatically if it is located
elsewhere other than your project file
I mean the NetBeans project file then
you need to provide this path otherwise
you don't need to provide this path you
can work with this name only after JDBC
SQLite so do that
this is the second step
and now we are going to make the jar
file for our project so go to your
project my project name is project 1 2 4
I will right click it and click clean
and build I will click it
and here you can see build is successful
okay and then go to your NetBeans
project once again and here you can see
a new folder called D ist beside your
SRC and built folder you now can see di
St folder which is made after we clean
and build our program so go to this
folder and in this you can see your jar
file this is this file is the jar file
which when you click it's our run file
for your project so when you click this
file you can run the project but there
is still one step we need to take in
order to run this program successfully
what do you need to do is wherever you
have copied your database file just copy
it don't cut it just copy it and go to
this DI st folder and paste it there so
what I have done is I have copied my
database and I have pasted my database
here and now when I run this program it
must run successfully so I will
right bye
user name and password and user name and
password is correct
and my other jframe is open so in this
way you can make a jar file which you
can run on any other desktop or other
computer which is having Java so in this
way you can generate the setup file for
your NetBeans project in the next video
I will show you how to make your project
as an installed labels or executable
file so that when you when somebody open
it he need to install it and it it will
look like a software when you need to
install your files and all so it will be
good for the project so this I will show
you in the next video please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
