Android MySQL database tutorial for
beginners in this video series we are
going to learn how we can create an
Android app using MySQL database which
is running on some web server so let's
see what are the requirement first of
all we are going to need a MySQL
database and then we want to use a web
server web server can be an Apache web
server or nginx web server or any other
web server we can also use a web server
which is running on web hosting right
now we are also going to need a
server-side scripting language in our
case we are going to use PHP for
server-side scripting so this
server-side scripting language will help
us to query the database and cater the
result and the last we are going to need
our Android development environment
which we are already using which is
Android studio now there are different
ways of getting these databases and web
server and scripting language together
so for testing purposes what we can do
is we can download and install a ramp
server and what is a web server web
server is a Windows web development
environment and it allows you to create
a web application with Apache PHP and
MySQL database alongside it's also going
to give you PHP my and win which allows
you to manage your database easily ok so
this is the first option which we can
use for creating our first Android
application for and for testing our
application now for practical uses we
can use web hosting and a server which
is running on some web hosting website
like GoDaddy or who
skater or Google hosting or any other
hosting website okay so what is a web
hosting web hosting is a service which
you can use to you know host your
website and it generally comes with you
know file system and database integrated
so we can use this web hosting also so
I'm going to give you both examples
using ramp web server also and this web
hosting also so you can create online
you know MySQL database using Android
application right so first of all we are
going to create an application using
ramp server
it comes with MySQL Apache and PHP
myadmin
so let's download and install vamp web
server and then we are going to write
some PHP scripts to query our database
and then we are going to create our
Android application so first of all open
your favorite browser and search for web
server and the first result most
probably which will appear here will be
from web server comm slash en for
English just click this link here and
this is the website from which you can
install vamp web server so you can read
more about web server in here and how
you can install it so to download web
server executable file you just need to
click download section here and in here
you have two options one is web server
for 32-bit operating system and second
is the web server for 64-bit operating
system
I have 64-bit operating system so I'm
going to click this option right now in
here you can read the prerequisite for
installing the web server
so you can read here don't use previous
web server extension or add-ons so you
must not have any other or previous
version of web server when you are
installing it right the second warning
here it says that this web server
requires Visual Studio 2012 we see
eleven executable file so to install
this web server you need to have Visual
Studio 2012 we see 11 and to download
and install it you can just click this
link so first of all I'm going to click
this link to install this executable and
then we are going to install web server
so just click this Microsoft website
link and in here you can see we are
going to install visual c++
redistributable for visual studio 2012
update 4 ok select your language and
click download and in here we are going
to check this first option which is for
64-bit operating system if you have
32-bit operating system you can choose
the second option or if you have arm
device you can choose the third option
so in our case we are going to choose
the first option then click Next
and now the executable will be
downloaded you can see our executable is
downloaded so just click this executable
file here and then click run and then
just check this checkbox to agree with
license terms and condition and click
install and click yes and once Visual
C++ distributable installation is
complete you can just close it and once
again you can open your favorite web
browser and then search for ramp server
and then go to the same website web
server dot-com and then once it
go to downloads here and then once again
click the web server option and then
this time you need to just click
download directly ok so it's going to
download this web server executable
right so we will wait for this web
server executable to download it's not a
big file it's just 41 point 5 MB file so
it's going to download in few seconds
now once the download is complete you
can click this executable file for the
web server and you will be able to see
this kind of web server setup so just
click Next and in here just click I
accept the agreement and click Next and
this is the location where web server
will be installed so C colon slash vamp
will be the folder in which this web
server will be installed so just click
Next and then you can create a desktop
icon and quick launch icon also so I'm
going to create only desktop icon for
that and click Next and click install
now in here it's going to tell you or
ask you please choose your default web
browser and if you're not sure just
click open or if you have some browser
preferences you can choose your browser
from here for example I want to choose a
Chrome web browser so I'm going to go to
my C folder and in here I'm going to go
to Program Files x86 and in here go to
Google folder and go to Chrome
application and choose Chrome dot exe
and click open ok and then it's going to
finish installing and you can see the
web server icon here ok and right now
you just need to allow the access you
just click allow access here and these
are the PHP mail parameter which we are
not going to use right now so we will
leave them as default and click Next and
then just click finish and please make
sure that this option is checked to
launch the web server right so just
click finish and click yes and it's
going to launch your web server and when
your web server is ready it's going to
show you this green ramp server icon
here right so you can just click this
web server icon here and you can see all
these options here ok so right now you
can see PHP myadmin
apache mysql folder and other options
for web server so first of all what we
are going to do is we are going to use
PHP myadmin to create our database so
let's create a database now you can see
our PHP myadmin
is open here and by default it has some
databases right so to create a database
what we can do here is you can click
data
yes and give the database name so for
example we are creating a database for
employees so we can just write employee
101 and then just click create here and
you can see our database is created so
expand to your database right now we
don't have any table inside the database
so just click this employee database and
in create table option you can just
create the table inside your database so
for example we are going to create a
table called employee data and then we
are going to provide the number of
column it's going to contain for example
it's going to contain employee ID name
surname age and user name and password
so it's going to contain six columns
just select 6 from here and then click
go and then it's going to give you this
kind of wizard first is our ID second is
the name third is the surname fourth
column is the age fifth column is the
user name and sixth column is the
password
okay now ID is integer name is text
surname data type is text also age data
type is int itself user name data type
is text and the password data type is
text okay now we can also choose the
primary key of this table so ID is our
primary key so go to index here and then
choose primary for ID okay
and this ID is also going to be Auto
incremented so choose this option which
says a underscore I which is auto
increment okay and then once this is
done we can just save our table okay so
now our table contains six columns which
you can just click on this employee
table
then you can see all the columns inside
the table which is ID name surname age
and username and password columns right
so our database and database table is
ready to use now after creating our
database we need to write some PHP
script to connect to the database and
then fetch the data or inserts the data
using this PHP script so now what we
need to do is once again click this web
server icon here and this time click
this
WWWE option here ok so just click this
option dub-dub-dub directory which is
going to open this vamp server /
dub-dub-dub directory and in here you
can see by default index dot PHP and
test MySQL dot PHP here ok so what we
can do here is we can create one more
file you can just create a new file from
here it can be a PHP file ok or you can
open a notepad plus plus and in here you
can create a PHP file so just open a new
tab and then save it as a PHP file so
first is the connection of PHP file ok
so I'm going to just choose the same
folder from C so C vamp and then in the
vamp we are going to go to www-wait a
PHP file which is connection PHP so I am
just going to right corner dot PHP ok
and then click Save and it's going to
create this file which is con dot PHP
here ok so now we can write some PHP
script to connect to the database so how
we can write it first of all you just
need to write this PHP initialization
element and between this PHP element we
are going to define some variables and
to define a variable in the PHP you need
a dollar symbol and then the variable
name so for example first is our
database name and which is going to be
equal to we are going to define these
names in a while just give a double
quotation symbols right now okay second
is the MySQL username so just write my
SQL underscore username okay is equal to
leave it blank for now and then third
option is the mysql password
okay so just write MySQL for example
password okay and the fourth option is
the server name right so the fourth
option is the server underscore name
okay so now first option is database
name so database which we have created
is this database which is employee 101
right so just copy the name of the
database and go to your PHP file and
give the name of your database right the
second option is the MySQL user name so
we can see the MySQL username by going
to the database so just select the
database and then see the privileges and
in here you can see the username is root
and the privilege is all right so for
the username we are going to choose
from here and we are going to just paste
here because our username ends root and
the password what is the password so for
example we are going to use this
localhost as a server name so we are
going to just write localhost and in
here we can just go to edit privileges
and go down a little and right now there
is no password or you can just select
this option which is no password and
then click go and it's going to you know
save your changes successfully so
password is nothing or blank okay now
after that to connect to a database we
are going to create a variable called
corn and we are going to initiate it
with a method called MySQL I connect so
just write my SQL i underscore connect
and then inside the brackets just pass
the four arguments it takes four
argument first is your server name so
just pass the first argument as server
name second is the MySQL user names
second is this one third is MySQL
password so just copy this variable and
paste it here and the fourth is the
database name so database name is this
one okay so these are the four arguments
right now to check if the connection is
successful or not you can just give this
condition if inside the if statement you
can just write this variable corn which
gives you the boolean result and then
inside these brackets if the connection
is successful you can echo something so
you can just write echo connection
success otherwise in the else condition
just write
else here and then in the else condition
you can add Co connection not success
okay so just write echo connection not
success okay and then save everything
and then open your web browser and in
here you just need to first of all right
localhost which is going to give you
this kind of web server options like
this right and then whenever you give
localhost / corner dot PHP which is of a
file name if you remember inside our www
folder we have this corner dot PHP file
so in your browser you just need to
write localhost and then slash corn dot
PHP right and when you click enter it's
going to give you connection success if
your connection is successful otherwise
is going to give you connection not
success so let's add it our you know
these values so we can know that it
gives the right result so I will change
the database name to wrong the database
name and save it and once again refresh
this localhost / con dot PHP and now
it's going to give you this error report
right and it says connection not success
so we know that whenever we write this
write parameters it's going to give us
the connection success right so right
parameter gives the connection success
okay so in this way we know that our PHP
is able to connect to the MySQL database
right now we are going to create one
more PHP script so I'm going to just
write create a new PHP script and I'm
going to save it as for example login
dot PHP so just write login dot PHP and
click Save here
and once again I'm going to just give
the PHP initialization tag and in here
first of all we are going to you know
import the score dot PHP which gives us
the connection right so we are going to
require first of all so just write
require and then inside the double code
corn dot PHP corn dot PHP right so this
is going to import this connection and
then we are going to create two
variables one is user underscore name
which we are going to give in a while
and right now we are going to leave it
as blank and second variable name is the
user password so just write user pass
and leave it as blank for now because we
are going to you know enter some data
inside the table and then we are going
to check against it okay and then we are
going to prepare a query so just write
my SQL for example query okay ready for
qry and in here we want to check if the
username and password is correct so we
can just write select some element or
you can just write select asterisk which
is a wild-card for selecting everything
from your database name so our database
table name is employee data if you
remember this one is our database table
name so just copy the same name and
paste it here and then just write where
clause and in here we are going to check
username and password right so we want
to check the column name username and
password right so where user name
like your username variable so in the
single quotes you just need to copy this
variable and paste it here and then just
give a space here and in here
after that just right end and then take
your password column name which is this
one and paste it here
and then once again single quote and
inside the single quote you just need to
give your user pass variable name which
is this one right so I'm going to just
minimize this a little and just paste it
here okay and don't forget to give this
semicolon before this double quote and
after this double quote also now we are
going to execute this query so we want
to create a variable called for example
result is equal to and then we need to
call a method called my SQL underscore
query so just write my SQL query and as
an argument we need to you know
parameters one is the connection
variable which we have here in
connection dot PHP which is this one and
the second argument is our query which
is this one right and then we can
evaluate our result using a if condition
so just write if our query provide more
than one line of result then we know
that username and password is correct so
just write my s ql i underscore num
underscore rows and then inside these
bracket just pass this result variable
so just pass
result and we will evaluate if it's
greater than zero then we will say that
our user name and password is correct
right so in the echo we can just echo
logging success right so just right
login success okay
and otherwise if there is no result we
are going to echo that login is not
successful so just copy the same and
just say login not success okay and save
your code now in your database you don't
have any data so these two variables we
have left right now blank but let's
insert some data inside our database so
just you know select your employee data
table and select this option which says
insert here so just select this and in
here we are going to insert some data so
for example employee ID one name is Tom
and the surname is for example something
and the age is 22 and and username is
one two three and password is one two
three okay and just click go it's going
to insert this username and password so
go to browse once again and now you can
see this data is added to your table
employee ID one Tom ban age is 22 and
username and password is one two three
and one two three so when we write here
1 2 3 1 2 3 and password is also 1 2 3
and save it and in here I think this
should be MySQL I query so instead of
MySQL query you need to write MySQL I
underscore query right
and save your PHP file go to your web
browser and just write localhost
and then this time you just need to lie
it login dot PHP and now it's going to
give you connection success and login
success that means your login is success
using the PHP script so right now we are
done installing our vamp webserver and
we are done writing our PHP scripts so
in the next video what we are going to
do is we are going to create our Android
app and we are going to connect it to
our MySQL database using this PHP script
so stay tuned and please read come and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
