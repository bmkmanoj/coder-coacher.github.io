cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can add an
image or picture to our cutie GUI
application
now basically QT doesn't have any widget
specially to include pictures so we can
use a label for this purpose to include
pictures so for example I have created
this login application in the last video
if you don't know how to make this login
application you can go to the last video
which I have made right so what I want
here is I want to add a picture at the
left hand side of my sign-in widget here
right so in this area I want to show
some picture so my application look
little bit professional right so what I
can do is I can just go here and search
for a label and then I can resize this
label right
and in this label I want to add a
picture so first of all I will just
remove the text because I don't want the
text inside the label so now we have
this label now there are two ways of
including pictures to this label one is
by code and other is by using these
properties so let's see the first way of
adding the picture so first of all I'm
going to change the object name of this
label so I will select the label and I
will name this label as label pick for
example so I know that this label is for
the picture right and then I will go to
my edit view and I will go to main
window dot CPP because this is my login
window right and in the constructor what
I'm going to do here is first of all I
need to create an instance of Q pixmap
so I need to include this head first so
just include Q pics map here okay so
just write Q pics map and this will
allow us to you know create a qmix
pixmap object which takes one argument
so let's create a cube pixmap object
first so just write Q pix map which is
this one and we are going to create an
object for example pics itself and this
takes basically one argument which is
the location of your image right so we
are going to give the location of our
image so what I have done is I have an a
default image which is saved at a
particular location in my computer so
what I can do is I can just copy the
path of this location here and then add
it to this argument here with the double
quotes something like this okay so just
copy the part where your picture is
located something like this and then
just paste this path here now in here
for windows we need these opposite
slashes these slashes will not work for
you so just use these kind of slashes
right which is back slashes right and
then the location and then the name of
my picture so my name of my picture is
login icon dot PNG file right so I can
just copy the name of the picture and
then forward slash login icon dot PNG
with the extension right now you can use
this object to set the picture so you
just need to write UI and access the
label for the picture which is label pic
in our case
and then you can just set the pixmap so
just call a method called set pixmap and
then pass this object there in the pics
map constructor okay so these two lines
of code will add the picture to your
label
so now let's save our code and run it so
I'm going to run my application and
let's see what happens when our
application runs so our app is running
and you can see this picture is set on
this label but there is one problem this
picture is not resized according to the
size of the label so in order to resize
our picture what we can do so I'm going
to close my application so in order to
resize my picture to some scale what I
can do is I can call a scale method on
this pix object
so this pix object we have passed in set
pixmap function write as an argument so
you can just call a method called dot
scaled here and then what we can do is
we can provide the width and height so
for example if you want to resize a our
image 200 500 pixels so you can just
give width and height here as an
argument and the third argument here
will be Qt keep expect ratios so just
call Qt and then call keep aspect ratio
here okay so this is going to keep your
aspect ratio okay so let's run our
application once again and let's see if
the image is resized or not so you can
see the image is resized when we you
know give this kind of scaling property
to the pix object right now for example
you want exactly the same size as your
a label for the picture then what you
can do you can get the width and height
of your label and then apply to your pix
object so how you can get the width and
height of your label you can just define
inter for example first of all width we
will get the width of our label and then
just call UI label and then call a
method called
width here so just called width and this
will give you the width of your label in
a same way you can call a method called
height which will give you the height of
your level so here declare a variable
called edge and this time we are going
to call height here right so just call
height function which will give you the
height of your label and then you can
pass instead of this 100 you can pass
the width and the height here for your
label so this will resize the image
according to the width and height of
your label right so once again run your
code and let's see what happens and you
can see this image is resized according
to the size of our label right now there
is another way of setting the image to
the label which is using the properties
right so I'm going to comment this code
this is one way of setting the image and
the second way of setting the images
once again I'm going to go to my main
window dot UI file and in here I will
choose the label and then just search
for pixmap property here okay so in the
filter when you just write BI and it
will give you the pixmap property here
right so this property you just need to
click here and then choose the second
option which says choose file ok and
from here you can just choose your file
which is your image the location of your
file right and now this image is
you know set here but still you can see
the size of this image is not you know
perfectly fitting our label this you can
fix by just setting the stylesheet
property here but we haven't learned
this style sheet property how we can set
this style sheet or provide the styles
to our widgets so I'm not going to show
you how you can resize the image you can
just use the you know code way of you
know resizing your image right so I'm
going to just revert this image I'm
going to remove it from the label and I
will just use this code to set the image
in the constructor so something like
this so this is how you can set the
images in your QT GUI application now in
the next video I'm going to show you how
you can provide the resources or
resource folder in your QT GUI
application because for now you can see
this location is coming from my computer
which is not good for our application
when we transfer our application from
one computer to another computer this
location will not work so we need a
fixed location and there is a way of you
know providing this fixed location in QT
using resources so I'm going to teach
you how to use resources in the next
video so I hope you have enjoyed this
video please recommend subscribe and bye
