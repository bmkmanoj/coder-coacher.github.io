video I will show you how to link a list
box with your database so let's see how
can we do that go to your toolbox and
pick up a list box from you this one and
I will drag and drop into my form and I
will resize it okay now I will go to the
code section of this form which is this
and at the top of my code where this
function is there your initialize
function and all just below that I will
make a new function called void is
list box and break it and make it toast
and in here I will write the code for
the list box now if you followed my
tenth video in which I have shown you
how to link a combo box with your
database and how to populate your combo
box with your database I have made this
fill combo function and I have written
this code so just copy that same code
because we are going to require the same
code from here and if you don't know
this code just go to the video number 10
in which I have shown you how to link
your combo box with the database and so
copy the whole code in between the
function and just paste it in your fill
list box function okay
and now we will copy the name of the
listbox and just copy the name and
instead of this line we will paste our
list box name dot items not add like it
and break it closed and in between the
brackets you will pass this function so
copy this and pass it into this these
brackets okay so what this code will do
is it will take the names from your
database and place it into the string
variable and which will place when from
this code this variable or string will
be added into the list box so if you
want to copy the code you can just copy
the code this one
pause the video and copy the code and
now what I will do is I will just copy
this pin combo function and call it
inside my main function a main class
where my initialize component function
is there this is a default function
which is called when your form starts
running so just paste this function
there and now when we run the program
and login password and you can see list
box is populated with the back values
right
and one more thing you can do is like
when you select this name the
corresponding value for name will appear
in the text boxes the same thing you can
also do for list boxes so let's see how
can we do that for the list boxes okay
so just go to your form and select this
list box and double click it this will
lead us to the code for the event of
this list box action perform and once
again go to the form so if you following
if you are following these videos I have
shown you in the last video that is
video number 11 I think how to do the
same thing with the combo box so when
you select some name all the data will
come here so just double click this
combo box and copy the code from the
combo box whole code and go to your form
and double click this list box once
again and paste it there all the code
will be the same just you need to change
this list box from here in the query so
just copy the name of your list box
which is list box with number 1 nice box
1 and replace it in this
wherever you are passing your query
select star from database not table name
where name is equal to so this we have
written in the last video last last
video I think so just see where I have
taken the values from the combo box and
showing the corresponding values it's
video number 11 I think and just replace
the combo box with the list box and now
when you run the program give username
and password correct and when you click
any of the names here the corresponding
name should appear here so let's see yes
they are P they are appearing here so in
this way you can just pass the values
corresponding values to text box also so
I hope you have enjoyed this video

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
