cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how we can
use cutie list widget in QT so let's get
started what I have done is I have
created a blank project and I'm going to
go to my main window dot UI file and in
here I'm going to search for list widget
right so just write list here and there
will be two widget which will appear
here one is list view and other is list
widget
now list view is a model based widget
and it can be used with Model View
architecture which is an advanced topic
so we are going to see it in the later
videos right we are right now interested
in list widgets so just use this latest
widget right so drag-and-drop this list
widget in your main window and if you
want you can apply some you know layout
on it so you can just right click here
and then you can go to layouts and apply
the layouts right so I'm going to right
click layouts and let's say I am going
to apply this vertical layout here so
layout vertically okay and maybe I will
also use a push button here so just
search for push button and drag and drop
here okay now I'm going to go to my edit
mu here and go to my main window dot CPP
file and in here first of all we will
see how we can add item to the list
widgets so just write UI and search for
the list widget and then it takes an
argument which is add item as we have
seen in the combo box right but if you
see here it takes a instance or object
of queue list widget item right so this
is a class you know virtually you are
passing
last object here okay expect a glass
object pointer here so the procedure
will be the same as we have seen in the
case of combo box it can take an item
for example the name mark something like
this and we can repeat this multiple
times and we can say John and some other
name for example true right and then
just save your code and compile it and
let's see what happens when we run our
code so you can see these names are
populated in the list widget okay
so this is simple very simple now for
example I want to show some icons on the
list widget it's a little bit different
from the combo box as we have seen in
the last video so let's add some
resources for the icons first right so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
right-click on my project and I will add
a new resource files QT resource file
choose and the name of the resource
location so for example resource itself
right and then click Next and click
finish
and in here I'm going to add a prefix
first for example re C and then I will
add files so I already have this folder
in my project folder you can just copy
and paste and then I will choose these
images and paste it here right now I
will go to main window dot CPP file and
this time instead of giving this cue I
can as a first argument this in the list
widget this is little bit different so
what I am going to do here is I am going
to declare a cue list widget object so
just right cue
list widget item so just write list
widget item and let's say it's item and
let's initiate it with new list widget
item so just write new cue list widget
item and then the constructor takes few
argument first is the icon itself so you
can now pass the icon so just write Q
icon like this and the location of your
icon so the location of my icon here is
so I want to save it first everything so
I will be able to see this Q RC file so
let me check if my resource files are
there so I'm going to open it with
resource editor save all and I have
these things you can see here so I will
just copy this path using this option
which says copy path and go to main
window and then paste it here right and
then the name so name for example mod
something like this okay and then I can
pass this item here as ad item right and
in the same way I can do it multiple
times so something like this item 2 item
3 and the name will change here so I
will just change the name and maybe I
will also change the paths the paths
here will be different for the icon and
also path for the third item will be the
third image okay and I will pass these
items here so here and here everything
is good so let's run our code and let's
see what happens when we run the code
and it shows us error because I forget
to declare it as pointers right so just
do it as pointers and run your app again
and let's see what happens this time so
now you can see the items are populated
with the you know icons right now in the
next step let's see how we can do some
stuff with this list widget so I'm going
to go to my main window dot UI file and
I'm going to choose my push button and
in here I am going to go to slot and
then clicked okay and in here for
example first of all I want to just
display whatever is there in the list
box so whatever I select in the list
book I want to display it so I will
include for example first of all cue
message box will just write Q message
box and then we can just use it so Q
message box and then the information we
want to show the information and then by
now you will be pro in using I think Q
message box so the title is the second
and then the third is the current item
for example right so what we can do here
so we can just use this q UI list widget
and then you can just use the current
item so let's put here first of all
comma and then use our current list
items will just use current item which
will give us the pointer for the item
right so just write current item and
then we can just ask for the text so
just print text like this okay so let's
run our code and let's see if it gives
or returns or print current item text on
the message box or not so I will choose
mark
and then plus this button and it shows
mark or this other name and it will show
the other name right so simple now for
example you want to do something more
with your items so I will comment this
code for now and what I will do is for
example I will just write UI and then
call a list widget and then using a
current item it will give us the pointer
to the current item so just call current
item and then for example you can do so
many things with it for example you want
to set background color you can just use
set background color and then you can
just say Qt for example QT like this and
then red for example something like this
okay and let's see if it builds or not
or I need to do something else maybe so
it builds so let's run the code and for
example I choose this and press the push
button so the background is set to red
right now let's set the foreground to
something else so you can play with
these things and you know do anything
you want so for example set foreground
which will set the color of the
foreground and let say it will be for
example white okay let's run the code
and let's see what happens this time and
I will choose this option and you can
see the foreground or the text is white
and the background is red right so you
can play with these values and see what
you can do with this list widget you can
also populate this list widget using a
for loop as I have shown you in the last
video for the combo box and I think you
are intelligent enough to you know do
this so I am NOT going to
show you so I hope you have enjoyed this
