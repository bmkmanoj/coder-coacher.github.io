show you how you can install Java on
your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
system so first of all to check where
the Java is installed on your Windows 8
or Windows 8.1 operating system you can
do a small check and what you need to do
is you just need to go to this window
button here and just right click it and
open command prompt and in here you just
need to write Java C and press Enter
and if you see Java C is not recognized
by our command prompt then Java is most
probably not installed on your system
now to install Java we need to download
Java first and then install it and then
configure it on our Windows operating
system so first of all we will install
Java so open your favorite browser and
search for Java JDK Jadakiss stands for
Java development kit and the first link
most probably will come here is from
Java which is www.hyken.com slash Java
slash Java SE just click this link and
in here you will see this two options
for installing Java so this option is
Java for windows and the other option
this NetBeans options which is NetBeans
is a IDE ID e stands for integrated
development environment and it helps you
to you know create or it's just like an
editor to make your Java programs but
right now we are only interested in
installing Java so we are going to click
this link now at the time of making this
video Java platform you can see Java a 2
to 5 is the latest version so you can
just
this Java icon here and in here you have
various options to download but first of
all you can read all this so whatever is
written here and you can see looking for
Java and you need to accept the
licensing agreement first of all so I
will just check this accept license and
terms and conditions and then I will
look for the option which is most
suitable for my Windows operating system
now there can be two kind of Windows
operating system one is 32-bit and other
is 64 bit so my operating system is a
64-bit operating system you can just
check it in your system information by
going to the system category so I know
that my system is a 64-bit operating
system so I will just download this link
which is JDK a two to five windows x86
now if your system is a 32-bit system
you need to download the upper link
which is 4x windows x86 x86 is for
Windows 32 operating system and Windows
x64 is a Windows 64 operating system
64-bit operating system so I will click
this link here now it will take some
time to download this I will just save
this file and you can see it will take
about one minute to download on my
system if you have faster internet then
it can take lesser time on your system
so first of all I will let it download
and then we will install it on our
system so I will just pause the video
for now
so now install download of this Java
executable file or JDK is complete so I
will just open this executable file and
then I will just run it so I will say
yes I will prepare the windows installer
for Java and now the installation can
start this is the setup window which we
you will see so you just need to click
Next and in here you just need to click
Next here and now it will take some time
to get the status and then to install
Java on your system now you just need to
wait for a while while this Java is
installing but I was talking about
knowing your system
type right so you can know whether your
a system is 64 bit or a 32 bit by just
going to this search option and search
for system system and in here you will
be able to see system type and my is
mine is 64 bit but if it's a 32 bit you
will be able to see here 32 bit
operating system with x86 based
processor okay so if you are confused
which type of system you have you can
just go to the system and check which
kind of system you have okay now you can
see it's executed executing installer
and
it's just finishing this getting the
status right so you just need to wait
for the process to complete it can take
some time so I will just pause the video
and I'll let this process complete and
it says the destination folder of this
Java so by default it will be a see
Program Files Java and gr e 8.1 point
depending upon the version now what is
JRE JRE is a Jarah
java runtime environment and this helps
your java programs to run on your system
so you just need to click Next here if
you want to change the directory you can
change but I will prefer the default
path so you don't need to change
anything right click Next and just let
the process complete so I will pause the
video and I will wait for this process
to complete and then I will come to
continue and now you can see here that
Java is installing the process is going
on three billion devices run Java
nowadays
installing Java
okay and it says Java SE development
cake update successfully installed now
click next step to access tutorial or
something if you want to learn Java then
you can click this next tab and it will
open something in your browser whatever
tutorial you may you know see to learn
Java but right now it's not important
you can go here when you click that but
I will just click close here okay now
what I will do is I will go to the place
where I have installed Java so I will go
to the folder in see folder I need to go
to Program Files and in here I can see
this Java folder here and here I can see
two two parts one is JDK and one is JRE
right now in order to set this Java to
my environment variables so that it can
recognize this Java C command
I just need to configure environment
variable so what I will do here is I
will just change the name of this JDK
one point whatever version a little bit
simple name I will give it so that I can
remember so I will rename it and I will
name it as JDK 8 because it's Java 8 and
similarly I can just right-click and
change the path of this JRE folder el
JRE 8 ok now once you go inside this JDK
folder you will see some more folders
here one of them is bin folder and here
all the executable files are here which
are required by Java to compile your
program so just copy this path where
these executable files are c program
files slash Java slash JDK 8 which is
renamed by me slash bin
just copy this folder name and then what
you need to do is once again go through
your Search tab and search for system
once again and in here in system you
just need to go to advanced settings and
in here go to environment variables and
in here in the system variable category
I just need to search for path and just
select this path variable and click add
it and in here you will see so many
things what you need to do simply is go
to the last minimize F so you just need
to go to last and give a semicolon here
give a semicolon in the variable value
and then just copy the same path this
Java bin folder so c program files /
java / j DK h / bin just copy this path
and give it here
at the last after semicolon okay give
this path here and once again give a
semicolon here at the last and I will go
back a little to the Java folder and
then once again I will go to the JRE
folder so go to Java folder and then JRE
8 folder and then go to Ben folder and
same you need to do here just copy the
path go to this environment variable
section and paste it here this time you
don't need to give this semicolon you
can leave it as it is so you just need
to give these two paths for set setting
your environment variable I will click
OK click OK
once again click OK and everything is
set now once again I will check whether
Java is really installed in my system or
not earlier if you remember I will right
click this window button here and I have
opened this command prompt and I have
given the java c c'mon java c and
earlier it was not
responding or it was not recognized by
my system but this time when I when I
execute this Java C command here and
press Enter
I can see different options for this
Java C command and here it says Java C
is can be used with some options and the
source file that means you need just
need to give your source file name for
example HelloWorld dot Java to compile
your HelloWorld dot Java program using
this Java C command so Java C command is
just a compiler command to compile your
Java program so in this way you can
install Java on your Windows 8 or
Windows 8.1 operating system I hope you
