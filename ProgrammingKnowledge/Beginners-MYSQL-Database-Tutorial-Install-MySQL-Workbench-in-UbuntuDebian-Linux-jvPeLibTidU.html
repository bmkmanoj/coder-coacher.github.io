last video I have shown you how to
install MySQL server on your Ubuntu
Linux operating system now in this video
I will show you how to install MySQL
workbench on your Ubuntu Linux operating
system with the help of this open to a
workbench you have the graphical
interface to query your database and you
will be able to manage your database
much more easily then you would be able
to do it with command prompt so let's
get started and how let's see how we can
install ubuntu workbench or MySQL
workbench oh I beg your pardon so open
your terminal and just write this
command on your terminal right sudo apt
that get apt - get install MySQL -
workbench and click enter
and it will ask for your password of
your operating system so I will give my
password and press Enter and it starts
installing your MySQL workbench if you
want to download it then write Y and
press ENTER and this can take about a
minute to install so once you are
with your installation you can just go
to your user dashboard here and click it
and here you
type my SQL and you will be able to see
this MySQL workbench so first of all if
you want to use this mask you'll
frequently just select this MySQL
workbench and drag and drop in your
dashboard here okay now just double
click this MySQL workbench and it starts
opening your MySQL workbench here and
once it starts you can just start
querying your database and managing your
database when you go here at the top tab
you can just go to database and click
query database and you can see your
configurations here all the
configurations and you can click OK and
it asked for your password so whenever
you have installed mysql server on your
system which i have shown you in the
last video you have also given your
password so it my SQL server asks for
your password so you have already set
your password so the just give the same
password here so I give my same password
which I have given while I was
installing MySQL so and I will click OK
and if you want to just save your
password just click this and click OK
and now your MySQL workbench is ready to
use so you can here you can see you can
create a new schema and new databases
from here so that's it for this video
please keep watching these videos and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
