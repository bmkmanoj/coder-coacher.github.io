is equal to G C and once again copy this
MySQL connection write it here and make
a bracket bracket close and copy this
string comm string and paste it in your
brackets now in the next line write by
SQL command and once again this gap sign
and write C empty database
by the way I want to write it's not a
base B capital I can recognize this dot
on base okay
and then is equal to GC GC knew once
again papi the smiles welcome and and
write it here and then here right
bracket and bracket close and in between
this bracket and like a close make one
double quote comma right
or copy this corn database variable and
paste it on to this second place after
comma and in these double quote we will
write our query which we are going to
execute by or in my SQL database so we
will go to our database once again and
we will just click OK here and we hey
guide to our database and it's open I
have already made one database here
called database and it contains one
table called adata you can make your
table according to your use and just go
to edit table data and you can see I
have employee ID name surname age
username and password here so what I
will do is I will right-click it and I
will first of all I will go to one query
tamp this query one and I will right
click and send twice QL and I will
select select all statement and it will
present me a select statement so my
daughter base name is not abhi is my
table name is yah
so database dot e doctor I will write
select star from database dot e data and
as my query
so I'm white select star from database
dot e dot okay this is my database name
this is my table now in the next line
and yeah don't forget to write this
semicolon because when you go here you
can see this semicolon is there when you
execute the query so you need to write
the semicolon here also select star from
database and this is all in double
quotes okay and in the next line write
my SQL data window
once again this capsule and write my
freedom and close it we make a space and
this will read our daughter and now I
will make a try-catch block
and in this crime walk I will write my
code and in this catch I will write
exception cap the X and when this
exception come which will show me the
message and message box message box sure
and in the bracket right px
prime this arrow sign right message so
it will show some message if your
database encounters some endeavor and in
the try block you need to write what you
need to copy this corn database variable
which we have used with MySQL connection
one database copy and paste it here and
write this arrow sign pointer and write
open bracket closed and in the next line
write or copy this my s my reader or
reading my doctor this yesterday is
equal to copy this command database for
MySQL command and gave this arrow sign
once again and then write execute reader
get a packet closed okay so this
completes our code to connect our MySQL
database to our application and not and
now we will try to run this application
and see if it got some error or it can
run so just go to this green button
start debugging press it
press yes would you like to build it say
yes and if our code is correct then it
will run and yes our code is correct so
it's running and when you click this OK
button our query is also correct so if
our query is executed then this will not
show any error that means our code is
correct to check whether our code is
really working what we can do is go here
and in your try-catch block first of all
go to your home design and just note the
name of this text box so the name of
this text box is you can see here in the
property tab the text box name is
message text so just copy this text box
name for this test text box and just
click this smaller one right click check
multi-line so we can make this a bigger
box and then here we can see our data
and just go there just once again click
OK we will go to our code and in here in
the try catch block paste that message
pop test text name and then give this
arrow sign and white text
and right plus is equal to what this
plus will do is this will keep on
writing in your text box it will not
replace your text and then right bracket
and bracket closed and in here just copy
this my reader where he will name paste
it in the box and write this arrow
button and just try to get int 32 in the
bracket right 0 this line what it will
explain it is we are taking the first
column of your database and we are going
to display in this message box so the
first column of my database is employee
ID and it should show me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
up to 7 that's why I have taken this get
int because it's a integer variable type
so once again I will run my program
and it's running now and when I press ok
and it says invalid access to the peel
wheat I'll close it and in here what are
we go here this error comes because I
haven't enclosed my message with a while
statement so I need to write while you
bracket and this will close this message
yeah so this so I've written this while
statement and close this message in that
and in this while I will write copy this
my reader paste it here with this arrow
sign I'll write read so it will read our
database so just do this code and now
once again run your application and it
runs and press ok and you can see 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 this one - 7 number is
representing this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so we
have successfully extracted our database
key ID column in our program so I think
this is a very long video so I will stop
it here and in the next video properly I
will show you how to make a log in a
sign-in page with this windows form
application in C++ so stay tuned and
please read rate comment and subscribe
