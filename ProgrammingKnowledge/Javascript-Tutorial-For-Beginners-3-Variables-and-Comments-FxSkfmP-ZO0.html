JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will learn about comments
and variables in JavaScript so let's get
started with comments you can give
comments in JavaScript in two ways one
is a single line comment and you can
give a single line comment by giving two
forward slashes and then your comment
for example my code okay so this is how
you can give a single line comment and
whatever you write after these two
double forward slashes will not be
executed by your JavaScript code or you
can give a comment by giving these
forward slash and then asterisks and
then Asterix and forward slash okay
and whatever comment you will give in
between this forward slash and Astrix
and Astrix and forward slash it will be
considered as a comment so if you want
to give a multi-line comment you can
give something like this okay so this is
how you can use comments in JavaScript
now let's talk about variable so first
of all what is a variable a variable is
a container which can contain some data
so for example we can assign a variable
or we can name a variable like X and
then we can assign some data for example
one into it right so X is a variable
which contains the value of one now in
JavaScript to declare our variables
there are some rules okay so there are
mainly I think three or four rules you
need to remember whenever declaring the
variable first rule is you can declare a
variable using numbers letters a dollar
symbol or an underscore okay so you can
declare a variable something like
my variable or my variable something
like this okay your variable name can
also start with a dollar symbol so for
example dollar my variable or you can
also start your variable name by
underscore like this my variable okay
you can also declare a variable using a
number after a letter or a keyword for
example you want to declare X one you
can declare a variable but a variable
cannot start with a number so this is
not valid okay so X 1 is valid but 1x is
not valid because your variable cannot
start with a number the next rule is
your variable cannot contain the
reserved keywords in JavaScript so there
are a number of keyword which are
reserved in JavaScript and with this
course when we learn more we will learn
more about these keywords for example
there is a keyword called var or there
is a keyword called function these are
reserved keywords and you cannot declare
a variable using these keywords ok now I
will show you some more interesting
stuff so if you have a Google Chrome
browser just open your Google Chrome
browser and then right-click on it and
then go to the last option which says
inspect element ok and this is the thing
which will help you to debug and find
the errors into your JavaScript code so
for example go to console here and in
here for example I will declare a
variable called X is equal to 1 and
press Enter
and it will give you the result 1
something like this I will make it a
little bit bigger so it will give you
the result 1 right
or for example you can give a variable
called Y is equal to five and it will
give you the result five now you have
two variables x and y which you can use
in your console here so for example X
plus y when you enter it will give you 6
because X is equal to 1 and Y is equal
to 5 and when you add these two it will
give you 6 right now I have told you
that our variable cannot start with a
number so let's check here if this
variable when we declared with a number
will it pass or not so 1 my well for
example ok we'd start with a number and
press ENTER and it will give you this
error which says uncaught syntax error
right so this is not allowed but when we
declare a variable something like my
well and assign some value in here then
it's not going to give you the error now
let's try to declare a variable with the
underscore for example underscore my
well is equal to 1 and press Enter it's
totally valid and now let's try to
declare a variable with a dollar symbol
so dollar and my well and this is equal
to 6 for example and it's also totally
valid okay so this console will help you
to debug your code and even show you if
you have some errors in your code right
now let's see how these variable works
in JavaScript so for example you declare
a variable called X is equal to 6 and Y
is equal to 10 okay so I have already
told you that you can do something like
X plus y and it will give you the sum
and whenever you
do X or Y minus X then it will give you
the subtraction you can do the opposite
X minus y and it will give you the minus
value right now to multiply these two
numbers you can do Y multiplied by X so
Astrix is the multiplication symbol in
JavaScript so press Enter it will give
you the multiplication whenever you do
for example Y divided by X so Y divided
by X is 1.6 whatever is the value of
this division it will give you now there
is a special symbol called mod in
JavaScript so whenever you do Y mod X
and press Enter
then it will give you the remainder of
the division of the variable you are
dividing so the value of y was 10 and
the value of x was 6 so when you divide
Y by X then you will get 4 as remainder
so this modulus gives you the remainder
now javascript is also intelligent
enough to recognize what operation you
want to do with your numbers for example
you want to do 4 minus 4 multiplied by 5
it will give you minus 16 and not 0
right so it will give the importance to
the multiplication first and then the
subtraction or for example you want to
divide and multiply and add or subtract
something at the same time it will give
the precedence something like
multiplication then division then
addition and then the subtraction ok or
if you want to make your code more clear
you can do something like this so you
can add a bracket here and inside this
bracket you can do 4 minus 4 and then
after the bracket you can do multiply it
by 5 and press Enter it will give you 0
because
this bracket has more priority than your
multiplication or your division symbols
okay so in this way you can use these
variables and comments in JavaScript by
the way if you are using Firefox you can
also use these consoles so go to Firefox
and right-click and once again go to
inspect element and in here go to
console and you have this console here X
is equal to 1 it will give you the same
answer okay so if you have a Firefox or
Google Chrome you can debug your code
and find errors in it and do many more
things with this view here so I hope
