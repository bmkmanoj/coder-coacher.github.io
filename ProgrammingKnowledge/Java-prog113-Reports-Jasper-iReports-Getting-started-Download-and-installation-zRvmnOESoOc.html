have shown you how to generate reports
with the help of I text and in this
video and in the coming few videos I
will show you how to generate report
with the help of Jesper report or I
report so let's get started first of all
what you need for generating report is I
report installer so go to your browser
and write my report with Windows
installer download and first link that
comes is I report designer version 4.7
download which is on the side just
before JH so I will click it and this
window will open at the time of making
the video this is version 4.7 and in the
future it may be revised so keep in mind
and then this is the windows installer
for IronPort 0.7 so just click it and
download it I have already downloaded it
so I do need to do it and it's pretty
simple to install you just have to click
view next button next next next and you
will be good to go
the second thing you need to download is
Jasper report Java file so go to your
browser and write just for report 4.7
jar because my version I have downloaded
for I report is version 4.7 I'm
downloading the same version jar file
some time it happens that you have
different version of I report install
our designer and if you use other for
example 4.5 version jar it creates some
problem so make sure that your I report
designer version and just pearl report
jar version is same and just it shows
the in the first link source Forge site
and which host this just by report
download and when you go to the download
site of source watch you need to
download this zip file which have
maximum number of downloads you can see
here this zip file so I have also this I
have already downloaded it so I will
need to download just downloaded and
unzipped it to your specified position
after downloading these two things and
after installing your I report designer
your I report designer I can will look
like this so I will click it to
open it it will take some time by the
mean time I will show you how to add the
jar file into your project just go to
your projects and
and go to the libraries here once again
go to the project you're making and go
to its libraries why click it go to the
properties and it's taking some time to
open and so this is the project
properties window click Add jar file or
folder and what you need to do is go to
the folder in which you have extracted
your zip file just for report 4.7 zip
file this is mine just for report 4.7 I
will click it and go to the libraries
you can see so many jar files generally
you don't need all the files but I
prefer to select all and press open ok
and once again go to the jar file and
once again the just purport for pencil
previously you have gone in libraries Li
B and now you will go to D is T here and
click it
and you also need to include these four
jar files
also and click open I have already have
these files I would not click open and
after this all the jar file will come
here and then click OK
so this in this way you can install your
report designer and you can add the jar
file into your NetBeans IDE and I think
it's ready and this is your pie report
designer which looks like this and now
in the next video I will tell you how to
connect the database with this my report
on just per report and how to use it in
NetBeans so I hope you have enjoyed this
tutorial and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
