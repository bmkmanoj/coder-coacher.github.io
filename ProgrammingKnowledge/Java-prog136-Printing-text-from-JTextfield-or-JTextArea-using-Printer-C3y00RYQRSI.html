video number 134 I have shown you how to
read a file or load a text file into
your text box or J text area so in that
video I have shown you how to load a
text file for example I have some text
file and I select it and it loads the
text file into my text area or text box
okay so now lot of you guys have asked
me to give a code how this text area
content can be printed out so in this
video I will show you how to print the
content in the text area so for this for
uploading or for showing the text file
into the text area I have shown you in
the video number 134 whose title is like
this Java Prague 134 how to read the
entire text file and display it in the
j-2x peeler J text area so I am just
extending that code and I will now add a
code to print that this whole text which
is there in the text file so for example
when I press this button this print
frame will come before me and if you
have a PDF or Adobe installed in your
system then it will show Adobe PDF also
but I don't have it so the default is
microsoft XPS document
and when I press print it says printing
in process and when I and it asked me to
give our name of the print so I will
name it as print it's coming like that
okay so print and when I press ok yeah
or save then printing will be done right
when printing is done and it will show
you done printing ok so this I'm going
to tell you in this video and when
you're printing is done then you will be
able to see a file which is in the form
of XPS file so that I will show you in
this video
so this is xpl XPS file which is created
and when I open it it in the form of XPS
file all the text which is there in the
text area so let's see the code really
fast so what I have done is this is the
code for reading the file so if you want
the code for that just go to with your
number 134 now in this video I have
added this print button so they go to
your palette and take a print button and
just go right click it go to event
action an action perform and this I have
written this code so first of all right
or try-catch block and in the catch
right printer exception e so this is the
printer exception if this gives you some
error while writing then just right
click and then fix import so your big
imports for ping printer will be fixed
okay and just write J option pain dot
show message dialog null comma E so it
will show any exception for printer now
in the try block just write this code so
right boolean complete is equal to J
text area 1 which is your text area name
variable name
this is J text area 1 and dot print so
boolean complete is equal to J text area
1 got complete if and copy this variable
and write in the condition if complete
then in the if condition show our J
option pain so J option pain dot show
dialog and in the bracket right null
comma done printing so this is the
message you will get whenever
printing is complete comma whatever you
want to give the name of your J option
pain title so Q here I am giving
information comma J option pain dot
information message so this is the
information type of J option pain that's
why it's information message or else
right J option pain dot show dialog and
in the bracket null comma printing this
is a message I'm passing if it's not a
complete comma printer this is the title
of the the option pain and comma J
option pain dot Haran message okay so
this I can really come in on J option
pain so write this code to print the
document if you want you can just copy
the code also I mean make it visible in
your screen so just pause the video and
copy the code and once again when I
right-click it and run the program and I
once again choose text file from here so
some text file at this one
select an open text file is open in the
text area and then when I press print
the print frame will come and you select
select your type of document you can do
some page setting if you want monochrome
color whatever you want to select number
of coffee copies and just press print so
it will show printing in process just
give the name if your printer is
installed then it will not show this
give name and all that so it will
directly print your J text area but in
my case it's not printed right now so
that's why it's asking me for the name
so I will say save and then the printing
is complete and now I go to see my print
file and I right-click it and open it
with XPS viewer because it's in XPS file
and you can see it's there so in this
way you can print the content of J text
area or J text box with the help of your
NetBeans Java project I hope you have
learned something new this time please
