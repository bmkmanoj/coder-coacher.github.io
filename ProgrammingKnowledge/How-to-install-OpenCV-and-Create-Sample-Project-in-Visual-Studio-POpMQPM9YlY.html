how to install OpenCV on your Windows
operating system and how to configure it
with visual studio so let's get started
first of all what is open CV open CV is
a set of libraries which is generally
used for real-time computer vision and
it mainly focuses on real-time image
processing so if you have some project
which aims to do image processing then
it's a very good library so let's
install OpenCV on your system so just
open your browser and right here open CV
and first link you will see here is open
CV dot o-r-g and here you can see the
listed latest version of open CV at the
time of making this video the latest
version is two point four point seven so
we are going to download the same so
just click this download button and just
choose this first option open CV per
Windows and when you click it it will
open the open source SourceForge
link and you will be able to download
the file so this file is a little bit
big file about 2 GB so it will take a
few minutes to download so I have
already downloaded this file you can see
it here and let's configure this file
and install it on our system so I will
just click this and it will open this
run command and just run it and here the
important step when it asks for the
location where you want to extract this
app I'll just provide here C folder so
you want to extract this file at your C
folder right
just click extract and it will start
extracting your file once you are done
with the extraction in your C folder you
will be able to see this open CV folder
created and just when you go inside that
folder you will have this built folder
and source folder so you can build this
OpenCV library for visual studio by
using for example c make and you can use
it with Visual Studio 2010 but I'm going
to show you the simple way by using
these built libraries and we are going
to use these DLL so let's change the
name of this folder first because open
CV or continuously keep on releasing the
new versions so if you have the newer
version you will be able to extract that
file in your C folder so I will just
rename this folder as open CV 2 4 7
because it's version two point four four
point seven right now we are going to
set our in environment variable so that
when we use it with Visual Studio the
DLL files will be automatically
recognized so just go to your Start
button here and just right-click your
computer and click on properties and
here it will open this window so just go
to advanced system settings and here
click environment variables
and here in system variables here just
search for path this path and just
double click it and here you need to add
the path to the dll files so let's see
where we have so go to your build folder
so first of all this is my open CV
247 folder then I will go to build
folder and here I have x86 folder and
here I have two options Visual Studio
2010 and Visual Studio 2011 I will
choose vc10 or Visual Studio 2010 and
here we I have this bin folder I will go
inside and here we have the DLL files so
I will just copy that this Park whole
path here and I will go to the setting
of path and I will just after this
whatever your path is given just provide
a semicolon here and paste your path
which is C and your open CV directory
then build slash x86 slash vc10 slash
bin and click OK and click OK once again
and click OK once again ok so now we are
done with the configuration of
environment
so let's create up Visual Studio C++
program and let's see how we can use
this with Visual Studio 2010 so I have
opened already Visual Studio 2010 I will
just go to file here click on file and
new new project
and here I will go to here visual c++
windows 32 console application and here
I will make a project called open CV
test for example and I will click OK and
it will open one more dialog box for
asking which kind of project you want so
just click Next here and we are going to
make a empty project so just click this
empty project and finish click finish
and it will
take some time to finish okay so our
project is made and what we need to do
is now we need to do some configuration
to use this OpenCV with this project so
what you need to do is just go to your
project in your solution explorer just
right-click your project name right
click and just click properties here and
here you will be able to see this so we
see plus-plus directory and linker here
so what you need to do is go to this VC
plus plus directories and here go to
include directories just click it and
click this button here and just click
Add it here and we here we are going to
add the include file from OpenCV so just
click this button and we are going to
just click this button once again and we
browse for the opencv files go to your C
folder where you have extracted your
open CV file so this is my file open CV
2 4 7 and here I will go to belt and I
will go to include and don't go further
just include this this pile path till
include and just click select and you
will be able to see this C slash open CV
4 2 4 7 / build slash include click OK
and then just go to this library
directories and just click Edit once
again and just click this new line and
click this button once again and once
again browse your C folder and then open
CV
- ho seven and build and now go to this
x86 folder and we see ten and then
select lib so just go here and select it
and click OK and it's good to select one
more directory so just once again after
this vc10 Lib folder once again click
this button
uline select this button and once again
go to this C folder and open CV build
x86 vc10 and select this bin folder also
ok and select folder so you have this
open C we build x86 /v c then bin bin
folder and you have this open CV two
four seven build slash x86 slash vc10
slash lib folder also and click OK and
is it ok no we need to add the libraries
also so go to here linker and go here
input and go to additional dependencies
here and just click it and add it and
here you need to add this libraries so
if you go to your open CV folder this is
my open CV folder where bin folder is
there and in x86 we see 10 and in bin
folder there are some DLL files so I
want to link this libraries with my
Visual Studio C++ console program right
so in mice c+ first program I need to
write or or link these libraries so what
I will do is
I will paste the library need libraries
names here and don't worry I will
provide the list of all these libraries
in the description so you just need to
copy all these libraries and paste it
here one important thing to remember
here is this for example we have this
open CV underscore core and then we have
the version which we have downloaded so
we have downloaded the version two point
four point seven so here the library
name will be open CV and the scope for
two four seven for the version two point
four point seven so if you have another
version for example if you have two
point four points eight then you need to
change this library name to two four
eight okay and this D after the this
number symbolises that we are going to
link this type libraries to our debug
compiler so here make sure this is debug
here right and this D indicates that we
are making it our debug compile the
library so if you delete this D from
here you need to change this debug to
release folder so just remember that and
click OK and click apply and then click
OK and one more thing we can do here is
in your general folder here just for to
be on the safer side just click on use
library dependency input as yes and now
click apply and click OK now once we
have done with these include and
libraries configuration we are going to
make
a new CPP file so just click right click
your source file and add new item and
just click this C++ file which is dot
CPP and we name it as main dot CPP file
ok so give your file name as main dot
CPP and just click add and we have this
main dot CPP file here so if you have
done your configuration correctly then
you will be able to include these open
CV CV libraries in your project so go at
the top and write include and write open
CV right so you now can recognize this
open CV directories and just choose CV
dot H and just close it and once again
we are going to include one more
directory which is include open CV and
then hi GUI dot H and close it and now
we are going to make our main program
first of all just right here using
namespace CV so we don't need to use CV
namespace again and again and just write
int main and just close this and here in
this main we are going to write a
program so for example I am going to
write a program to open a image
and then whatever you want to do with
image you can do it so this is just the
sample that our libraries are working so
let's see so I will write some code here
which is like this so this is just a
sample program to test whether my OpenCV
libraries are working or not so maybe
this sample program also I will provide
in the link in the description below so
you can just click the link and just
copy this program to check here one
thing to notice here is this image path
so whatever image you want to analyze
just give your path here and just we are
ready to run and compile our libraries
so let's see if it compiles or not so I
will compile I will go to build and I
will say build solution and it's done I
think right so build is successful now
one more thing you need to do is so I
will run the program and I will show the
problem first and then I will so show
the solution so just run your program
and it's running now so you have done
your configuration correct okay and this
was the image I want to see in this
folder so that's why I have given the
path of this file and if this program
shows some error then your linkage from
the libraries is not correct so just
for the other solution what you can do
is if you cannot link this program with
the library just right-click your
project folder and go to the properties
not in the properties but right click it
once again oh and go to open folder in
Windows Explorer and it will open the
project folder and just go to one step
back and just go here in the debug
folder and in here you will be having
your executable file so if it shows some
error related to DLL files then what you
need to do is just go to this folder
where you have install OpenCV then build
then go to x86 vc10 and then bin and
just copy all the file files from here
copy all the dll file from here go to
your project and wherever you have your
executable file paste all the dll files
here so it will link to those dll files
and you will not see the error related
to dll if it shows the error related to
dll but right now our configurations are
right so we don't need to add those dll
files so in this way you can install and
configure OpenCV with your Visual Studio
2010 I hope you have enjoyed this video
