show you how you can download and
install Visual Studio code editor on
your Ubuntu operating system so what is
Visual Studio code Visual Studio code is
a source code editor developed by
Microsoft for Windows Linux and Mac OS
it includes the support for debugging
embedded gate control
syntax highlighting intelligent code
completions Nighy pets and even code
refactoring and the best thing about it
is it's highly customizable so user can
customize it according to their need
right and it's open source of course
right so let's see how we can download
and install Visual Studio code so first
of all open your favorite browser and
then search for Visual Studio code and
then just search for Visual Studio code
and the first link which will appear
here will be from code dot visual studio
comm so just click this link and you
will be in the studio website now there
are two options here one is for Debian
based operating system and one is for
Red Hat based operating system so
because the bun two is Debian based so
we will download this dot de Bie file
and just click this button and spoon to
start your download so just save
wherever you want and it's about let's
see how big file is it so it's about 33
megabyte of you know file so it will
take some time to download once it's
downloaded we will see how we can
install it so the file is downloaded now
so we will see that it's downloaded on
the folder explorer
so this is the file dot DB file in my
downloads folder right so I'm going to
minimize my browser and what I am going
to do next is I am going to open my
terminal
to open my tunnel I have used this ctrl
alt T command which will open my
terminal and then I am going to go to my
downloads folder and when I LS here and
it lists out all the files in folder
which are there in my downloads folder
right now to run this file you have two
options one is by using ubuntu software
center or other is by using the command
line so we are going to use the second
option which is by using command line so
just give this command sudo and then
dpkg and then - i black and the name of
your file so the name of my file is code
or and whatever the version is and then
the amd64 dot BEB so this is the name of
my file so sudo dpkg - i and the name of
the file and then press enter which is
going to ask for your password just give
the password and it's going to take few
seconds to install this visual studio
code editor and once it's installed we
are going to see how we can open it and
how we can you know lock it here to this
menu here right so let it complete first
of all so the installation is complete
now to open the visual studio code you
need to go here at the top and then
search for code for example just search
code and which is going to give the
first option visual studio code so just
open this visual studio code editor and
i'm going to minimize my name terminal
also and for the first time when we use
to you code opens it's going to look
like a normal a beta and here i can see
this you know visuals - the phone icon
on my left hand bar right so here i can
just right click on this left hand bar
and then I can click lock to the
launcher which is going to lock this
visual studio code to
this launcher lapin bar so whenever you
close this zoo studio code editor also
so I'm going to close it and then once
again when I go here I can see this icon
and once I click this icon is going to
open the visual studio code again right
so for the first time it's it's going to
look normal which is like a normal
editor so you can see there is a button
which is for gate control so if you are
using gate control you can go here and
then it's going to list out all the
files which are changed or you know
whatever action you have done on your
files on the gate source file it's going
to show here everything right and then
if you are doing the debugging for
example for C++ or know chess or any
other you know language you are using
you can use this section here and the
favorite part of mine is this section
which is for adding the extension to the
visual studio code so you can see there
is an extension for c-sharp so this
extension you can see see shop for
visual studio code so you can use it for
developing c-sharp application then
there is a Python also then C and C++
and this is for es length which is for
JavaScript right there is a beautify
option so when you install it then you
can you know beautify your code by right
clicking and then you know beautify the
code this also has the native option of
right-clicking in the formatting code so
when I go here and for example I will
create a file here so for example let's
create a file and then when I
right-click it has the you know
formatting option so I'm going to first
of all save this file so once again file
and then save as and let's save it on
the home folder itself and for example I
named it as
index dot JSP okay so JavaScript right
and then I can write some code here and
right away you can see the code
highlighting feature and when I
right-click here I have the option to
format this document right so when I
just do something like this and then
right-click and format it's going to be
formatted the code will be formatted
right so you can see there are lots and
lots of extension you can add to your
you know we will studio code editor
using this button so you know there are
many you know third-party extensions
also there are many visuals through the
code extension native extensions also so
whatever language you want to develop we
can you know you know install the
extension for that language and that
support right so in this way you can
download and install Visual Studio code
on your open to operating system I hope
