last video I have shown you how to
connect your database with cue table
view so in the last video I have shown
you when I click this load table button
it loads your data in the database in
this table view so I have some data in
my database and which I wanted to show
you show in this table view and this I
have shown in the last video in this
video I will show you how to connect a
list box with your database so this is a
table and for example I want to list out
all the names in the database in a list
box so how can I do this I will show you
in this video so let's get started let
me make the rule for the list box so I
make this table view little bit smaller
and I will go to this item views and I
will go to this model based item views
and I will take a list view from here
and I will drag and drop here and I will
just resize a little and I want to load
the list of all name which is there in
the database in this list box and for
example by clicking this button itself
in the last video I have used this
button to load the table this time I
will load ListView with this button so
let me change the title or text of this
button instead of load table this time I
will write load list
and this I have done because I'm going
to use most of the code from the last
video so if you haven't seen my last
video just go and watch it and then you
will be able to understand what I am
doing here also so I will right click my
button and go to slot click and click OK
and in here in the last video I have
written this code so first of all I have
made a log in class object this I have
explained you why I am using this login
object because I have connection with
the database connection open in
connection close function in this login
class and I want to use them so that's
why I created an object then I created a
queue SQL model and model object and
then I opened a connection with the
database so I write corn which is my log
in class object dot I call the function
connection open with the database then I
made a query object
so I write Q SQL query and give it a
query object is equal to new SQL query
and I connect I use my already connected
database which is my DB and then I
prepared a query so I just copied and
pasted this query object here and I
prepared a query and I pass this SQLite
query here this we are going to change
in this video so because a list can have
only one column that's why we are going
to change this query a little so for
example in this video we want to load
the list of all names so instead of
using select employee
name and surname we will just write
select name from your table name right
and then I execute our query and then I
set this query into my model object so I
execute the query and load all the data
in a query and then transfer it to the
model and this model we have transferred
in the last video to the table view but
in this video we are using ListView so I
will go to my forms once again and I
will select my ListView I will copy the
name of my ListView
once again go to slot click and instead
of this UI the pointer or arrow pointer
table view I will replace this table
view by a ListView so two changes I have
made in this last code first of all
because we are using only one column and
list you can have only one column that's
why we have selected only one column
from database and then we have set the
model to the ListView and once your data
is loaded in the ListView I am closing
the connection and if any error I am
showing here let's try and run the
program first and build and run
and login ID and when I click this load
list my list of all names which is there
in the database this mark John Peter
Julie so in the same way mark John peter
julie and other names are listed and in
the same way you can load any column for
example e ID or surname you can load or
any column which is there in the in the
table or database table you can load it
here okay so I think you understand what
I have done here and you will use it in
your project somewhere and keep watching
these videos and keep subscribing liking
these videos and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
