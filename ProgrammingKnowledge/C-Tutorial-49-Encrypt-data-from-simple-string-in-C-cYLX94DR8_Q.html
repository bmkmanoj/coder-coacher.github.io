video I will show you how to encrypt and
decrypt data using your c-sharp windows
form application so let's first quickly
see what encryption means according to
Wikipedia so in Wikipedia if you search
for encryption then this line according
to this line cryptography in encryption
is a process of encoding messages in
such a way that hackers cannot read it
but the authorized party can so
encryption is converting your simple
string into non readable form and so
that some other party can not read it
which is unauthorized to read it but if
the authorized person which has some
secret decryption key he would be able
to decrypt your encrypted data so this
can be very useful when you want to hide
your dot or when you want secrecy with
your data so that's why we use
encryption and I will also want to show
you the what type of decryption or
encryption we are going to use so in
this particular video I am going to show
you advanced encryption standard also
called AES encryption which is widely
used and it converts your simple string
into this Rendlesham which is a type of
encrypted string okay and if you want to
know about AES and encryption then you
can also do
Gullit and see on the Wikipedia page for
more explained nation so let's see the
code so what I have done is I have taken
three labels one I named it as simple
text second as encrypted text and third
as decrypted text and I also have taken
three text boxes one in this text box I
will end the simple string and when I
press this encryption button it will
convert it into encrypted string and
when I want booty crypt and that then I
would press this button and then it will
decrypt the encrypted string and once
again in it will show you in the
original form in this text box so these
two buttons I have taken these three
text boxes are taken and these three
labels I have taken so take these all
tools and I have also changed the name
of these text boxes according to their
use so first text box I have named as
text box plain text because it was used
or it is used to contain clean text and
second text box is for encrypted text
that's why I have named that it as text
box encrypted text okay and in the same
way third text box is for decryption of
data so I have named it as text box
underscore decrypted taught underscore
text
okay so just change the name so you will
not be confused now the coding in this
video will show you how to encrypt your
data and in the next video I will show
you how to decrypt that data so let's
just double click this encryption but
and you come to the encryption button
click event here we are going to write
our encryption code but first of all we
need to include some namespaces so right
using go at the top and here you write
using system dot security dot
cryptography so this is the
cryptographic library we are going to
use in this code so just import this
library and you swipe this code at the
top of your code once again to the form
and then double click this and in here
we will write our code but before that
I'm going to declare some global
variables so I will go and top after
this form declaration where my
initialized component is there and there
is a declaration of my home function
below that I will just declare these
variables so declare these all variables
first is string which is and I have
given the name Schaefer data so it will
contain our encrypted string data into
this string variable then declare byte
array and I named it as Shiva bytes
then once again bites clean bites third
byte array is plain bites - and fourth
byte array is plain key okay so declare
these variables and I have declared our
object also symmetric algorithm Oh des
obj so declare this also
okay so just declare these things and
now just copy this des object and go to
here there your initialized component
function is there just paste it there
this variable and Y is equal to reindeer
God v8
not create racket um very closed
so just declare this object here so when
your program will be run or when you run
your program this object will be called
when you first run your program and this
will run throughout your program so just
write this and this and now we will
write the code for encryption so double
click this button once again and in here
write this code so this is the Schiffer
data which is string the variable which
we have declared above so I will show
you this variable we have just a clear
Shakur data and in this ship without a
string variable we will transfer the
plain text so this is the name of your
text box this one and dot text so
whatever we enter in the text box as a
simple string it will transfer that
string into this variable and then write
plain bytes is equal to plain bytes is
also we have declared above is equal to
n coding dot ASCII dot cat bites and
just copy this variable and paste it
here and in the third line right plain
key which or also we have declared above
is equal to encoding dot ASCII dot get
bytes and in the bracket we will pass
pass the custom key for our encryption
this will this key will be contained
only by the authorized person and this
key has
sighs fixed-size I have given it the
size of 16 bit so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15 so 0 to 15
so total 16 characters are there okay so
just provide your key here which should
be the multiple of 8 okay and then write
the es object which we have declared
above the object for rain bill dot key
is equal to clean key which is this
variable so we are passing in the rain
deal object key from here okay so this
object dot key is equal to plane key and
in next line write obj dot mode so this
is the mode or encryption is equal to
Shippo mode dot CBC you can also provide
some other modes like cfb cts ECB and so
all the description you can be able to
see here and whatever kind of Shippo
mode you want to select just select
according to yourself okay I am just
selecting CBC mode okay
and then right des object which we have
also declared above dot padding this is
a padding for your text is equal to
padding mode dot pkcs7 which is a
standard padding mode for your
encryption then right system dot IO dot
memory stream and give it a variable
name ms is equal to mu system dot IO dot
memory stream packet and bracket closed
and in this next line we will declare
crypto stream is CS is even the new
crypto stream and in the bracket right
ms which is this variable comma tes
object which we have declared a bird
above thought create M crypto racket
like a closed comma crypto stream mode
dot right okay and in the next line just
copy this variable paste it here dot
right and in the bracket right plane
bytes which is this variable and which
we have also declared above comma 0
comma plane by its dot length bracket to
break it closed and then we will just
close this crypto stream variable and in
here we will pass our stream memory
stream into this byte arrays so this
also we have declared above Schiffer
bytes is equal to M s dot to array
bracket and bracket closed and then
write M s not close so we are also
closing our memory stream and then we
are just passing our Shiva byte which is
this variable into our text boxes for
encrypted text box so write n text box
encrypted text this is the name of the
text box this one second
Xbox and then dot text is equal to n
coding dot ASCII dot get string and just
passed this variable here so this all is
the code for encryption so if you want
you can just copy the code and when
you're done with this we are going to
check our code so run the code and I
will write here
hello void and I press encryption so you
see it has converted our normal string
into our encrypted strings which cannot
be read read it bias somehow
unauthorized person so that's it about
encryption and the this decryption of
code I will show you in the next video
so stay tuned and please rate comment
and subscribe bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
