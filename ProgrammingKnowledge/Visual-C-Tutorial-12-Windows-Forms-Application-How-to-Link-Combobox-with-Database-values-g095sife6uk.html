combo box with this text box and these
button for adding and deleting some
strings into this combo box in this
video I will show you how to populate
your combo box with data from database
so for example I have this MySQL
yes here and I want to populate the name
field into my combo box so all the names
should appear into the combo box so how
can I do that I will show you so go to
my program I will delete this text box
because I don't need it now and just
this combo box so what I will do is I
will go to my source code Anna and I
will go to the bottom of the program and
just when where my last function is
ending I will give a space there and I
want to create a new function which is
user-defined function which is made by
me for populating my combo box so I will
make a function which is called private
: void pill combo void and break it and
break it closed and in this I will write
a method to fill the combo box okay
now what I mean do is I will go to my
design
and I will double click this Save button
and in here I have shown you how to save
data with the help of your button click
event so I will just copy this code once
again in order to save the time if you
don't know how this code is written you
can see my previous videos and there I
am shown how to write this save code so
I will copy the whole code from this
string to the end of this catch block so
copy and I will paste in my new function
which is combo filter function so hold
data is pasted here I will delete this
message box because this is not required
in this code and in here instead of
passing this insert Kweli which we have
seen in the save data code
I will just delete all the queries till
the semicolon I will leave the semicolon
so I just have double quote semicolon
come double quote and here I will write
my query select star from my database
name which is database dot my table name
which is that my daughter need best name
I will show you this is my database name
and this is the table name in which my
daughter is present so that's why I have
written not a base not eat out of here
okay and go down and now we write some
code into our while loop so first of all
I will declare a string
and then this cap sign and I renamed my
variable as the name and break it closed
and then in the next line what I will do
is I will copy this my reader variable
name which is my SQL data reader
variable name paste it here we provide a
arrow pointer and I will write get get
string and break it and break it closed
and in this bracket I will write the
column which I want to show so right now
I in my database I want to show this
name column into my combo box
so this is the column name which is name
so I'm right here
name the name of my column in the
database and then in the next line I
will go to design pen and I will just
select this combo box and copy its name
which is combo box one go to the code
once again and
in the next life here I will paste the
combobox name and then that arrow point
iTunes then arrow point to once a game
pad bracket and bracket closed and I
forgot to assign this valuable so I will
copy this string variable paste it here
and give equal to sign here so what it
will do is it will execute this select
query and it will take all the values of
name column and place it into this
variable so because it's in a while loop
it will take name one by name one by one
and populate your combo box so just copy
this variable name once again and paste
it in between this add bracket so this
is this three line code I think it
should work so let's try and run the
program
no it's not running so let's see what is
the problem okay so the problem is here
where I have deleted my text boxes and
add button and display delete button
from here but I haven't deleted the code
for that so just I will just delete that
code and then drive to run the program
so let's try and run the program yes
maybe right username and password it's
correct and then here my combo box
should fill but it's not having any
values why because we made our function
but we haven't called it anywhere so I'm
going to copy my function from here and
I will go at the top and just go to the
point where this code is written form 2
which is my form name void and where
these initialize component function is
called this is a function which
initializes all the default function so
I will just paste my welcome function
here so whenever my program starts or
initializes it will initialize my combo
box function also so it this combo box
function will fill the values in my
combo box so let's try and run the
program once again
once again username and password okay
now it should fill yes
John John Jack need mark max let's see
all the value matches yes John John Jack
mark max
so all this column is here so let's try
see you can see here and here the values
are same so in this way you can fill
your combo box in the next video I will
show you how to fill these T's text
boxes on the basis of selected name so
for example when you select the name
John corresponding to the name John all
the values of John from the database
should appear in these text boxes so
that I will show you in the next video
so please stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
