today I am going to teach you how to use
tabbed pane so what is attempt pane
tabbed pane looks like this whenever you
click a tab this whatever W click the
same tab information will be seen if you
click this you can see another tab if
you click this you can see another and
if you click this you can see another
tab this is really useful whenever in a
jframe you have little space and so many
information to share so you can always
use tabbed pane in order to make your
information concise or and that at a
place so just you can click and you can
see the particular information in the
tab so let us get started how to use
tabs in your program so we have made a
project now we will take we will go to
the palette take a time to paint place
it here and make it a little bit bigger
so
understand but when you see this this
don't look like a tab this is because
you need to add some tabs inside this
tabbed pane how can you can do that go
to your pallet take a panel yeah you
heard it right
take a panel not tab pain take a panel
drag it to your tabbed pane and when you
see the dashed bar on the border of your
tab pin just leave the panel or click
the mouse so one tab is added in the
same way if you want to add another tab
drag your panel to your tab and when you
see you have to drag it like that you
should see the dashed border around your
tab then only you should leave your
panel and be like that and if you leave
the panel like that only it will not
become a tab unless it this border you
are not seeing you leave dependent like
that clear look like this also do it
like that
what happens when you need a tab inside
a tab you can do that also how to do
that just click outside on your tab pane
or here where no tab is there right
click it then
go to enclose in and go to tabbed pane
enclose in a damp name so you can see a
tab inside a tab and then when you need
to add these tabs here you need to just
click here once again right click add
from palette swing containers and click
down pain okay there is one another
damn this is for stamp inside this three
times out there ii am inside this there
is no time so you just drag a panel
places inside it so these tabs will look
like this three two now how to change
the name if you want to change this name
right click it click the edit button and
give the name for example user info
right-click a marks and
document so you can give the names also
from here
like that
this way you can give this the names and
one more thing you can select for
example click here tab and go to the
properties from here you can select
index for example what is the index this
top is a first index 0th index this low
is a first index and inside this there
is another tab where user info 0th index
the marxist first index and document is
second in this so you can go and change
the properties default it should open
the 0th index you can change it to 1 so
whenever you run the program it will
show first in right index whenever you
run the program you can also change the
position of these tabs from here tab
placement right now it's on top you can
take and
you can see it goes to the bottom
and you can make it on right so you your
tab will appear on right and left also
your template appear on left you can do
that also
and what else
I think that's it for this tutorial I
hope you learned something new today and
please do comment and give feedback to
this tutorial so I can improve if any
mistake I have done please give me your
pre feedback and thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
