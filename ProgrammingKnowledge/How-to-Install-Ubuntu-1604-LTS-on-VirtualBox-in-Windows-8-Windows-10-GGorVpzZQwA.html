show you how you can download and
install Ubuntu version 16.04 on your
VirtualBox virtual machine now those of
you who don't know what is VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a software using which you
can run different type of operating
system on your native machine so you
don't need to uninstall anything for
running an extra operating system on
your host machine for example I have
Windows machine and I want to install
Ubuntu on my machine I don't need to
uninstall Windows this VirtualBox
software will allow me to use Ubuntu for
example as a virtual machine on my host
machine so if you don't know how to
install VirtualBox you just need to
search for VirtualBox and the first link
which will appear here will be from
virtualbox.org G and then you just need
to go to downloads here you can see
different kind of downloads here this is
for Windows so you can just click here
to download VirtualBox and if you click
here the on downloads you are already we
are already in downloads if you come to
the you know home page of this website
then you just need to click downloads
from here right and then click Install
Now or download this executable file for
VirtualBox and then just run the you
know installer and it's not complicated
so I'm not going to show you how you can
download an install VirtualBox but after
installing VirtualBox it's going to look
like this now in my VirtualBox I already
have some you know operating system
running here for example I already have
our Ubuntu running on it I have Kali
Linux install on my VirtualBox or I have
Windows 10 also on my VirtualBox so
let's see how we can
download and install Ubuntu 16.4 on my
VirtualBox also right now whenever you
you know see it for the first time you
won't be seeing these virtual machine
these virtual machines I have you know
downloaded and installed after
installing the word VirtualBox right now
in order to install Ubuntu you just need
to search for Ubuntu here and the first
language will appear I will be
ubuntu.com so just go in this website
and in here you will be able to see the
desktop and you will be also able to see
the downloads section so in here you
just need to click downloads tab here
and here you will be able to see this
link which says open to download right
so just click this link now in here you
have two versions of Ubuntu avail
available one is the ubuntu 16.04 at the
time of making this video which is LTS
version in here you can also see the
full form of LTS LTS stands for a
long-term support version right the
other is the latest version of open 2
which is 16 point 10 at the time making
this video so whenever you come to this
page you may always want to you know
download the long-term support version
because this LTS version will be
supported for a long time on the other
hand this version which is the latest
version so you will be able to see the
latest feature in this version but it
will not be supported for a long time
because of boon 2 releases its desktop
version frequently so for that for
example in next one menu month when you
come here it's going to be 16 point 11
or 12 or 13 whereas this version is
going to remain you know stable for some
time for some years I would say okay so
I'm going to choose this 16.04 version
I will click download' here and now you
will reach to this page now in here
Ubuntu website will ask you to give some
donation by the way
Ubuntu is totally free and open-source
but in order to keep this project
running if you are encouraged to you
know give some donations but for now I
don't want to give any donations so I
will just keep these progress bar at
zero so here my contribution will be
zero but I will be able to see this
button which says Ubuntu desktop
download ok so when you click this
button then you will be able to download
the ubuntu iso file now just click this
button and you know download of this ISO
file will start you see Ubuntu 16 points
4.1 desktop 64-bit version dot ISO now I
have already downloaded this file you
can see this file is 1.4 gigabyte so it
will take some time to download so I
have already downloaded this ISO file in
advance so that I don't need to you know
waste my time on down or downloading
this so I have already downloading the
unrelated this once you have downloaded
this ISO file then you will be able to
see this ISO file like this so this is
my ISO file and I have saved this ISO
file at our desired location anywhere in
your you know desktop you can save this
ISO file right now let's go to our
VirtualBox so I will open my VirtualBox
and in here in order to create a new
device what you can do is you can either
click here which says new or either
right click here on this you know on on
this left hand side then click you know
create a new device right so whenever
you have already created the device for
example Windows 10 and when I
right-click on this device I can even
remove
is Windows forever right so for a new
device I need to just click here this
button which says new which is going to
give me this kind of pop-up box now in
here I just need to give the name of my
machine for example Ubuntu and this
VirtualBox is smart enough to give you
these options which is Linux and you
know open to 16 64-bit right and maybe I
will just give the version of this for
example open to 0.4 because Ubuntu is
already a name in my virtual machine you
can see him right so one to sixteen
point four if it doesn't give you this
type option you can choose it from here
so type is Linux and the version is open
to sixteen point four right click Next
in here you just need to give the memory
size for your virtual machine according
to the size available for you from your
host machine so for now I want to give
it for example memory size of two
gigabyte so 2 0 4 0 right and then I
will click Next and in here it says do
not add a virtual machine to hard drive
so here we need to choose the hard drive
and other option says create a virtual
hard drive now and the third option says
use an existing virtual hard drive so
generally you don't want to change this
option which is by default which is
create a virtual hard drive now ok so
just click this option and just click
create which is going to give you this
option which is hard drive file type so
we want to create the hard drive type
which is VDI which sent for VirtualBox
disk image right so choose the first
option and then click Next in here you
need to choose the storage on the
physical hard drive type
so generally it's preferred to choose
the dynamically allocated you don't want
to you know allocate a fixed size for
your virtual machine which is a ya good
practice I would say so just choose the
dynamically allocated size and then
click Next
now in here the minimum memory you are
open to will require is 8 gigabyte now
you can increase it for example you can
give a 30 gigabyte or 20 gigabyte
depending upon the availability on your
machine for example I will do 31
gigabyte for example and then I will
just create click create which is going
to create this virtual machine on
VirtualBox now once you click create you
will be able to see open to sixteen
point four virtual machine is created on
your VirtualBox but still you are not
finished so you may want to click the
start button to start this virtual
machine but remember we haven't given
any you know ISO file to this virtual
machine which we have downloaded right
so select your virtual machine which you
have created here and then go to
settings so just click settings here and
in the settings you can change the name
of your virtual machine in the future
whenever you want or go to advanced here
and here you may want to you know choose
these two options which will allow you
to copy and paste between your Windows
machine to your you know open to
operating system or vice versa
so just select bidirectional shared
clipboard and bi-directional
drag-and-drop
okay and then the other option is system
here so system we have already located
this much amount of memory so if you
want to change it in future you can do
it from here and for now I have one core
by default allocated but I can increase
it to two or three or four in futures
for example I want two core to be used
for this virtual machine okay
now in the storage just go to storage
section and in the storage go to
controller section and in the controller
just click host drive D here in the host
drive D you may want to go here which is
a CD symbol here just click the CD
symbol and then just choose the option
which says choose a virtual cd/dvd disk
file okay
so just choose this option from here and
then give the location of your ISO file
so my ISO file is located here so I will
just copy the path from here and then I
will paste it here and you can see I
have this open to ISO file so just give
the location and select your ISO file
from here ok and then click open which
is going to provide the path of your ISO
file so your virtual machine knows where
to get the ISO file for in your open to
now you can just click OK from here and
now we are ready to start our virtual
machine so you can start your virtual
machine by just right clicking on your
virtual machine and clicking start or
just select your virtual machine and
then click start from here so I'm going
to click the start button now the
installation process for Ubuntu will
start so you can see the open to initial
window for the installation is going to
set up and then we are going to see the
installation wizard for Ubuntu inside
our VirtualBox so just wait for a while
it's not a very fast process because as
you know every operating system takes
some time to do it setup and everything
but we can see here Ubuntu 16.4
installation has been started here right
now in the next step I can see here my
installation wizard for Ubuntu has been
started on the left hand side you can
choose the language in which you want to
install Ubuntu I want to choose English
and then I want to click install Ubuntu
so just click install Ubuntu and now I
can
this window which says preparing to
install Ubuntu and it shows me two
option download updates while installing
Ubuntu and the install third-party
software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware
so I want to check both of these options
here right and then I will click
continue and in the next stage it asks
me the installation type now you may be
wondering why it's saying it is disk and
install Ubuntu by the way if you check
this option it's not going to erase your
hard disk and install Ubuntu it's just a
default option in your Ubuntu which you
know say is this so it's not going to do
anything you just need to check this
option with say erase disk and install
Ubuntu it's okay to do this it's just a
step so you just need to you know select
this and then click install now okay so
now the installation process will start
and here is the default configuration I
just want to click continue for now and
now you just need to choose the location
according to this location your time you
know will be set so for me it's okay for
Berlin s okay so I will click continue
and in here you just need to give the
keyboard type now in every country the
keyboard which you are using is
different right so by default the US
keyboard is presented to you but for now
in my case I'm using German keyboard so
for this I can choose German keyboard
layout from here so just search for G
and I can see the German keyboard and I
will just choose the German keyboard
from here but if you want to use the
same keyboard you have you just go with
the default type so German and German
and then click continue in your case it
can be in
she was or any other keyboard now in
here this will be the name of your you
know you're open to machine so just
choose some name I will choose for
example code bind and this will be the
user name and in here you can give the
computer name also so by default the
computer name will be code binder I just
need to give code bind here right so the
virtual computer name will be whatever
you name you have given - code Virtual
Machine right so if you don't want this
long name you can just remove it also
something like this ok and then you can
give the password here give any secure
password which you may want to give and
giving my password for example and then
repeat this password and leave
everything is default and click continue
and now the installation of Ubuntu will
start now this step will take some time
so now the installation has been started
and you need to wait for some time to
install a ssin to complete so I will
pause this video for some time and after
everything is done I'm going to continue
with this video ok so now as I can see
the installation of Ubuntu 16.4 has been
done on my VirtualBox
and I am seeing this message which says
installation is complete you need to
restart the computer in order to use
this installation so when you click
restart it's going to restart your
virtual machine and not your computer
right so just click restart and it's
going to restart your Ubuntu virtual
machine which you have installed right
it's not going to restart your computer
and if the restart takes longer time you
can just cancel this virtual machine
also so just click
this close button and then click power
of the machine okay so if the restart
takes a longer time just close the
virtual machine and start it again so
just select the virtual machine and I
will start it again and then it's going
to start my open to operating system
which I have already installed right so
I can see the operating system is
starting and now I can see my open to
operating system which is on my
VirtualBox is started so you just need
to give your password you have provided
at the time of installation and then
click enter which is going to you know
give you your Ubuntu desktop okay so I
will just wait for few seconds and
hopefully I will be able to see the open
to desktop in few seconds so my desktop
has been presented to me I can see all
the sidebar icons here and here I can
see all the you know options which
normal open to have so I will just see
about this computer for example and most
probably I will be able to see the
version of my computer here so I can see
here it's a 64-bit whatever disk size I
have provided it's there right and the
memory I have provide its there device
name which I have provided it's there ok
so in this way you can install Ubuntu on
VirtualBox I hope you enjoyed this video
