we have seen how to make a login
application with your c-sharp and MySQL
database and how to create a new form
when you log in and how to open in your
form so when you open a new form I just
want to be able to save the data for the
employee so in this video we will learn
how to save the data from your c-sharp
application to the MySQL database so for
example if you open the my SQL database
I have your database called database and
I have a table called employee ID and in
that I have the columns like employee ID
name surname age and I want to enter new
data into this database with the help of
my c-sharp application so how can I do
that I will show you right now so first
of all if you are following this video
till last video this form was empty I
have added four labels from my toolbox
so drag these kind of labels and just
change the text on these labels from
here this text just change it and I will
delete this so this is the four labels I
have taken and I have taken the four
text boxes from my toolbox
so just drag and drop for text boxes and
places place them like this and take a
button from your toolbox and Clips it
like this and change the text as save
now for the text boxes I have changed
the name of these text boxes so let's
see if you go to the top and go to the
name I change the name of the first text
box as a ID and the score text this will
indicate the employee ID text text box
variable name so this is the name of
your value text box variable between Li
we will use in the code in the same way
for the first name I have provided for
the first name tool box text box sorry
for the first name text box I provided
the name name underscore text for the
last name I have provided the name
surname underscore text and all the age
text box I have provided the name age
underscore text txt ok so just change
the name according to your convenience
and just remember those names now when
you are done with this
assembly then just select the Save
button and double click it and you will
go to the code of that button click
event so on the top of your form just
wherever you're using system windows dot
form these utilities are there we need
to declare once again because this is a
new form last time in the first form
also we have declared this using my SQL
dot data dot MySQL client so just
declare this and once again go to the
button double click it and this is the
code for saving the new data in the
database so I will quickly run through
the code declare strength called
Conn string and just pass these
connections which I have already told
you in the last videos so you have to
write data source is equal to localhost
or your port number and then semicolon
port is equal to three three zero six
semicolon username is equal to root
semicolon password is equal to root okay
and now we will declare a second
variable string called query so in this
variable string we will pass our code
query for inserting the data so if you
know the MySQL query you know how to
insert the data in the database by query
to MySQL so just right first of all
these double quotes and in the double
quotes right insert into database
dot e data so this is my database name
and this is my table name database dot e
data in the bracket the columns in which
you need to insert your data so I want
to insert data into employee I need name
surname and each column these four
column by one to insert data in so just
in the bracket right employee ID common
names comma surname comma H and then
give a space and then write well use and
make a bracket here bracket and give a
single quote and double quote and this
plus sign and then write this dot e ID
and the score text if you remember I
have named my this textbox named as AE
ID text so this dot e ID text dot text
plus double quote and single quote so
this is one variable we are passing from
the text box of employee ID comma single
quote same as that single quote and
double quote and plus and in between
pass this dot name dot text so this name
text is equal is the second text box
name okay
and then write comma single quote double
quote class this dot surname text which
is your surname textbox named dots text
plus code and just complete the ports
comma once again single quote double
quote Plus this time we are going to
pass age so this dot age textbox named
dot text and plus and double quote
single hotel this is the bracket for the
values so close it
give this semicolon and then give this
double quote to complete the text and
this is the quote for the string
completion so write this okay so this is
the query to insert the data into the
database so we have provided in sequence
employee ID name surname and age text
boxes data into our this column employee
ID name surname in sequence so one first
is employee ID here is also employee ID
second his name here is also name and
surname here results surname and age and
here is also age then in the third line
right MySQL connection on database this
is the MySQL connection database name
connection name sorry is equal to new
MySQL connection and just pass this
constraint here then write my Square
command CMD TARTA base this is my
variable name is equal to new MySQL
command and I will pass this query here
comma corn database this one
I'll pass it here and then we will
declare a my SQL data reader variables
so write my SQL data reader my reader
and then we will make a try-catch block
so if some exceptions are there in our
connection then it will catch the error
so right
try bracket and your bracket close catch
exception e X and in the bracket of
catch right message dot show X dot
message which is this expert message and
in here in the try block write this code
so copy or this my spell c'mon variable
dot open bracket and bracket closed then
copy this my SQL data reader variable is
equal to command database variable this
one copy this not execute reader and if
the data is successfully inserted into
the database then we will show message
dot show data is saved so this is just
to confirm that our data is really saved
and make a while loop and in the bracket
write my reader dot read
so this one is this variable dot read
bracket in bracket close and just leave
your why you empty this is doing nothing
ok so this is the code for your saving
the data into the database and now when
I run my program
this is the login prayer so I will just
go to the second form and in here before
that we will see the data in the
database till now I have nine employee
IDs in my database I will add the tenth
employee IDs so I will refresh this no
more employee IDs is present so I will
add a tenth employee ID ten his name is
ma last name and his ages thirty four
five gentle and when I press this same
button you see you my the message comes
that data is saved
I click OK and I will go to check in my
database if the dot if the data is
really inserted into the database so I
will refresh my data and you can see new
data is saved into my database by using
C shop application so in this way you
can save the data into the database I
