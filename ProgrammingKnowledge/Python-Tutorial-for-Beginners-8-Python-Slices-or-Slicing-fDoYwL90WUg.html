your tutorial on Python programming for
beginners and in this video I am going
to show you how to use slicing in Python
so as the name suggests slicing we can
use it for you know separating a slice
from a list so for example I have a list
like this and I will call it my list and
it contains some integer values from 0
to 9
and I press ENTER and it locates this 0
to 9 values to my list and I can just
see this by printing the list so it has
0 to 9 values now suppose I want to
print only or I want only the values of
from 4 to 7 how can I get this these
values from my list so what I can do is
I can just use my list and then in the
square bracket I will start from the
value which I want to print so for
example 4 and then I give this : and
then I give the ending value till of
whatever value I want to print for
example 8 and I press ENTER and print
from 4 to just before the value you want
to print so you if you remember this
index of the list starts from 0 right so
index is 0 here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 right
so to print your values this starting
value whenever you write it includes the
index of the value you want to print ok
so whenever you write for it will
include 0 1 2 3 4 so
print the value from four that will go
to eight four five six seven eight but
it excludes this value and it only
prints up to seven okay now suppose you
want to print something like you want to
print to the end from five to nine how
you can do it you can just do it like my
list and you can just write five and
because this will print if you write it
here nine this will print up to eight
right because whenever we have written
it here it was printing up to seven
value right and remember this is the
index not the values these values can be
string datatype
or any other data type right so this
these value has nothing to do with these
index values okay these are the position
which you want to print okay so in order
to print from five to nine you need to
add one more to your slice and then it
will print from five to nine okay so
remember if you want to go from some
value in the middle to the end just add
one to the index here okay so you want
to print nine then just print ten here
now as I have to already told you that
you not only can have the list or you
can own not only can print the index
slice the index for the integer array or
list but any string list also so for
example I have a list like this of
character for example characters and
then
I want to print or slice these list
characters right so how you can do it I
will just write name my list names and
then in the square bracket I will just
write to 2 or 3 for example I want to
print 2 to 3 it will just print second
value because it skips the third value
right so 0 1 2 it includes the 2 and it
skips the value which you give here so
it will only print to see here right for
example I want to go to the end I will
just write 2 2 4 that gives this like
this now for example are there is a
short way of doing this if you want to
print from 5 to the end what you can do
I have this my list here I will copy and
paste it here in the square bracket what
you can do you can just write 5 and
semicolon and leave the other part of
this slice and when you press ENTER it
will just print the values from 5 to 9
to the end of your list ok now for
example you do the same thing but you
leave the first part and just go up to
the last part it will print from start
to the end ok so for example I want to
print once again :
or to the 5th value and it will print
from the starting to the 5th value ok
now this will be true for the negative
sequence also so I have already told you
in the last video that you can in the
list you can have the index in negative
index
the backward of from the back right so
what you can do is you can just use this
list and you can just say - 4 2 - 2 and
press Enter
it will give you the values from so this
is minus 1 minus 2 and it will skip this
value and print here and then we have
minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 minus 4 and
minus 4 is this one right so it will
print this one it will print this one
but it will not print this one because
it will skip this right as you have seen
in this positive of forward forward
indexing in a similar way it will this
also works for the blank sequence for
example - 6 - blank it will print from 4
to 9 okay
it will be same for if you leave the
first part and print want to print the
last part ok now if you want to print
the whole array you just can do it like
this but you can also do it like just
give a square and give this semicolon
here that will also give you the whole
array okay now there is one more thing
you can do with your list is for example
I have my list and I want to print the
values for example I want to print 0 3 6
in some sequence ok so you want to skip
some values in there you want to print
only some other values so what you can
do here you can just write 0 which is a
starting index and took 10 so you want
to print from 0
to the end and there is a optional value
you can give here and you can give the
value here which you want to skip so for
example you want to skip 0 1 2 3 here so
you want to print 0 3 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 9 what you
can do here you can skip the value by 2
okay and when you print here it will
print 0 2 4 6 8
okay so it prints here and it skips the
first value and second value it prints
and skips the third value and fourth
value it prints and just like this right
so for example I can once again skip two
values at a time instead of 2 I can
write 3 here and press ENTER I will give
0 3 6 9 okay
and there is a very short way of doing
this is you can just write the skip
value number of spa index you want to
skip and just leave these things or
these parts blank here and will print
the same value okay so this is optional
it's not necessary to use this but if
you use this it will skip you know those
values like this okay and you can do it
with the negative index also for example
you can just leave this and write 2 here
it will print from the backward to the
front right so it when you write
negative 2 it will start from 9 and then
negative 2 it will print 7 and then 5 &amp;amp;
3 &amp;amp; 1 okay so if you want to print
backward just give this sequence in
negative okay once again you want to
print backward
skipping third value or three values
just do it like this nine six three zero
okay so in this way you can use sequence
in Python there is more to sequence
which well I will discuss in later
videos but that's it for sequence in
Python I hope you enjoyed this video
