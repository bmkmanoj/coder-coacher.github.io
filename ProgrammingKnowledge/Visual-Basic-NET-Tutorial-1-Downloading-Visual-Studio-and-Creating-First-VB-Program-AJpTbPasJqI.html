a new video series on Visual Basic
windows form application using Visual
Studio and in the first video itself I
will show you how to download Visual
Studio and how to make your first
project so go to your google chrome or
any search engine and just enter Visual
Studio Express here Visual Studio in
itself is a very expensive IDE but it
has an Express Edition you can download
and you can use it for free so just go
to your Visual Studio Express Edition
and according to the latest version you
can download visually Express Studio
Express and you need to go to Visual
Studio Express for Windows and choose
your language and you can install it by
downloading it it's pretty easy and
straightforward to download Visual
Studio Express and install it in your in
your computer and when you are done with
your downloading and installation just
go to start button and click this Visual
Studio from there and it will open a
visual studio environment like this in
here we are going to start a new project
so to go to file and then go to new
project and in here we are going to make
windows form application but first we
need to choose the language so go to
other languages and choose Visual Studio
from here and we will make Windows from
application using Visual Studio and
visual basic and
in here we will enter the name of our
project so I will write first Visual
Studio or Visual Basic project
VB project and click OK and it will
create a new project for us now in here
you can see solution Explorer so to see
your project in solution you have this
form and you have the tool box which I
will show you in a moment so this is the
project where it creates your files and
it will create your file in the solution
Explorer and it created form 1 dot V B
ok and it has toolbox and from toolbox
you can choose a tools like button text
boxes and other tools and you can drag
and drop into the form and then you can
provide the code for the action that the
tool will perform if you cannot see or
if you aren't able to see solution
Explorer then go to you and search for
solution Explorer or toolbox and then
you can pin it into your visual studio
environment for example you don't have
toolbox or you can't see toolbox in your
environment just go to view and click
toolbox from here and you can dock this
at the bottom also and you can docked it
to the top right or left like this by
just clicking like this okay so let's
make a button or drag and drop a button
and we are going to show a mess
using this button I can change the text
of this button I will right show message
here and I will just select this button
and double click it to make the button
click action perform method and in this
I am going to show a message that
whenever I click a button it will show
some message so just write message box
dot show and in the bracket write your
message which you want to display so I'm
going to write a message this is my
first ve
code ok whatever my message you want to
show just right in the brackets in
between and you don't need to give any
semicolon and just run your program and
it will show like this so just need you
just need to click this green button
from here and it will start debugging
your program and when you click this
show message button it will show or
display your message whatever you have
written in the brackets right so in this
way you can make your first visual basic
windows form application project using
Visual Studio IDE I hope you have
enjoyed this video and you have learned
something new this time and in the
future I will show some more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
