you can download and install MongoDB on
your Ubuntu operating system so first of
all open your terminal and MongoDB is
the part of open to repositories so you
just need to give this command sudo apt
- get install MongoDB ok and when you
give this command it's going to ask for
your password just give you a password
and then press enter and then the
installation of MongoDB will start you
just need to click why to allow the you
know download and then just wait for
some time
unless this process is complete and once
this process is complete we are going to
see the next step
so now MongoDB is installed in my system
one more command we need to give here is
sudo apt-get update so just write sudo
apt - get up date and press Enter
so that all the repositories related to
MongoDB are you know updated now once
the update is complete you just need to
start MongoDB service so you can just
write sudo service Mongo DB start so
Mongo DB start ok and press enter and it
says MongoDB a job is already running so
whenever MongoDB is installed on your
system it already starts this MongoDB
you know job on your system so if in
case this job is not started this
command is going to start this MongoDB
job in background in your computer now
once this is done we are ready to use
MongoDB so let's see how we can you know
work with the MongoDB shell but now what
I'm going to do
I'm going to just clear everything so
just right here and placenta and now I'm
going to give this command which is
Mongo so just give Mongo command and now
you can see we are inside the Mongo
shell the first command we can give here
is show DB's which is going to give the
databases which we already have so just
right show DBS and it's going to give
you this result this is the default
database which is already present in
MongoDB and if you want to create a new
database you just need to just write use
and your database name for example my DB
and what this is going to do is let's
give the command first and what is going
to do is it's going to create this
database if it's not present otherwise
if this database is present then this
will be switched to this database so
right now we are inside this my DB
database it has created the database for
us because there was no database called
my DB but it if this database was
present then we will be switched to this
database now to print this database or
print the current database we are in you
just need to write DB and then give this
command and it shows my DB that means we
are inside this database and we are
ready to work with this database now in
order to insert some collections and
documents inside Mongo DB what we can do
is we can just write DB DB is the
current database so you don't need to
write the database name but the DB
keyword indicates the current database
and then you need to give the collection
name
so if you know that MongoDB is not a
relational database it's a no SQL
database and it's based upon collections
and documents so to add a collection you
need to just write DB dot your
collection name for example my call for
my collection and then dot insert to
insert the document inside the
collection right and then give this
round brackets and inside the round
bracket give these curly brackets
because MongoDB tates its document in
the form of JSON in a key value pair so
inside this curly bracket we can give a
key value pair for example name
something like this and then colon and
then the name of the person for example
mark okay and then give this command
press ENTER and now this collection is
created inside your/my DB database and
we have one document inside your
collection which is my call now once
again when you give show DB command here
you can just hit the UP button and it's
going to browse through this show DB
command and press ENTER and now you can
see you have two databases and if you
want to you know see the collection
inside your database you just need to
give this command show
collections and then press ENTER and it
shows the collections inside your
databases right so in here Michael call
is the collection which is created by me
and this one is the default collection
we haven't created this but it will show
you this thing by default right so this
was the collection we have created using
this command now to show all the
documents inside the collection you just
need to give D be dot your collection
name for example
I call which I have created this
collection and then dot find okay and
then these round brackets and then give
this command and you can see you have
one document inside your collection and
if you can observe here this ID is
automatically generated by MongoDB for
your document and this is the unique ID
which is created by MongoDB for each
document you create so that MongoDB can
recognize each document uniquely right
so in this way you can download and
install MongoDB on your open to
operating system I hope you have enjoyed
