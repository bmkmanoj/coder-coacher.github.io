video we will see what does final
keyword do in Java so for example I have
a class called hello and I define a
variable public final int number and I
have added final to the variable
declaration what does this final
declaration do in front of any variable
declaration or in front of class
declaration or even in front of method
declaration they have different meaning
whenever you add it with the variable or
a method or a class so let's see what
does this keyword mean so that final
keyword has numerous way to use when we
use final keyword with a class this
class cannot be subclassed when you use
final with a method this method cannot
be overridden by a subclass and when you
use final with a variable it can only be
initialized once ok so first of all we
will see this point that if you declare
a variable as final it can only be
initialized once okay so I have declared
a member variable which is public final
int number and what here written it can
only be initialized once right so for
example I declare a constructor with the
same name and I am going to initialize
this value in my constructor so number
is equal to 10 okay so we I have
initialized it only once right now I
will create an instance of this class in
my main
method hello is equal to or hello a chi
l is equal to new hello and what I am
going to do is and trying I will try to
assign the value to this number hello
dot number once again right so for
example 20 okay and when I run the
program or compile the program it gives
me error and the error says the final
field hello dot number cannot be
assigned right so once I assign this
variable which is final then I cannot
initialize it once again okay
so if I commend this this will compile
perfectly fine so it has compiled
perfectly fine but if I try to
reinitialize or reassign a value to a
final variable then it is not allowed so
generally you whatever value or whatever
variable we want to declare it as a
constant
you can add final keyboard keyboard
before this okay now the first point the
final class cannot be subclassed when we
will learn about inheritance we will
also learn about what is sub classing
and what the sub classing means is you
can have the properties of one class
into another class by the means of
inheritance so for example I have the
student class which whose property I
want to use it or property or member
variables or member method inside my
hello class I can use it like extends
and then student class not this one but
student not this for this student right
and this is totally fine if you write
extend student this means that we are
inheriting from student class to hello
class and this inheritance we will learn
in the further video but I want to show
you what this final key would mean right
and when we compile the program it will
give us the error and what is their
final cannot be initialized
let us comment this and then once again
compile the program and it compiles
totally fine right because student class
is not final right so if you add this
final keyword before the Declaration of
a class for example I will write public
class student instead of public law
student I write public final class
student final class student so I have
made this class as final right so if I
made this class as final now see what
happens
it shows whenever I compile the program
it will show error and what is the error
here the type hello cannot subclass the
final class student okay so whenever you
declare a class as final you cannot
subtract it from it yeah okay so you
cannot extend from that class okay and
the point in the middle that the final
method cannot be overridden by the
subclass this we will learn when we
learn how to use inheritance and how to
use overriding in a class okay so just
remember these three key key sentences
and you will be good to go I hope you
have enjoyed this video please read when
you subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
