I have been teaching you the basics of
windowbuilder GUI in Eclipse using Java
and I have shown you some of the basic
programs or basic concept of
windowbuilder GUI like this and how to
use this window build a GUI in Eclipse
using Java now I want to build from this
video a small little project so that if
I'm going to build this project and and
I am going to teach I am going to try to
teach every tool or component we have in
here by building that project so in a
way you will build a project also and
you will learn how to use these
components or tools also so from this
video I am going to create a connection
to the database with this java
application so I'm going to use SQLite
database for a connection to this GUI
which we are making in Java and we are
going to make a little login page in
connection with this database but first
of all I want to show you how you can
create your database in SQLite SQLite is
a server less database that means you
can transfer this database from one
computer to another without worrying for
the connection to the server so it's not
server based database it's a kind of
local database which exists on one
computer only ok so let me show you how
you can first of all create a database I
will show you the simple method
there can be other method for creating
SQLite database but what I find simple
I'm going to show you but if you don't
know
about SQLite how to use SQLite what you
can do is you can go to my channel which
is YouTube / programming knowledge
and you can find their SQLite tutorial
if you are really new to SQLite database
you can find those tutorials here so go
to my channel which is programming
knowledge and go to playlist and in here
you will be able to find this playlist
in here so this playlist is called
SQLite database so this is the playlist
which I am talking about beginners as
like tutorial and in here I have
explained how you can create database
query to the database and some of the
basics of SQLite but in this video also
I'm going to show you how you can easily
make SQLite database in your computer so
the easiest thing is to use Firefox as a
SQLite manager so if you don't have
Firefox just download this Firefox from
Internet it's free if as you all know
and in here in the Firefox I have the
newest version of Firefox which is
Firefox I think 31 so open your Firefox
and click this small button here and in
here you will find this different
section what we are interested in is
add-ons so click this add-ons here and
search for the add-on call SQLite and
press ENTER and you will find this
SQLite manager 0.8.1 it's free so just
click install and will be installed in
your Firefox browser as a plug-in just
restart your Firefox so I will once
again restart my Firefox and now how to
search for that SQLite manager in
Firefox so in the older version the
it was really easier to find this
escalade manager by going to the top
menu but in this new Firefox you need to
go to customize so just click this
customize here and in here you will be
able to find your ex collide manager
right so just drag and drop this
escalade manager in this menu in here
okay and you will be good to go and just
exit customization and now you will be
able to see SQLite manager here just
open this SQLite manager and we are
ready to create our SQLite database it's
really simple to make SQLite database in
this SQLite manager to create a new
database you can go here and say new
database and give the name of the
database for example I want to create a
database for employees so I will say
employee what we can say employee data
database okay and this will create an
extension dot SQLite it will
automatically give an extension to your
database AZ dot SQLite but it's not
necessary that all SQLite database has
the same extension they can have dot DB
extension also or other extension also
but SQLite manager in Firefox create the
extension dot SQLite so do not worry
about it
and click OK and now it will ask for the
location where you want to save your
database ok so save a location which you
can locate later right so for example
let's say where can I save my database
I will go to user and I will go to the
same workspace which I am using for this
Eclipse okay you can save it anywhere
it's not I mean it's not the necessary
that you need to save it in the
specified folder you can choose any
folder of your choice and just select
that folder and then this s collide
database will be created there okay now
in order to add tables you need to
right-click right now whenever you
create this database it has 0 tables so
you need to add tables so just right
click this tables here and click create
table and in here you can give create a
table so for example I name my table as
employee info table and here I can make
the column names so the basics you can
find on my playlist of my channel but I
will quickly create these columns first
column will be Eid second column will be
name name third column will be surname
both will be
user name v Willy password and for
example sixth will be age for now I need
these columns maybe I will add more
columns but for now it's okay EW will be
integer data type and name will be text
and surname will be text username will
be text and password will be text and my
age will be integer okay so i have
quickly created this database and for
example i say e ID is my primary key I
will click OK and click yes so now I
have one table created in the SQLite
Manager and in this table I can add some
data okay so how to add data you can
just make it bigger and just go to the
table and go to browse and search here
and to add some data you can just go to
add and for example employee ID 1 name
is mark
some surname username for example one
you can give any username password also
one for example and age is 35 for
example okay okay so I have created
added one data I will once again add the
second data this is John
some surname and user name - password -
age 25 so I have two rows of data have
created and this is your database and
what is so once you create your database
and wherever you have given the location
for saving this database you will find
this database there so I will look for
this database once again where I have
saved I have saved it in workspace you
can see employ dot SQLite database here
right so this is the database I have
created and it has some data okay now I
can close this Firefox browser and I
will create a new project this I have
been showing in you in the last two
videos but I will create a new project
for this okay so what I am going to do
is close this for now I will go to file
new new project and I will name this
project as
company project okay and everything will
remain safe they are same I will click
Next
and I will click finish so it has
created me a project called company it
has subfolder called source and some
libraries ok in this I am going to add a
class so go just go to the source folder
right click it and go to new and I am
going to add a class and this class I
will call as SQLite
connection class so this class will help
us to connect to the database and make
sure this is not checked public static
void main is not checked
it's unchecked okay so this method made
this class will not contain the mean
method okay this is our helper class and
just click finish
now you have this SQLite connection
class it doesn't have any thing other
than the class name so what we are going
to do is in here we are we want to
import some of the imports to connect to
the database first import is import Java
dot SQL dot star or asterisk whenever
you use this estwick it this means that
you this will be SQL right so whenever
you use this asterisk after dot it means
whatever class this SQL namespace or
whatever have it will add all the
classes related to X SQL ok and the
second import is import Java X dot swing
okay so we have created our two imports
now I will create a method which will be
a public method public
static and this method will return the
connection so I will say connection and
the name of the method will be for
example DB DB connector okay and this
will take no argument and this will take
we will start the method and and the
method like this so let us create a
global variable maybe we will use this
in future so just write connection con
is equal to null and do it like this and
so this connection is a part of your
java dot SQL class you see when you
hover over this this is a part of your
java dot SQL dot connection class right
that's why I have used this and this
method will return the connection and
first of all in the last video I have
shown you how to create a try-catch
block so just make a quick try catch
block
try catch and it with
take exceptions so just right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
