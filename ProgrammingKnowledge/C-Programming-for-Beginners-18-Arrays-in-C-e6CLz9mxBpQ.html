tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video we will see what is an
array and how to use our a and C so what
is an array array is a variable which
can contain more than one values of same
data-type so for example you want to
store a similar data in a variable you
can do it with the help of an array for
example you want to store a scores of a
student or ages of persons or names of
any person or any number of persons you
can do it using an array using a single
variable now how to declare an array in
C it's like same as declaring variable
so first is the data type what kind of
data you want to store in your array and
then the name of your race for example
my number array right and then this
square bracket this square bracket tells
see that it's an array and whatever
number you insert inside this square
bracket for example 3 this is the number
of element you can store inside an array
right so for example we have written 3
here we can store 3 numbers in an array
now whenever you declare an array you
can initialize it by equal to sign and
in this curly braces you can give the
values to your array for example the
values can be 20 30 and 60 for example
right so I have stored 3 values because
here you can see I have defined that
this array can contains 3 values
therefore I can assign 3 values to my
array if it would be 4 then
can add one more value for example 55 to
my array okay
and so on if it be 5 it will be 5 I can
add 5 values here okay so for example I
have 3 values right now so I can store 3
values okay now you can ask how can I
access the value of an array okay and
there is something called index of an
array and the index of an array is a
position at which any value is you know
placed so the index of 20 here is 0 so
index of an array starts from 0 not from
1 so always remember that index of an
array starts from 0 and thus at the 0th
index we have the value 20 here and at
the first index we have the value 30 and
at the second index we have the value 60
ok
so index start from 0 1 2 now to access
the value of an array what you can do is
you can just write print F or for
example I want to access and the value
of an array I can just name a variable
access array for example is equal to for
example I want to store second value of
an array inside this variable ok so I
can just copy the name of an array and
then in the square bracket the index of
the array whose value we want to store
for example we want to store 30 the
index of the 30 is 0-1 right so we will
write 1 here ok so now the value 30 from
array will be stored inside this access
are a variable right and then we can
print this value print
F and then we can just write value is
equal to percentage D small D and then
we will change the line so that it will
be printed at the next line whenever we
use the next printf right so now we will
see that this will print 30 because we
have assigned 30 which is at index R 1
of this array right you will just run
this program at prints 30 which is
totally fine in a similar way you can
define that any character array or any
double array also but always remember
that an array for example care array and
we want to store 3 characters inside
this array so for example I will write 3
or I want to store four character inside
this array and then in the curly braces
I can store these four characters for
example first character second character
third and fourth and then this contains
a comma
this contains P comma this contains C
comma
this contains D okay so this is a
character array you can define a float
array or string array or any other kind
of array but always remember that the
data type of array so if you have
declared an integer array it can only
contain integer values if you have
declared character array it can only it
can only have character values right if
you have float array it can only have
float values okay now for example you
want to print all the values of your
array so for example your array
means six values and I can just extend
my array like this so now it contains
six value one two three four five six
and the index of these value is zero one
two three four five right so now for
example I want to print all the values
of an array I can use for loop for that
and I can just write int I is equal to
zero and then my condition comes I is
less than the index of an array so s or
size of an array so the size of an array
is six in my case so I will write I
should be less than six and then I plus
plus and then I can print the value of
these arrays for example I will just
print this and I can write element and
then I can write percentage T here and
percentage D and I will just print the
value of I I and comma I will just print
the index one by one so I will just
write the name of my array and then I
okay why I have written I because I will
be you know increased in the for loop
first the value of I is equal to zero so
it will print twenty then it will
increase the value of fiber one which is
one so array at index one is 30 okay
well you are for a at index one is 30
now once again the value of I becomes
two so the value of I at index 2 is 60
so it will print oh well all the values
in the are a one by one add the specific
index so I will just run this program
and you can see it prints the value so
the element zero is twenty which is true
element one is 30 which is true element
2 is 60 which is here element 3 is 54 is
55 and fifth is 30 so index start from
zero to five okay so it prints all the
values in an array like this okay now
for example you want to change any value
in the array for example you are not
happy with this 30 in an array and you
want to change the value of this 30 to
45 for example so you can change it like
this so the index of this value 30 is
0-1
okay so what you can do is you can just
copy this value from here I will just
delete all the other things right now so
that it will be simpler to see so just
copy the name of your array and then the
index of the value you want to change so
the index of value I want to change s101
right is equal to i want to change it to
the value 45 right so this will change
the value at index 1 of this array which
is 30 to 45 okay and we will verify it
by this for loop and printing the value
I will compile the program and run this
and you can see the value or in index 0
is 20 value at index 1 is 45 here which
was 30 earlier but we have changed it to
45 right so you can change the value of
an array like this ok so this kind of
array which has you know week which can
contain some or one or more than one
variable of value
is called single dimensional array right
in C there can be multi-dimensional
array also which I will teach you in the
next videos but this is single
dimensional array in C and how you can
array in C so I hope you have enjoyed
