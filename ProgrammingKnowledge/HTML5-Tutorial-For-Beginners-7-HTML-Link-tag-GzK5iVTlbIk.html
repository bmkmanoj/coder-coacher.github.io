HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
in this video we will see how to use
links in HTML so you may have seen links
on almost every web page whenever you
visit some web site so for example you
want to navigate from one page to
another you click some link and it will
redirect you to the other page so how to
add this link the basic tag which we use
for this link is this a tag okay or it's
called a link tag and to add a URL or
your file name what you need is you need
to have our reference called H ref and
it's attribute we want to add and in
these double quotes you give a URL name
or a file name okay and in here you can
provide the description of the link
right so for example I want to give some
website path here for example this is my
website path HTTP colon and then the
website part you want to you know
redirect this page to right and here you
can give the description to your link
for example easy online converter okay
save your code and when you refresh your
page you will see this link easy online
converter this is the description but
behind this when you click this link it
will redirect you to the website which
we have written in the H ref ok so like
this you can replace this by google.com
or any other website and in here you can
give the description now you can also
add some file name here so for example I
will create a new HTML file inside my
web content folder so html5 and this
I will name it as file 2 for example dot
HTML and I will finish it and this
creates my second file and I will just
add some description here file 2 for
example okay
and I save it and this is name of the my
file file to write so when I want to add
here the file name I can just directly
write file to dot HTML right same name
as your file name ok and here you can
write Open File to and save it and
refresh your web page I'd say is open
file - and when you click it it's going
to open your file - like this ok so you
can see file - dot HTML is open okay now
if this file is present in some folder
for example I will create a folder
inside my web content folder so create a
folder and I can name it as dir and it's
going to create a dir folder and I am
going to drag and drop my file to a dot
HTML in my dir folder and it is going to
transfer it inside my dir folder so now
I can give the path dir forward slash
file - ok save it and refresh your web
page and once again open the link and
it's going to open the same file right
so if you have some directory structure
you can do it something like this ok now
for example when you click this link
it's going to open your any link or
website in the same tab in which you are
working on and for example you want to
open it in some other tab for example
here you want to you know let this
website be opened but when you click
this link you want to open your website
in the other tab how can you do it you
can do it with a attribute called
get and as a target you give a value
underscore blank okay save it and
refresh your page and when you click
this it's going to open your file to dot
HTML in second tab right so you can give
target like blank or by default it's
self so this is the default target and
you can also give a target like top
which opens the linked document in the
full body of the window okay now you can
also use a link as a bookmark so how you
can use it for example you have a web
page which has many topics topic one two
three four and for example 100 topics on
a single page and you want to jump from
one topic to another topic for example
from topic 1 to topic 6 directly when
you click a link so how you can do it
you can add a paragraph first and inside
the paragraph you can add this link tag
and as an attribute here at shrap you
can give something like hash and the ID
which you want to give it so for example
T five okay and then the description for
example jump to topic five okay and same
ID you just need to give in the heading
here for example ID is equal to T five
so T five something like this so this is
the reference and this is the ID so
whenever you click this link it's going
to see where this T five is and it's
going to search this ID and it's going
to jump to this topic here
okay so let's save it and refresh our
page once again and here we have talked
pick one two three and
five is not even visible from here right
so when I click jump to topic five is
going to jump to topic five here okay so
you can use links as a bookmark also so
in this way you can use links in HTML I
