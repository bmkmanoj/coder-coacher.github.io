two videos I have been showing you how
to create a PDF file using or I text
sharp DLL in your visual basic windows
form application and in the last video
I've shown you how to draw create a list
in your PDF file and in this video I
will show you how to add image in your
PDF file using your visual basic windows
form application and I take shop DLL so
let's get started I have created this
button already and I have already
created this code to create a PDF file
so if you don't know just watch the last
two videos and you know how i made this
code so this is i will just go through
this code really fast this is a
try-catch block and i'm catching any
exception if it occurs and in the try
block i am just defining the variable
called PDF doc as you document and in
the second line i am defining and giving
my PDF file a name so i will write dem
PDF right as PDF writer is equal to PDF
writer dot getinstance
and in the bracket just pass the
arguments this argument as a first
argument and the second argument is the
new for file stream and in the bracket
your file name or PDF file name which
you want to give comma while mode dot
create okay and then we open the PDF doc
to write in it so i will write PDF doc
dot open and then i have created a
paragraph which I have already shown you
how to create a paragraph in the PDF
file so just write PDF doc dot add and
in the bracket just write new paragraph
show image and at the last before this
cache block just close this PDF document
by writing PDF doc dot close
and in between I will write the code to
add an image so I have an image in my
binary folder so when I click my
solution Explorer
I will go to open folder in Windows
Explorer and then I will go to bin
folder where my debug folder is there
and in here I have my executable file
for my for my project and here I have
been creating the simple PDF and here I
have a picture called VB 36 and when I
open it you can see a picture and this
picture I want to show in my PDF file
okay so how can I do this
so in here just write the code this line
so just create and variable of image so
just write dem IMG this is the variable
name as image is equal to image dot get
instance and you are getting the
instance from this PDF file which is vb
36 dot PNG I have already shown you this
is the name of my visual basic file so
what you can do is you can give the full
path of the PNG file like this so it's a
full path of the PNG file but you need
to add double slashes to your path
otherwise if your PNG file is PNG or any
other jpg or whatever file you want is
in your bin folder which is which
contains your executable file here then
you don't need to give any paths you can
just write the name of the path because
it sees this path automatically if it's
already in the binary folder ok and then
I will just copy this PDF doc which is
my PDF document dot
and I will say and in the bracket I will
pass my IMG image and these two lines
will add an image to your PDF document
let's try and run the program and I
click let me show you first of all my
PDF file before clicking the before
clicking the create PDF button ok so
right now I was testing the PDF file and
I'm going to show you how to add this
PDF file and how how to give the border
to my PDF file ok so right now I'm just
adding the this PNG image ok so I will
close this PDF and I will run my program
say create PDF and now when I see my
simple dot PDF here you can see this
show image is created and the image size
will be the actual size of the image and
for example you want to reduce the size
of the image how can you reduce the size
of the image I will just show you so go
to the code once again and in between
here when you declare your image
variable and you add your image to the
document in between this just write
these two lines so first line is I am G
dot scale percent so I have given 50% to
the image so I have reduced the size of
my image by half right and in the second
line I have written I am G dot scale to
fit 250 by 250 so it will be a square
image right now and this is the scale of
the size okay now when I run the program
once again and I show click create PDF
and I open my simple PDF and now my
image size is reduced and the percentage
it is reduced by it is reduced by 50%
okay now for example I want to add the
border to my PDF file so just go this
below this scaling and just add these
three lines of code to add a border so
just right I am G dot border is equal to
rectangle box okay
so just write this line and then once
again write IMG border color this will
define the colour of your border is
equal to I TechShop dot text dot base
color dot whatever color you want right
now I have selected a yellow color but
you can select any color for example
black blue there are some options here
for example I want to add this green
color to my image and then in the next
line just write IMG dot border width so
this will be the width of your wardrobe
right now I have set my bit as 5 let's
make it 10 - then it will show bigger
bottom it now I will run the program and
I will click create PDF and once again I
will see my PDF file and you can see I
have my picture and I have the border
which is green and which is of width 10
okay so in this way you can add image to
your PDF file using ITEX shop dll and
visual basic windows form application so
this is the code so if you want just
pause the video and copy the code and
you will be good to go
I hope you have enjoyed this video
