video I will show you how to use tab
control with your visual basic windows
form application so let's get started I
will just go to my toolbox and search
for the tab control here it is I will
drag and drop into my form and for the
first time when you drag and drop this
tab control into your form it has two
tabs to have one and tab to buy a
default so generally we want to use tab
control when you have a little space and
you want to show more so you can double
your space which is available on one
form by using tab controls okay so let
me show you first of all how we can
generate more tabs in this tab control
so just select your tab control and just
go to this collection and here you can
add new tabs so right now I have two
tabs
once again I will show you just select
this tab control as a whole and go to
the property called tab pages and select
this button and then add a new tab from
here okay like this and likewise if you
want to remove the tab just click this
remove button now you can also change
the text of this these tabs for example
I select first tab and the name of this
tab is tab page one and text of this tab
I will change it as login tab for
example and
and the second tab I will name it as
image images tab and third tab is to
close the application this is just the
demonstration so you can do whatever you
want so when I do this you see here all
the tabs have now the heading which I
have provided to them right and there
are other properties like background
color if you want to change background
images also if you have any you can give
these images just go to the local
resources and just set any image which
you want for example this image I select
and click OK and you see in the close
tab I have this image right you have
font you have for color so basically you
just need to play with the properties in
order to run over you in order to use
these tabs so now when I run the program
I have three tabs one is login one is
image and one is clothes which have the
background image which I said and this
has the efficiency of space right so you
or your space is now multiplied by three
which was available previously right
because we are using three tabs and you
can segregate your tasks in these tabs
this is also one use so for example now
you want to add some of the tools in the
first tab it's just very easy for
example I want to add a button I want to
add
some label here so I will search for the
label one and do and I will also take a
text box or a to temp text box so I will
change the name of this or text of the
label which is first is name and second
is surname for example okay so it works
like normal tools it has no effect or
the these tools or text box or label or
button have no effect whatsoever while
they are in these tabs so they will work
so that this name can be used as it is
we have used earlier this has text box
one so this as is its own name
it doesn't change or doesn't matter if
you are using tabs or not right so like
this and for example in second name
second tab I want to show some image so
I will take a picture box from here and
then I will choose an image go to the
local resources and choose an image
which image I want to choose like this
okay and I will make it zoom so it will
be stretched or you can make it stretch
image so that it will stretch to your
picture box and on the third you can add
a button and call it call this button as
exit button so I say this is a exit
button this is just a small
demonstration so you can do whatever you
want with the tabs I will just
double-click this and I will say end and
when I run the program now just click
this and run the program and it has
normal functioning for the login page
for the image tab it has my images and a
four for the closed tab it has exit
button which when I press it exits so in
this way you can use tab control with
your visual basic windows form
application I hope you have enjoyed this
