show you how you can download and
install atom text editor on your Ubuntu
operating system atom is a open source
source code and text editor so you can
install atom on Windows or Mac OS or
Ubuntu it's a cross plate from text
editor and the good thing about this is
it's really good for developing
JavaScript or any other you know
application you may want to because it
supports community packages so you can
customize atom editor according to your
needs so let's see how we can download
and install a Tam editor on Ubuntu and
hopefully we can see also how we can
install packages in atom so first of all
open your terminal and in the terminal
first of all you need to give some
command so first command in here you
need to give here is this command all
these command I'm going to give in the
description so you don't need to you
know type them manually you can just
copy and paste these commands right so
the first command is sudo apt - get -
repository PPA colon web update team
slash atom and this is to add
repositories for atom right so the first
command is this and then you just need
to give your user password which is
going to you know add these repository
and at this point it's asking me to
press ENTER to continue so I will press
ENTER and then you can see the
repository is added now the second
command here is we need to give the
update command so just type sudo apt-get
update okay so just give this command
which is sudo apt-get update the
spelling is wrong here so sudo apt-get
update and you can see all the updates
are taking place right now
and the third command will be the actual
install command to install Adam on your
open to operating systems once this
update is finished you are ready to give
this command so once again sudo apt -
I'd get install Adam ok so just give
this command and press Enter
which is going to install the Adam
editor on your open to operating system
so just wait for this process to
complete this may take few seconds to a
minute to complete so just wait for this
to complete and once this is completed
we are going to see how we can use this
Adam editor ok so the installation
process for Adam has been completed and
now we are ready to use Adam so I'm
going to minimize my terminal and I will
go here so just go at the top and search
for Adam and you will be able to see
this kind of icon what you can do is you
can drag and drop this icon to your
toolbar so next time you will be able to
open this Adam editor from your toolbar
itself ok and now you can close this and
then you can open your Adam editor now
first of all it's going to open our
otama DITA so now my Adam edita is
opened and the first of all you will be
able to see this kind of editor and in
order to you know use this editor you
can go to files here and you can open
either our existing project for example
if you have a node.js project you can
open existing node JS folder project or
otherwise you can create your own
project right so now for example I'm
going to open the existing node.js
project which I have been working on so
I will just say open folder and this is
my project so I will just click on this
and then click OK which is going to open
my node.js project so I can just open
this server dot J's file
and you can see the code here all the
code right now for the first time it'll
look like any editor but it's really
powerful in a sense that you can install
and customize this atom according to
your needs and for this you can install
multiple packages for yourself
so for what you can do is to install
packages you just need to press three
keys which is controlled shift P so just
press control shift P and going to open
this kind of window and in here you can
just type install packages okay and you
will be able to see this option which
says install packages and themes so just
click it and in here you have some
featured packages and you have some you
know not you know listed packages so you
can search on internet for the you know
packages you want for example to
beautify your JavaScript so you can just
type beautify something like this and
it's going to search for the package
which is for you know your code
highlighting or something for this right
so you can see atom beautify okay and
you can see here I need to uninstall it
I already have this installed on my atom
edita but if you don't have this for
example this Jade beautify you can just
click install to install it and this
will be installed on your atom editor
and then you will be able to use it
right so for example you can you have
installed this editor I already have
this beautify editor so I can right
click on
the file and you can see I have this
option to beautify editor content
something like this right so it have
many packages something for for example
you want to want to have a node.js
terminal it has that also if you want to
have other things for example for
debugging node chairs I'm talking about
node chairs because I use it for node.js
but it's not constrained only for
node.js it can be used for any other
development work which you wish for
right so just explore this editor and I
hope you will definitely like it once
you use it so I hope you have liked this
