guys asked me how can we
a picture of the jframe we are using so
exactly he wanted to know that how can I
save my jframe in the form of PNG
picture on jpg picture so today I'm
gonna show you how you can show your Jay
Paul frame or your panel in the form of
picture
so as of I know except from Jay cream
you can take a picture of everything
like panels and buttons and tables and
all and you can take a picture and save
it into the PNG of jframe also but in
this Java frames it's a little bit
difficult but you can surely do it so
what I will do is I will enclose
everything into the panel and I will
take a picture of a panel so I will
enclose from here to here
pull jframe into a panel and I will take
a picture and save it in the form of PNG
so in other way you are taking directly
picture of whole jframe so first of all
what I will do is from this corner on
the starting I'll just
select all of my jframe starting to end
and then I will click right and close in
swing containers and I will enclose
everything into the panel so just click
this and you have covered everything
into a panel and our panel name is I
will set it as my
and so I know the name that this is my
name and now I will go directly to my
source code Oh first of all I will take
a button from which I will save my whole
panel into the form of PNG file and I
will name it as pig pick so when I click
this button my panel picture is will be
saved into my source project file now
what I will do is I will go to my source
code and at the top of my source code I
will make a function or a method called
public
static so Publix static
before image
and function is get screen shot
this one refused and the dirt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
