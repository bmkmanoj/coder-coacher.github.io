tutorial on Java programming for
beginners till now we have seen the
procedural part of Java now from this
video we will see some of the
object-oriented aspects of Java and
first of all we will see what are
classes and how we can declare classes
in Java and how we can use classes in
Java so first of all what is a class you
may have noticed that whenever we have
created our first program it was a class
and inside this class we were calling
this main method so every Java project
has at least one class and one main
method and class is basically a data
structure or type in side which you can
define some variables which are called
member variables and methods which are
called member methods and the most
important property of classes are you
can create instance or object from class
so you can maintain different states of
at last using these instances or objects
so let us see how we can define a class
which will be a new class and how we can
use it with our main class which is my
class so for example we want to make
some student data structure and for that
we will make a class so just go to your
project if you are using eclipse and go
to the package you have made we have
made a lesson one package at the
starting of this video series go to that
package inside which you will be having
a class my class in my case just go to
the package right click the same package
and
go to new and create a new class and
this class name we will name it as
student okay and leave everything as
default and click finish and now we have
this student class inside our lesson 1
package so we have two classes now my
class is the first class which we were
working on and the second class is
called student dot Java and this is the
second class we have created now now
this class can have its member variables
and methods so for example what can be
the traits of the student student can
have his ID
so ID is integer values I declare a
variable called ID student can have name
so I declare a variable called name and
student can have age his age so I have
declare student age okay so this is
basically you have created a class and
it can have member variables it can also
have member methods that we will see in
a moment but let's consider this is a
basic student class which contains three
variables ID name and age okay now to
call this class in your main method in
my my class you can just create an
instance of or object of the class so
how you can do it you can just call the
same name student class name
just copy this name here and then give
the name to your instance so as we have
we give any name to our variables for
example age name or something here also
you can give the name to the students
variable
for example the name is mark we are
making the data structure for mark is
equal to new student okay and this
basically we have created an instance of
student class which we named as mark so
this is a mark instance so mark here
mark here is called object okay
or some people also call it as instense
okay instance so mark is here called
object or instance and this object we
can use to you know assign values to the
member variables of the student class
for example marks ID is so whenever you
call this instance called mark and
whenever you use this dot separator it
will give you the options which is
provided by eclipse to you so the
student class contain age ID and name so
we will choose ID student ID is equal to
for example a one mark is our first
student and in the same way you can call
mark dot name should be mark dot name is
equal to name is mark we already know
and the age so mark dot age is equal to
and he is fifteen year old for example
so what we have done is we have created
an instance of student class and we name
it as mark and then to this instance
we have created or we have assigned some
values and these values we can you know
access these values with the same name
small dot ID mark dot name and math dot
age so you can just write this Oh
control shift and then you can just
write mark dot name is so you use plus
or concatenation operator is and then
plus and then mark dot age so we will
print mark is whatever his age is years
old okay years old
okay and when we run this program it
will print mark is 15 years old okay
in a similar way we can create different
instances of our classes and so what we
can do is we I will just copy the same
mark student class and we will create a
new object called this time we call it
Tom okay so here tom is the second
instance of the student class
okay and his ID is to name is Tommy
itself and the age is for example 14
okay so in here we can once again make
the copy of this print line method and
this time we will just replace mark by
tom and now you can see it prints tom is
14 year old and is there something wrong
here yeah here we haven't changed this
instance name here
once again we will run the program and
say is mark is 15 year old and tom is 14
years old okay so using a class we can
define different object and we can
define these object values of object
number variable values which are
independent of each other so this
instance values which are ID Tom's ID
Tom's name and Tom's age is independent
of Mark's ID Mark's name and marks age
okay so this is very important property
of object that it can store its own
state and it's independent of the other
instance right now in you know in java
programming or programming in general we
never use or this kind of usage direct
usage of variables are discouraged and
why it's discouraged because any other
person or whoever is whoever is using
your code can modify these values so we
use some you know some methods or some
functions which can get or set these
values okay so what I mean by getting
and setting these values is I can go to
this class called student and in here I
can just use I can just go to the source
tab and in here I can go to so we will
go to the source and just go to generate
getters and setters here and here we can
see operation is not applicable in
current plus okay and in here
we will just use this and click once
again getters and setters so just click
one variable name or variable then only
this will work so go to source once
again and create getters and setters and
in here select all so we are basically
making getter and setter method for
every value because we do not want to
use or we do not want to access these
variables directly we just create
getters and setters for all of them and
whenever we click OK you can see here
Java has created us these Gators and
setters for all these values ok and what
this is basically doing is it has we
whenever we want to
you know assign some value to the ID we
will use set ID method and whenever we
want to get the value of ID we will use
get method and this is called
encapsulation of a variable and this is
important because we do not want to give
access to our variables to some other
user which is unknown to us right and so
now what we are going to do is we have
generated these getters and setters in
between our variables so we can just cut
these values and paste it here and these
Caterson settles we have generated for
all the values right so now when we want
to assign some value to the mark
instance instead of this mark dot ID we
will just use mark dot set ID was set ID
and then we can give any ID to mark and
this value assignment is
we are not going to use in the same way
we will use marks dot set name and this
name we will give to mark and in the
same way we will assign age to mark so
mark dot set age okay AJ is 15 right and
in a same way we will do something with
Tom's instance also so tom dot set ID
tom dot set name so tom dot set name we
will assign this name to Tom and Tom dot
set age same thing here so basically
what we have done we have used instead
of direct assignment we are assigning
values using these skaters and setters
and this protects your data from
corrupting if you somebody wants to
corrupt or your daughter or something
like this okay and to get these value
you just call mark dot get name and mark
dot get age okay and same we will do
with our Tom instance and whenever we
run the program result will be same but
this is more preferred while you are
accessing or assigning the values to the
member variables so this is how classes
works in Java there are more things to
you know classes which we will discuss
in further videos per but that's it for
this video please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
