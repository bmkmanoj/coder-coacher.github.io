letting some online tutorial for
beginners in this video I'm going to
show you how you can use watch command
in Linux what is an excellent command
which can run scripts for command at a
regular interval or repeatedly so for
example I'm going to give you an example
which I have taken in the last video and
you have used this free command to know
the resources used in our system right
and if you use a watch command so any
command which you use with watch so I'm
going to just try it watch before this
command then this command will be
executed repeatedly if you use watch
before any command right so let's just
press ENTER and you can see after every
two seconds this command is going to be
executed and you can see the resources
used will be changed after two second
you can see it's changed right so by
default the command will be executed at
an interval of two seconds right now if
you want to make it faster we can do it
just press control C to come out of this
command so just press control control C
and you will come out of this Kamal now
for example we want to increase the
frequency to execute this command you
can use the flag n and then the number
of seconds which you want to provide so
earlier by default it was 2 for example
I want to use 1 second interval so I can
just write minus M space 1 and it's
going to be executed at an interval of 1
second so I am going to press ENTER once
again and now it's you know refreshing
at a 1 second interval ok now even I can
you know increase this frequency in
points also so what we can do is I'm
going to open press control C once again
and instead of one second for example I
want
who execute this command at an interval
of 0.5 second I can just do it by just
writing 0.5 here and press Enter and
it's going to be executed at 0.5 second
you can see every 0.5 second ok so this
is how you can use watch command so you
can use this watch command with any
command or even with the script is going
to execute that script repeatedly ok so
in the last video we have also seen that
DF command which is disk free command
right so we can also use this this free
command you can just write TF and then
press enter and it's going to you know
execute this command repeatedly right
now nothing is happening here because we
are not downloading or uploading
anything on our system or from our
system for example if you download a big
file you will be able to see the used
memory and available memory changing so
you can use it as a you know watch to
watch what kind of memory is used or you
can you know think of any command which
can be used repeatedly and you can use
this command with that command
ok so I hope you've enjoyed this video

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
