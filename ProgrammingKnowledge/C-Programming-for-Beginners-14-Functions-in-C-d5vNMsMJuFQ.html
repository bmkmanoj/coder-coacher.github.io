tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video I am going to show you
how you can use function in C and what
is a function so first of all what is a
function a function is a piece of code
or a block of code which we can use to
perform a particular task for example
adding two numbers you may wish to add
two numbers multiple times in your
program and you can define a function
for this to add two numbers and you can
use your function again and again or you
can call your function again and again
inside any other function so let's see
how we can declare function but first of
all I must say that every C program has
at least one function and this function
is called mean right in the starting of
this series I have told you that this
mean is a function okay and every
program has at least one function and
this function is called mean and
whenever you execute your program C
searches for this main function and
executes whatever inside this so
function more or less looks like this
itself it has a return type it has the
name of the function this is a inbuilt
name in C which is mean but you can
define a user-defined function and give
it any name and then comes this bracket
and then curly braces so let's see how
or what is the definition or declaration
of this function for example so this is
how you declare a function this is not
actually declare
raishin but this is some pseudo
declaration I will declare a function in
a moment so function you can declare
first of all you must have the type of
function which it returns and then you
give the name to your function and then
in the bracket you can pass argument or
parameters like this of some type and
inside your curly braces you write your
code okay so I will just comment this
for now so that we can see as a
reference see it as a reference right
now you can define your function above
your main function or below your main
function but there is a difference in
using or declaring your function above
and below which I am going to tell you
but let's take an example for example we
want to add two numbers using a function
so how we can do it or let us take a
rather more simple example than this
also we want to print something using a
function okay so for example I have told
you that function start with a return
type and this time we for example we
won't want to return anything then we
write void void means we are not
returning anything right
then comes the name of the function this
name you can define anything for example
my function name any name you can give
it and then comes your bracket like this
and it can take some parameters and it
cannot I mean it you it's your wish if
you want to give some parameters to this
function or not it depends upon your
requirement right now we do not want to
pass any
parameters but we will see how we can
use parameters based function in the
next videos so just for now we will not
pass any parameter to the function right
and then comes these two curly braces
and now in this function I want to
perform some code for example I want to
print something print F and we can say
we are inside a function right and end
line okay now for example you want to
you know do some most of for example
adding some two numbers for example you
want to add two numbers and show the sum
so you can just write print F this
should be print F not print F and then
you can write some sum is equal to and
then you can write percentage D and then
you can add two numbers for example 10
plus 52 this is just an example I am
giving you so so you can just write your
code inside a function any code any
numbers or offline you can write inside
a function and then you can call this
function in your mean and for calling
your function you just need to copy the
name of the function as it is just copy
this name and then inside your main
function which is this one you just
paste it here okay and then give a
semicolon here and what this do is this
function name and replace is replaced by
this code okay so whenever you call a
function this code is
also called in place of this function so
in indirectly we are calling this code
in here inside our main function
okay and the logical name we have given
to this function so that more or less
the name of the function should reflect
the code which we are writing okay now
we will run the code compile and run the
code it says sum is equal to 62 which is
this line sum is equal to 62 and then it
right we are inside a function right so
what happens here your programs starts
from here and goes to the second line
and then comes here and it sees that
there is a declaration of function so it
remembers that this is a function which
we have declared and whenever our main
function calls this function we need to
execute these lines and because we are
calling this function inside our main it
will execute this okay you can use this
function multiple times inside your code
also like this like this three times and
for example I will just change this
lines so that we can see it more clearly
and you can see some 62 we are in the
function some 62 we are in the function
three times okay so this shows that you
can call a function multiple times in
your code and that is the basic usage of
function so function makes your code
really readable and fast to execute and
you can perform this function or call
this function again and again so this
makes your code really
short and understandable and concise
okay now some people also like to call
this function below your the main
function here and there is no I mean
difference I in declaring the function
below your main or above the main but if
you want to declare your function below
your mean you just need to prototype
your function just copy this here and
paste the declaration here right and I
will show you if you don't do this what
happens if I do not prototype this I
will just delete this and compile try to
compile my program it still runs but
when you prototype your function then
you are just saying your C program that
there is a function called my first
function name which we are going to
define somewhere in our code so your C
program comes here and sees there is a
function with a name my function name
which is defined in our code so it goes
from here to here and see the definition
of the function this is the definition
of the function and this is called the
prototyping of the function or forward
declaration of the function and then it
goes here and whenever your main calls
your function it knows that this
function is defined here okay so it's a
good practice whenever you define a
function below your mean just prototype
it like this when what is what I mean by
prototyping you just need to copy this
from void to the function not the curly
braces but from here to here and just
paste it here
gave a semicolon here after this okay
and run it once again it will execute
fine so this is how you can use
functions in C there are different kind
of function for example function which
takes parameter or function which
returns some value which I am will show
you in the next videos so I hope you
