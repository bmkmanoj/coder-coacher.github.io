cutie tutorial for beginners and in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
use a resource files in QT now in the
previous to previous video I have shown
you how you can add an image inside a
label in QT so when I run this program
you can see I have shown you how you can
add this image in cue label like this
and in that video I have shown you how
to do it using this type of code which
is this one right so if you don't know
you can just watch the previous two
previous video and you will be able to
you know see that I have shown you this
kind of code in order to show this image
but there was one problem with this code
which was the location because I have
given the absolute path of the image to
show it inside the Q label which is not
the good practice because imagine
whenever you want to port your QT
application on for example a different
operating system like Linux and then
this Linux operating system doesn't have
this kind of folder structure so this
location will not be found and this
image will not be shown on the label and
even on the same operating system for
example you want to you know transfer
your application from one Windows
operating system to another it may be
possible that this location is not
present in the other Windows operating
system so it's always a good practice to
provide not absolute path but the
relative path and QT allows us to create
resource file in which we can and give
the information about our files and then
we can provide the location according to
that and this makes it easier to you
know port our application from a one
to turn to another because it doesn't
follow this strict path structure okay
so let's see how we can create a
resource file so in order to create a
resource file you just need to
right-click on your project and then
click add new and in here go to QT and
select QT resource file and then choose
and then gave the name of your file so
for example resource itself I'm going to
give the name to my other source file as
resource itself or you can change the
name to anything do you just need to you
know give any name according to your
usage right so I have given here
resource name and then click Next and
then just click finish ok and after
clicking finish you will be able to see
here there is one category added to our
project which is resources and when you
expand this you can see this is our
resource dot qrc file so this is the
name which we have provided and this has
the extension of qrc file right now when
you select this qrc file you will be
able to see at the bottom some options
so you can just click this combo box
here and you can see there is option
called add prefix so prefix is something
like folder structure you want to give
in your project so for example I have
this image at a particular location in
my computer not in my project but in my
computer and I want to transfer this to
my project so first of all let's create
a folder inside our project so I'm going
to right-click on any of the source file
in the project like this and then click
show in Explorer which is going to open
the project path for you okay and in
here what I'm going to do is I'm going
to just create a new folder and I'm
going to name it as IMG for images right
and inside this image
folder I'm going to copy my image so
just I will just copy this image to this
image folder which I've created inside
my login project which is this project
right so I have this image now here okay
now I'm going to minimize everything and
then I can go here and first of all I
will create a prefix so here just add
prefix and you can see there is already
this default option which is given to
you which is / new slash prefix so you
can change this prefix to for example I
am G for images right and you can see
it's added here so just press enter and
this prefix will be added to your you
know qrc file right and then you can
give the location of your image right so
what you can do here is now once again
go here add and then this time you will
be able to add your image here so you
can just click add files and it's going
to ask you from where we want to add
file so just go to image folder which we
have created and select the image which
you have you know paste it here right so
something like this okay so you can see
we have the image folder and inside the
image folder we have once again image
folder and slash login icon dot PNG
something like this even you can just
change this prefix to instead of image
just changes to only forward slash and
this will be your location or better we
can change the name of this
you know prefixes resources right so you
have your resource folder and then you
have a mid slash login file here right
so this is how you can add the resource
file in your project now in order to use
this resource file in your project what
you can do is you can once again extend
this you know qrc or file and you can
see there is a resource folder which
indicates this folder and inside the
resource folder you have this file which
is image slash log in PNG and when you
right-click on this image you will be
able to see this option which says copy
path and without qrc so this is the
first part which is copy path not copy
URL but copy path so just click this
option which says copy path and then go
to your code wherever you have provided
the location of your image previously
this was the location we have provided
earlier instead of this you just need to
click paste here because we have already
copied the path right so this will be
the path of your image from here okay so
now you can see there is no strict path
according to the operating system it
it's according to the rules of Qt not
according to the rules of any operating
system so Linux operating system can
also recognize this image path and
Windows operating system can also
recognize this image for path right now
we are going to run our application and
let's see everything is good or not so
just wait for it and you can see
everything is fine here right so in this
way you can provide the resource file in
your project and maintain it
not even the images you can provide any
JSON file if you want to read any JSON
files or any other formatted files you
can provide under the
source you know folder or files here
right and you don't need to worry about
the path of these files anymore because
QT has this resource file option for you
so I hope you enjoyed this video please
