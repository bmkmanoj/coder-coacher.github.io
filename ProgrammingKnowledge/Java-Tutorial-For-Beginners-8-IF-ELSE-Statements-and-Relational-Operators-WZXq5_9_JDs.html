tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are conditional statements and we
will also see what is an if statement in
Java which is also called a conditional
statement and we will see an example how
we can implement if statement in Java so
first of all what is a conditional
statement a conditional statement is a
statement which evaluates some condition
whether it is true or false and based
upon this condition it executes some
code so for example I am going to give
you the an example of if statement which
is also a conditional statement how it
works so the basic syntax of the
conditional statement if is like this so
we you write a keyword called
if and then you write these two brackets
and inside these two brackets you
evaluate some boolean condition or
boolean expression and if this condition
is true we will execute some code inside
these curly braces otherwise we will not
execute this code if this condition is
not true so for example I have this
integer called X which is equal to 10
and I want to evaluate this X if it's
really equal to 10 or not and based upon
this I want to execute some code or some
some other statement
so let's implement if statement in here
so we will write if X double equal to 10
then we will execute some code okay
inside these curly braces okay
so first of all what is this double
equal to double equal to means this is a
comparison operator okay which checks
equality okay
so this double equal to whenever you
write inside your if condition you are
basically checking the Equality of these
two variables okay so we are checking if
X is really equal to 10 or not and yes
if X is really equal to 10 because we
have assigned 10 to X and if this
statement is true we want to just print
out system dot out dot print line okay
and we will say that yes x equal to 10
okay so we will run this program and see
whether our code is correct or not so I
will just compile this program and it
says yes X is equal to 10 which means
that this condition is true and which is
actually true because the value of x is
equal to 10 so here instead of X we can
replace the value of x which is 10 and
we are checking whether it's equal to 10
which is true so this condition will be
you know followed and this statement
will be executed otherwise nothing will
be executed so for example we will check
if X is equal to 20 this condition is
false right so we will just run the
program once again and we will see
nothing in here because this condition
is not true so this statement will not
be you know executed an if statement
there is a statement called as else
statement which executes
when this condition is not true so
whenever we write something like this
else and inside this bracket it doesn't
you know compares anything it just
executes some code if this condition is
not true
so we can say no X is not equal to then
okay so and in Java this is called a non
Equality operator so this says that this
is not equal to ten okay so whenever we
run the program once again it says no X
is not equal to ten right
which is you know true because the value
of x is ten ten is not equal to 20 so
this statement is not executed but as
this statement will be executed because
the condition is false okay so if the
condition is not false then your program
goes to else statement and this else
statement will be executed
okay now in Java there are different
kind of comparison operators and we will
see what are those so I will give you
what are these all comparison operator
in Java
so these are some of the comparison
operator we use in Java
first I have already shown you whenever
you write double equal it checks the
Equality right and whenever you write
this apostrophe or what symbol I do not
remember the name of this and equal to
then it checks the non Equality
condition so whenever you write here
something like this this checks or this
says that X is not equal to 20 we are
checking that X is not equal to 10 or 20
we
just true in this case then this
statement will be executed right because
10 is not equal to 20 the condition is
true right so it says yes X is equal to
10 okay so second type is non Equality
operator third is this angle bracket on
the left side I can say which checks
whether right left hand side the
operator is greater than the left hand
side you know value right so if it I
will write something like this it will
check whether the value of X is greater
than 20 or not okay and if this angle
bracket has the face on the right hand
side then it will check whether X is
less than 20 or not right and we can
also check to condition or dual equality
and greater them so this type of
operation says or checks whether the
value of x for example we will check
this here and checks whether the value
of x is greater than or equal to 20
right and this other last statement
checks where the value of x is less than
or equal to 20 so these are some of the
comparison operators in Java and this is
how you can use if-else statement in
Java which is also called a conditional
statement of which is also a kind of
conditional statement in Java so I hope
