show you what is inheritance and what
are subclasses and super classes in
Python so we all know that Python is an
object-oriented programming language and
inheritance is one of the most important
concepts in object-oriented programming
language now what is inheritance
inheritance allows us to define a class
in terms of another class which makes it
easier to create and maintain our
application so for example you have
created a class which is generic in
nature and you want to you reuse it
again and again in different situations
you can use inheritance to you know show
or inherit some of the traits or all the
traits from the class to your class
which you want to make so you don't need
to write a class from the scratch you
can inherit from the superclass the
class from which we are inheriting is
called a super class and the class which
is inheriting is called a subclass so
let me give you an example for example I
create a class which I call this is a
parent parent ok and this class has two
values or two variables value one is
equal to let's say it's a string so I
say this is
value one and in the same way I will
define value to this should be value
right so I will define value to variable
which is the second member variable of
this class and this is value to okay now
for example I want to reuse the
variables which are their member
variables which are there in the parent
class and I want to create a second
class and I want to reuse these the
member variables in other class how we
can do it so I will define a second
class for example class and I will name
it as child and this class wants to
reuse these member variables from the
parent class so what I can do is I can
inherit from the parent class in the
child class and to inherit the parent
class in the child class we just use
these two brackets and inside these two
brackets we just pass the name of the
class from which we want to inherit so
in this case we want to inherit from
this parent class so we can just pass
this parent class name and in the
brackets right now we can use this
values from the instance of our child
class so for example I don't want to do
anything here I can just write pass and
pass if you don't know what is passed
pass is just a placeholder so you know
it doesn't do anything
but you suppose you don't want to
implement your class and you want to
leave your class as it is then pass will
help you to avoid any errors so let's
see what happens when we don't use pass
here and I will save my program and run
it and it says unexpected indent session
then should not be here run it once
again so it shows an error and what is
the error because we haven't given a
pass here it expect or Pythian expect
that we define some you know definitions
of member variables of member functions
here so what we can use is we can use
pass in order to avoid any errors now
whenever we want to make a child class
instance for example child like this is
equal to and we want to make the
instance of this child class we can make
it like this so we just can make the
instance child you can just kill
underscore to differentiate this
instance from this class but let's first
create an instance of the parent class
and then we will create the instance of
child parent &amp;amp; parent is equal to parent
so we have created the instance of
parent class and from this instance we
can call parent dot value one which is
this one and we just want to print this
parent dot value one so
you can just print and inside our print
you can just pass this parent dot print
one here and let's say we will define it
this child class later so I will just
run this once again ad prints this is
value one okay
in a similar manner you can call second
value from parent and this you already
know right now suppose child instance
want to use value one and value two I
create the instance of child and because
I am inheriting from my parent class
this value 1 or and value 2 which are
member for member variables of this
parent class is available to use from
the instance of child class also because
by inheritance we are allowing the
superclass which is this parent class
from which we are inheriting so the
class from which we are inheriting is
called super class and the class which
is inheriting from super class is called
subclass so from this instance we can
call this member when values or
variables from the parent class so I can
just once again copy this print value 1
but this time I will use the instance of
child class and you can see here I
haven't implemented anything in the
child class except the inheritance right
so I will just run the program once
again and it should it prints this
double x so for example I delete this to
illustrate this example clearly l1 say
in one this ad prints this is value one
and this is value to which is printed by
the instance of child class right that
means we can use the member variables or
member when use of parent class when we
be inherit from parent class to a child
class right now you can inherit from
multiple classes so for example you have
parent class one you have parent class
two and you want to inherit from both
the classes you can inherit from parent
one like this comma parent - like this
okay so you can even inherit from two
classes or multiple classes at the same
time you just need to separate those
parent class by this comma
okay so just remember this so in this
way you can use inheritance in Python
