video I will show you how to install
Eclipse IDE and your Ubuntu 12.10
operating system so the desktop looked
like this and what you want to do is go
to here Ubuntu Software Center click it
and it will open
you
you window
so this window is open Ubuntu Software
Center
and what you have to do is go here in
the search option and right
eclipse
and it will search for decades idea here
so now what you do is just take it
and here
on the right-hand side
click
install
start installing Eclipse
Oh No
to last for the authentication just
enter your password
and this
and here you can see it's B and you can
also download the plugin for C C++ and
other plugins in the clips
so this we will see later
the process is going on here you can see
then will be complete I will show you
what to do next
so now our Eclipse IDE is installed here
we can see if you want to remove your
Eclipse I need and by this button you
can remove olson and now we will like to
open our tips so go here
- oh and click it and
it will open another
we'll look
something
and in here type eclipse
when you did eclipse any on dashhome
here
you can see Eclipse appears Eclipse Idol
and you just need to
take it and bless it
Sybok
right
so now
dragged or I can do
double-check the cycle
Eclipse IDE will start in a moment
you
so when Eclipse IDE starts it asked you
to select the workspace I will select
the default books workspace which is
already
selected by eclipse for me
starting
so Eclipse ID e has started
so
the files you can go to new
projects
we can start their projects but
one thing to notice is if you want to
develop any C C++ application with
eclipse you need to install one more
plugin in Eclipse called Eclipse CDT
which means for you
perhaps in the next video so that's it
for now please rate comment and
subscribe and by tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
