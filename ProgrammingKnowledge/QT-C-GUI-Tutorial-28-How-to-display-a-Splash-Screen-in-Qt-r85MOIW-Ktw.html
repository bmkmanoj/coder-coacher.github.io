video I will show you how to add a
splash screen with your QT GUI C++
application so I have this blank QT GUI
application made and for example I want
to start up my application with a splash
screen and then this foam should appear
so how can we do it let's get started
when we go to first of all this add it
tab here and go to my main dot CPP file
and in here I will include some headers
so I will include Q splash screen and I
will also include Q time okay now inside
this main form I will go after this
object declaration of to application I
will declare this Q splash screen object
with a name splash for example with L
splash is equal to new splash screen and
then I will copy this splash object and
I will say set pixmap and inside this I
will write Q pixmap and in the
bracket I want to add a picture for
example as a splash screen so I will go
to the location of the picture and right
click and go to the properties and I
will copy the path of the picture which
I want to show as a splash screen and I
go to my program once again and paste it
here this path and I will change these
backward slashes to forward slashes so
that it can recognize the path just
change these slashes as /and in the next
line just copy this splash object and
say show okay
now in order to show this splash screen
for some time and then start your
application we need our timer so we use
signal and slot functions to add this
splash screen for some second and then
we will start our main window so go
after the declaration of this main
window object here and in here I will
write Q timer then signal and slot
signal slot and in this bracket I will
pass three argument first argument will
be the number of milliseconds so for
example I want
two hundred two thousand five hundred
milliseconds and second argument will
will be this splash and third argument
will be
the slot so slot will be I want to close
this after 2.5 seconds so I will write
here slot as close so this will close
this splash screen after 2.5 second and
after exactly 2.5 second I want to show
the main window of the main frame so I
will just copy this object and paste it
here so it will start this off this main
window up to 2.5 second when this splash
screen closes and my slot will be this
show method from here and we can safely
comment this because we are already
doing this in this line now let's run
the program and let's see if it works or
not so save all and showing me some
errors let's see what are they okay so I
have one shortage of this bracket and in
here also yes I need to give one more
bracket here okay now once again I will
run my program and what is it okay so I
need to dereference this main window and
now when I run the program it shows me
the splash screen and then the main
window once again when I run the program
it shows me the splash screen and then
my window you can change the timing of
the splash screen for example you want
to show it for 5 seconds will just write
5 thousand milliseconds and this also 5
thousand milliseconds and once again
when you run the program
it will stay for five seconds and then
your main form comes so in this way you
can simply add a splash screen to your
QT GUI application I hope you have
