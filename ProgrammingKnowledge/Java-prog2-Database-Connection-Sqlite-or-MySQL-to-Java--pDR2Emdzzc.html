now I will show you how to connect
SQLite database it NetBeans Java ID so
earlier we created project called
project one two three so right click on
that putting you and click Java class
let us ask you the name so we are going
to name it us
Java connect press finish
and we create a new class called I work
on it
we have to import certain things right
and copying pasting because I'm lazy so
put Java dot school dot star semi colon
and import javax.swing dot star you have
to import these two files then
you have to
write small code which is like that
right connection
Khan is equal to null then create a
method called public static connection
connect to db2 means call this name then
right try
and make a catch poet
and y-you have to write class dot for
name and in the brackets
you have to write connect SQLite you
have to connect right here is one g dot
SQLite dot JDBC is the standard
connection path you have to give to in
order to connect it from JDBC then you
have to write connection call you can
give it any name I have given it Conn is
equal to driver manager dot get
connection and in the bracket you have
to write
and show you
JD bish JDBC SQL and the file you have
already made in SQLite
which is project 1 2 3 . SQLite file and
you have to give the path so we have we
know that we already saved our file
enough NetBeans project will go to the
Magnum project click 1 2 3 this is the
the database file of S or SQLite file
you already created in the last tutorial
so go click this you just have to copy
its path so copy the path
and
paste it here
once again copy the part or somehow dent
copied it old paste
here
and you copy the part and paste it here
it will show error because instead of
these this slash you have to give it
this song
this kind of a slash double slash
if you don't give double slash it will
not connect to the file and it will show
the other I got delete this thing and
we'll show error you have to type double
slash so once again you have to like
connection only we going to driver
manager not get connection and in this
racket you have to write JDBC semicolon
SQLite color C or whatever the path you
have copied your to just paste it here
okay
this is the part I have pasted and then
just copy the name
and
to this
paste the name dot skew every water
c-can't so we are connected to our
database and then you have to return
call and write the catch block catch the
bracket exception e and then in the
catch block drive J option pain dot so
show message dialog and then bracket
null if comma E so if any error in
connection comes it will show what is
the error in the form of dialog box you
can also write this block
the optional pain dots show message
dialog nollie coma connection
established so you will be able to know
that when the connection is made the
dialog box will open and you'll show
connection established
so this thing you can also make if you
have MySQL database instead of SQLite
database we just have to change two
things in order to connect it from my
school I donated pins that is you have
to write class dot for name comm dot
MySQL dot d DB C dot driver and here
below it connection Khan is equal to
driver manager dot get connection JDBC
dot MySQL dot the name of the localhost
in my case this is localhost and the
name of the database v and whatever your
username and password this so we have to
write this
and rest will be the same once again
right calm but SQL dot JDBC driver and
then get connection you have to write
this so in this way you can establish
the connection between MySQL or SQLite
from NetBeans so I think that's it for
now please rate comment and subscribe
and see you in next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
