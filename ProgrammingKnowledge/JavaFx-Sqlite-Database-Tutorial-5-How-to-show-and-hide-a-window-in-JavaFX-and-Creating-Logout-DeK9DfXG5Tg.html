SQLite database tutorial for beginners
in this video we will see how we can
hide our first window when we open the
second window so for example we have our
login window here and when I login and
login is successful is going to open the
second window but the first window which
is the login window is not hidden so I
want to hide this and then open this and
we will also see how can we create a
sign out button so that when we press
this sign out button is going to open
our login window once again so let's get
started first of all what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go to my user
controller dot Java class which I have
created in the last video ok this is the
user window once user logs in then this
is the controller for the user dot F XML
file right now in here I'm going to
create a method for the button click
event ok so I will name my method as for
example sign out method ok so sign out
ok and it takes one argument which is
action event so just add action event
and give the name to your event here and
then what it does it's going to just
open the last window right but first of
all we need to hide our login window so
go to your login controller dot Java
class and this is the method which we
are using on the successful login and
password right and we are opening from
here the new window which is user window
using this code so go inside this method
and inside this if condition just above
the declaration of your stage what we
are going to do here is just write node
and this is JavaFX see
node okay so this will show the error so
first of all import this Java FX dot
scene dot node
okay so just imports Java FX dot scene
dot node and now in close this node
inside these brackets and then call this
argument called event here and then call
get source and then once again and close
this code inside the brackets here and
then call a method called
dot get scene so just call this get
scene here and then call a method called
a get window here and then you have your
window so you can hide it so you can
call a method called hide here okay so
this is the code to hide your stage okay
and now let's run our code and let's see
if this login window is hidden using
this code or not
so I'm going to save everything and run
my code and I'm going to give my
username test and password test and I
will click login and now you can see
this login window is hidden right now we
want to do the same for the user window
right so we want to create a button
which we can click and we can go to the
login window so for that we have created
this user controller dot Java and in
here we have the sign out method which I
have created just a moment ago so in
here what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go to my login controller dot Java
class and I will copy all this code from
here right so this is the same code
which I'm going to use to you know open
the login window ok so just use this
code from node to the end of your stage
show
ok so copy it and now go to your user
controller and go to your sign out
method and paste it there and it's going
to show this error we want to remove
this user control
the you know declaration from here
because we are not passing any you know
parameter from one window to another so
just remove this user controller
definition here and we will also remove
this call of the function which was get
user which we have created in the last
video so now this is your code okay now
in here we want to call the login dot F
XML file from the user right so just
call a login dot F XML file and this
code throws some error so you need to
enclose your code inside a try/catch
block so just add a try-catch block here
and inside your try catch block just
enclose this code so so just paste it
here okay and your error will go okay
so just write this code here and now one
thing remains is we need to add a button
to our user dot F XML file so just open
your user dot F XML file using scene
builder and once your user dot F XML
file is open first of all what we are
going to do is because it's a border
pain which we have used in the last
video and in the last video if you
remember we added this label so what we
are going to do first here is we will
right click on our label from here and
then we will wrap it in the H box so
just go wrap in and then choose H box
okay
so it's going to wrap your label in a
horizontal box and now take a button and
place it inside your horizontal box here
okay and now what we are going to do is
we are going to name our button as for
example sign out right and then go to
code here and in here on action we are
going to give this
not method which we have created right
this is the sign-out method which we
have created now save your code and then
go to your Eclipse IDE and then refresh
your project once again so refresh it
and now you are ready to go so just run
your project it opens my login window so
I will give my username and password for
example test and test and when I click
login it opens my user window and login
window is hidden and when I click sign
out it opens my login window and user
window is hidden right so in this way
you can create a sign out button and
hide one bin window when you open the
second window so I hope you have enjoyed
