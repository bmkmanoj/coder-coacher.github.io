video I am going to show you how to use
loops in c-sharp and I will start with a
while loop and in the next couple of
video I will teach you how to use
do-while and for loop and some other
formats of loop so let's start with a
loop so what is a loop a loop is a code
or a piece of code which enables you to
do a particular task again and again
okay so as the name suggests it will
loop through the statement or the task
again and again until and unless you're
provided condition is not true so let's
see oh how we can use blue loop to print
ten numbers from one to ten so what I
have done is I have written this code to
print the number so I will ask the user
to enter please enter a number and then
whenever he enters the number using this
red line I will pass this number to the
integer and I will store this into this
in variable which is number I have also
declared a integer variable called int
and I have initialized it with for
example zero okay now let's see how we
can declare a while loop a while loop
start with this keyword while and then
you give this bracket and then you give
these curly braces so in this brackets
comes the condition and inside these
curly braces comes your statement or the
task you want to perform so I want to
print ten numbers right so what I can do
is I can say while count is less than
my number which is this one I want to
print that number so I will say number
and I will use this placeholder to show
the number and I will say and oh okay
and let's give this slash and to change
the line okay and this slash must be
backslash and now I will increase the
value of count one by one so I will say
count plus plus so this count plus plus
will increase the value by one by one so
let's just run the code and let's see
what happens and I will explain you once
again now run the code and it will ask
me to enter the number I will enter
number and I will press ENTER and it
will repeat my print statement ten times
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten right so I'm printing this
number ten times now to make it more
interesting I will just change this
number by this count and I will start it
once again and I will just give ten once
again and I will press ENTER and now you
can see it starts from zero one two
three four five six seven eight nine and
total these are ten numbers right so now
what this code is doing first of all
user has entered a number for example 10
and this count value is zero okay so it
goes to this while loop and it sees okay
zero is less than ten so I will print
this and the value of count is zero so I
will print
number is equal to zero and I will
increase the count by one so now the
value in the count is 1 and then once
again it will go to the while condition
and once again it sees 1 is less than 10
so it will print 1 here once again count
will be increased by 1 so its values 2
goes here 2 is less than 10 it performs
this food then 3 3 is less than 10 4 is
less than 10 5 6 7 8 9 and it as soon as
it sees that the count is 10 this code
will not be performed okay so it will go
up to 9 because 9 is less than 10 and
when it the value of count is 10 10 is
not less than 10 so it will not print
this 10 here so in this way you can loop
around a statement and you can perform a
certain statement or certain piece of
food again and again to print this value
or to perform some task until and unless
your condition is true okay so while
this condition is true you can perform
this code otherwise it will go out of
the board okay now as we have seen in
the last video you can use break to
break a loop or a statement so you can
write break and you can just do it like
this and what this break does is it will
break the loop and for the first time
whenever it's your port sees this break
in the loop will just go out of the loop
right for example I will just run the
code once again and I will give 10 input
once again and you can see here it only
printed Z
oh why it printed zero because once
again the number value is ten count is
zero it will go here it will perform
your code it will print number is equal
to zero it will increase the count but
it sees there is a break here so it
doesn't go around the loop but it goes
out of the loop when it sees this break
so this use of break is also important
in some conditions whenever you need to
go out of the loop without performing
the whole condition so just remember
that so I hope you have enjoyed this

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
