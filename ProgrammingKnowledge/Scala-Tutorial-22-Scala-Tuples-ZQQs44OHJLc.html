Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn how to use tuples or
tuples in Scala now in Scala tuples is a
class that can contain different kind of
elements now unlike lists or array which
were able to contain elements of same
data-type tuples can contain elements of
different data type that means
heterogeneous data types so let's see
how we can define a table and then we
will see how to use a double so I'm
going to just just give a name to my
double so well or bar and then let's say
my double and then you just give some
values to your table so let's say I want
to just have some number inside my
tuples so I will just write one and
let's say two and also I want to have
some string in my tuples so I can just
write hello and I also want to have a
boolean value so I can write true here
okay so this tuple contains four element
and these element need not be of same
type so they can be of same type they
can be of different datatype even they
can contain objects also now in scala
couple or tuples are of fixed size that
means they are immutable in scala you
cannot change the value of tuple once
it's declared okay so let's use this
tuple and let's print the content of the
tupple using the print line method so
I'm going to run the code and it prints
the values of tuple as expected now in
order to declare this same couple let's
say I want to have
three element in my tuple and let's say
I want to declare it in a different way
with new and the keyword tupple you will
see that let me give a couple let's say
two and you will see tuples here is not
a keyword okay so if you want to declare
tuple in this way you need to write
after the tupple the number of element
that Apple contains so let's say this
tuple contains one two three elements
then after tuple you just write three
here and that's a valid declaration okay
so this you need to keep in mind
so whatever the number of elements are
there in the tapu you need to write that
after this double keyword so double 3
that means double 3 contains three
elements in the same way when a tuple
contains two elements so let's say the
topple contains two element and I'm
going to name my table stubble 3 then
you can see this tuple 3 is going to
give you the error so this notation is
no more valid because topple contains 2
element and we are declaring it with
double 3 so to fix this we can just
write couple to here and this problem
will be fixed so you need to add the
number of elements that up will contain
after this double keyword now this is
allowed up to 22 okay so a couple can
contain 1 to 22 elements after or beyond
22 elements you cannot store more
elements inside a couple so you need to
just find a different kind of collection
to store those elements okay so up to 22
double 22 is possible now how you can
access the values of the double for
example I want to fetch this value 1 or
I want to fetch hello from this tuple
how can I fetch that so when you declare
a couple the values of the table can be
accessed by some methods right so when
you declare a tuple it will just create
these methods automatically so you can
see underscore one underscore to
underscore three underscore 4 is created
for the tuples of four elements right so
these are created after you declare the
tuples so for example I want to fetch
the hollow from my multiple variables so
I can just write my double dot
underscore 3 because it's at the third
position right in a same way let's run
the code and let's see the result first
of all so you can see it gives me hello
in a same way you can just fetch the
other values also so I can just write
one underscore one and then underscore
to underscore three and underscore 4 ok
and it will give me all the four values
of my double variable so couple of four
element will have underscore 1 2 3 4 but
the tuples of 3 element will only have
up to 3 method which is underscore one
underscore two and underscore 3 so let's
see that also so let's say my couple to
here and let's define underscore 4 and
you can see it's an error because
underscore 4 is not a member of this
tuple because this couple doesn't
contain 4 element and when I write
underscore 3 here it's perfectly fine
because
estoppel contains three element and
third element here is hello now let's
say I want to iterate over the values of
this double so how can I do this
so to do that you need to just use your
topple variable name and then there is a
method called product iterator so just
write product iterator you can see this
method and then this product iterator
will give you the access to 4e so you
can just write for each and inside this
for each you can just call your print
line method let's say so you can just
give these curly brackets and inside the
curly brackets you can just define let's
say I and then equals arrow and then you
can just write print Ln and then you can
just print the value of I so using for
each this will iterate over my double
variable and I and I you will get one by
one these values inside the topple I'm
going to run the code and let's see what
happens so I'm going to just run this
code and you can see it has printed
these four values which are 1 2 hello
and true so if you want to iterate over
the a topple you need to use product
iterator method now there is one more
way of creating a topple and that is by
using arrow symbol so in the last video
when I have showed you the maps the maps
can contain key value pairs and these
key value pair one pair is our tupple so
when you define the key value pair you
can just write let's say an integer and
then this arrow and then let's say we
want to have a string so string of some
name so in map this would be
key-value pair right and when you write
something like this is going to create a
couple so I'm going to just run the code
and show you so you can see a tuple is
created using this notation but keep in
mind that this notation is only valid
for two elements so when you just write
let's say something like this so I'm
going to just write true here this will
not give you an error but let's see what
happens so when I run the code you can
see it creates first of all the couple
of forced to element and then it joins
or and creates the tupple of this tuple
and the last element which is true this
is a tuple and then it joins a tuple and
this true so this is another tuple so
keep in mind that this arrow just join
the two elements so in this case this
arrow is joining this tuple and then
this true now let's say I will create a
tuple which have a couple inside it so
I'm going to just create this tuple
which is my tuple 3 and it has one hello
and I'm going to just add some more
values here inside our tuples so inside
these parentheses I'm going to just
write 2 comma 3 okay so what this is
going to do is now it has three elements
so I'm going to just write double 3 here
and then it will be valid so it has
three element 1 hello and a tableau of 2
and 3 okay so to access this what I can
do is I can just write let me just copy
this code and paste it here and I'm
going to just write my tuple 3 and I
want to get the third element which is
underscore
three so it's going to give me this
tupple right so I'm going to run the
code and you can see it gives me this
couple and let's say I want to access
the second value of that tuples testable
right so I want to get three out of this
tuple so how I can fetch this I can just
write dot and then underscore two okay
and then this is going to give me three
right so you can join it like this also
this notation so in this way you can use
tuples in Scala I hope you've enjoyed
