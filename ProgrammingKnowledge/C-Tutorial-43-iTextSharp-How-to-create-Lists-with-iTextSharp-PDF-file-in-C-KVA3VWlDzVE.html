last video I have shown you how to
create a PDF file by using ITEX shop DLL
and your c-sharp application so when you
click this create PDF button a PDF file
called test PDF generates and in that I
have shown you how to enter a paragraph
or how to write a paragraph in that PDF
file in this video I will show you how
to add a list to that PDF so for example
we have some lists and we want to show
it in this PDF so how can we show that
in the PDF I will show you today so
let's get started we close everything
first and I will go to the design and
double click it and this code I have
shown you in the last video so you must
have remember that so in this code just
go above your doc dot close code and I
will make a little space and in here
write this code so write list and give
it a variable name is equal to new list
in the bracket list dot unordered so
this is the type of list you want for
example you want unordered or you want
ABCDE so alphabetical numerical lower
case ordered so you can choose from this
what kind of list you want so right now
I want
unordered list so I select this but you
can choose according to your requirement
then copy this variable and just paste
it here and write dot add and in the
bracket write new list item and in the
bracket write the content of your list
so for example I am giving the first
string of the enlist so that's why I
have written one then in the same way
copy this list variable and paste it
here dot add the second item of the list
third fourth fifth like that okay so
write this this we don't require right
now so okay so for creating a simple
list you just have to write this code
okay so when we run the program once
again username and password and I click
create PDF and I check my PDF once again
so when I double click it you see a
simple unordered list is made by the PDF
Creator ok now I will show you how to
create some other kind of lists with
this code so this is a simple list and
now I will show you the different kind
of list so now suppose you want to give
the indent to your list so what I mean
by indent is the this all are in same
line but if you have seen lits lists it
has some indent so if it just not start
from this
sir corner of the page but it must start
a little bit 'space it gives and then
from here for example and from here it
starts so that's called in the
indentation I will show you what it is
so just see in the code just come to the
code and paste this line after your list
declaration here list list is equal to
new list this this you have already seen
and just to provide the indentation to
your list just right this list dot
indentation left
so if you write indentation left so it
will give the indentation to the left
side of the page is equal to 30 F so
this is the parameter you can increase
or decrease it according to your
requirement 25 or whatever you want to
give 35 okay and now if you have seen
this this looks like this keep in mind
and when I run the program and username
and password once again and when I click
this button if you don't close this PDF
file see what error it gives so it will
give me the process cannot access the
file so you this is because you haven't
closed this file while running your
program so you need to close this file
first and then run your program
otherwise it will give the error I
wanted to show you this that's why I
have not closed the PDF file now once
again I
click this button with no error and then
I will see the text file once again and
you see it has the list has some
indentation this normal paragraph start
from here but the list starts from here
ok so that's what is indentation so you
can give the indentation like this now I
will show you some other feature of the
list so suppose you want to give or make
our Roman numbered list ok so that that
has a Roman number before them so how
can you make a list which have Roman
number numbering so I will delete this
all code and I will paste the new code
here so write Roman list is equal to or
give up give it a variable name is equal
to new Roman list and in the bracket
right true and comma 20 okay so up to 20
it can take then write Roman list dot
indentation which I have shown you a
while ago and then add just copy this
variable and add a list like you have
created before and just add this list in
the document
ok so doc dot add and this removalist
and now when you run the program
and when you click this create PDF and
when you see the PDF once again you will
see the no Roman number are before the
list so this is how you can create a
Roman numbered list okay now I will show
you how to create a list inside a list
so you have a list and you want to show
a list inside that list how can you do
that I will show you now so we have this
Roman list which we have created just
before so we are going to use this Roman
list I will just delete this addition
dot to the document here the last code
and I will use this code to the further
code so we want list inside the list so
first list is this and we will make a
second list which we have I which I have
shown you in at first time so this is
our list with Roman initialization and
this is the list with normal list which
this time I have added ordered list in
here okay and you just need to add this
code also list dots at least symbol and
in the bracket right /you 2022 okay and
this is the indentation which I am
giving so the Roman list has indentation
30 and the normal list I will give the
indentation of 40 for example okay and
this here also 40
so create these two lists and for
example I want to show this Roman list
inside this normal list so what I will
do is I will go here and I will write
list dot add and in the bracket I will
just copy this Roman list variable and I
will paste it inside this list okay so
it will show a list one two three and
then our Roman list and then other four
and five so let's see how it looks like
so I will run the program username and
password and now I click this create PDF
and when I see the program now it hasn't
created anything probably I haven't
build my program so I will build it
okay so I have built my program and it's
build but yeah i forgot this i forgot to
add this list to the document so i will
write a doc dot add in the bracket and
bracket closed and i passed this list
variable so i will past this list per
variable that's why the list is not
showing so just write this and the whole
code is like this and when i run the
program once again to
I'm create PDF and I will check the PDF
once again and now you can see a list
inside our list so this is first list
and this is the Roman list inside the
first list so in this way you can give a
list inside a list okay
so in this way you can add a list to the
PDF file so I hope you have learned to
make some different kind of lists for
your PDF today
and I hope you have learned something
new also distant please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
