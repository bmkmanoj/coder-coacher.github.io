how to check whether internet connection
is available on your system or not with
the help of your C shop windows form
application so let's get started I will
take a button and I will just make it
bigger and I will change its text as is
internet available and let's change the
font size also so that you will be able
to see it font size bold 16 okay so now
you will be able to see it and let me
make this little bit smaller
okay so just click this button double
click it and go at the top and we are
going to import some using namespaces so
right using system dot runtime and
import using system dot runtime dot in
op services so these two namespaces you
need to import this we have imported
because we are going to use our DLL file
so that's why I have declared it and now
just go to your public method public
partial your form and just go inside
that and here write this square bracket
to import a DLL file and write DLL
import and give a bracket inside this
bracket double quote and inside the
double quotes
right this when I net dot DLL so we are
going to import when I in net dot DLL
and then just below that just right
private explicit not explicit but extern
static bool and then we are going to
give a method name so just give a method
name internet get connection state so I
have given the method name Internet get
connection state and bracket and bracket
flows and here we are going to pass two
arguments so write out int description
and the second argument will be int
wizard value okay so we have created
this bull method and this is taking two
argument one is description and one is
resolved value okay and now go to your
button click event and in here we are
going to declare int and write of int
variable name I have given this int de
SC for description and just below that
right
messagebox dot show bracket and break it
closed and inside this bracket we are
going to pass this method just copy this
method and paste it here and in the
bracket we are going to pass first of
all the description so write out and
copy this inter variable name and pass
it here out de SC comma and second
argument would be zero so resolved value
will would be zero and because it's a
bool so we need to convert it into
strings or just after this method
completion just write dot to string and
give the brackets so just write this
here and you have imported this dll file
and you have declared this method and
let's try and run the program
and right now my internet is available
so when I click this I should get true
so let's press this ok so because the
internet is available that's why it's
giving me the message true let's try to
disconnect the internet connection so I
go to here and right now this is
connected I disconnect my internet
connection and now my internet
connection is disconnected and now let's
check whether it's showing the right
condition or not so I will press this
and now it's showing false so it means
internet connection is not available
once again I will connect to internet so
I will go here and connect and now it
connected to the internet so let's try
and check is internet available just
press it and now it's string saying true
so it's checking the internet connection
and just giving you the true or false
value so I hope you have enjoyed this
