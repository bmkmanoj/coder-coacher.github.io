show you how you can install and
configure get on your Windows operating
system and I'm also going to show you
how you can create repositories on
github and transfer your files on your
repository using git on github so let's
get started first of all we will see how
we can install likeget on our Windows
operating system so open your favorite
browser and search for a get here ok and
the first website which will appear here
will be from gate - SCM comm just this
is the operation website from which we
can download gate so just click this
website and once you are inside this
website you will be able to see the
download button or link here which is
this one right so just click this link
or otherwise you can just click here
also which is download for Windows right
so I'm going to click this link here and
in here you will be able to you know
download the kit on your Windows
operating system by the way here you
will be able to find the gate lined
which is a GUI client which we don't
want to download the cause most of the
times if you are a developer you may
want to work with command line instead
of GUI programs and if you are looking
for a job then most of the companies
will ask for the commands instead of
this GUI application so this GUI tool
will not help you to understand the
commands involved in git so that's why
you need to you know download the
command line version which is this one
don't download or I will not recommend
this option which is GUI client right so
you can see this gate is already
downloaded on my system using this
download and if you want some other
downloads you can see there are other
you know options here also so let's run
this executable file I am going to run
and I'm going to minimize my browser and
it's going to start installing get on
our Windows operating system so now the
setup has been started first of all the
license information just click Next here
this will be the location where gate
will be installed on your system there
is no reason to change it in my case so
I will click Next and in here you will
be able to see some of the components
which you are going to install so you
verify these components and in addition
I want to create a shortcut on my
desktop so I will just click this option
on the desktop ok so it's going to
install like get bash here and get GUI
here but we are going to work with git
bash most of the times right click Next
and leave it as default and click Next
once again and in here you will be able
to see three options one is use get from
get bash only the second option is the
use get from Windows command line and
the third option is used git and
optional UNIX tool from the Windows
command prompt so I generally like to
use this third option which will allow
me to use Unix commands also and Windows
command prompt also so choose this
option and click Next and leave
everything as default for now and click
Next and here also leave everything as
default and click Next and click install
and the kit will start installing on
your Windows operating system and maybe
it will take few seconds and once this
progress bar reaches hundred percent
then we will be able to use our git bash
command prompt right so just wait for
this to complete now meanwhile while
this gate is installing on our Windows
operating system let's go to our browser
and lets you know login to our github
account so just open your favorite
browser once again and then search for
get ha
there so I'm going to open my browser
and this time I'm going to search for
github and press Enter
and most probably it'll open the github
website or it will show the github
website link which will be the first
link for you so you can see this is the
first link which is github comm so just
click this link here and once you are
inside this github website you will be
able to create your gift hub account so
it's really easy to create a github
account you just need to give your
username email and password and then
click sign up for github and it will
create your github account and then you
will have to verify your email id
so just verify your email id and once
you have created your github account you
can go here sign in and then you will be
able to give your username and password
and then sign in to your github account
so I will give my username and password
and then click sign in
okay so once you are signed in or logged
in to your account on the right hand
side you will be able to see this option
which says new repositories so in our
case we want to just click this option
which says new repository ok so I'm
going to just click this option which
says new repository and now you will be
able to see this kind of webpage so it
will show you the owner which is your
username and then you will be having the
option to create or give the name of
your repository here so what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to give the name
of my repository for example test gate
for example and then I can give the
optional description here for example
this is for testing gate okay so for
testing gate okay and by default your
repository will be public if you want to
make it the private you will
have to give some cheese which we don't
want to give so I will use the public
option and just check this checkbox also
which will initialize this repository
with the readme file ok
and you can optionally also give the
type of you know the language you want
to use for example C C++ Java or any
other language you can choose from here
I'm going to choose none for now but you
can choose your language here and also
you can choose the license from here
which you want to you know have for your
repository right I'm going to choose
none but you are free to choose MIT GNU
or Apache license or any other license
which will be added to your repository
so I will choose none for now and then I
will say create repository and it's
going to create me this repository
called test kit ok and you can see a
readme file is there which we have
checked for this option right and inside
the readme file you will be having this
kind of text which you have given in the
description right now let's see if gate
is installed on our Windows operating
system so I will just check if it's
already installed or not you can see
it's complete so I'm going to minimize
my browser and I will just check this
option which says launch get bash and I
will also uncheck this option which says
view release note right so I'm going to
launch get bash now and click finish and
it's going to launch get bash on my
desktop so this is a kind of interface
you will be able to see for your git
bash ok so you can maximize it and in
here right now you are in this mingw 64
directory you can just type CD for
change directory and then press enter
and now you will be on in your home
directory right now for example this
gate bash you can
I use it like units UNIX command-line so
you can create directories or you can
you know create files or anything here
ok so what I'm going to do here is for
example this is my folder structure and
for example I want to create a new
folder here so what I will do is I will
just create a new folder and I'm going
to name it as you get ok so this gate I
will be able to access from this command
line so for example I will say here CD
into my C directory so I will just say
CD /c
and then press enter and you can see
here I'm in my C directory which is this
directory here we can see in the folder
now we can list all the files and folder
in this directory by using the command
LS so just give LS and press ENTER and
it will print all the files and
directories here and then we will be
able to see our gate folder here also so
just search for gate which is this here
right so we want to go inside this gate
folder so we can just say CD gate and
then press ENTER and we are now inside
this gate folder and then we can just
say LS which is to list all the files
files inside this gate folder right now
there is no files here right so now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to clone my
repository in this gate folder in the
sea of folder right so what I can do
here is I will go to my browser once
again and you will be able to see this
kind of link here this is the link for
your repository right so how you can
copy this you can just click this button
which says copy to clipboard so just
copy this or click this button and it
says copied so this link will be copied
when you click this button right so just
click this button and minimize your
browser and then first of all before
doing this step we need to configure our
gate
found for our github you know repository
so we need to follow some of the steps
so first step here you need to do is you
need to give this command here so it's
just give get and then config just give
config and then give - - global ok so -
- global and then use a dot name and
then your username for your github
account so my username is P P knowledge
and then I will press ENTER ok so I will
paste this command in the description so
you will be able to copy and paste these
commands right and press Enter this will
set up your username for your get
account C in the same way you want to
give our email ID also right so in this
step we will just give get conflict - -
global then user dot email right so just
write email here right and this time you
don't need to use your you know these
double quotes you can just give your
email id directly right so just give
your email id whatever you have provided
for your github account and press Enter
so my username and password is set for
the get account right now I can clone my
repository so I have copied this part
from here remember so what I can do in
the next step is I can just give the
command which is git clone command so
just write get clone and then paste the
part you have copied so just right click
and paste ok so it will paste this part
which we have copied right and then
press enter and when you press enter you
will be able to see this test gate
folder is created on inside your git
folder right and this is the same
repository
which you have here okay so what this
command has done is it has you know
taken all the files from your repository
and then it has you know downloaded here
and now your repository you can use it
locally also right so what next step we
are going to do is we will just give LS
command and you can see here you have a
test gate directory so I will just go
inside this test gate directory so CD
just give test gate and press enter and
then Alice so we have readme file here
right so now what we can do is we can
create some files here inside your test
to it and then we can commit and you
know upload it on the github account so
for example I will right-click and I can
create a new document from here for
example test document right and then I
can say this is my test dot txt file
right and then I can open this text or
TST file and I can give some random text
here so for example this is my first
text file right on something like this
and then you can save your file and then
close it okay so this file is there and
you can verify it from LS command here
you can see this file is there right so
by the way it has the already has the
extension txt so I should not give this
extra extension so I will right-click
and rename it to just text files so it
will be like test dot txt so just write
LS and you can see test dot txt file is
there right now in order to upload this
file to your github what you need to do
is firstly you need to add this file to
your git so to add this file you just
need to get
give this command which says get add and
then the file name for example test dot
txt ok and press ENTER and this will add
this text file in your gate ok
now to check the status of your files
you can just give get status command so
just give get status and press enter and
you can see you have these files which
is one is readme file and other is new
file which is test dot txt file which we
have added so you can see it says new
file test dot txt now first of all
before transferring this these files are
to your github account what you need to
do is you need to commit these files
first and then you can upload them so in
order to commit this you just need to
give this command which says git commit
just give this get commit command and
then give minus M which is like a
comment you want to give here so minus M
and then in the code so you can give any
comments to your comments so for example
first commit something like this and
then the file name you want to commit so
I want to comment test dot txt file so
just give this option so get commit
minus M the comment and the file name
you want to commit and then press Enter
which will commit your file into get now
once you have done this now you will be
able to you know transfer this file on
your kid hub account so for you doing
this for transferring your file to your
github account there is a command called
git push so just write get and then
dried push and then write this minus u
which will be your username flag and
then just give origin/master commands so
just write origin master so just give
this
c'mon which says get push - you original
space master okay
so just give this command and press
ENTER and then this will push your files
to your github account right so you can
see it's just asking for the get
credential manager for Windows and then
for the first time you need to give your
username and password here in the
windows security you can just give your
gate username and password right so I'm
going to give it and press ok
and now you can see it has transferred
our files to our github account right so
we can go to our browser here and I will
go to my github account and this is our
repository and I haven't refreshed this
page so it shows readme file only but
when I will refresh this page this test
dot txt file will also be there which we
have committed in get right this we want
to see here when we refresh it so let's
refresh this and once it's refreshed we
will be able to see this test file also
you can see here test dot text and when
we open this test dot text file we will
be able to see our text we have written
inside this text file which is this is
my first text file right so this is how
you can create a github repository and
this is how you can download and install
git on your Windows operating system now
if you want to make some changes to your
files for example I will open this file
again and I will just paste it a few
number of times or in something like
this right and I will save this file
something like this and just close it
and then once again I can give the
commit command and then I can give this
push command to push my changes so I
will just press the UP button
to you know show all the previous
commands and you can see all the
previous commands are here right so I
can just give this command which says
get status and then it shows this test
dot txt file is modified right so we
want to commit it so once again press
the up key and this time we want to
commit it with the other message so this
is my second comment so I can just say
second commit as a message so it's just
right second commit and we want to
commit this test dot txt file right so
press Enter which will commit our file
and once again we want to push it so we
will just give this command which says
get push - u origin/master
and press enter and then this will push
all the changes to our github repository
so once you see success message go to
your browser refresh your page once
again and this time you will be able to
see the step test dot text change to our
change so you can see this change it all
is applied to our repository also okay
