HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
in this video we will learn how to use
CSS or cascading style sheets in HTML
now CSS is whole different topic and it
requires you know many videos to learn
CSS but I'm going to give you a brief
introduction how you can use CSS in HTML
so there are three ways in which you can
use CSS in HTML one is internal second
is inline and third is external so first
of all let's see how we can use inline
CSS with our HTML element so for example
I have this h1 tag and I have some text
inside this h1 tag and I want to change
the appearance of this text so right now
it looks like this right so for example
I want to change the color of this text
so what I can do is I can add a style
attribute here and as a style I can add
a color and color can be for example red
okay I will save it and I will refresh
my webpage and now it looks like red
right you can change it to some other
color and save your code and refresh
your page add changes to that color so
this is how you can add inline styling
to your element now let's see how to add
internal styling to our HTML tags so go
inside your head element and inside the
header element you just need to add
style element here and in here in the
inside style element right now we don't
need this text attribute so just inside
your style element what you can do is
you can choose the name of your elements
for example I want to change the font
size of this h1 element right so I will
just write h1 and then inside the
brackets these curly brackets I can
provide the attribute for example I want
to change the font size
I can choose font size and then I can
choose my size for example 100 px which
stands for 100 pixels
okay I save it and I will refresh my
page and now the font size is changed
200px right now for example I want to
transfer this property to this internal
style so how what I can do is I can just
choose this color colon and then just
below this I can add this property and
at the last I and need to add this
semicolon here and now I can remove this
style from here and save it and it will
be same style right so we can use these
Styles like this now for example I want
to change the background of my body so I
can take the body element from here
something like body and inside these
curly braces I can change the background
color for example background color and I
can choose any color here for example
yellow okay and save it and refresh your
page and the background becomes yellow
here okay now let's see how we can add
our external CSS file in our HTML so
first of all we need to create a CSS
file so I will go to my web content
folder and I will create a new and I
will choose a new file here and this
time I want to create a style dot CSS
file so just write style
dot CSS and CSS stands for cascading
style sheet as I already told you and
just save this CSS file here and in here
you can just transfer your style which
you have provided here like this just
copy this and I will delete this style
element from here and inside your CSS
file you just need to give these styles
like this so for h1 tag same as you have
given as an internal style you can give
it here
right now to add the CSS file in our
HTML file what we need to do is we need
to add a link tag here so add a link tag
and as an attribute here we add a
attribute called arielle and whose value
should be equal to style sheet right and
the second attribute we want to give
here is H ref as we give in our link and
then is equal to give the path of your
CSS file so it's in the same directory
as in my HTML file so I can directly
write style dot CSS okay now this will
add the CSS file in your HTML file and
then once you refresh your page it will
look like the same okay and when you
remove some property for example this
background color and save it and refresh
your page will remove your property
right so these are the three ways you
can add a CSS file in your HTML file now
there are two more important things in
CSS you need to know one is called a ID
attribute and another is called a class
attribute okay so I'm going to remove
all the styling code from my styling
sheet and once again I will go to my
HTML file and for example first of all
we will learn
to use ID attribute with CSS okay so for
example I add our attribute called
ID here and I can define my own ID for
example my ID and then I can go to my
style dot CSS file here and then here
first of all I will give the name of the
element in which I want to add this
style so h1 is the name of the element
so just write h1 and then write a hash
and then write the name of the ID so ID
name is my ID right so write the name of
the ID and then add these curly braces
here and then you can provide your
property which you want to change for
example color and I want to change it to
red color right like this and save your
code and refresh your page it becomes
red okay so this is how you can use ID
attribute with CSS now there is one more
attribute called class so for example I
delete this attribute ID from my h1 tag
and I add a attribute called class here
and I can define my own class so for
example my class and once again I will
go to my style the CSS file and instead
of using this what I can do is I can
write something like this so first of
all I can take the name of my element
which I want to use so for example h1
because this class is in the h1 tag
right and then dot my class name which
is my class right and then these curly
braces and inside the curly braces once
again the for example color attribute I
want to change and this time I want to
change it to blue right so I will save
my code and refresh my webpage and it
becomes blue so in this way you can use
class attribute
in CSS and HTML okay so that's it for
CSS I hope you understood the basic
concept how to use CSS in HTML so that's
it for this video please rate comment
