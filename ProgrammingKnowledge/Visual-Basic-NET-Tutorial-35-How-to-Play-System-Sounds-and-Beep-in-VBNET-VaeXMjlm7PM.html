how to play a different system sound and
beep sound with your visual basic
windows form application so I have this
sample project created and I have 6
different buttons in here
so these button click events are empty
so I am going to write some code here so
just drag and drop 6 button into your
form and change its text now double
click this first button and here I will
write the code for the first sound so I
will write my dot computer dot audio dot
play sound and in here I'm going to add
this first system sound which is media
dot system sounds dot a string okay and
I will close this and in the same way
I'm going to add five more system sounds
so this is second sound but this one is
going to be beep third sound and this
one is going to be a exclamation sound
and the fourth button and this one is
going to be a hand sound and the fifth
button and this one is going to be a
question sound okay and the sixth button
I will show you differently because the
code for the sixth sound is different a
little different so let's play the code
or and see what sound they can make
okay so I will just lay my program or
run my program and it runs the program
and let's hear for the sound what song
they make so here for this possum I will
increase the sound so that you can hear
this is the first song so this is the
first song you can hear and this is
second song and the third song and the
fourth song and the fifth sound it sound
I don't know why my computer doesn't
create the sound but it should work in
other computers and let's make the code
for the six sound now so I will double
click my sixth button and in here I will
write the console dot beep so it creates
a beep sound so now when I run the
program and I will crow click the sixth
button
and it creates a beep sound you can also
give the frequency and the interval to
this beep sound like this so you just
need to pass the parameter first
parameter this beep function takes is
the frequencies for example I want the
frequency to be thousand and the second
parameter it takes is the interval in
milliseconds so for example I want to
give two second intervals so I will give
two thousand here and now when I run the
program it will give me 100 Hertz a
thousand Hertz frequency this is the
frequency in Hertz and this is the time
in milliseconds ok so now when I click
this sound 6 button here for it so the
sound played for 2 seconds with the
frequency of thousands second you can
change this frequency and time and you
can have your own sound so in this way
you can play different sound with the
help of your visual basic windows form
application please keep watching this
video and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
