teach you about polymorphism in c-sharp
polymorphism is also one of the very
important concept in object-oriented
programming which C sharp is
polymorphism allows us to invoke derive
class methods through a base class
reference during runtime so let's see an
example for example I have a base class
which is called a drawing class so I
have this base class called drawing and
it has one method called draw and what
this method does is it simply prints a
message and this is a message this
message says this is just a generic
drawing object now from our previous
videos we already know how we can define
the derived classic classes using this
base class which is drawing class so for
example I want to derive a class or I
want to define a derived class called
line which inherits from this base class
drawing okay so I will declare this the
right class called line Club with public
class line which inherits from your base
class joint okay and it also has a
public method called draw and it has its
own message and message says this is a
line okay now I want I will this derive
two more classes form this base class so
I will copy and paste this this derived
class once again and the second derived
class I will say it's a circle and the
message I will change it as this is a
circle okay in this draw method and the
third derived class will be square and
in the square draw method I will print
this
our square so we have one base class and
we have three derived class lines square
the circle and they have their own draw
method right now I will for example I
want to declare an instance of my base
class and this instance will be an array
of the base class okay so how can I
declare an array of base class instances
so I will just copy my base class and I
will give these square brackets and I
will give the name to my object I will
say D D Oh BJ which is drawing object is
equal to new drawing object okay
so just copy it and paste it here and
for example this array contains four
elements so I can pass for here like
this okay now for example I want to give
this object and instance of a line plus
an instance of CERCLA class and an
instance of square class so what I can
do is I can say obj zeroth element or
obj then the X 0 is equal to new line
class ok and this will be like this in
the same way I can declare an instance
of square circle and square classes and
even I will declare the instance of
bilities class that will say is 0 1 2 3
and this is our
Circle and this is square okay so our
base class object has an instance of
line which is a derived class and this
is absolutely possible right we can have
an instance of derived class as an
object type of as an object of our base
class right as we have seen in the last
video so I have first object as an
instance of line second object as an
instance of circle third object as an
instance of square so these all three
are derived classes and I even have the
instance of a drawing class which is our
base class and now for example I want to
call draw methods from each of these
classes base and the right classes so I
can use for each loop you may know from
the last video how to use for each loop
and I will say for each and the
condition is drawing D for example or
draw in my object which is this one so
that it will take one by one it will go
through object by object depending upon
the index of the object and here I will
give the statement and what I mean to
here I will just take this draw object
here and I will just call draw method so
of draw dot draw so let's see what is
the result of this code I will run my
program
and what this is doing is it's sprinting
this is a generic drawing object this is
a generic drawing object for trying
times right and it's true because so we
are not even know hiding our method
which is a base class method which we
have seen in the last video so we have
just created an instance of drawing and
we are just giving them the instances of
God derived classes so by default it
will go to the base class it will print
this four times right now for example
you want that from your base class
object you want to call these methods
you want to call the draw method inline
class draw method encircle class and
draw method in square class you can do
it by using polymorphism right so what
you need to do here is you need to
declare this object you need to change
the declare raishin of this method draw
in the base class like this so just
write public virtual so this virtual
keyword will say that you can redefine
this draw in the base classes right so
this is the mood this is this the use of
this virtual method bunch module
keyboard now in my derived classes I
will say I will override this base class
method so how can I override I will go
to my derived class which is line and in
this draw method in line derived class I
will declare it like public
override and this should be over right
okay so this keyboard will tell this the
right class that you are overriding this
base class method by its own method and
I will do the same in my circle the
right class here public override void
and in my square the right class method
draw okay now what I have done I have
given the keyword a draw key but virtual
to my base class method and I have given
the keyword override to my derived class
method this virtual virtual keyword
tells the base class that somewhere when
ever you declare a derived class you can
override this method by using override
method keyboard right now this main code
will remain same and let's see what is
the result now I'll run the program and
see the result now you have this is a
line which is a draw method in line
class this is a circle which is a draw
method insert a class the square which
is a draw method in square class and you
have this is just a general draw object
which is a method based class method
right so in this way this is the basic
concept of polymorphism and what I have
said in the beginning polymorphism
allows us to invoke derived class method
through a base class reference during
runtime right so we have we have invoked
the derived class method like this from
a base class
so we have invoked from from a base
class given both invoke the method draw
from our derived classes like this okay
so this is how polymorphism books and
where it comes handy it comes handy when
you need to assign a group of object to
an array and then invoke each of their
methods so this is useful in those
situation okay so I hope you have
understood the basic concept of
polymorphism and I hope you have enjoyed
