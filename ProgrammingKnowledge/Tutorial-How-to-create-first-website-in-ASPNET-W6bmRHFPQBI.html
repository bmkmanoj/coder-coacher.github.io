tutorial and in this video I am going to
show you how you can install Visual
Studio Express Edition to develop
asp.net applications and how to create
your first website using asp.net so what
is asp.net asp.net is a framework from
Microsoft which by which you can develop
web applications website and other
mobile applications using this asp.net
framework and for much if you want to
see you can go to www.beadaholique.com
to
you can develop asp.net applications or
web applications using visual studio and
visual studio you can install either
from a visual studio website which I
will show you or you can go here to the
download section of download tab here
and you can click this install for free
install asp.net and web tools 2013 which
is the latest version for now and
otherwise what you can do is if you want
to develop other applications like
c-sharp or Visual Basic what you can do
is you can download Visual Studio
Express so just go to your browser and
just say Visual Studio Express and just
search for it and the first link you
will find here is Visual Studio dot
and in here you will be able to see what
are the latest version of Visual Studio
available
and what we are interested in is the
download tab here just go to the
download tab and for developing asp.net
application we are specifically looking
for Visual Studio Express for web so
this is the software of it this is the
framework we are looking for so just
click this Visual Studio Express for now
the version is 2013 for web and select
your language and you can install Visual
Studio Express by just clicking this
button we take about 20 minutes to
install or you can it can take more so
be patient and you don't need to do much
you just need to click some Next button
and it will be installed in your system
now once this Visual Studio is installed
in your system it'll look like this when
you open this you can open visual studio
from here by going to the start and go
to Microsoft Visual Studio in my case I
have Digital Studio Express 2010 and you
can go to Microsoft visual web developer
ok just click it and it will open
environment like this now how we can
create a website using asp.net and
Visual Studio so in this Visual Studio
IDE just you just need to go to this
file tab here and just click new project
so by clicking this new project you can
develop other applications or web
applications using asp.net but we are
interested in it right now is to create
a website so we will say new website so
just keep this option and go to new
website here
and in here there are few options
available you can develop your asp.net
web website in Visual Basic or you can
develop your application in c-sharp for
now I am taking c-sharp as the language
and I'm going to select the first option
which is asp.net website and in here you
can browse for the location in which you
want to save your website files so I
will leave it as default but if you want
you can change this locations okay and
here in the web location you will see
three type of cup locations on HTTP FTP
or file system so for now I'm leaving
this as default so my website pages will
remain on my desktop or my PC but if you
are want to transfer your pages to a
hosting domain then you can use FTP or
this HTTP and then click OK and this
will create your website project in
asp.net now in here you can see some
folders in solution Explorer and this
these folder contains some file so I
will show you here
first of all in account the first folder
it has created some files related to the
database and login pages so this is
default website design when you create a
first website using asp.net let me show
you run this application and then
I will show you what page is for what so
I will say run there without debugging
and now you can see here we have a home
page it's all them developed or all
created by asp.net for the first time
and it has the about page okay and it
also has this login button here when you
click this it will present you the login
page so this is all created by asp.net
for the first time and you don't even
need to write a single word or single
HTML or JavaScript or any other code
while creating this website so let's see
in our project where is what so in your
account folder it will contain the
information related to your login pages
this as login dot aspx and when we see
here in your login you can either
register or login so by clicking this
login button this is the login page
which this login dot aspx contains right
and when you click the suggester button
here this is the page which your
register dot aspx will contain ok and
change password success dot aspx and
change password you will be able to see
here once again so this of these options
will come when you have the database and
you have some users and you want to
change the pages or will change the
passwords right now the home page when
you click this home page you will be
able to see the code of home page in
default dot aspx and the about page
which is this page you will
be able to see the code in this above
dot aspx now for example I'm going to
open this default page which is my home
page in the website this page default
dot aspx contains three views right now
we are in this source view you can go to
design view to see the design of your
website or you can go to this split view
which will give you both so you will be
able to see the code and the design at
the same time in the split window okay
and it's for all all the pages so for
about you will be able to see about page
here and you will be able to see the
design of about or you can see the login
page and you will be able to see des
design of login page or the password
change password pages okay
so this is all done by ASP application
and no need you don't need to invite
anything now in this style folder here
this will contain your CSS files so what
CSS file does is it provides the style
to your website so this all styling of
your website this file will be
responsible for the styling of your
website site those CSS for now and this
will also contain jQuery files and this
will make your website in more
interactive for example when you have
some buttons and login let me show you
this it will explain much better
so this functionality when you click
this login button and when you enter
some username and password and when you
click this login button this will make
your page dynamic rights based upon user
name and password if it's correct
to redirect you to some other page or
some other application in your website
or if the username and password is wrong
it will prompt you that some error s
occurred so this is called dynamic
response of the website otherwise
another kind of website are those which
have static pages and you don't need or
you cannot interact with the pages like
this page which have button or it will
just serve you static pages which you
only read and you cannot perform any
action so these are those files these
are the files responsible for the
dynamic actions on your website so this
is the basic structure of your project
and for the first time it will give you
this much amount of code by default now
for example we go to default SPX yeah
and in here you can add more
functionality so at least you should
have the basic idea how the weekend
program website using HTML and CSS basic
idea of HTML CSS you must have in order
to understand or encode asp.net website
so for example I want to add one more
tag to my website for example I will add
here one more tag which will be let's
say h1 tag and anyhow I will I will
write hello world asp.net ok this should
be dot meant
so this will create our h1 tag or h1
paragraph here and when you click here
on this design view you will be able to
see your line h1 tag here right hello
world asp.net so in this way you can add
more lines or more content to your web
pages and this is the static content and
I was showing you now in order to add
some dynamic functionality to your page
what you can do is you see here a tool
box in which some tools are there for
example button text box list box and
other tools so for example I will take a
button from here and let me see I will
take our label here ok and the button
text you can see here you can change
this button click me and you can change
the text of this label also like this so
I will say show message okay and on the
code side when I drag and drop these
button this button and this label here
it have it will automatically generate
some code for you in your source view so
when I click this label you it will be
highlighted here you see here this label
code is auto-generated for you or when I
click this button this button code is
auto-generated for you ok and in here
you can change the ID of this button so
if you know from your HTML knowledge
that every tag has its ID and text so
you can change the ID of this button
from here also and from here also so
there are two ways to change the ID of
your controls now for example I want to
insert some functionality when I click
this button I want to show some message
on this on this label so I will just
select my button and double click it and
this is the view or this is called the
code behind your page so this will open
this default dot aspx dot CS file which
is a c-sharp file and we directly go to
the button click event here and in here
I can write when I click this button so
my label 1 which is my the name of my
label dot text is equal to whatever text
you want to give you can give from here
so say I will say hi You Tube and some
signs here and I will close this by the
semicolon ok so now when I run my
website I will save all the changes by
clicking the Save button and once again
I will like this green button here start
debugging and once again I will say run
without debugging ok and now you can see
this button here and you see this label
here and when I click this button you
see the message will change here so when
I click this button and now you can see
the message is hi YouTube so in this way
you can make your webpage dinah
like and this is what exactly is going
here so when you click this login button
because I haven't not entered user name
and password it gives me some error so
this makes your website dynamic so I
think you got the basic idea how you can
create web pages and what is what in
this project when you create a website
first website project in asp.net so I
