tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what does the static keyword do in a
class so in the last videos which I have
been showing you you may have seen the
usage of this keyword static with some
member method or member variables of a
class and you may be curious what is the
meaning of this this is not you know
just we are putting like this it has
some meaning so the meaning behind the
static keyword is whenever you declare
your member as static the static member
belongs to the class instance instead of
some specific instance of a class so let
me give you an example and then we will
see it once again so I have a class
called hello and which contains two
method one is a static method and other
is a non static method
static method means I have added static
keyword to this and this method is not
doing much it's just taking string as an
argument and it's returning this string
in as whatever we pass back and the same
method we are using here it has a
different name which is do something
else and this does not have any static
keyword in it okay so whenever we
declare the instance of a class for
example hello hello is equal to new
hello the static member is shared by so
whenever you create an instance you can
create many instance so for example
hello hello one hello to the static
member method will be shared by
every instance okay and the static
member only belongs to the class not to
the instance so it will not belong to
the instance of a class but it will only
belong to the class itself so if you
want to do something like this say dot
do something which is a static method
and we want to pass some message hi
YouTube for example it it will work and
it will work fine but it will give some
warning here and the warning is the
static method do something from the type
hello should not be exist exist in
static way okay so you cannot access or
you can access this but it's a wrong way
of accessing this method which is
declared as static method so for
accessing your static method whatever
you define as static you can access this
method directly from a class like hello
dot do something and this is the right
way and once you do this your warning
message will be gone okay but a
non-static method when you try to access
so this
hello is my class name dot do something
is not something else is not available
in this class right so this method is
not available on cannot be accessed
directly with the class name but
whenever you add a static before your
method name or variable name its
accessed from the class itself so do
something is exist from the class and do
something else which is not a static
method cannot be accessed
by directly by this class you can you
see there is no do something else but
this non-static method is available
through the instance of a class okay so
basically the non-static methods are
available or can be accessed using the
instance of a class and the static
method should be accessed using the
class itself not the instance okay so
this is the correct way of using a
static class or static method and this
is the correct way of using non-static
method you can even declare some
variable as static for example public
static int age for example and then
whenever you want to access by this
instance you can just for example hello
dot dot age whenever you want to assign
some value to the age let's see what
happens so it's okay right now but it's
once again showing that warning that the
static field hello it should be accessed
statically right
once again we define a different
instance of this class hello hello one
and we assign some different value here
for example 20 or 50 right and we will
print hello age once again so says oh
and we will print this hello age here
and we will print this hello age here
also the
this instance okay and for now let us
commend this these two and when we run
the program it gives you the same I mean
the answer but it is preferred that
because it's a instance or not the
instance but is the X member of the
class you need to use it like this not
by instance but using the class itself
okay so whenever you want to declare a
variable or method static just access
them using a class and whenever you are
using non-static method or variable
access them with the instance of a class
so I hope you enjoyed this video please
