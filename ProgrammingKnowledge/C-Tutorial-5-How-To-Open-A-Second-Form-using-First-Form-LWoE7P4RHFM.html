video I mean show you how to create a
new form for your c-sharp application
and how to open it with your first form
for example if you are following this
video I have been making this
application called loggin and till now I
have been working with one form now I
want whenever the username whenever the
user logs in and if username and
password is correct a new form should
open for that particular user so for
example when I run the program and I
enter the right username and password
and then click login and if it's
username and password is correct and
when I click OK it should open a new
form for me instead of this login form
so how can I achieve that I will show
you in that in this video so just go to
your solution Explorer and select your
project my project name is 4c shop app
right click it go to add new items and
now in here select a new item this one
you need to select Windows form and just
give the name or your form in my case I
will leave it as default form to not
seus
and click OK and it will create a new
form for you so I will open this form
with the help of this login button so if
you are following this video I have
shown you in the second video how to
make this login application and how to
write this code for login so just select
this login button and double click it
and this code I have shown you in the
video number two so if you don't know
this code just go to video number two
and after your while loop in here in
this condition if count is equal to one
and in the if condition brackets I am
showing this message box not show you
user name and password is correct
so if the username and password is
correct I want to hide this form which
is form number one so I will write this
dot hide
and bracket and bracket closed and then
I will write the name of my second form
which is form 2 so I will write form and
I will give a variable name so for
example f2 variable is equal to me new
form to bracket and write closed and
then copy this variable which is f2 f2
sorry
here F to not show dialogue ok bracket
and racket closed so what these three
lines of code will do is first line of
code will hide your first form so
whatever form you are working on will
hide your first form and then we are
declaring a variable for form to so form
2 is equal to f2 is equal to MU form 2
and this will show your new form which
is formed to so a 2 dot show dialogue so
write these three lines in order to open
a new form if and only if when you are
username and password is correct so when
I run my program and I will write
username and password login username and
password is correct
click okay and you see it opens a new
form tool for us so in this way you can
open a new form with your c-sharp
application I hope you enjoyed this
