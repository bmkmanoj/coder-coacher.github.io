I have added a playlist page to my
website and I do move wanted to show
this on my navigation menu so I hide
this page on my navigation menu and on
my videos and total page I have added a
button for opening my NetBeans Java
playlist page which I have shown you
here and in this video I will edit this
page and I will add the playlist into
this page so I will click added page and
this will open the new page which is
playlist page and here I want to add the
playlist so what I will do here I will
add a custom playlist oh sorry
custom HTML code here because there is
no option in Weebly as far as I know
which will provide functionality that it
should provide a written link and when
you click it it should open other page
of course this button is there but I
don't want to place 120 button because I
have 120 videos on that means I don't
want to place this 120 buttons here and
it will look a little bit awkward so I
want to add a custom HTML so I
drag this dusty customized table tool
here and I will add some HTML code so
here I will in I I will insert my HTML
code and what I have done is in my
notepad plus plus I've small HTML code
notepad plus plus days of open source
editor to write HTML or JavaScript
programming language and this is only
one line code which will give a
reference of a website and it will show
the link by the name NetBeans Java
playlist for example and this will will
open this link which is my website name
so I want to check if it works or not so
I will run it launch in Firefox and it
will look like this so this is NetBeans
Java playlist and when I click this it
opens my website so like this from this
reference I want to open a link so I
will copy and paste it 120 times like
this for example I have pasted it only
four times here and what I will do is I
will go to my youtube channel I will
copy the name of my first video
and I will go to notepad I will replace
that name here and then I will go to my
YouTube channel once again and I will
copy the ulr of that video and I will go
to a notepad once again and I will paste
it yeah okay so this name when you click
it will open the same link of the
YouTube video so I will say well save it
and I will run it once again let's see
how it look like and you can see the
name of my video and when I click this
the youtube link of that video opens in
YouTube so I want to do like that so I
will do it 120 times and I will not take
your time for that so I will stop this
video here and I will copy this code in
my Weebly website in the next video so
stay tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
