maven tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn about scope which is
one more interesting and important
concept in dependency management so
let's get started so in the previous
videos we have seen how to add an
dependencies in our pom dot XML file
let's say we have this dependency J unit
which we have added for our tests and we
want that this dependency will only be
you know related to our tests and not to
our source file because J unit we are
not going to use probably in our source
code so we want to limit the scope of
this J unit or to the level of scope so
what we can do is just below the version
you can add one more element here and
then you can say scope ok so just write
scope and inside the scope you can just
write test here and this basically means
is that this J unit is only limited to
our test source file and not to the
compile source files right so in a way
we are limiting the scope of our J unit
dependency up to only our test now there
are different kind of scopes which are
possible in dependency management so
this is one kind of scope which is test
then there is one more kind of scope
which is for example compile and compile
is the default scope so if you don't
define any scope by default it's a
compile so compile is available in your
source code also and in the test files
also or any other files also now there
is one more
scope called
run time and this means is that this J
unit will only available at the run time
so this scope indicates that the
dependency is not required for the
compilation but it is required for the
execution of the jar file for example so
this jar file will be present in the run
time and test class part but not in
compiled class parts okay so this is how
you use run time scope now there is one
more type of scope which is called
provided okay
and this provided scope is much like
compiled but it indicates that you
expect the JDK or a container to provide
the dependency at runtime for example
when building a web application for Java
EE you would set the dependency on the
Soviet API and the related Java EE API
to scope provided because the web
container provides those classes right
so this scope is only available on the
compilation and test class plot but it's
not available in transitive okay so this
is how you can use cope in dependency
management these scopes like runtime and
other scopes are important when you want
to create an API which has an interface
and the implementation
so basically when a developer develops
an application he wants to segregate his
API in to you know different segments
one is the interface and other is the
implementation and this is done because
the implementation if the developer want
to change at any time he can change it
and he don't need to change the
interface and also the vice versa is
also possible easily so I hoped you have
