JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will see how to use loops
in JavaScript and in this particular
video I'm going to show you how to use
while loop and do-while loop in
JavaScript so first of all what is a
loop a loop is a piece of statement
which will allow you to perform some
piece of code again and again until and
unless some condition is fulfilled
right so let's say I have a variable
called a and I will initialize it with
zero okay and I will initialize one more
variable called result and this I will
use it to display some value now let's
see how the while loop looks like so you
use a while keyword and then here comes
your condition right and then in the
curly braces comes your code if your
condition in this bracket is mad okay
so this is for the condition this round
bracket is for the condition and if your
condition is met then the code inside
these curly braces will be executed okay
and if the condition is not met then it
will once again perform the same code
until and unless this condition is met
so let's say we want to you know have
the condition a is less than 10 okay so
right now obviously a is equal to zero
which is less than 10 so it will go
inside the while loop and will perform
the code right so for example I will
just say result is equal to a okay and
for the simplicity I will just add a
break tag here so just add this break
tag so that it will be printed on the
different line
every time this code is executed right
and this result I'm just passing here
which will print this using this demo ID
and I have this paragraph with ID demo
here so in this paragraph this will be
executed right now here if you notice
that this condition will never be
fulfilled if we write this kind of code
right this condition is in finite
condition because we are not increasing
the value of a so the value of a is
constant so our while loop will go on
performing the code again and again in
finitely write and this kind of infinite
loop are also useful in some conditions
but right now in our condition what we
want to do here is let's say we want to
increase the value of a by 1 every time
it goes inside the loop ok now what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to add
this plus symbol or concatenation symbol
here and what it's going to do is it's
going to add the value of this string to
this result every time it executes this
code and one more thing what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to initialize
this result with empty string something
like this ok so the value of result will
not be ambiguous when it's initialized
right so save your code and run it here
and now you can see this is printing
from 0 to 9 okay so what happens here so
in your while loop we know that this
condition is obviously true 0 is less
than 10 so it will go inside the while
loop and perform this code and what this
code is doing
it's just assigning the value of a in
the result right and then it goes here
in the next line and it increases the
value of a by 1 so the value of a
becomes 1 here because it was initially
0
and then we add one here using this code
and the value of a is 1 so it goes once
again in the loop and it's check 1 is
less than 10 yes so it performed this
code once again and add this string to
the result once again and then the value
of a becomes 2 here right so in the in
this way it will keep on looping 2 3 4
until 9 reaches and in this case also
this condition is true and will increase
the value of a by 1 and then value of a
becomes 10 which in here is false so 10
is not less than 10 so this condition is
not true so this code will not be
executed right so that's why it's
printing the value from 0 to 9 ok now
you can have something like this a is
less than or equal to 10 okay so in this
case it will print from 0 to 10 because
we are also evaluating equal to now okay
or you can have different conditions
here for example a is greater than or a
is not equal to 10 so you can evaluate
different kind of conditions in this
while loop here okay so this is how your
while loop works now there is one more
kind of loop which is called do-while
loop okay and the syntax of this
do-while loop is something like this so
you use the keyword do first and then
after the curly braces you say while
okay and then a semicolon okay so in
here it's the same you evaluate some
condition inside these brackets right so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to declare one more variable and I'm
going to name it as B and I'm going to
initialize it with zero and this B I'm
going to evaluate in
this while loop condition so be is for
example less than or equal to 10 the
same situation which we have evaluated
in here okay and we will just copy the
same code from here and paste it in
do-while loop and let's define one more
valuable for example result 1 which is
for do-while loop result 1 ok and let's
define one more paragraph tag and this
is demo 1 and here also I will define
one more document dot get element by ID
for demo 1 and here I will print result
1 ok and this will be B and this will be
B ok so let's see what happens this is
our while loop and this is our do-while
loop ok so let's save the code and
refresh the webpage and you can see here
it prints the value from 0 to 10 using
the while loop and once again when I go
down it prints the value of 0 to 10
using the do-while loop so they are
working in a same manner right so you
will say what's the difference between
them if they are working in the same
manner so the basic difference between
while loop and do-while loop is that
while loop evaluates the condition first
and then execute your code while the
do-while loop performs your code for the
first time and then evaluates your
condition right so do-while loop no
matter what at least one will execute
the code inside these curly braces even
if this condition is false so it's
logical right
it says do first and then evaluate the
condition and in here we are first
evaluating a condition and then
executing the code so let's say we are
evaluating that
is for example - one right and in here
also as B we are evaluating the
condition minus one which is false
because B is equal to zero right and in
the while loop also a is equal to zero
right
so save your code and refresh the
webpage and it prints zero which is due
to this do loop so let's say we say do
and here we say while so we can
recognize from which line this zero is
printed so just save your code and
refresh it once again and you see once
after do is printed then zero is printed
right so it's coming from this line okay
so what's happening here so here this
condition is false so this code will not
be executed but in here in the do-while
loop first the code is executed and then
the condition is evaluated so this code
is executed once and then it goes to
while loop and checks whether this
condition is true or false and it's
false so it's not going to loop it once
again so this is the basic difference
between while loop and do-while loop so
