last couple of videos I have been
showing you how to create a PDF file
with the help of your C shop application
using the I text shop DLL so till now I
have shown you how to add paragraphs how
that lists how to add pictures and in
this video I will show you how to add a
table in your PDF file using C shop and
itix shop Niran so let's see how can we
do that so we have this create PDF
button which we click and this code I
have been showing you in last three
videos okay and now suppose I want to
add a table below this list which was
showing here so I have this list and
below this list I want to show some
table so what I will do is I will just
go to the logo below to the list code
and here I will add the code for the
tables okay so here write this code this
much to add a simple table so right P D
F P table and give it a variable name is
equal to new PDF P table and in this
bracket this three shows it has three
columns okay so whatever cell you add it
will be added in the combination or in
the pair of three columns so first three
columns will be of first row and second
three column will be
of the second row so and if you add
three more column they will add in the
third row okay so like that so these are
pairs of one row and which are three
makes a pair of a row so right this
table declaration and then table dot add
cell and whatever content you want to
give in your cell here you will write so
I am just writing cell column 1 Row 1 so
this will go into the column 1 and Row 1
and like that just add these lines into
your code so it will add the these
columns and this three will make one
column one arose sorry and at last you
just write doc dot add and just add this
table or variable here so this is the
simple code to generate a simple table
in your PDF so let's try and run the
program first
and I click create PDF and when I go to
my PDF file I can see our table here so
column 1 Row 1 column 2 Row 1 come 3 row
1 column 1 Row 2 column 2 Row 2 and
column 3 rotor now sometimes this table
is not enough we need to give some title
to our table also so now I will show you
how to give the title to this table so
just close your program and go to your
code and in this code we will add a new
code to add a title so just go after
your table declaration and here after
the table declaration we are going to
add a code for the header to your table
so write this code for the header right
PDF cell and give it a variable name is
equal to new PDF cell and in the bracket
you can give the title of your header so
write new phrase and in the bracket give
your header name or header text ok and
bracket closed so like that this is the
header title and now we will copy this
cell variable and paste it here dot
column span is equal to 3 because our
table is of 3 columns that's why we
write here 3 so that this cell of header
will be spent to the 3 columns
it will cover 3 columns ok so this code
means that once again copy the cell and
paste it here not horizontal
and is equal to one this one shows that
the text on the header will go to the
center of your cell if you write zero
then it will go to the left of the cell
and if you write 2 it will go to the
right of the cell okay and then just
like these table code lion right this
table variable dot ad cell and just copy
and paste this cell here so this will
add header to your table okay so let's
try and run our program once again and I
will click create PDF and I will check
my PDF once again and if you see this
header is there in my table which have
the span of all three columns so in this
way you can add the header to your table
now for example this had a simple header
don't look like I mean good when you
simply add a header to your table you
need to change the font sometime you
need to change the color of the cell
sometimes also so now I will show you
how to change the font of this header or
any cell that code will not apply to any
cell I am just writing it for this cell
which has header so I will change the
font and I will change the color of this
header so let's see how we can do that
so in our code here we will go to our
table had a phrase because we want to
change the font of this title phrase
okay so just go there where you have
written your face and in the within
these brackets for PDFs P cell just give
here a comma okay and then give this
code there oh I did the mistake not
inside this bracket but inside this
bracket so go to the code phrase and
just after your freeze
just give here a comma and then add this
code so what does this code say after
this comma right new I text text dot
font and give a bracket okay so in here
we are defining the properties of the
pond for this text okay so write this
header come on new text i text job dot X
dot font and in the bracket right
once again I text sharp dot text dot
font dot whatever font you want to
choose I am choosing the normal font
comma the size of your font comma the
once again the font type so I text or
text dot font not normal
okay and then write gamma i text shop
dot text dot base color dot whatever
color you want to give to your font okay
so this is a kind of a big line so just
I will try to move the screen to the
code so that you will be able to write
it okay so just write this code big line
and this line will basically change the
font of your title text so let's see if
it changes the font so I just press this
PDF and I will check the form and if you
see this is change into yellow color and
its size is really reduced because it
was eight F okay
so never mind you can just change the
size and change the color and this is
the basic code to change the font and
the color of your font okay so you know
the code and you can play with it and
the next is we are going to change the
background color of the cell so just
this cell hydrocele we are going to
change the background look so after this
cell declaration just write this code
cell dot background color and this will
show the error because I need to add I
text shop I will just copy it from here
so I just need to add this I takes sharp
dot text because this is conflicting
with the system not drawing of C shop
that's why it's showing this dot base
below
okay so right cell dot background color
is equal to new text dot I take star
shop dot text dot back base color and in
this bracket we are going to pass the
RGB colors okay or otherwise you can
also give the color like that also I
think no you cannot give like that so
you need to give it in RGB formation
okay so like this these three categories
shows the RGB formation of colors so if
you know the RGB codes then you know
what these three column means so this is
just a one color from the RGB code you
can just Google RGB and you will be able
to find the color of your choice okay so
write this to change the background
color of yourself and I will quickly
change the on size also and just change
the wand also do you this time okay and
I'm running the program and I will click
this create PDF and I will check my text
this time you see that a background
color of green is colored here the title
cell is colored with background color
green that title font is also bigger now
and title font color is also big enough
so in this way you can play with the
table and you can get your table correct
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
