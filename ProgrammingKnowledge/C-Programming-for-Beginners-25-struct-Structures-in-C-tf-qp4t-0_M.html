tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video we will see what are
structures in C and how we can use
structures in C so the first question is
what is a structure in C in C a
structure is a collection of different
variable which are grouped together to
make a make some logical group so for
example I want to make a structure of a
student there is no direct variable I
can give to define the attribute for a
student so that I know that this
attribute is for some particular student
there can be many students and there can
be you know I have to declare so many
variables and in the end when I have so
many variables I can get confused which
which variable is assigned to which
student so structures make it very easy
to define if you have a group of
variable to which you want to bind in a
logical group so let's see how we can
declare a structure in C so structure
you just need to use struct keyword in
to define a structure and then the name
of the structure for example student and
then comes these curly braces I just
need to change the font so then comes
these curly braces here and then inside
these curly braces you can define your
variable so what attributes the students
can have he can have his high D his or
her
so this ID can be an integer so I will
define int ID then the student can have
his name so I can define string as a
name so string for example care pointer
I can define it as name hello guys
welcome to the next video tutorial on c
programming for beginners and in this
video I will teach you what is a
structure in C and how we can use
structures in C now what is a structure
structure is a group of variable which
you can group together to make a logical
you know variable for example you want
to define some data base of some student
or you want to create some record of a
student or some students it will be very
difficult to define variables to each
student and then if in the end if you
have many variables containing the
student record it can get a little bit
messy but we can make the situation
better by using structure so structure
is a logical group of variables so to
define a structure for example I want to
define a structure of student to define
a structure we use a keyword called
struct and then we give the name of the
structure for example I gave the name to
my structure as stew dent and then comes
curly braces and inside these curly
braces you define your attributes for
this student structure okay so for
example what attributes or what traits a
student can have a student can have
his ID which can be integer ID student
ID can be integer so I define integer
then student have his name which can be
character and student can have his score
or marks which can be in percentage and
percentage we will define it as a
floating point so he can have these
three attributes or these three traits
right now for each student we can define
this different you know instance of a
structure and we can use structure to
make a logical group of these three
variable for a particular student okay
now once you define the structure this
kind of structure you can use it in your
main function like this so whenever you
define a structure you need to call it
inside your main function and how you
can call it you can just copy the name
of structure and struct keyword itself
and then give the name to this student
structure right so for example you give
this student structure name record one
for example this indicates the student
ric student record of student 1 for
example right now this is the variable
you define for this student structure so
this can be treated the student can be
treated as a data type in this case and
structure is a key book key word which
tells that it's a student data type
which is a structure okay and this is
your variable name just think it think
it like this okay
now whenever you want to assign some
value to this record which is a
instance of the students structure
instance means one part of this student
then how you can do it you can just do
it simply like this so you just need to
take this record and you for example you
want to assign ID to this record you
just need to use this dots separator and
you will be able to see the member
variables of this student structure you
can see automatically in code blocks
okay so these ID name and percentage are
called the members of the structure okay
and you can call them using this dot
separator or after this variable okay so
for example student IB is equal to 1 for
example I have a sign one to record one
and student name so I will once again
use this dot name and then I can assign
any name to this student but if you
remember in the last video when I teach
you what are strings I taught you how
you can copy a string to you know a
character array right or you can assign
or copy a string you can just use a
function call st st r c py which is
string copy and then you can use this
thing so the first argument of this
function is the destination where you
want to assign the value and second
argument is the value itself for example
the value is john so basically what we
have done is we have assigned john as a
value to this name variable record dot
name variable
okay and the third we can assign
percentage like the same so record one
dot percentage is equal to for example
seventy point two zero okay these are
the percentage scored by him okay now
once you assign these values to the
structure or use the into the instance
of the structure you can access these
values also using your print print
function so just use print and then you
can just call for example ID so you can
just write ID is equal to percentage D
and then you can just give the space and
just write name is equal to percentage s
and just gives little bit more space and
then just write percent is equal to a
percentage F okay so this is for holding
the decimal value this is for holding
the string this is for holding the
floating point right and we will give
the line break here also and then we
will assign or we can brain we can
access the values which we have assigned
just by like same as we have assigned
the value so record dot ID will give you
the ID record dot name will give you the
name and record dot percentage record
one dot percentage will give you the
percentage okay like this so let's break
this print into few lines so we can see
it
easily okay so we can access these
values like this okay so let us try and
run the program and hopefully it does
not contain any errors and you can see
ID is equal to one name is equal to John
and percentage is equal to 70 point one
nine nine nine which is seventy point
two zero right so in the same way you
can define different instance of the
student structure and you can maintain a
record of the student for example you
define some different structure so I
will just copy the same and paste it
below to a define as second record and
this record I will name it as record to
everywhere I will just change it record
to record to they got to here also
record to so I will just copy they got
to for the student to okay and the ID
now is to the name will change for
example mark and the percentage also
changes for example 90 1.30 okay and now
we have two records of the student
student with student ID 1 and student
with student ID 2 so logically we have
to record for students right run the
program and now it says ID is equal to 1
named John percent is 70 point something
ID is equal to 2 name mark percent
ninety point 1 point something right so
in this way you can define as many
instances of this structure as you want
and you can you know create a record for
the student or so this is one way of
using structure there is one more way of
using structure in
see and this is by directly giving the
name to your student structure for
example I can just delete this line from
here and instead of giving the name to
this student variable here I can just
give the name at the Declaration of the
students structure for example record
right and then this record will be my
variable name okay so the student is the
structure and record will be the
variable name of your structure okay and
then you can use this record to you know
access the value or assign the values to
this record for example here you can
just replace record like this and it
will work like same so you don't need to
declare this record inside your main
this can be also declared like this and
this will be your variable name and you
don't need to declare inside your main
and when you run the program it will run
fine it will give you the output so in
this way you can use structures in C and
try you know using structures by
yourself and try practicing using
structures and you will be good to go so
