last video I have shown you what are
delegates and how to declare delegates
in c-sharp in this video I am going to
give you a little example which makes
this a delegate concept a little bit
much thira so let's get started in the
last video I have shown you how to
declare a delegate signature and I have
shown you whatever method you want to
point to from a delegate you your method
or your delegate signature will look
like the same as method only changes you
need to have this delegate right now for
example I create I want to create a
delegate which will be a general-purpose
delegate to perform some action or to
perform some operation for example I
want to perform addition subtraction and
multiplication and division from our
same delegate how can I do it so for
example this method we have written it
for the addition of two numbers I can
just make a similar method to subtract
two numbers I will just say subs number
for subtracting number and you just give
us the subtraction of two numbers and
once again we will copy this method and
we will paste it here and then this
third method we will use it to get the
product of two numbers product two
numbers so this will give us the product
okay so for example I have these three
method and I want to use the same
delegate to use them I can name mine the
delegate as operation delegate for
example operation delegate which perform
some operation on these two numbers
right now what I what
can I do is or what I can do is I can
perform this addition subtraction or
product product of these two numbers by
using the single delegate so I will just
copy the name of this delegate and I can
declare the object of this delegate I've
told you last time that delegates are
similar to the classes in a way that you
can instantiate or you can create a
instance of this class or in this
delegate right and in the constructor
you need to give the name of the
function you want to point to so for
example first object I create del 1 to
add these two numbers right and I can
say the result the add result is equal
to whatever is the result right this
should be is equal to and the result
okay so and in a similar way I can
declare the another instance of this
delegate I will just copy and paste it
here and I will name this delegate as
delegate 2 and this can this delegate
instance I will pass this function which
is subtracting two numbers okay and this
result I will say this result is result
one for me this so for example we said
this is a result one and this is a
result two for me and other passed two
different numbers for example thousand
minus 789 okay and I can instantiate a
third delegate object del 3 and I will
pass this product function to this and
now this delegate will point to the
and this wizard I will store in the
third variable called result three and
then I can say sub result is or
substrate the result is and product
result is this one so in a way I have
used a single that delegate to perform
these three methods right so this
delegate can be used as a general
purpose a method for performing three
different tasks right and I will run the
program it shows me the result of all
these three right so in this way you can
create a delegate which will show you
which you give you the result of all
these this should be once one second
okay so there there is something which I
forget this delegate comes here when you
pass these two arguments this delegate
will come here and this delegate will
come here right now this this variation
is complete so we create an instance of
the delegate and in the construct as a
constructor we give the function name
which will point point to this function
so our delegate object will point to
this function and whatever this function
is it is pointing to it will take the
argument same argument as that function
and using the dis instance right the
same you will do it for this and this
and now probably you will see the right
will do so addition of these two number
is this subtraction of these two number
in this and multiplication of these two
number is this okay so in a way you can
use delegate for three purposes first is
to encapsulate the methods call from
caller
second is effective use of delegate
improve the performance of the
application right so if you use this
these delegates effectively it will
increase the performance of your
application in a way that your
application will be much flexible if you
use
delegates because you can perform
different tasks using the same delegate
right and the third is delegates are
used to call method asynchronously right
so you can call this method and at the
different time you can call other method
so you can call them asynchronously
right so in this way you can use
delegates this is a small example I want
to give you and I hope you learn
something new this time please rate
