last video I have shown you how to
declare arrays how to initialize arrays
and how to use arrays in C++ now in this
video I am going to show you a small
example using arrays so that you can
your concepts on array can be a little
bit more strong so let's get started
what I'm going to do is I am going to
show you how you can sum or how you can
add all the elements of array in this
example for example I have an array we
call it my array and now I will assign
the number of value where it will
contain for example it will contain six
values and then I will initialize it
with arrays initializer values so I will
give some values to my array the first
value for example not here but 465
second value is 678 third value is
something fourth value is also fifth and
sixth so suppose I want to add or I want
the sum of all the values of the array
how I can get the sum of all values of
the array let's see how we can achieve
it I will declare a variable sum which
is which will hold the sum of all the
elements in the array and I will
initialize this as 0 now we will declare
a power loop for int I is equal to 0 and
then I is less than 6 because our array
contains 6 values right and it starts
from 0 the index of the array starts
from 0 that
it's AI is less than six and I plus plus
and then in the next line what I'm you
need to do is simply I will take some
and I will add the element of some one
by one so I will say plus equal to and
then the element of the array so I will
copy this array here and then I will
just add element one by one using this I
okay so what will we do it will just get
the zeroth element then get the first
element because it's in the loop right
and when all the some and when the
addition is done and for loop is
complete we are going to print awesome
I will say sum and then my variable sum
and then okay now I will say sum is
equal to that will be much better the
see now when I run the program it's
showing me the mistake because here is
the sum I declare it randomly okay now
we will build it and run the program and
now you can see the sum of all the
values in the array is this one you can
just check it whether it's the sum or
not or we can check it with the simple
values for example two two two two two
and two so we know that the sum will be
twelve right build the program and run
it and you can see sum is equal to 12 so
in this way you can calculate the sum of
the element of an array using C++ I hope
you have enjoyed the video please rate
