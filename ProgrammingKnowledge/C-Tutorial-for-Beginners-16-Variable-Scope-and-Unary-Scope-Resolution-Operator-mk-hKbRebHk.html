last couple of videos I have been
showing you how to use functions in c++
now in this video I am going to show you
how variable scope works in C++ and how
unary scope resolution operator works in
C++ so first of all I will demonstrate
how variable scope works so for example
you have a function void print me it's a
random function I'm writing and what it
does is it just prints some things so
I'll say print something okay and yen be
a so now for example you can declare a
variable which is local to a function
and you can declare a variable which is
global to the function so for example I
declare some variable in my variable for
example is equal to 30 okay and I want
to use this variable here also so I want
to print C out my variable in here will
it work let's see if it pulls or not so
it's showing the error and what error
it's showing is that let's see what is
the error here error is my variable was
not declared in this scope
so there is a problem of scope in here
so what is the problem here is whenever
you declare a variable inside a function
it's called a local declaration on local
scope of that variable and whenever you
declare a function inside or whenever
you declare a variable inside a function
it can be this function of this function
it will be usable inside that function
only okay so you cannot use my variable
outside this function so this is called
the local scope or local declaration of
a variable now for example if you want
to use the same variable and this
function in this function what you can
do is you can declare your variable as
global so I will just remove this here
and I will declare it as global int my
variable is equal to 20 is equal to 20
so now what will happen is because we
have declared a variable outside this
function and our main function this is
called a global variable and it is
global to this and this so this function
of this variable can be used here also
and here also right and when I compile
my program this time it will be compiled
fine okay
so you can declare the variable either
as a global variable if you want to use
it in your main function and the other
functions then declare your variable as
global variable and if you want to use
your variable in the function itself or
locally then you just declare o your
function inside
inside your function right so I hope you
understood this now let's talk about
unary scope resolution operator so for
example you have declared a global value
like this and you also have declared in
my variable here also which you have
initialized with 10 now how your program
will know with this this which you are
printing my variable it is local
variable or a global variable that's
that we just remove this function in
order to clarify more so this is my
global variable and I have also declared
the same name in as a local variable
also and when I want to print this
variable let's see what happens
I will compile my program and run it and
it shows me the value 10 that means the
variable value is 10 and it's using this
value as a local value here right so
whenever you declare variable with the
same name which will be preferred the
local value will be preferred right so
most recent value you have declared will
be preferred in the function so this is
the most recent value or the most inner
value or the local value simply it will
be preferred on global value so this
will print 10 here now in order to use
the global value for example you want to
use this value you want to print 20 and
not 10 how you can print it so in order
to print this global value you need to
use this unary scope resolution operator
and
what is this unary scope resolution
operator we just need to give two
columns sorry this was a mistake you
just need to give two columns before
your variable so these two call columns
are called unary scope resolution
operator and this two double colons
tells your C++ code that this variable
is a global global variable and not a
local variable so in this way you
distinguish between global and local
value if it doesn't have these two
columns it will treat this my variable
as this local variable and when you have
this two : then this my variable will be
considered as a global variable and now
let's try to build our program and run
it and now you can see here that it has
printed 20 so this variable is
considered because we have declared is
as a global variable using unity scope
resolution operator
so 4:00 p.m. understood the concept of
variable scores and unity scope
resolution operator in C++ and I hope
