tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what our ArrayList and how we can use
array lists in Java now before this we
have seen how we can declare and use
simple arrays and the problem with those
arrays were that we have to provide the
initial or the size of the array and the
size of the array in those cases were
fixed and it's really hard in real
programming practices to change the size
of the array using simple arrays now
Java also provides a library called util
and in this util library there is a
keyword called ArrayList and this
ArrayList
helps us to maintain and use dynamic
arrays so unlike the simple arrays whose
size is hard to change these array lists
are dynamically created and used so you
can decrease or increase or you know
clear these are a list whatever you want
now to use this ArrayList you need to
import this util library so just right
import Java Java dot util dot array list
and this will add this class called
ArrayList to your program and if you
want to go inside this class you can
just hover over this and ctrl and click
on this and this is the inbuilt Java
ArrayList class you can go inside okay
now to declare an array list in Java you
just
need this keyword called arraylists so
just use this keyword called ArrayList
and then in these angular bracket you
can give the data type of the array you
want to have for example you want to
create an integer array we just write
integer and then my list is the name of
the array not here but it should come
outside these angular brackets like this
my list is equal to new ArrayList and
then once again integer and then here
you can give the initial size and this
is not the fixed size this is the
initial size you won't provide this size
can be changed it can be increased or
decreased depending upon your
requirement now to add values to the
array you just need the variable name
and then just write add and in here you
can add any value for example at index
one we want to add one and in a similar
way you can add values one by one here
so for example second number is 5/3 is 3
and you will add two more numbers for
example 6 and 993 whatever okay so now
for example I want to access those
values I can use advanced for loop for
iterating over this list so what I can
do is I can just write integer X and
then in here from my list I can iterate
these values so in here I can just write
this Oh ctrl shift and in here I can
just iterate over my list using X okay
and once I run the program it just
prints all the values of the
or is five values so five you know five
times we can print the values okay now
in order to get the size of the array
you can do something like this so you
can just write system dot out dot print
and then the name of your list or
ArrayList which is my list here and then
dot size and this gives you the size of
the array okay so this is the function
inside our our list and this gives the
size here you can see pipe to make it
more clear
I can just say size is equal to and then
this plus so that we can see the size
and say size is equal to five
okay which is true because our array
contain one two three four five elements
so bear in mind this size
shows the number of element contained by
the array not the initial size we have
provided for example we have provided
any initial size as five but we have
only added three values to the array
right and now once we run the program it
says size is equal to three so it this
size is not indicating the initial size
which is this one but this indicates the
number of element contained by the array
so we have added only three element then
the size will be three now using this
array list you can even remove the
values for example I have once again
five values I will add two more values
to the array and these are some all
values and for example I want to remove
this element at
index to because index of ArrayList also
starts from zero so the index starts
from zero one two three and four
so I want to delete the element three
which is at index two so I can just use
the array myarray which is this one and
then I can call a method called
thought remove and here I can give the
index so I want to remove for example
here at index two the value is 555 and I
want to remove this 555 from here so I
will just write to index two and then I
will just once again print the disarray
after removing the value and I will also
see the size what is the size of this
array after removing this value so I
will run this program and you can see
initially our array contains five values
and size was five but when we call this
method remove two at index two then our
size becomes four and 555 is removed
from the array from here right you can
see here now
there is a method called clear by which
you can even clear all the values from
the other so just my list dot clear and
then using this clear you can just clear
all the values from the array so
initially the size of the array was five
but when you call this method on your
list the size becomes zero right now for
example you want to change some value in
your area for example you I want to
change this value one which is at index
zero 200 I can do this something like
this so your array name then set
and then it takes to a limb to argument
one is the index so I want to change the
value at index 0 because 1 is at index 0
and I want to change the value of 1 200
so second value of 100 or second
argument is 100 and now when I run the
program the size remains same but the
value here what earlier it was 1 now it
became 100 okay so in this way you can
use these ArrayList in Java it contained
many more method for example when I just
use this variable name my list and when
I just use dot separator it will give
you suggestions and here it will give
you some more suggestions like you can
clone this or you can have you can check
if this array is empty or not or you can
check or you can trim this array to the
size of something so let's try to trim
this list dot trim to size ok and what
this method is doing is it trims the
size of the array to the number of
element it contain for example the
initial size of this array was 5 and we
have just provided 3 then it trims your
array to 3 itself any instead of initial
size okay so trimming means just
cost-cutting the size of the array to
the number of element it contains which
is 3 so in this way you can use many
more method on this list but I hope you
have enjoyed I mean you have learned the
basic concept of ArrayList and I hope
you enjoyed this video please rate
