video I'm going to show you how we can
use constructor in C++ and what is a
constructor so first of all what is a
constructor a constructor is a special
member function of a class that is
created when you create the object of
the class and the name of the
constructor a constructor is always same
as the name of the class so that is how
you can recognize constructor so let's
see how we can declare constructor in
classes but first of all one more
important information even if you don't
declare a constructor C++ will create a
constructor for you for us class
automatically so we have written this
class there is a constructor for this
class which is automatically created
even though we have not written any
constructor for this class now let's see
how we can declare constructor for a
class so I have shown I have already
told you constructor has the same name
as your class name so I will just copy
this and in my public access specifier I
will just write this and I will pass no
parameter inside this and I will give
these parentheses so this is called a
constructor okay so it has the same name
as class and it is always initialized
when you create an object so let's
verify if it's created or or it's
initialized when we create the object or
not so I will write some message I will
show some message so for example I will
write BNE or you are in
constructor okay and I will write and
line here by the way if you don't know
how or how this class works I have shown
you the explanation of this class book
class in the last video so if you want
don't know how to click declare a class
or how what are these functions in this
class I have explained these things in
the last two videos okay so what we have
done is we have declared a constructor
and we have we are showing some when you
inside our constructor or we are showing
some message inside our constructor
right now let's create an object of a
class so you already know how to create
an object of the class we just need the
name of your class we just poke books
and give the variable name or object
name it is for example book one okay and
even though we are not calling any
variable we are just creating the object
and I already told you that constructor
is called
whenever object is created right so even
though we are not writing anything let's
see what happens I will just compile my
program now I will run my program and
you see here it shows you are in
constructor that means what I am saying
is true right so a constructor is called
whenever you dare the object of a class
and it is created automatically now we
don't really use constructor to show
some messages right it should have some
specific cues so generally we use
constructor to initialize the values of
the variable
in the class right so for example what
you want to do is you want to initialize
the value of this variable called name
okay we already create a set name and
get name functions and we need to
initialize this name with some value or
otherwise for example if somebody writes
C out this we call this book 1 dot get
name what will happen because we haven't
initialized any value to the name and we
directly we are calling this get name
what happens here is I will just close
this and I will compile this and see
let's see what happens you see here it's
showing some error because we haven't
initialized any values and this function
does not match is this functions let's
just change this and now let's compile
the program once again and let's run the
program and you see here you will not be
able to see any values here because we
haven't assigned any values to our
string variable called name so why do we
use constructor we generally use
constructor to initialize some value to
the constructor and how we can
initialize the name value or initialize
this variable name you can just pass a
parameter called string because this
variable is a string right so you can
just pass string for example X and what
you can do is you can call this set name
function here set name is equal to
X for example okay so whenever you
create an object it will initialize for
you and you have to give some name to
your object and this that object will go
here and then that object that function
will assign this value to name and
indirectly you are assigning the value
to the name variable okay so we have
initialized name by initializing this
constructor now whenever you pass some
argument in the constructor like this
for example is our constructor with the
string variable then you need to
initialize your object with an argument
which is string also so I will give the
name of the book c plus plus tutorial
for example and now when we run the
program compile it and run it you can
see this book 1 dot get name gives you
the name of the book right and what we
have done we have simply initialize this
value with a constructor like this ok so
once again why do we use constructor we
do use constructor to initialize value
and when consumer when constructor is
initialized of when constructor is
created whenever you create the object
of the function and if you pass argument
to the constructor you need to pass the
same data-type argument to the
constructor to initialize it like this
ok now one more in the key concept I
want to show you is for example you want
to create a
different object for example book to
object you want to create a book to
object we have created already book one
object so we create we will create book
to object and we initialize this with
some other name so book name will be
this time for example Java tutorials ok
and once again you call this book to dot
get name so what do you think what will
happen because this is a different
object and this is a different object so
one might think that whenever you create
a second object of a class it will
overwrite the name you have given to the
first object but this doesn't happen
every object you create it has different
or its own set of name set of function
so this object will have independent
this variable name this function get
name and this function set name and this
has nothing to do with this object this
object will also has its own name get
name and set name function and this
object will also have its own name
variable and get inside functions okay
so when you compile this program both
object will be initialized and they will
work fine c++ tutorial java tutorial and
they are independent of each other
right so it's just a instance of a class
you are creating by object and they are
not related to each other on they are
not dependent on each other each object
is independent of each other so i hope
you have understood the concept of
constructor in c++ and i hope you have
