video number 25
I have shown you how to create and show
date and current time on your form but
in that video I have shown how to show a
static time so it's not moving but
sometimes we want our time to be moving
as a clock and we want to show it
dynamically so in this video I will show
you how to show or move this time
dynamically as a watch so let's get
started first of all go go into your
form and go to the tool bar you know
this one and take the time from here and
drag and drop into your form and if you
see this timer doesn't go into your form
but it goes and this bottom strip so it
means your timer is there for use okay
and now we will go to the source code of
our program or form and if you remember
in the video number 25 how I have shown
the clock so
I have used these two line to show the
current date and time so I will run
through them once again I have taken a
date/time variable which is this late
time and what I am passing in that
variable is the current date and time
that's why it's day time now and then
I'm transferring that current date and
time into a string and then to unlived
so if you don't remember this code just
copy this code and this is the label you
won't have to take into your form so
these two lines I have written in the
video number 25 but right now we just
cut these lines so right click and cut
these two lines and just go to your form
once again and just select this timer
and double click it and this will lead
us to the timer event of our form and if
you can see when you just select it and
when you go to the properties of this
timer you can see the interval is set
100 that means it's one second so every
hundred interval is one second you can
increase it also and decrease it also so
we won't want to move a clock every one
second that's why it's okay by a default
for us
but if you can you can move this also or
change this also so once again go to the
timer double click it once again and
what we have cut from our these two
lines just place it here okay same code
same two lines I'm pasting here now once
again I will go to my form and I'm just
copying my name of the time which is
time over once again go to the code and
go at the top from where you have cut
your two lines of code for time yeah so
come here if you don't know where to go
just find this initialized component
function and in this function the in
these two brackets we need to write so
here right timer and then arrow point
and right start and bracket and bracket
closed so write this wherever your
initialized component is there and now
when we run our program
once again and when we see our clock you
see it's moving right
so in this way you can show the date and
time dynamically this will look good on
your form and you can also use it
according to your use so I hope you have
enjoyed this video please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
