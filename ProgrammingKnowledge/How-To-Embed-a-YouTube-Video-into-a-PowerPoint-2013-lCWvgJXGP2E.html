show you how you can embed YouTube
videos in your Microsoft Office 2013
PowerPoint presentation so earlier
version if you wanted to you know embed
YouTube video in your PowerPoint
presentation you would have gone to
insert and in here in the video section
there was an option to embed your
YouTube videos but in the newer versions
it's not available so we are going to
embed YouTube video using a simple
little trick using Visual Basic but it's
not complicated and it's easy to follow
and it's easy to implement so for
example I want to embed a video so this
is the video for example I want to embed
on my PowerPoint presentation what I
need to do is I just need to copy the
URL so just copy this URL from here and
open any notepad so that you can added
this URL so in this notepad you just
need to paste this URL I will make it
bigger so you can see and in here you
just need to add at this URL
a little so in order to make it work on
your PowerPoint presentation you just
need to remove this watch and this
question marks so remove this watch and
question mark and after the /v just
remove this equal to sign and replace it
with this slash okay so remove this
equal to sign and replace it with slash
and rest of this will remain the same
now if you want to autoplay your video
directly whenever you start your
PowerPoint presentation and when you
reach that slide you can add some more
URL options here for example autoplay so
how to add this autoplay option to your
URL you just need to give this and
symbol here so just give this and symbol
and then write autoplay
autoplay is equal to one okay
autoplay is equal to one not this one
but autoplay is equal to one so what I
have added to my URL I will just paste
it down so that you can see what I have
added I have added this and symbol and
then this autoplay word is equal to one
after my URL this is to autoplay the
video just whenever your slide is
reached wherever you want embed your
YouTube video okay so now we have our
URL now we want to embed it in our
PowerPoint presentation but in here we
want to have a developer ribbon so what
we need to do is go to files here or
file here and go to the last and click
options and in the options go to
customize ribbon so go to customize
ribbon and in here customize the ribbon
in here you will be able to see this
ribbon call developer this is by default
is unchecked so you just need to check
it and then click OK
this will add this new ribbon here in
your PowerPoint presentation called
developer so you can click this
developer ribbon here and then you what
you need to do is you need to click this
symbol called more control this
screwdriver and hatchet kind of tool or
button okay and when you hover over it
it says more control so you can check it
just click this options and in here
search for shockwave so search for
shockwave flash player okay so whenever
you see this sock shockwave flash object
then click OK and then you will be able
to see a square on your mouse okay you
just need to make a square with your
mouse here and this will define the size
of your video you want to have so I make
made a square with my mouse here and
this will be the size of my video okay
but still we need to add the URL to our
this shock wave of flash object right so
what we need to do now is you just need
to right click your Square where which
you have made for YouTube video so right
click it and just click property sheet
here so just click property sheet and in
here you will be able to see this
property sheet window here and then
search for movie movie tab here so this
is movie tab and then we will just copy
our URL from here which we have modified
so copy this URL from here and then once
again go to your presentation and once
again search for movie here and in here
in this movie category you just need to
paste your link as it is which you have
copied and then just close this ok so
just close this and as soon as you close
it it will
not show anything right now but whenever
you start your slideshow so I will start
my slideshow from here and slideshow is
started and I can see my video with you
playing on my powerpoint presentation
this is the video which is playing here
on my powerpoint presentation right I
can exit it from here and still I can
see this YouTube video screen but it's
not playing so whenever you will just
run your PowerPoint presentation this
will start once again I will run my
PowerPoint presentation and you can see
this here your YouTube video okay I
escaped it from here so in this video in
this way you can add or embed YouTube
video in your PowerPoint 2013
