show you how you can download and
install android studio ide on your
Windows operating system now first thing
you need to know that Android studio is
dependent on Java so you need to have
Java installed on your Windows operating
system in order to install Android
studio so make sure that Java JDK is
installed on your system and then we are
ready to install Android studio on our
Windows operating system so open your
browser and search for Android studio
and the first link most probably which
will appear here will be from
developer.android.com slash tools last
to do click this link and in here you
can read more about Android studio and
STK and what we need to do now is we
need to click this option called
download here and you will see this kind
of screen and this green button says
download Android studio for Windows so
just click this button and in here you
will see terms and condition for
downloading Android studio you can read
all these and after reading you need to
check this checkbox and now you will see
this blue button which says Android
studio for Windows just click this
button and it's going to download this
Android studio bundle for Windows which
is an executable file and which is 1.1
GB at the time of making this video so
it may take some time to download this
executable file so sit back relax and
grab a cup of tea while it's downloading
and after it has been downloaded we can
start installing Android studio so I
have already downloaded this Android
studio executable file so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to cancel it but you
in your case you need to download it and
I'm going to go to the location where I
have
downloaded this executable file and
double click on it and this will start
this Android studio installation now
Android studio setup has been started
you just need to click Next here and in
here make sure that all these options
are automatically checked and click Next
and you just need to click I agree and
once again I agree and this is the
location where your Android studio will
be installed and this is the location
where your Android SDK will be installed
so make note of these locations you may
need to you know use these locations in
order to debug some problems ok and now
click Next and these are the
configuration setting which is required
of by Android studio and click Next and
you will see here what are the
extensions and what are the plug-in you
may have with Android studio so you
don't need anything extra we just need
Android studio right now and just click
install
now the installation of android studio
on our windows operating system is
complete and you will see this complete
message when this setup is completed so
at this time you just need to click this
next button and it will give you this
message that if you want to start
Android studio when you click finish
button but right now just uncheck this
option and click finish ok and now to
start Android studio on Windows 8 for
example you just need to search for
Android studio so search for Android
studio and right-click on this option so
right click on Android studio and run
Android studio as administrator now
Android studio will start and Android
studio is made by IntelliJ which is
famous for making other IDE for
programming languages like Java or
Python or PHP and many other languages
and for the first time when you start
your Android studio it will give you
this message that if you want to import
your setting from previous version of
studio you can do it but we don't have
any previous version so we will leave it
as default and click OK and Android
studio will start now now in between you
will see this type of Windows security
alert you just need to allow the access
and now Android studio is started and
for the first time when you start
Android studio it will ask for the theme
you want to work on if you want IntelliJ
theme or you want dark Allah which is
dark theme so it's on you which theme
you want to use I will prefer then this
IntelliJ theme and click Next and it
will download some component for itself
and now click finish
and now this is the interface you will
see for Android studio now before
starting our first Android project what
we need to do is we need to do some
configurations so just choose this
option which says configuration and
click on it and give you these options
for settings plugins and SDK manager for
now you want to click SDK manager so
just click SDK manager and it will start
this kind of SDK manager
now in here on the right corner you will
see the install seven packages so these
are the packages which will be installed
whenever you click this button and it's
recommended that you click this button
for installing these packages and in
addition it's important to click this
option so in here in the SDK manager go
to the category called extras which is
the last category and inside this
categories the last option will be Intel
x86 emulator accelerator and this we
will need to start our emulator and in
short it's called haxm installer okay so
make sure that you check this option for
Intel x86 emulator accelerator ok
so it's you know necessary you can say
to start your app on your emulator okay
so once you check this click this option
which says install these number of
packages in my case it's 8 but it can
vary and it will give you this option
that you accept license and condition
for installing these packages just check
this option accept license and then you
will see this install button click
install and will install these 8
packages
on your Android SDK manager so once
these packages are installed we are
ready to create our first Android
application so just close it and we can
go back from here and now we can create
our first Android app so I hope you
