tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in this video we will see what
is a method and how to use a method in
Java methods are also called
functions in other languages so if I use
function or method they can be used
interchangeably okay
but in Java this method is preferred or
method what keyboard is preferred so
first of all what is a method a method
is a piece of code which executes some
logic and you can wrap this method with
a name and you can call this method
again and again whenever you want to use
it now how to use a method first of all
for your information this main is also a
method which every Java program has this
I have told you in the initial videos
right so in this same method this is you
know Java is expecting us to provide and
our method name should not be mean
because there should be only one main
method in any Java program okay but
other than mean and reserved name in
Java you can define any name to a method
so first of all let's see what is the
basic syntax of a method so we just give
first of all the XS specifier to our
method which is public like this and
then static so don't worry about these
public and static because we will see
these keywords in detail in the later
videos when ever we will see how to use
classes but then starts this return
value we
the part of the method and then comes
the name of the method for example my
first method okay and then comes these
brackets in these brackets we can pass
some parameter but for the first time
because it's an introduction I just want
to leave them empty they can be left
empty or you can pass parameters like
int a something like this in here but
for now for simplicity I will leave them
you know blank so this is the simplest
kind of method so what are these first
of all public static is called the axis
specifier and public keyword tells your
class or Java that it's accessible
anywhere inside your class okay and then
void is the return type right now we are
not returning anything that's why we
write here void but I will show you in
the further videos how to return value
using method and in that we will see
more options other than void with this
method and then comes the method name
and in these school circular brackets or
round brackets comes the argument for
now we are not passing any argument and
then in these curly braces comes your
statement for example we want to execute
or we want to print some some message so
system dot out dot print line and be
just right hello YouTube okay and this
is the basic syntax or code which you
want to write or which what you want to
exist cute
using this method now you can call this
method in your main method here and you
don't need to execute or print anything
you can just call this method as it is
you just need to copy the name of the
method like this and then provide these
two round brackets okay and then when
you run the program it will print hello
YouTube so we are not if you notice we
are not directly printing in our main
method you tell YouTube but we are
calling the function with a function
name and then it prints hello YouTube
okay and the biggest advantage of using
this function or method is it will make
your code really readable and really
concise and it will make your code look
good okay and understandable so for
example you want to call this method
again and again inside your function you
can call it and you don't need to write
any further code right it will print
hello you do five times so you can call
a method again and again in inside your
main method and without writing
rewriting the same code again and again
so the basic rule of thumb is when you
decide to write a method whenever you
have the code which is you know which
you want to write again and again then
you may wrap it inside a method and this
will help you to reduce the lines of
code which will you write okay for
example this code contains five lines
okay so and we do not want to write
these five lines again and again because
for example this code
method continue five lines and if we
have to do it without the method we have
to do it you know just like this and we
want to call it if once again these five
lines of code again in our main method
then we need to write it something like
this and this and this will make your
code really lengthy and whenever your
code becomes really lengthy it will be
hard to read your code okay and what
this method is doing it's just making
your code with you know execute with
just single line of code okay so this is
the real advantage of method and you
should give really logical name to a
method so that it's understandable and
then you know any other person if he is
reading your code he will be able to
understand your code also okay so this
is the basic form of method in Java
there are other kinds of methods for
example method which takes arguments
method which returns value which I will
show you in the next videos please stay
