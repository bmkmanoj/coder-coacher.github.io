video I will show you how to open a
directory and lift out all the folders
and files in that directory in this list
box so suppose you have some folder you
have some folder again in that folder or
directory and you have some files so if
it's the mixture of files and folder in
the root folder or whatever you selected
and you want to lift out in this list
box for how can you do it I will show
you so just take a button this is a
simple button and I renamed it and
resized it and this is a list box you
can find it here in the toolbox just
this button and just this list box you
have to take and now click this button
and double click it and in here we are
going to write the code first of all
what you need to do is you need to
import this using directive so write
using system dot IO because we are
dealing with files and folders so we
need this using directive and in this
button click event I have already
written a small code to open folder
browser dialogue so this folder browser
dialog will open your folder dialog so
that you can select the directory from
this folder dialog and so what I have
done is I have written folder browser
dialog and I have given that name is
equal to new folder dialog and I am
checking if my folder dialog or my
selected path from the dialog is correct
or not and if it's correct now I will
write my code for listing the files and
folder in this list box so first of all
I will what I will do is I will
clear the listbox if I want to use it
again and again so I will write list box
once again list box
dot items dot clear so it will clear the
list box first and now what I will do is
I will declare two strings so I am write
string array files the first string will
contains the pile names and then I will
write directory dot get piles and
bracket and bracket close and then I
will pass argument here so just copy
this file folder browser dialog object
dot selected path ok so this is the
array which will contain the all the
files which are there inside the
selected directory now I want to make RA
so I will copy it once again and paste
it here and now I want to make a array
which will hold all the directories in
that selected directory so I will write
the string name as directories dir f
does and here instead of get files I
will write directory dot get directories
ok and this will remain the same so now
I have all the files and directories
inside my arrays
now I just want to show in this list box
so I will write for each once again for
each and I will make a string variable
here so I will write string pile in my
file array so I'm searching files in my
file array then I will just close this
and I will add those file in my
directory so what I will do is list box
dot add dot items dot add so items not
add and you can just copy this file
variable and paste it here this is not
files which is our array but this file
variable ok in the same way I will copy
this for each loop once again and paste
is just below my other loop and I will
write here the IR for directory and I
will just copy this Derrick dirs array
and paste it here so I'm listing all the
directories and now I will copy this
directory here so it will add all the
files in the list box and all the
directories in the list box right so
this is the code to list out all the
files and folder in the directory
and in the list box so let's run our
program and it's running now I will just
select a folder open folder
browser and I will select a folder so I
will select this folder and I click OK
and it will list out all the files you
can see J dot jpg dot XML and it also
lists out all the directories also and
if you want don't want to show this
whole path you just want to show the
file name only and directory name only
and you don't want to show the whole
path what you can do is you can just go
here and just close this file in the
bracket one more brackets so add this
bracket and right here path dot get file
name and same thing you can do it with
this directory here so write directory
just enclose it in other bracket and
just paste it here now when we run the
program it's showing some error let's
see what what is this yeah we are short
of 1 bracket so now when I run the
program and I select the same directory
and I open it it just shows the file
names and directory names it doesn't
show the whole path of the file and
directories so in this way you can list
out all the files and folder in the
selected directory in the list box I
