show you how we can download and install
Visual Studio code on our Windows
operating system Visual Studio code is a
code editor on which you can you know
edit or write different kind of codes
for example PHP JavaScript HTML C++ or
and many other languages so let's see
how we can download and install Visual
Studio code so just open your favorite

of executable file which is vs core
setup - stable dot exe file and you can
save it anywhere wherever you want in
your computer and depending upon the
speed of your internet you can see it
can take a minute or so because it's a
thirty megabyte file so just wait for
the download to complete and then we
will start installing it ok so now the
executable file is downloaded on my
system so I can just run it so just
click the Exe file which you have
downloaded and then start installing
Visual Studio code now installing Visual
Studio code is really easy so you just
need to click Next accept license terms
and condition click Next this is the
location where code will be installed on
your system click Next and then you know
it's a start
select start menu folder so this is the
Start menu folder and if you don't have
the you know correct reason to change it
don't change it and leave it as default
and click Next and here you can see it
will create a desktop icon for you
register code as an editor for support
for files and add to the path so
environment variable also
you can you know it will be able to set
by itself okay and then click Next and
click install it will be really fast
installation so it will not take much
time to install Visual Studio code and
you can see it's installing and
extracting all the files and then in few
seconds it will be installed on your
system
now it's also going to set the
environment path variables so whenever
you want to open visual studio code
using your for example command line it
will be able to do it so now you can see
the code is installed on my system so I
can just leave this checkbox checked
which will launch the Visual Studio code
and click finish and now the Visual
Studio code will be launched on my you
know on my system now I will also see
this welcome screen and getting started
so if you are interested in learning
more you can see this ton of information
given on their website so you see top
extension for c-sharp Python C++
debugger for Chrome and many other
options are here right now let's see how
we can you know open the Visual Studio
code from the command line so here you
can create any file for example I will
create a new file you can see it will
create a new file or if I want to save
this file I can just save it by going to
the file and then save as or save so for
example I will do save as and I will say
for example test dot HTML right and now
I can just type so it's a really good
editor which has intelligence so I can
just say HTML and press double tab and
it's going to complete the you know tags
for me right once again
for example head and double tab and it's
going to complete this once again the
body for example
you can just write body and double-tap
and you know it's completing my you know
tags for me okay
and then you have the option to format
your code so right click and then just
click format code and it's going to
format your code for you also right out
of the box now if you want so I'm going
to close my code editor and for example
I can just open a command line and here
when I type code it's going to open the
code for me so you can see it's going to
open the code right and for example if
you want to open the code and you know
open your project using code you just
need to go to the folder in which your
project is for example you have some
node.js project just browse to that
project and then you can just type code
and dot and it's going to open the
folder for you right so in this way you
can download and install Visual Studio
