show you how you can solve hjx kernel
module is not installed while running
your android application so you made
your cool Android application and while
running that application you are
encounter some message like this that
CPU has seller ation status hacks kernel
module is not installed or it says error
x86 emulator currently requires hardware
acceleration okay so if you encounter
this problem I'm going to show you how
you can solve it so the first step to
solve this problem is to make sure that
this hacks x86 emulator is installed on
your system so go to your SDK manager or
click this small button for SDK manager
and open your SDK manager from Android
studio and in here just scroll down and
at the bottom in extras section just
open this extras category and the last
option here is Intel x86 emulator
accelerator okay so make sure that this
is installed or and if it's not
installed just select it and install
this package so the first step is making
sure that Intel x86 emulator accelerator
is installed so if it's not installed
just install it otherwise if you have
already installed it's okay so you can
close it okay now the second thing to do
is you just need to copy this path so if
you encounter this problem the first
line of this message is the path of the
emulator right so you need to copy this
part which is C user whatever your user
name is
/ up data slash local slash Android
slash SDK so just copy this part until
SDK okay less to the part you don't
require ok so just copy this path until
as dkc user whatever your username is
slash app data slash local slash
androids slash SDK I will copy this and
I will open my file manager and paste
this path there which is C slash user
slash username slash app data slash
local slash Android slash at sticky and
press enter and it will open this SDK
folder in this folder you need to go to
extras so click this extras folder and
inside this extras folder you need to go
inside Intel folder and in this Intel
folder you will see this hardware
accelerated execution manager go inside
this folder and inside this there will
be a installer called intel haxm -
android and the type of this is
application so it's a executable file
you need to run this and while running
this you may encounter some problem that
it's not compatible this hardware
accelerated execution manager or intel
is not compatible so if you find some
error while executing this problem right
now I'm not getting any error while
running but if you find any problem
while running this executable file most
probably you need to go to your control
panel
so search for control panel and in this
control panel go to programs so go to
programs and in here go to programs and
feature and in this program since
feature you need to click turn Windows
Features on or off so click this turn
window
feature on or off and in here make sure
that your hyper-v option is unchecked so
it will open some of the options or some
logo features which are which you can
enable or disable so you can see here
there is an option called hyper - V okay
and it's unchecked in my case so if it's
not unchecked you need to uncheck it if
and only if this executable file which
is hardware accelerated execution
manager gives you some problem if it
doesn't give you something this problem
you don't need to do anything right so
you just make sure that this hyper-v is
unchecked and if it's unchecked or if
it's checked you need to uncheck it and
restart your computer and then only it
will work okay so make it unchecked and
then restart your computer ok and I'm
going to close this and I will go
further with this installer which is
Intel hardware accelerated executables
file next and everything is ok you just
need to click Next buttons make sure or
note this value which is default for
hardware accelerated execution manager
which is 1 0 to 4 ok so make please make
a note of this value which is 1 GB or 1
0 to 4 MB in my case click Next and
install and it will install this haxm
manager it will not take much time it's
finished uncheck this and click finish
so now this intel haxm - Android is
installed in my system and now I'm going
to run my program but before running
this pro
we need to make sure one more thing so
just go to your AVD manager here just
click this AVD manager and in here
hopefully this will be your default
device which is nexus whatever version
of nexus this is the default which
Android manager gives you or Android
studio gives you right go to this added
this AVD or click this pencil button
here and go to app show advanced
settings and make sure that this value
which is RAM value this one is one zero
two four also so the value should match
so we when we ran this program which is
intel haxm the value was 1 0 to 4 mb
right so make sure I'm going to exit
this make sure that this value is also 1
0 to 4 MB so it's in your add one
setting and in here scroll down and go
to Ram and make sure it's 1 0 to 4 MB so
it they the value of actually X manager
and this Ram should match click finish
and it will create or update our a DVD
manager and once it updates we are going
to run our program once again and we
will see if the problem is solved or not
so I will click OK and so we can we are
seeing the same message now we are going
to run our program once again and let's
see the message after you know editing
or installing this one and editing our
abd device so it's preparing our
executable file it will give us the
launcher or launch a meetin later I will
choose the default one which we have
edited and now see the message here
hopefully we will see the message that
now this is running this emulator is
running
so now it says that hjx is working an
emulator runs in fast virtual mode so
now our application is running
successfully right and we can see that
emulator has been started and now your
application will run normally so in this
way you can solve this hjx related
problem I hope you have enjoyed this
