cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
use line edit as a password field so if
you remember we have made this login
kind of a simple login kind of
application and in which we were
entering user name and password
right so let me run the program and let
me show you what the simple problem is
so we can give the user name here and
the password here right but the password
which we are entering here is visible to
the user so that if the other user wants
to see the password he can easily see
this password and we want to hide this
password so we want to make this line
edit as a password field so we can see
some kind of character which replaces
the original you know letters like for
example some kind of dot or some kind of
special character so let's see how we
can do it so what we can do is we can go
to the line added which we want to
convert to password field and then go to
the property section here and search for
the property called eco mode it's inside
this line added category so just search
for the Eco mode which is you can see
this property by default line add it has
Eco mode normal but you can change it to
password field
okay so just change it to password field
and it's going to make your line edit as
password field so let's run our app once
again and save all changes and run it
and whenever we run our application once
again and when we give the username for
example test and the password if you
remember was also test and when I give
this password test it shows these kind
of dot and it hides my you know password
and replaces my
you know password character with these
dots right so in this way you can
convert your line edit into password
field this is a simple concept but I
thought maybe important for you so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
