tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are loops and we will also see how
to use while loop which is the most
basic kind of loop in Java so first of
all what is a loop a loop is a piece of
code or statement which executes some
block of code again and again until some
condition is met so for example you want
to execute some block of code again and
again in Java without rewriting it loop
will help you to do exactly the same now
I will give you an example for example I
have an integer which I initialized it
by a zero and let's see first of all
what is the basic syntax of while loop
while loop as the name suggests use the
keyword while and then these round
brackets and then these curly braces we
will use to execute your statement here
comes the condition it can be true or
false whenever this condition is true it
executes your code here and as soon as
this condition becomes false then this
loop will break so for example I want to
check whether the value of a is less
than 10 or not okay and right now I have
initialized it by 0 so obviously it is
less than 10 then whatever I write here
will be executed okay it will execute
execute execute forever if I do not
change the value of a ok so this can be
an infinite loop if I for example write
system dot out dot print line and I just
print the value of a here okay this will
become an infinite loop okay
infinite loops are also useful if you
know how to use them but right now we
will see how to use this condition more
effectively so for example I print the
value of a and then I increase it by one
like this so then I run the program here
and what it did it did the same you know
execution of code again and again unless
test condition has met so what this code
has done initially the value of 0 value
of a was 0 so it has printed the value
of a here as 0 because 0 is less than 10
right then it increased the value of a
by 1 and now the value of a became 1
okay and then it goes here once again
and 1 is less than 10 then it prints the
value of a once again and it prints 1
here and it executes the same statement
again and again and again and it
increases the value of a again and again
until the value of a becomes 10 so it
printed the value of a until 9 but when
the value of a becomes 10 here 10 is not
less than 10 then the condition is false
and we will go out of the loop and
program is terminated right in the same
way if you do something like this is
less than or equal to this will print
the value of a
until then so let us execute the program
and you can see it printed zero to ten
okay
and we have done using only a single
line of code we have printed these ten
or eleven values using a single line of
code using this loop right
we are just increment or incrementing
the value of a and on the basis of this
we are changing the value of a and then
we are checking these conditions this
will work up Oh in opposite direction
also for example a is greater than or
equal to 10 let's initialize a by 10 and
if a is greater than or equal to 10 we
want to print the value of a and here we
can just minus the value of a by 1 and
once again run the program and it will
print a is equal to 10 but here when you
change it to for example 0 or 1 let's
see what happens
it has printed the value from 10 to 1 in
decreasing order okay so you can do or
execute your code like this also so what
basically this while loop is doing is
it's executing the code or this single
line or these two lines again and again
until and unless this condition is true
so if this condition is true this
statement will be executed as soon as
this condition becomes false the while
loop will break and it will go out of
the loop
ok so this is the basic concept of loop
I hope you have understood the basic
concept
in the next video we will see some more
kind of loops so stay tuned and please
