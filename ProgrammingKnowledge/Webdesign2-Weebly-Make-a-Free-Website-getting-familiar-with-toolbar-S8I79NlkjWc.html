the last video I have shown you how to
sign up in the vbe website and how to
create your domain name and then create
your title in this video I will show you
how to use these tool bars options to
make your website and get started with
your website so before showing these
things to you first thing I want to let
you know is if you cancelled this
website last time like this then what
you need to do is go into your email id
which you have provided to log in and
you can see this mail from Weebly and on
top of this mail when you open it's
showing auto log-in if you don't auto
log in if you don't click this auto
log-in it will not create your website
so if you haven't done that just go to
your email id and just click this auto
login button and then you will reach
this Weebly website and here you can see
website and if you can if you click this
option
for added you can start editing your
website or you want to make another
website from here
sorry from here you can just stick and
you can make another website you want to
make so maximum of two website you can
make for free using one email ID I will
just delete the site so I will be having
only one website which I have created in
the last video so here is my website
programming knowledge don't be bleep
calm and I click Edit here it's taking
some time to open and yeah so last time
provided a title to my side and this
small title to my site and if I haven't
described you that this now I will
describe so this toolbar looks like this
and from if you go you can click basic
and you can drag these options and
release it there and you can provide
your title so for example I will provide
my title
from here so it's just drag-and-drop and
this is also one important option custom
HTML I will be showing you some HTML
codes also simple HTML codes which will
do JavaScript and HTML so it could be
able to launch some STS and we'll stop
from this website making site also this
is the basic toolbar if you go to
multimedia you can see you can add
photos slideshows files and maps and
YouTube videos also if you go to design
here you can choose your design which is
best what you do for your website like
this if I choose my website will look
like this if I choose this like this so
it's up to you what design you want to
choose people yes so many design options
in the third tab
it's a page tab and in this I only have
one page but in the future I will show
you how to create more pages here and
then it has editor which I will show you
in future and then it has setting
options so if you want you can change
your website name by clicking here
change site name and if it's available
on me me then you can change your
website name you can even change your
title you can also upload your fabric
favicon
this is a pro option so you need to pay
for it
so right now I just want to make a three
websites I want
I don't go for these options and it has
other options also search engine
optimization and Google Analytics
tracing code also and had a good so if
you are if you have your account in
Google Analytics you can just paste your
code and you can see your traffic and
other features also here ecommerce
setting if you are lucky enough and your
website is visited by thousands or
millions of viewers then you can earn
money from this Weebly website that I
will also show you in future for mobiles
option if you want to enable then you
can choose this option and you can even
download your code of the website so if
some so crashes if some Weebly server
crashes
then you have the code of your website
so you can even save your code for the
web site from here it's the back best
very good options and probably you must
save this every month in order to save
your work so I will go to the basic and
here is the option to own revenue so if
you want to on something you can add
Google Adsense to your account
this will also I will show you in future
and there are some more
like feed reader or you can add your
contact form or button block code and
online polls so many things you can add
to your website so here is my title and
you know I want to give this description
whatever I want to give so just drag and
drop these options and start in your
post page descriptions and all so that's
all for this video I hope you've learned
something new this time and please rate
