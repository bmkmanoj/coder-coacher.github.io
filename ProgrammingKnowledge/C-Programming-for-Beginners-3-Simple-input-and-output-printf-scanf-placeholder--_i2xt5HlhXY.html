shown you how to create your first C
program and I have also explained you
this code line by line to you now in
this video I am going to further explain
you how to use these inputs and outputs
like printf and other things in C so in
the last video I have shown you that
this print app we can use it to print
any value to the terminal so whenever we
run this code we will see that hello
world which is inside the printf
function brackets is printed and this /n
just changes the next line so for
example I want to print hello world look
three times 1 2 3 and I will just build
and run my program maybe it will be
printed three times hello world and in
the next line hello world and in the
next line hello world but if you want to
print this hello world again and again
without any line break you can just
remove the /n so I will remove the /n
here and then I will just run my program
and I can see this hello world is
printed three times in one line so this
/n changes the line now for example you
want to print some number how can you do
this for so first idea which may come
into your mind is just write a number
for example printf 42 but let's compile
this program for it says some warning
and when I run the program it will not
run and we give you some error because
this is not how you print a number
- in order to a print a number you need
to use a special place holder so for
example I want to print 32 here I need
to give uh place holder so just in your
print app function in these bracket just
give two double quotes and a comma and
then give a percentage sign so give this
percentage sign and then B and I will
explain you what the percentage D is but
let's first try to or build and run our
program and prints 32 now % is D here is
called a place holder what this is
called it's called a place holder and it
literally means that percentage D is
going to hold the place for the integer
d stands for integer so if you write D
it will appear hold an integer if you
want to print a decimal value then there
is a special character called F which
then for float and then you can print a
decimal value for example 32.2 so when I
build the program it can print 32 points
to 0 now for example you just write here
presented B but you want to print 32
point - let's see what happens it
doesn't print this number because this
is a decimal value but we are providing
the integer placeholder to hold the
decimal value which is not valid so you
always have to remember that you need to
keep in mind what kind of value you want
to print
now with this placeholder you can add
your text also so for example I want to
print the text with this placeholder
that the number is equal to and then
write your placeholder so this
placeholder will be replaced by 32 here
so just imagine like this it will print
the number is and whatever here it will
be replaced by the number or the value
you right after this
comma okay and when I run the program it
will print the number is equal to 32
okay
now in order to print multiple decimal
what you need to do is you just need to
give multiple placeholder just space for
example I want to print some value with
separated by a space you just need to
just copy and paste it three times and
then after comma just provide other
values you want to print because we have
written percentage D free time and keep
in mind here this is space so it will be
printed
42 space 58 space 5 let's try and run
the program and 32:58 m5 right now there
are different kind of data you can print
for example I have shown you how to
print this that's decimal it will print
the our decimal value one decimal value
right now in order to I will just copy
this and paste it on this one
but I want to copy this whole string and
paste it here I don't know why it's not
copy
right leg and if there is a copy of you
copy it copy and right click and wait
right so I will just copy this once
again and try to paste it once again and
for example I want to print our decimal
value so it will be
replaced by this F which is which sent
off load now in order to print a big
decimal value or large load value you
use a double and double is an F large
rode value in order to print a large
integer value you use L be okay so I
will just write some something here
comment and this comment means double
slash means our comment which I will
explain you later
and basically this comment means that
whatever you right after this comment it
will be not executed by your C program
so this is in teacher and this is large
integer and once again this is our
double value of load value load and
float stand for F right and this will be
large float large pros stand for LF okay
now for example you want to print a
single character do you use percentage C
so I will just write care for the
character and single character you
always enclose it in single quotes okay
for example I want to print C then just
percentage C and then your character
okay or a or whatever for example you
want to print a string string means our
sentence kind of thing so you use
percentage as and then you can just
print hello world here also in double
quotes for example
okay
and inside the stubble you need to print
inside these double quotes and this is
called string okay so this comment I
will show you in the next video how
these comment works but for now just to
understand that this this line after
this double slash will not be executed
okay now there if you want to print some
hexadecimal value you can print it with
this which X okay and for example you
want to print the hexam hexadecimal
value was 16 it will be printed as hex
value okay so I will write hex now I
will run the program but bear in mind
that they will be printed in same line
because we haven't provided this line
break here so we will provide this line
break after every every up line print so
that they will be all printed in
different lines okay different lines and
this world decimal this was largely
female so you can just print a large
number large number can be you can
search for the large decimal limit and
it has some limit and then the load
value and then the large decimal float
value for example this one and the
character is okay string is okay and hex
is okay now we will try to build my
program and run it and it runs first it
prints hello world which is a simple
string then it prints 32 which is a
decimal then it prints big
well you will not bigdecimal but big
integer value which is this one then it
prints the dis load value with half
percentage F then it prints the large
load value which is this big decimal
value then it prints the character a
with a percent this C sign then it
prints the string which is percentage s
and then it prints the hexadecimal value
of 16 which is then hexadecimal value of
16 is then okay so in this way you can
print values using printf function okay
so remember these placeholder values D
for integer LD for large integer F for
decimal values of float values L F for
large load values C for characters as
for string and X 4 hexadecimal values
okay now in order to take the input so
for example you want that user should
the give some input and then you want to
print this input so for example what you
can do is for example you want that the
user should enter some value okay and
then it will be printed on the screen
how can you do that you do that with a
special function called scan half can F
function we generally use to take the
input from the user
okay for example I want to take input
from the user as a string so I will
write percentage s and then comma and
then I can just give
any value here and it will be taken by
this scan app and if you want printed
you can print this value but this we
will see later when we will understand
how variable in C works and how these
data types work see this we are going to
see later but just remember this cannot
use it to input values right now there
is another special function which is
called puts which is like this you es
and it also prints the value to the
screen so for example you want to print
some value R this is my C program you
can print it like this also with by
using print or puts function and when I
run this program it will be running fine
I will close this and compile and run
this and this prints that is my feet
program so in this way you can input and
output a different kind of data using C
on terminal I hope you have enjoyed this
video please rate them in the tribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
