JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will learn about if else
statement in JavaScript and how to use
some of the comparison operators in
JavaScript so let's get started so first
of all why do we need to use FL
statements so sometimes in your code you
need to use some conditions on the basis
of which you want to execute some code
and if-else statement will help you to
do exactly that
so for example I want to check the age
of the person if it's greater than 18
equal to 18 or less than 18 okay so I
have a variable called age whose value
initially I assign is equal to 18 okay
and to check whether it's 18 or it's
below 18 or it's greater than 18 you
want to check it and then execute some
code okay so you can use if statement
for that and the basic syntax for if
statement is if keyword and then these
brackets and then these curly braces and
in here in these round bracket your
condition will be evaluated and if this
condition in these bracket are met then
this code is executed inside these curly
braces okay so let's check the condition
okay so I have this variable called age
and I want to check whether it's equal
to 18 or not so I just give these two
equal to sign and I evaluate against 18
now these double equal to means equality
okay so this is for checking the
equality this single equal to is the
assignment operator right and these
double equal to
is the equality checking operator okay
so if this condition is met then we want
to execute some code for example we want
to print something using document dot
right and we will say the age is equal
to 18 okay and save your code and
refresh your web page here and it says
the age is equal to 18
okay now let's say in the case when this
age is not equal to 18 we want to
execute some other code so in that case
we use else condition so just write else
and then these curly braces okay
so when this condition in if statement
is not true your program logic comes to
as condition and it executes the code
which is inside these curly braces after
else okay so I will just copy this here
and I say age is not equal to 18 and
let's say right now the age is 20 we
assign age is equal to 20 and save it
and refresh your webpage and now it says
age is not equal to 18 okay now not only
you can use equality here you can also
compare non equality for example I want
to compare non equality I give this
exclamation mark and then this equal to
sign and I can save it and I can refresh
my webpage and it says the age is equal
to 18 okay which is here okay so I'm
checking whether my age is not equal to
18 and right now the age is equal to 20
right so it goes here because the
condition is true with because 20 is not
equal to 18 so it prints this statement
okay now there are
few operators which are called
comparison operator which you can use in
place of these equal and non equal signs
okay so let's see what are they so these
are some of the comparison operator we
can use in JavaScript so we have already
seen how to check equality now let's see
what does these triple equal to do okay
so for example I have age is equal to 18
here and I want to check if our age is
equal to 18 obviously this will print
this statement because this condition is
true now we all know that right now
age is a integer variable because we
have assigned a number to it now let's
see and check whether it gives this
statement if we compare this age against
a string value right so just save it and
refresh our webpage and it says the age
is equal to 18 right so right now this
double equal to only checks the value
and not the type of your value but when
you use triple equal to it will check
the value as well as the type of your
variable okay so now let's see what
happens so save it and refresh our page
and now it says the age is not equal to
18 because these triple equal to is
checking whether the value is 18 which
is yes it's 18 but the type is string
right and we are checking it against a
number so then it will go here because
this condition is not met okay so this
is how you can use triple equal to non
equality we have already seen this
exclamation mark with double equal means
we are checking non equality in value
and non equality in type also okay now
the next symbol
is for checking if the value is greater
than the value so for example we can use
these angle brackets and here we use the
number for example 18 once again and
let's change this print message here so
we can say age is greater than 18 and
here we can say age is less than 18 okay
and save your code and refresh your page
and it says age is less than 18 right
which is this statement because in our
case age is equal to 18 and not greater
than 18 right now the next symbol is to
check whether age is greater than or
equal to okay so you can use this and
after this you can use equal to sign and
then it will check if age is greater
than or it is equal to 18 right so save
your code and refresh your webpage and
now it says the ages greater than 18 we
must add this equal to symbol also here
like this so this message is more clear
right now in the same way we have the
less than symbol so whenever you use
here the less than symbol then it checks
whether age is less than or equal to 18
okay so let's save it and refresh your
code and now it says the ages greater
than or equal to 18 which is this
statement okay now let's say you want to
check multiple conditions
so how you can do this so in JavaScript
you can also use nested if-else
statement so for example here I'm
checking if the value is 18 and if the
value is 18 I will say value is equal to
18 and then I also want to check if the
value is greater than 18 or not
so after this curly braces we're
this curly brace and and before the else
condition I can introduce one more if
condition like this and then you can do
something like this and here you can add
a keyword called else okay so it checks
this condition else if this condition is
true then it this statement will be
executed else otherwise this statement
can be executed so let's say we want to
check if age is greater than 18 or not
okay so copy it here and let's replace
with greater than okay and let's say age
is equal to 20 this time okay so refresh
your webpage and now it says the age is
greater than 18 so what is our program
flow our program goes to if condition
and checks where the 20 is equal to 18
or not which is not so it goes to next
step and it checks this condition and
check whether 20 is greater than 18 or
not which is true so it executes this
statement and it don't need to go to the
third statement because this is already
true right so in this way you can also
use if-else statement in nested format
okay so in this way you can use FL
statement in JavaScript and you can use
these comparison operators in JavaScript
