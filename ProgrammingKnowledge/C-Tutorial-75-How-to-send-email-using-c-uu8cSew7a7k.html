video I will show you how to send an
email with the help of your see shop
windows form application so it can be
any email service you can use you can
use Gmail Yahoo or any big Claire which
provides email services so it's not
bound to any one particular email
service so what I have done is I have
taken these text box labels and a rich
box and the button so first of all I
have taken a rich text box from here
just drag-and-drop here and this is for
body of my email so this in this rich
text box I will write the body of my
email and I named this rich text box as
body itself B or D Y and in a similar
way I have taken six text boxes and six
labels and I change the text of the
labels according to the functionality of
the text boxes so take labels from your
toolbar tool box and drag and drop here
six labels and change their text as from
to subject SMTP server username and
password and takes it six text boxes
from here text boxes drag and drop and
name them as first is four from text box
so I named this text box as from second
is for two so I name this text box as to
third is for subject so I name this text
box as subject fourth is for SMTP server
so I named this as SMTP
fifth is for username so I named this
text box as username and sixth is for
password so I named this text box as
password and I have taken um button and
I change its text as send okay so these
six text boxes six labels one rich text
box and one button these things you
should take and just change the labels
and the names now we will go to the code
just double click the send button and go
above your code and in here you need to
declare these two namespaces first is
using system dot web and second is using
system dotnet dot mil so just declare
these two namespaces above your code now
just below that we need to define
something for the password because I
have taken here if you can see a
password field and you don't want to
show your password or user don't want to
show his or her password to the outside
world so what I have done is in this
code section I went to the main form
public forum name so my form name is
form 1 so I go here this in this public
method where my initialize component
function is there so every form code
contains this initialize component
function so search for this initialize
component in your form declaration and
in here I have provided some character
instead of the
a real character so this is the name of
my text box for password so this text
box and the name of this text box is
password okay so I copied this password
text and I go to the code and I paste it
here dot password Care is equal to
single quote and inside whatever
character you want to show instead of
your real characters okay so I want to
show this star sign or a strict sign
instead of my real character or password
so just write this line where your
initialized component function is there
okay just one line so this will hide
your password from the outside world now
once again we go to the main form and we
go to the this button and double click
this button and in here I have written
my code for sending the email so first
thing you need to declare is this map
mail message object is equal to mail
give it any variable name I named it as
mail is equal to new mail message and
inside this bracket I am passing for
argument first is from argument so I
copied the name of my from text box so
my from text box name is from and I have
passed it here from dot text so it it it
will take the text from my from text box
and it will pass here as a first
argument in the same way I have taken
the name of my two text box and dot text
so it will pass whatever
is present in my to text box it will
pass as a second argument comma third is
the subject textbox so subject dot text
this will pass the subject of my email
and fourth is the body so this is the
name of my rich text box body dot text
so it will take the body of the text and
pass it as a fourth argument so I first
write this line of code which takes four
argument from two subject and body now
we will declare us SMTP client which
will take the SMTP so so write SMTP
client client is equal to new SMTP
client and in the bracket you need to
pass whatever you will write in the SMTP
text box so this is the SMTP server text
box so just copy the name of this SMTP
text box in my case SMTP and in the code
just pass it here dot text okay okay so
this will take the SMTP server name for
your email service for example you are
using Gmail in the case of Gmail it's
smtp.gmail.com or in the case of yahoo
it's SMTP dot-com so if you don't know
the SMTP setting of your email provider
just go to your google search and write
the name of your SMTP provider for
example Gmail so I write Gmail SMTP
settings and it gives me some links that
provides Gmail's SMTP settings so when I
click one link it opens the
things and it gives the details so it
takes the server name as this it takes
the username as the username of the
gmail address it takes the password as
gmail password and the port number it
will give and the SSL or TLS requirement
Gmail in case of Gmail HCS okay so all
these information you can find on
internet so I'm using this information
here so here write your SMTP textbox
name dot txt now just copy this line
variable paste it here dot port is equal
to 587 so this is specifically for Gmail
so when I searched on the internet it
uses these port 465 port or 587 so I am
using this 587 'the port this is for
gmail specific meals okay so this is for
gmail 587 port now once again copy your
client variable paste it here dot client
credential is equal to new system dot
net dot network credential and then here
we will pass the username and password
so I copied the name of my username text
field which is username itself and this
I have copied and pasted here here dot
text comma password text box name dot
text okay and next
once again copy this line
dot enable SSL is equal to true why I
have taken this because when I see the
Gmail settings
it says Gmail SMTP TLS or SSL is equal
to yes that's why I have taken this
enable SSS SSL as true and then in the
last step you just copy this client dot
send and in the bracket just pass this
mail message variable here and if you
want you can show it in the message that
your message has been sent
so just pass your success I mean your
message text success or messages send or
whatever message you want to show once
your mail is send ok so just write this
code for sending your email if you want
you can pause the video and copy this
code and now we are going to run this
program so run and in here I am going to
pass some values so first is from so
from is the email ID from from where you
want to send the email so I write my
email ID from which I want to send the
email and to is the email idea to which
you want to send the email so in this
case also I will write the same email id
because I want to send the email to the
same email you can change it whatever
you like to which you want to send your
email then the subject so I will give
subject as test email
then the SMTP server name so in my case
because I am using Gmail you can see
here smtp.gmail.com so this is the SMTP
server name so sm t P dot G mail.com
then the user name so when I you can see
in the settings the username is same as
the gmail address for Gmail okay so I
will add here the same email id which I
have in the from textbox and here I will
give the password so just see here it
will not give your original password
which you are tapping but instead of
your password it gives the star sign
because we have set the settings not to
show our password so I write my password
and then I will give some content so I
you cube
leave
subscribe and some some text whatever
you want to learn right okay now I want
to send this so I will just click this
send button and my message comes my mail
is send so now let's see if my mail is
sent or not so I will go to my email id
and yes my email id I'm I received this
email on my email id so in this way you
can send an email with the help of your
see shop windows form application in the
next video I will show you how to attach
attachment with your emails so stay
tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
