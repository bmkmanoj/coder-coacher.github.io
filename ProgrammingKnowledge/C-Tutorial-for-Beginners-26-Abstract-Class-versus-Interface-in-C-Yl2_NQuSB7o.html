video I am going to show you the
difference between interfaces and
abstract classes so let's see the
differences between abstract classes and
interfaces first of all first difference
between interface and abstract class is
interface supports multiple inheritance
whereas abstract classes that does not
support multiple inheritance so let's
see what this mean so in the earlier
videos I have shown you that if you
define two interface says metre I meter
one or and I meter two you can inherit
from both the interfaces like this meter
1 comma meter to write and this is valid
so you can inherit from multiple
interfaces but on the other hand if you
want to inherit from a class normally
loss or abstract class doesn't matter
you cannot inherit from multiple base
classes ok for example you want to do
something like this or and you have one
more class meter one you cannot write
like this okay so interfaces support
multiple inheritance
whereas abstract classes does not the
second difference is interfaces does not
contain data members of fields and
abstract classes contains data members
so let's see what this mean your
interface when I define for example I
want to define some field in or int ABC
for example some some some feel it's not
allowed in interface when you compile
this program it will give you an error
because you cannot define fields in
interfaces on the other hand if you want
to define fields in abstract classes you
can do so so you can just define public
in ABC and when you compile a program
that will compile fine this error is not
for this field but you we I haven't
provided the implementation of this
abstract class so this error is for that
but you can define these fields for
abstract classes and you cannot define
fields for interfaces right the third
difference is interfaces doesn't have
constructor and abstract classes have
constructor right so it's easy by
definition only you can see a class can
have constructor right but in the
interface is not a class and in that's
why it doesn't have constructor okay
the fourth difference is interface
contains only incomplete members where
as obscure abstract classes can contain
incomplete member or complete members so
in the earlier videos I have shown you
that your interface for example this
only contains the incomplete member you
cannot derive or define the definition
of this print meter or other definition
inside your interface you cannot define
the definition of this method inside
your interface right but on the other
hand your abstract class can contain
this kind of a method for example print
meter which like this and which can have
definition if it's not an abstract
method okay so you can have normal
method inside or abstract class which
can have definitions you can just print
any message here right but you cannot
provide definition or source code inside
your interface method okay the fifth
difference is an interface can have
access modifiers by default
that means all interface
access more members are public okay so
interface cannot have access modifier on
the other hand your abstract classes can
have access modifiers swaps function
properties so you can see these method
declaration and you can easily say that
this X is specify a public you can have
access specifier in the abstract member
declaration but when you try to define
this or when you try to give public
specifier to interface method it's not
valid okay and let's see the last
difference the member of interface can
be cannot be static right but only
complete members of abstract class have
a static method that means you cannot
define your interface method like this
static okay it doesn't it's not allowed
but on the other hand I can have static
method inside my abstract class if it's
not our abstract method this cannot have
static member or this cannot be declared
as like this because this should be
starting so if this abstract method
cannot be defined as static but if you
define a normal method inside a abstract
class it can be static method right so
this should be not like this but here
static comes and it's totally valid but
if your abstract class have abstract
method this can not be starting but
normal method inside a abstract class
can be can be declared as static so
these are some of the differences or you
can say interface versus class
differences
