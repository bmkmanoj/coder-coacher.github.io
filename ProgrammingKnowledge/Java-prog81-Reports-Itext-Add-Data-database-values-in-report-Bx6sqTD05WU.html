we have made reports and we have learned
in previous videos that how we can make
tables lists how we can insert the
pictures in the report how to give date
and title and now today I will show you
how to insert your database values into
your report so suppose in this table you
want to insert the values of for example
employee ID last name and all these
values so how can we do that I will show
you today so let's get started we have
in our program employee ID name surname
and age and maybe the gender also we
will add into our report so we will go
to the program and go to the report code
this was the code here written in
previous videos so in here at the top of
your method what will you do you will
declare
string value 1 is equal to what is this
we are taking whatever in this text
field we are taking it in the form of
string so we will copy the variable name
with this text employee ID and paste
here dot get text in the same way we
will take name surname age and gender so
I have already done that you can do like
this so you just have to take the values
in the text field and take it into the
string variable so these variable we
could be able to insert into our table
into a report table as we say so now
when you've done when you are done with
this just copy this variable and
wherever you have written your table
code of the report this I have shown you
in the previous videos you can go there
and after this employee ID I am what I
am doing is in the next cell I am
placing my value
so just after employee-id I could be
able to see my employee ID actual value
in the same way I can take all the
values I think I have done some mistake
in copying the variable I have to change
these variable according to the text
field so my name text field is text name
text so name text field name is text me
so like this and these values this is
for name I will go to my name text field
table and I will paste it in the next
cell just below my name so in the same
manga I will do it for all the values
age and age I have taken into my both
variables
what were you yes so you can you can do
that and let's see our program works or
not so I run my program and I will go to
the report I will click report my report
is saved but one thing you have you
could notice that I haven't click any of
the values in the table so nothing is
shown here in my text field so till
nothing is in your text field your
report will also not show those values
see these values are not shown but for
example I choose one value Paul Martin
here employee ID is shown
Paul is shown Martine and age is shown
and I will click the report and I press
ok then you can see employee ID one
named Paul last name Martin and age 22
so in this way you can insert your
values database values you can you just
have to take these values in string or
number variables and you can just place
these values or variables into the
tables code so it's not very tough I
think I think you understand the logic
so you could be able to do these simple
stuff
in next video I will show you how to
save your graph in the form of PNG I am
talking about J pre chart we have
learned some days back and now I will
show you how to convert these graph into
the PNG file and after that I will show
you how to show that into the report so
thanks for now and please rate comment
