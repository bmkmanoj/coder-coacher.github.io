last video I have shown you how to use
classes and objects in C++ and I've also
shown you how you can access your member
variables in your main function using
objects now in this video I am going to
show you a good practice to access your
member variables in your main function
in the last video I have shown you you
can use this public access specifier to
access functions or variables in your
main function it works correctly but
it's not a good practice to access your
member variables of a class directly in
your main function because you always
want to protect your variable and you
don't want that other user would be able
to change these variable contain content
so now in this video I'm going to show
you the concept of setter and getter
functions to access the variable
indirectly
in your main function so I will delete
this this declaration and I have the
basic declaration of this book class and
I have the basic declaration of book
object here now in the last video I've
shown you how you can use this public
access specifier in this video I am
going to show you this private access
specifier and what this private means is
your whatever you declare under this
private access specifier all those
member will be private to what last and
you cannot use these member variables on
member functions outside your class so I
will declare a variable called string
variable so I will add one more library
called include
string okay and this what this string
class will do is it will help us to
declare string variables so there is
something called string and I will name
my stringers name this will be the book
name right and this string is just like
character array but it is handled more
easily or efficiently right so string is
nothing but just writing the book name
is you can give the value to the string
like this it is equal to like this
okay so string is nothing but the string
of the word right now this is our
private member of this book class and
how can I access this name in my member
main function because this is a private
and I cannot use this name variable
outside my class I have already told you
so
let me declare that setter and getter
function for it to access the name
variable indirectly so what I will do is
I will declare our declare a function
called void set name and in here I will
pass this string variable and I will
call it for example X right
and what I am going to do here is I will
say my name which is my private member
of class is equal to X so what I am
doing is indirectly copying the whatever
I will I will give here as a set
variable it will just copy the content
of X to my name right and there is
something called get function so I will
write get name and this cat named will
return the value of name okay so this
will return the name so name data type
is string so it will return string and
it's just returning this name so just
write return name okay this these two
are called setting and getting off your
member variable set a getter function in
easy words and what these two functions
does is it enables us to access the
content of your private number name
using these public functions that add
and get names now I will show you how
you can use these set and get names in
your main function so you already have
this object called book 1 which we
derived from books last right and we can
call this side function so I will say
book 1 dot set name and inside this set
name we can set any name to our book so
I will say set name to the book C++
tutorials okay and now I want to access
so what this does is
whenever I pass the string to the set
function it has this string here and it
just copies this string to your name
variable which is my private variable
right now private it is assigned the
value C++ tutorial indirectly right and
now in order to get or in order to print
this value what I can do is I can use
book 1 dot get name and what this get
named thus is it just returned the value
of name so we are indirectly accessing
the value of name and returning so let's
print this value I will write C out and
I will just copy this function here and
paste it here because it's returning the
string right so it will return the value
we have assigned here and I will say and
L and when I compile this program we
compiled and now we are going to run
this program and we see that we are able
to access this name where you will using
this book dot get name so this is the
good practice to use what to access
private member variables of class using
get and set functions so just always
remember this practice whenever you need
to declare variable inside class try
making them private right as far as
possible try always declare the member
variable private and try to access these
variable using set and get class so you
will never mess up or in C++ I hope you
