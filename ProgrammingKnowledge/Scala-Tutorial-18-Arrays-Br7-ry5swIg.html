scholar tutorial for beginners in this
video we'll learn about arrays in Scala
so first of all what is an array so
array is a data structure which can
store fixed size sequential elements of
same data type so the keyword fixed size
and the same data type is important to
note here so arrays can store the data
types or collections of same data types
right so let's see how we can use or
declare an array so you can just write
var or well and then your variable name
my array for example and then the type
of the variable so the type of variable
is array in our case and then the type
of array which type of array we want to
create so you can create any data type
array for example int or double or
string or any kind of data type and then
you just define the size of array using
a new array keyword right so you just
write new array and then in the bracket
once again that type of array and then
you can just give the size of the array
using this parentheses and then inside
the parentheses you define the size of
the array right now the second way of
declaring an array is you can just write
array my array two for example and then
you can directly assign the size of an
array using new array and then the data
type you give here for example int and
this time let's say we just define the
array of size five now you can assign
the value to an array element using the
indexes so you just need to give the
name of your array my array for example
and then index starts from zero so Scala
arrays are zero indexed that means they
start from zero and then you can assign
any value to this element so the element
at 0th position we have assigned 20
value to it right in the same way you
can assign for example and then you can
assign these values to your area right
and then to just to print the values of
the array you can just use print line
and let's save it and let's run the code
and you can see it's not really
convenient to use the array inside print
line so what we are going to do is we
are going to use a for loop to print the
elements inside the array so you can
just write for and then first of all the
value and then whatever array you want
to iterate on so you just use these
arrow symbol and then for example my
array your array name and then inside
these curly brackets you can use the
print line and you can write X here
right this means that you are iterating
over the array which starts from 0 to
the index 3 right so let's run the code
and you can see it iterates over the
array and then it prints the value of
every element inside the array there is
one more way of iterating over an array
and this is using the conventional type
of for loop so you define I here and
then you start the I from zero and then
the length of the array so you
get the length of the array using length
method so just use your variable dot
length okay and this will give the
length of an array and because arrays
are zero indexed that means the value of
array starts from zero index so we need
to minus one from the length so that it
goes up to three index right and then
inside the brackets you can once again
use the print line function to print
your value so this time you just need to
use or or your array and then I will
give you the index of your array
starting from zero until three which is
my array length which is four minus one
so up to three okay and then once you
run your program it will give the same
result as the above for loop let me just
move this console to the right-hand side
so we can see the code in a better way
so now if you're having to assign any
value to an array so in our secondary
example my array two we have assigned
the size to an array and the type to an
array but we haven't assigned any value
to the array to so how it looks like so
I'm going to use array 2 instead of my
array and let's see what it prints so
you can see it prints the 0 0 0 0 so it
prints the default value of that data
type right so for example if it's a
string and we run the program it's going
to print null the default value of that
data type if we write double here and
then run the code it's going to print 0
point 0 which is the default value of
double if we define boolean data type
here and then run the code it's going to
just print the false which is the
default value of
the boolean so if you haven't assigned
any value to your array element is going
to take the default value of that data
type now there is one more way of
defining an array so you can write Bal
or bar and then my array is equal to
array and then you can directly
initialize the array by the values for
example 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 or any
number right or if it's a string then
you just need to give the string values
here let's define this array as array 3
and let's print the size of the array or
length of the array so my array 3 dot
length and let's run the code and you
can see the length of the array is 7 so
you can define the arrays like this also
now if you want to concatenate an array
what you can do is you can use the
concat method on the array so you can
just write con cat and then the first
array and the second array so for
example we want to concatenate my array
and my array 3 ok so like this you just
need to use concat method and then you
just need to use your arrays which have
the same data type now you can see it
gives concat not found error so for that
you just need to import the array
library so just write import array dot
underscore ok and this is going to solve
this concat problem right and let's say
Val result is equal to whatever the
concatenation of array and array 3 is
okay and let's print the
are a result using the for loop and
let's run the code and you can see it
concatenates are a 1 and the are a 3 and
there are different methods are
associated with arrays so you can just
write the name of your variable and then
just use dot to see whichever method are
available for your array so you can see
when you just write dot here you can see
using installations what are the methods
which are available for arrays so you
can see these are all the method which
are available for the array so there is
a sizeof array for example or there is a
method called last which will give you
the last value of array or the maximum
value which is max method you can see a
min method max method and there are so
many method related to array so you can
just see the definition or how they can
be used here and then use those methods
on your arrays easily right so this is
how you can use arrays in Scala I hope
