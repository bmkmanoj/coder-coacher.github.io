WPF tutorial for beginners using Visual
Basic WP f stands for windows
presentation foundation which is
relatively new and which can be seen as
an alternative for windows forum
applications using WPF we can create
really interactive UIs or user
interfaces so let's see how we can
create our first WPF project using
Visual Basic so just open your Visual
Studio I downloaded Visual Studio
Express from their website and then just
go to file and go to new project and in
here you will be able to see different
categories you can make WPF project in
c-sharp or in Visual Basic and this time
we are going to use Visual Basic so
select this category Visual Basic and
choose WPF application from here you can
give any name to your application by
default WPF application is the name of
your project but you can change this
name also and the project location is
the default location selected by the
visual studio for you and this also you
can change I will leave everything as
default and I will click OK just make
sure that this WPF application is
highlighted when you select or create
your program click OK and will create
your first WPF application
you
so now our project is open and we can
see in our solution Explorer our project
name is there and in here some of the
default files are already created by
Windows or Visual Studio for us and you
can see the there is a file called main
window dot sam'l sam'l stands for
extensible application markup language
which is a kind of markup language which
we can use to create our UIs and in here
you can see this sam'l structure so I
will just drag this output output a
little bit down and this little bit up
and this is George Samuel files just
whenever you select the sam'l file here
is the you know zamel file behind this
UI okay so you can see there is a
Windows tag here and inside there is a
grid okay so this is our main window
which is indicated by these tags opening
and closing tags and here inside this
opening and closing tags there is a grid
which is this one okay and this is
really useful when you want to you know
have full control over user interface
and you will be able to see what's
happening behind your interface so for
example I want to change the title of
this this you is from main window to my
first G Y G Y stands for graphical user
interface and in here you will be able
to see in the title the title of your UI
is changed now okay so in this way you
can use this zamel file to edit the
property of your UI or either
the alternative option is you can select
your component or tag from here and
change the properties from here and they
will be implemented in here also okay so
there are two ways of doing this now you
will be able to see our tool box on the
left and of your editor here you can see
tool box whenever you click this and you
can pin this tool box from here so there
is a small pin symbol here and which you
can just click and your tool box will be
you know permanently pinned here and in
here you will be able to see common WPF
controls which you can use all which you
can drag and drop into your graphical
user interface and use them to create
interactive uisce so for example I will
drag and drop a button here and what I
want to do with the button is I can
resize it so whatever I you know I have
dragged and dropped this button into my
main window and you will be able to see
in this zamel file this button tag is
added with its properties right so you
can go to the properties here and you
can change the properties of this button
for example you can change the text size
or some other properties like for
example I want to change the content or
to the display text on this button for
example click me and press Enter and
these changes will be you know image
Italy reflected in your example file so
now you can see the button is showing
click me and in here in the button
content in the saml file you will be
able to see this text here ok or you if
you want to change your property of
these this button from your zamel file
itself you can change it from here
itself for example click button and this
will be
change in your UI and here also so it's
on you from where you want to change the
properties you can go change the
properties from this property tab or
dryer directly from the sam'l file or
you know from this UI also okay now for
example I want to add some functionality
to this button I can just double click
this button and we will reach to the
main window dot sam'l dot Phoebe file
which is a visual basic file which is
responsible for the real you know code
behind for this button action perform
and inside in between this my click
button action perform I can write some
code ok so inside this method private
sub my click which is the name of my
button I can just print message box and
I can show some message inside this
measured message box so inside this mesh
message box I can just write for example
hello world okay and then I can run this
button run this program so just click
this start button from here and our
program will be compiled and run so now
our program is running you can see our
title on this interface my first GUI
which we have changed and when I click
this click button I can see this message
hello world which we have just written
the code of ok so that's it for this
video and the further videos we will see
more how we can use this GUI to make
some you know really interesting
projects so I hope you have enjoyed this
