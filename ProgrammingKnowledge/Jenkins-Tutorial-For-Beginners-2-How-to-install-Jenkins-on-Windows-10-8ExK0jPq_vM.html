you how you can download and install
Jenkins on your Windows 10 operating
system so first of all let's talk about
the prerequisite of installing Jenkins
on your Windows 10 operating system in
order to install Jenkins you need to
have Java 7 or above so make sure you
have the latest version of Java and then
once you have Java installed then you
are ready to install Jenkins
so I have already installed Java 10 on
my Windows 10 operating system and I'm
assuming that you also have the latest
version of Java so once you have Java
installed just open your favorite
browser and search for Jenkins and the
first language will appear here will be
from Jenkins dot IO so we are going to
click on this link so once you are on
this Jenkins website you just need to
click on the Downloads button here and
on the downloads page you just need to
scroll down a little don't click on
downloads yet we are going to see which
are the versions which are available for
Jenkins so when you scroll down you will
see different versions of Jenkins one is
the LTS version and other is the weekly
release so we are going to use the long
term support version and the latest
version is 2.10 7.2 and in here we are
going to choose the windows option so
here you will see the windows option now
one thing you need to keep in mind is
when you are installing Jenkins on
Windows it is good to run Jenkins as a
service so it starts automatically
without requiring any user to log in the
easiest way to install Jenkins on
Windows is by using Windows installer
but if you are an advanced user you can
also download the Jenkins food war file
and then you can deploy it on servlets
like GlassFish or tomcat but for our
purpose we want to just learn so we are
going to use the windows installer so
I'm going to just click on windows here
and once you click on windows option you
will see
this message which says thank you for
downloading windows stable installer and
you can see here if you download it as a
zip file so I'm going to wait for the
download to complete so now the download
of this zip file is completed so I'm
going to minimize the browser and I'm
going to go to my downloads folder where
I have downloaded this zip file and now
I'm going to just open this zip file and
in here I will be able to see this
windows installer package so I'm going
to double click on this windows
installer package which is going to
start the Jenkins installation so I'm
going to minimize this folder Explorer
and you can see Jenkins 2.10 7.2 setup
window so on this welcome window we
don't need to do anything we just need
to click Next here and this will be the
default location where Jenkins will be
installed so if you don't have the good
reason to change it just leave it as
default and then click Next and then
click install and then just click yes
which is going to start installing
Jenkins and in the end you will see this
message which says completed the Jenkins
setup wizard click finish button to exit
the setup wizard so I'm going to click
finish
so now Jenkins is installed on your
system and it will ask in which browser
you want to open it so I'm going to
click on Google Chrome and you can see
on a port localhost 8080 you will be
able to see this kind of window so if
this window doesn't open automatically
you just need to go to your favorite
browser and then just write localhost
colon 8080 so let's copy this here and
just paste it here so HTTP colon forward
slash forward slash localhost colon 8080
the default port is port 8080 and I'm
going to just click on this and then you
will be able to see this kind of window
ok so if it doesn't open automatically
you can just browse on localhost port
8080 now first thing in order to unlock
Jenkins you just need to provide the
initial admin password and this password
is
set in this directory so just copy this
part here and then I'm going to open my
folder Explorer and I'm going to paste
this path and you will see this file
here which is initial admin password so
you just need to open this initial admin
password here so I'm going to just open
it into my editor so I'm going to open
it in the notepad and you just need to
copy this initial password and then I'm
going to minimize this window and I'm
going to provide my initial password and
then click continue now in the next step
you will see a customized Jenkins window
so there are two options here installed
suggested plugins and the second option
is select plugins to install so I'm
going to choose this option which says
install suggested plugins which is going
to install the most suggested plugins in
your Jenkins installation so you can
just click on install suggested plugins
and this is going to start installing
the suggested plugins so you can see
there is a plugin for get here there is
a plugin for subversion plugin for
github LDAP email extension and some
other plugins so right now I don't have
get installed on my system or LDAP
installed on my system or even as a such
slave so if it shows some error it's
okay
so once all the plugins are successfully
installed on your Jenkins you will be
automatically redirected to this page
which says create first admin user so
you just need to create the admin user
credentials here so user name let's say
I'm going to take it as admin here and
password whatever you want I'm going to
give some password and then I'm going to
confirm my password and here I'm going
to give the full name for example admin
once again and the next thing is email
so I'm going to provide the email and
after providing each and every credit
you just need to click Save and finish
which is going to say Jenkins is ready
start using Jenkins so I'm going to just
click on this button which says start
using Jenkins and you will see this kind
of window so if you see this kind of
window that means Jenkins is fully
installed on your system and Jenkins is
running on your system now if you want
to see more about Jenkins you will be
able to see it inside your C directory
and inside the C direct you just need to
go to Program Files x86 and there will
be a Jenkins folder here and inside
Jenkins folder all the plugins are there
so you can see the plugins folder and
all the plugins are here and all the
files related to Jenkins will be stored
here so if you want to dig deeper into
Jenkins you can always come to this
directory and see what's happening so
this is how you can install Jenkins on
your Windows 10 operating system I hope
