video I will show you how to create a
PDF file with your c-sharp application
so for that we are going to need a
third-party DLL and I will show you how
to download that DLL
which is open source DLL so that's free
to download and use
so let's first see how can we download
that DLL and in the later part of the
video I will show you how to use that
DLL to create a PDF file so go to your
browser and right here i text shop in
your search and the first link you will
see is I text shop in the
sourceforge.net projects so it's link is
showing free software downloads at
SourceForge and when you click this link
you will reach to the C sharp sorry I
text shop download zip so I will just
download this zip file and it takes some
seconds to download in a meanwhile I
will return to my project and I will go
to the solution Explorer of my project
and I will select my project name and I
will right click it and I will click
open folder in Windows Explorer so what
it will do is it will open a project
folder in which your project is located
okay and let's see if the download is
complete or not no it's still
downloading so this I text PDF which we
are going to generate today
we can also use it to make reports also
so our file is downloaded I will open it
and it contains some some zipped files
ok so let's see which zip file we are
going to need so what I will do is I
will open this the five first zip file
which is I takes sharp DLL core double
click it and what I will do is I will
just select these both to file XML and
DLL file and I will drag and drop into
my project folder ok wherever my
solution is there for the project so now
it's there and I will close it and in I
will once again open the second file and
see if it contains any deal files or not
yes so I will select this file also and
drag and drop into my project also and
third I will select this DLL also and
drag and drop into my project so I have
taken 3 dll files and I have placed them
into my project folder where my project
is located and now I will minimize this
all and now the next step is once again
go to your solution Explorer right-click
it and go to add references and then go
to browse and it will by default open
your project folder and if it doesn't
open your project folder
just choose or browse the DLL file which
you have extracted from I text sheep
c-sharp okay these three files and I
will select okay and you can see all the
three dll files are here so when you
once again go to the solution Explorer
and go to resources you can see all the
these threes C sharp file here C sharp
DLL file is here okay now the code part
so for that I will give you a simple
example how to generate a simple PDF
file with some text in it so I will take
a button from the tool box and I will
change its text as create PDF and I will
double click this button and in here we
write my code for creating the PDF but
before that we need to add some imports
or using namespaces so ad here using hi
text shop dot text
sorry don't text and using ITEX shop dot
text dot PDF okay so these two files we
are importing and just if you don't have
this system dot IO file in your
namespaces then include this also
because this we will use for the file
stream so write these three files or
import these three namespaces in your C
shaft code just below your other using
namespaces once again we will go to the
form just double click it and in here
now we will write the code for
generating the PDF okay so in here we
will write our code so just write this
code generate the file so declare a
document dock so this is a variable name
from I text and give it any variable is
equal to new document and in the bracket
right I text dot text dot page size dot
letter and comma 10 comma 10 comma 42
comma 42 okay
comma 35 sorry so write this line and
then in the next line write PDF writer
which is a class of your I text sharp
and then write a variable name according
to yourself in my case w ra is equal to
PDF writer not get instance and in the
bracket we
pass this variable here common new file
stream and in the bracket once again
give the name of your PDF file whatever
you want to give so I have given my PDF
file name is test dot PDF and in this
hole name is in double quotes you can
also give some path if you want to give
like see something like that
but I am generating this PDF file in my
project folder where my exe file is
there so I am not providing any paths it
will generate in my project folder comma
file mode dot create bracket and bracket
close okay so write this code in the
next line copy this variable write it
here dot open so this will open your
document file and then in the next pair
of the PDF file so in this video we are
just learning how to write some
paragraph line in your PDF file so write
paragraphs variable name is equal to new
paragraph and in bracket write whatever
you want to write in the prior paragraph
okay and if you want to give some new
line comment so just give this /n and
you can give new life
okay and then once again right doc dot
add and once again copy this paragraph
line here or paragraph variable into
this bracket dog not add in in the
bracket right this variable named
paragraph and then write doc dot close
so this is closing your document okay so
write this code to generate a simple PDF
and this PDF will contain this paragraph
okay so if you want you can pause the
video and write the code and when once
you have done writing the code we will
check our code now so i running my
program username and password okay and
this is my button so right now I will
show you I will go to my project and in
my bin folder debug here there there is
no PDF file if you can see and when I
click this create PDF button just see
here a PDF will be generated so I will
click this and you see a text dot PDF is
generated here okay
and when I open this PDF file the music
it
it contains the content of my paragraphs
so this is the first line of the
paragraph this is the second line of the
paragraph so this is a simple PDF file
which contains a paragraph in the future
videos or in the next few videos I will
show you how to create a fully designed
PDF report with the help of this I text
shop and see shop application so I will
show you how to write the heading how to
give the dates how to give the title how
to insert images how to make tables all
this I will show you in the next few
videos so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
