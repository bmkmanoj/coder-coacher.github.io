video I will show you how to install
notepad plus plus on your open to
operating system so first of all open
your browser and write it here
notepad plus plus and we'll open some
lengths for notepad plus plus by the way
notepad plus plus is a very good tool
for if you want to write some of the
modern languages like C++ HTML PHP and
many others and it's totally free but
the only problem is it's only available
for the windows installer there is no
install for Ubuntu or installer for open
- in the notepad plus plus side so just
if you see notepad plus plus dot o-r-g
then go to this home and you can go to
the download here and here you can see
the download but this is available only
for Windows so I will just hit download
here and I will show you how you can
install this windows installer on open
to just hit download and while it's
downloading I will just press save ok
and while it's downloading I will show
you the way you can install notepad plus
plus or any other Windows executable
file on your open to operating system so
for that you need to install this so
open your terminal on open - and give
this command sudo space apt - get space
install wine
so wine is the instalation library which
allows you to to run Windows application
on your Ubuntu or Linux operating system
or any other operating system so if you
have installed this wine then you will
be able to install this Windows
installer for notepad plus plus on your
Linux system so I will give this command
and I will press Enter
and I have shown you how you can install
this wine on your open to operating
system in the last video that's why you
will see that mine is already in the
newest version so if you want to see how
I installed mine on my operating system
just go to the last video and watch it
and you will be good to go so now my
installation for notepad plus plus is
also complete so I will open this
open in the containing folder by the way
I am running a virtual machine and not
the actual operating system of of open -
that's why it's a little bit slow and
you can see so many archive managers are
open now so now you can see in your
downloads this notepad plus plus the
latest version or latest installer for
notepad plus plus and if you have
successfully installed wine on your
system and when you double click this
the Installer will open and if the
Installer doesn't open by double double
clicking it just right click and just go
here open with wine windows program
loader so once you have installed wine
then it will open this installer with
wine installer or Windows installer and
you can see when this installation for
roadbed + + start/stop choose your
language and click OK and click Next
read the license term and if you agree
just click I agree and you can browse
for the folder where you want to install
this
so in this it looks like this almost
like Windows system and click Next and
destination folder is clash notepad plus
plus but we are installing it with this
Windows installer that is why you need
to use the file system of Windows so
wherever you want to install this
notepad plus plus for example on desktop
i will choose desktop and click OK and
press next and these are okay let's just
next and you can see if you want
shortcut yes and I don't want these all
plugins so I will say install and
installation starts and once the
solution is complete just click finish
and it will launch notepad plus plus on
your bun to system so you can see
notepad plus plus is stall and running
on your open to operating system you can
make many of the programs in this
