tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in the last video I have shown you
what is a function and how we can call
function from our main function
right and how we can declare a simple
function like this okay now in this
video I am going to show you how to
declare and use a function which takes
parameters or arguments so suppose we
want to make a function which adds two
values and prints the sum okay so what
we are going to do is here we will
declare a function which returns nothing
so you will write void and then the name
of the function you can name it as sum
or add whatever you find appropriate for
your program okay I will name it as sum
and now because we want to pass two
numbers which we can sum we will pass
them as an argument for fraud of
function so how to pass an argument in
these two brackets these two brackets we
will give int the type of the argument
first and then we will give the name of
the argument for example a and in a
similar way we can pass the second
argument int B and you can pass any
number of argument in the function for
example int C in D and so on but right
now we want to just add two numbers so
we will pass only two arguments right
and then we will just give two curly
braces here now this one but this one
and now what we want to do from this
function we want to add these two
functions and pass it into other
variable for example we will name it as
sum which will hold the sum of our two
argument which is a and B so we will
just do a plus B and now we want to
print the sum so we will just write
print F and inside this we will just
write sum is equal to percentage T comma
sum
okay and now and whenever you want to
add these two numbers you can just call
the sum function inside your main
function here so just call it and for
example you want to add two numbers for
example you want to add 50 and 60 so we
will just write 50 comma 60 because this
sum function takes two arguments one is
a and one is B so you can pass 50 as a
and 60 as be here right and what will
this will do so this sum function will
replace a by 50 and B by s 60 and then
in here
this a plus B will be 50 plus 60 and it
will transfer the sum to this sum
variable and then this sum will be
printed here so let's try to run the
program first and it prints 1 1 0 which
is true in a similar way you can call
this function multiple times for example
you want to get the sum multiple times
let's give /n here to change the line
and this time we want to add one hundred
or thousand plus five hundred in here we
want to add 1 1 1 and 2 2
- and in here you want to add one two
three and four five six for example and
we want to print the sum of all these
tests this and this run the program and
it will give you the sum 110 1500 which
is the sum of these two numbers 33 or
333 which is the sum of these two
numbers and 5 9 6 which is sum of these
two numbers right let me change the / -
backslash because it will just change
the line like this and run the program
once again and now it will change the
line 110 1503 33 and 595 79 which is the
addition of first some second some
thought some and fourth some like this
and you can call your function multiple
times now for example you want that user
should define these two values at run
time what we can do is we can declare
two numbers X comma Y two integers which
are and then we will ask the user to
give these two numbers so we will printf
and we will write please enter two
numbers okay and then slash and to
change the line and then we will just
say printf printf number one
number one and change the line once
again and then we will use scanf which
we use to take input right
so we will write scan scan F and then in
the bracket percentage D percentage D
and then comma and then this symbol to
take integer this end symbol right and
then value of x which will be our first
number and in the same way we will pass
the second number which is buh-bye so
printf number two this is number two I
will give space so we can see it better
and the second time we will pass or scan
Y so X is this one and Y is this one we
are scanning two numbers and now we will
pass these x and y sum as a first
argument and second argument for this
sum function and what will this do now
when we run the program we will run the
program first and now the program asks
for two numbers so it says please enter
two numbers number one so we will give
number one for example six four or five
eight this is the number one and place
press enter and now it's a is number two
so we will give second number one zero
two five for example and when we press
ENTER we will see sum is equal to 7 for
8 3 which is the sum of the above two
numbers right so in this way we can ask
the user to give two numbers and we can
make the sum of these two numbers and
print it on the screen right so these
are called function with argument and
arguments is this one argument one
argument two and
in the same way you can pass any number
of argument to a function and you can
call your function inside your main
program with those arguments right so I
hope you have understood the basic
concept of functions with arguments or
functions with parameter and I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
