show you how you can create and set up a
Twitter bootstrap project in your
NetBeans IDE now when you create a
Twitter bootstrap project using NetBeans
IDE this way of creating a project will
save you a lot of time because it's
going to provide you a sample template
which is a bootstrap template and this
will save a lot of time for you so let's
see how we can create the bootstrap
project in that beans so open your and
admin side E and go to file here and
then click new project and in the new
project you can see these kind of you
know categories here like Java Java FX
Java web and other application what we
are interested in is html5 and
JavaScript category which is this one
right so just click html5 slash
JavaScript category and then select the
first option which is the topmost option
from here and then click Next and in
here you need to give the name of your
project for example bootstrap one for
example and then click Next and in here
you can choose the site template and
this is the necessary step for creating
the bootstrap project so instead of
using no site template we are going to
choose this option which says download
online template and in here you can see
the second option initializer bootstrap
so you just need to select this one
initialize a bootstrap there are other
options here you can choose for example
classic responsive or angularjs or other
options you are free to choose these
options but right now we want to choose
a bootstrap here right and then click
Next and in here you just need to leave
all the options as default and click
finish
and now NetBeans will download all the
bootstrap file for you and it will
create a bootstrap project for you now
you can see on the left hand side the
bootstrap project is created for us and
inside the site root folder we have CSS
file in which our bootstrap themes and
other CSS files are there then there is
a fonts folder where all the cleef econ
files are there and then we also have
the image folder this is the placeholder
for images and we also have the
JavaScript folder in which your
JavaScript libraries can recite for
example bootstrap dot min J's which is a
prerequisite for you know using
bootstrap so you already have all these
JavaScript CSS files included in your
project and you also have the index dot
HTML file here you can see now in this
index dot HTML file you already have you
know sample template for bootstrap you
can see all the code related to
bootstrap here which you can add it
later but that means provide you this
sample template so that you can
kick-start your project right from the
beginning so now let's run our bootstrap
project so you can click this button to
run your booster project but make sure
here on this you know global icon you
can choose chrome and then you can just
press this green button to run your
project and it will ask you to add
Chrome extension so just click this
button which says go to chrome webstore
and then just add this extension to your
chrome which will allow you to launch
this application so just click Add to
Chrome and it's going to add this
extension
to your Chrome just click Add and in few
seconds it will be added to your Chrome
browser so now you can see this
extension is added and once again when
you go to the NetBeans IDE and click
this green button once again is going to
launch your bootstrap application on
your Chrome browser for example right so
as you can see here NetBeans has
provided you this bootstrap template and
you have your navigation bar the
jumbotron here and few sections here and
this template you can modify and create
your own you know design starting from
here okay so you don't need to start
from scratch whenever you are creating
your bootstrap project in that beans IDE
so in this way you can create your first
bootstrap project in NetBeans IDE I hope
