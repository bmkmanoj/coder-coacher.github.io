video I will show you how to create a
random number generator with your
c-sharp application so let me give you
the quick demonstration what I am going
to show you today I have made these text
boxes in which I will enter the minimum
value so for example I and the minimum
value is through 30 maximum value is 500
and when I click this generate button it
will give me a random number between 30
and 500 any random number it will
generate between 30 and 500 so random
number is very useful when you are
creating some kind of a game or some
kind of a quiz then it's useful and you
can find your own useful way to use this
random number generator so now let me
show you the code behind that first of
all what I have done is I have taken
three button on sorry not three buttons
three text boxes one two and three from
my toolbox so just drag these three text
boxes and place it here in the same way
I have taken three labels and I just
change their text as minimum maximum and
also and I have taken a button and I
renamed its text as generate my text box
names are for minimum my text box name
is textbox min so I know that this is
for minimum value
in the same way for maximum the textbox
name is textbox max and for the answer
the textbox name is textbox ans so I
know which text box is for what use now
I have I will click this generate button
and double click it and here I will
write a board first of all I will
declare a random variable so write
random and give any variable name I give
it as rnd is equal to new random bracket
and bracket closed and then write text
box answer dot text which is your this
text box name so text box answer dot
text is equal to end which is this
variable dot next and in the bracket you
need to write this code in the bracket
right convert dot to int 32 and in the
bracket write text box min because this
is for passing the minimum value from
the text box so if you know text box
only can take strings so we are
converting this string variable into
integer that is why I have written
convert dot to int 32 which is a
conversion form of for integer in
c-sharp in the bracket I write the name
of my textbox or minimum dot text comma
same way for maximum so write convert
dot to 32 and break in the bracket right
text box maximum dot text so if you
don't want to write this big thing and
you don't want to use it these text
boxes it's very simple code just write
your minimum value which I have written
in the text boxes just write this this
is a simple conversion of your code but
if I want to give any different input
then I should be able to give it with
the help of text boxes that's what
that's why I have used text boxes so you
can write this also and dot two strings
so this is converting everything into
the string so these number will be
converted to string and will be shown
into the answer textbox so bigger code
for this is this we need to convert your
text box text into integer and basically
this is the minimum value and this is
the maximum value we are passing in the
bracket friend dot next and then we are
converting this into two string okay so
I hope you understood what I mean by
that and then once again when I run the
program
when you do a maximum value thousand and
then I press generate it will give me
every time when I press generate button
who gave me a random number which is
totally random so in this way you can
use a random number generator in c-sharp
so I hope you have learned something new
this time please rate comment subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
