show you how you can install and use
rainmeter in your Windows operating
system rainmeter is a desktop
customization tool which you can use to
change the skin of your Windows desktop
so for example I want to change the skin
of this desktop I will be able to do
with my rainmeter tool so let's see how
I can install rainmeter first just go to
your browser and search for rain meter
and the first link here you will find is
for rain meter dotnet just click this
link and in here there is a download
section so what I want to download is
the final release I don't want to
install and download this beta version
because that this is a beta version and
this is the final release version so I
will prefer this over this so I will
download this executable file and it's a
fairly small file and will be downloaded
in few seconds ok so once this file is
downloaded you just need to execute this
so I will just click this executable
file and I will just choose my language
as English click OK and I want the start
standard installation click Next and my
operating system is 64-bit so I will
click install and just see here that it
to install this rainmeter in your
Program Files ok so just note the
location and is click install and click
yes and rainmeter will be installed in
few seconds and once the installation is
finished and just keep this checkbox
checked and click finish you will be
able to see
these kind of stick skins so this is
these are the default skin of rainmeter
okay and you can drag and drop these
correct skins from here and you can
place them as you wish and you can
customize all these skins also now in
order to unload these skins for example
you want to change this default skin to
a new skin whatever you want to unload
these skins you just need to write these
skins and you just need to click unload
okay so I will just click unload right
click unload right click and unload skin
now for example you want that right now
it's draggable right the diskens
draggable for example you want that this
should stay here and it should not be
draggable you can always go to your skin
right click it go to the setting and
uncheck this draggable setting so just
uncheck this and now you cannot drag
this okay so they are pretty much you
know good settings which you can do with
rain meters for your skins so I will
unload it for right now unload and my
rainmeter I will be able to find here
when I have installed it you can see the
rain meter is running here I can open it
and by default it has this default skin
okay and it has clock once you click it
you can see clock it has disk you can
click and see the disk space it has
google-searched
skin you can search for it Network skin
recycle bin skin system skin when I
click this it will give me a system
overview and the Welcome script skin ok
so you can just load them like this or
unload these skins by right-clicking and
just click unloads kittens
now in order to get the new skin and you
want before if you want some new skins
which you want to you know implement to
your desktop what you can do is for
example I want to search for the new
skin okay so what I will do here is I
will search for rainmeter skins rain
meter skins right and in here you will
be able to find many website which hosts
these rainmeter skins but the one I like
is this deviantart.com I will put the
link in the description and you will be
able to find this link and just click
this link and it has fairly good amount
of rainmeter skins so you can choose
from those skins and customize those
skins on your desktop okay so for now
for example I want to use some skin and
implement some skin so what I'm going to
do is I will search for a skin called
Circulo rainmeter skin and I will choose
the skin from here which is the link
from deviantART which this is the
website I already shown you so I will
just click this and I will be able to
find this skin here right so what I need
to do is I just need to download this
skin so you can download it from this
small little button here so I will just
click it and it's also our executable
file so you can just download this and
execute it so I will just click this
executable file once again
it says Circulo meter you want to add
just click this install button and once
it's installed you will be able to see
this Circulo meter here and you can see
total storage or you can always
customize your skin for the rain meter
right now I have already told you right
now it's draggable but if you want to
you know fix this Circulo skin you just
right click and go to the setting and
click this uncheck this draggable okay
so now you cannot drag this and it will
be here ok there are some other settings
for example save position keep on the
skin 2d rendering and refreshed skin
which you can play with and you can all
always click manage skin and to open
your rainmeter
and in here you will be able to find
this circular meter
once you install this right so for
example you want to remove this circular
meter right click unload skin it will go
and once again you want to add it just
click this meter ini and now you will be
able to see the skin let's go down and
just click this meter dot ini and just
click this load button here and it will
be loaded right and because I have the
setting that it's undruggable now it's
not draggable here so in this way you
can choose your skins from any internet
link this is the link I have I prefer
which is deviantART calm but they are
many you know website which hosts
rainmeter skins so just choose the skin
whatever you like and you can
implement these skins like this so in
this way you can install and use rain
skin on your Windows operating system I
