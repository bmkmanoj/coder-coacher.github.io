show you how you can download and
install Windows 10 technical preview on
your Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Windows
8.1 operating system so Windows has
released its serve in those 10 technical
preview and you can download and install
it and take a look on it how it works
and if possible you can provide the
feedback to Microsoft also and it's free
to download and preview this Windows 10
technical preview so you can download it
and install it now how you can install
this in parallel with your operating
system for example Windows 8 in my case
well it's really easy to install Windows
10 technical preview with your you know
or Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
system by using a virtual machine and
the virtual machine we are going to use
in this video is called VirtualBox
virtual box helps us to run any other
operating system in parallel with your
host operating system so virtual boss
enables you to run other operating
systems like linux or other windows
versions or Mac OS on this VirtualBox
software so you don't need to uninstall
anything and you can run to operating
system in parallel so this is the
website which you need to go to in order
to get VirtualBox first and on this
VirtualBox we are going to install
Windows 10 technical preview so just go
to this website called
www.virtualbox.org G and then just go to
the downloads here and I will post
the link in the description where I have
shown you how you can download and
install VirtualBox so just click this
link if you're not sure and once you
have downloaded this VirtualBox it'll
look like this
so this virtual box looks like this and
the icon of VirtualBox will look like
this Oracle Virtual Machine VirtualBox
right and you can add new virtual
machines or operating systems on this
Virtual Box now the second thing you
need is the Windows 10 ISO file right to
install it on your virtual boss so you
can get this Windows 10 ISO file by
going to this link which is Windows
Microsoft comm /en - Us / windows /
preview - ISO I will post this link in
the description so you can directly go
to this link and then in here you will
be able to see something like this
download Windows technical preview and
just read all the comments here and when
you browse little bit down you will be
able to see some links here so depending
upon the requirement if you have a
64-bit or 32-bit operating system you
can download this so for now I'm going
to download this 64-bit English unit
this state so ISO file so just click
this link it will take around half an
hour to download because it's a bigger
file around 3.8 1gb so be patient and
let this download complete and once this
download is complete then we are ready
to install this Windows 10 on our system
now we have already opened our virtual
machine here which is VirtualBox now in
order to create a new virtual machine on
this VirtualBox
what you need to do is you need to click
this new button here you click this new
button and in here you need to give the
name of to your machine so we are going
to install Windows 10 technical preview
right windows then you can name it as TP
for technical preview and the type is
Windows Microsoft Windows there are
other types here which are available but
we are interested in Windows right so
just select this options and in the
version because the latest available
version is Windows 8.1 I'm going to
select Windows 8.1 64-bit because I have
downloaded 64-bit ISO file right and
click Next and in here you will be able
to see how much memory you want to give
through your operating system by default
it's 2-0 for it in my case but it
depends upon the operating on the
machine you are using so I think 2 0 4 8
will be ok for Windows 10 technical
preview next create virtual hard drive
just select this option next leave it as
default which is VDI next leave it this
also default dynamically allocated and
this much amount of memory it requires
by default 25 gb but you can increase or
decree that depending upon your RS
system you know specifications what 25
gb is ok now create once this Windows 10
T P which is Windows 10 technical
preview is this machine is created you
just need to select this machine and
right click and go to the settings this
you can do it by selecting this machine
and clicking this button also so just go
to the settings and in here you will be
able to see in the system category you
will be able to see the memory and the
process
SURS right now by default one processor
is allotted by VirtualBox but you can
increase this depending upon the
processors you have so I will increase
it to two but it's not necessary it'll
work fine with one processor also now go
to storage and in here select in the
controller category empty and then
browse for the ISO file you have
downloaded right you have downloaded
this ISO file this will look like this
Windows technical preview - x64 English
us right select this ISO file and open
it and then click OK now you have
provided this ISO file which you have
downloaded to the this Windows 10
machine now you just need to right click
and start just right Lea can start or to
select this machine and click this
button start it will start your virtual
machine and on this virtual machine will
start your Windows 10 installation so
you can see Windows 10 is starting here
to install so for the first time you
need to install it and once it's
installed from the next time whenever it
will open it will open as a normal
operating system so it can also take
some time depending upon the speed of
your computer so this installation is I
think straightforward it's same as any
other Windows operating system it's so
very similar to Windows 8 installation
so language and this you can choose it
according to your language and whatever
is your keyboard layout and click Next
and click Install Now and then just it
will take some time it will start up
cross
says to configure your machine and if
you are that you notice these messages
you just need to close them because they
are not going to affect your
installation so you can safely ignore
these messages okay and so you this
license terms and condition you need to
agree these and click Next and in here
this is important by default
this upgrade install windows to keep all
the files they selected but you need to
select custom windows installed so
custom install windows select this
option and in here create a new hard
drive and click apply and click OK it
will create a new hard drive and now you
can click Next and now it will take some
time to copy all windows files and copy
all installation features on
installation so now I'm going to pause
this video because it takes around five
minutes to complete these all processes
so once these processes are come are
complete I'm going to continue now next
the option is to create your account
Microsoft account if you already have
then give it your account name or
otherwise you can create a new account
I'm going to create a new account and
then I will give my credential here but
if you also don't want to do this there
will be a option here called sign in
without a Microsoft account so I'm going
to choose this sign in without a
Microsoft account and here you just need
to give your your username and password
and then you will be good to go so it
will be a local account so for example
programming knowledge and password and
once again password and some hint and
click finish and once you click finish
it will finalize your settings and then
it will start your Windows 10 operating
system like this
you
and now let's start and this is your
Windows 10 and for the first time and
ever you take a look at this Windows 10
it will look like this which is which
will look like any other Windows 10
operating system but whenever you click
this button you will be able to feel the
changes in new Windows 10 so for example
you will click this those 10 is ready to
use you can preview this for the first
time you can see this menu Start menu is
back here and there are other features
like this menu you can drag like this or
resize your menu and there is one more
feature to search your apps from
directly from here or see your tasks
from you so you can preview this Windows
10 by yourself and see how it looks like
