to connect our new jframe with the
database or to populate a new injectable
with a new database a bill which is user
input which we made in the previous
video so let's get started first of all
what you have need to do is in this
table you need you need to go to source
and you need to import some files which
I am copying because I am already shown
you what final you need to import in
order to connect your jframe with the
database so import these two files
import Java doc dot SQL dot star and
import Java X dot showing dot star these
two file you need to import and just
below public class your table name
extend this we need to write our
connection variables this also I am
copying because I have already shown you
so just write connection corn is equal
to null result set RS is equal to null
and preparedstatement EST is equal to
now in order to connect your connection
which is Java Connect which I have this
method I've shown you in the second
tutorial second video so if you have
some doubt you can go to second video
and see how to make a connection method
for with the database so this thing will
need to write and in the public user
input frame where you're in it
components method is there you need to
pace one more method which is this Java
Connect method so just copy this this
also have shown in the previous video
some just copying and I'm just pasting
this so you need to write call is equal
to Java connect dot connector DB which
is Java Connect is the name of our gem
frame Java connect dot connected TV DB
is the method inside our Java Connect
Jathan
so write this and now we are ready to
populate our J table so we will go
and just copy our method update table
which we have made in the employee info
in employing 4j cream and this thing I
already teach to you in how to populate
your J table so you can see that video
if you don't know how to do that and
just copy it from employee info and you
just go to your new jframe and paste it
there you will see two errors here this
is the table name so we need to change
our table name our table name is J table
one I will name it as user info
use an input table now we'll just copy
the name impressive okay and we'll just
paste here
and the place of previous table and we
have now this error for this either you
need to import one more file which is
this import that dot 40 and it dot SQL
dot d utils and I copy this paste it
here in the import files and you can see
your error will go and instead of string
SQL select from select star from
employee info table now we want the
information from our user input table so
we copy the name and just paste it
instead of this table name so select
star from user info table and everything
will be the same in update table and one
more final thing we need to call this
method here and where you have copied
your connection this is our main method
you copy and paste our update table here
so every time when your gem is open this
method is called and directly it will
show the table so let's try to run our
program you can see all the data which
you have created in the previous videos
come by the indeed pressure temperature
volume flow and rotational speed added
some more and use rows in that so you
can also add
and I think that time is over for this
video and next video I will show you how
to use J tempt pains and how to design
your J tamping so stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and thanks
