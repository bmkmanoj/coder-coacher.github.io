video I will show you how to use file
dialog with your QT GUI C++ application
or more specifically I should say queue
file dialog so what is a file dialog for
example in your Windows operating system
when you go to this start button and
when you open this computer this dialog
box which shows you all this file system
and you will be able to see all the list
of files and folders this is called the
file dialog this whole dialog box so I
will show you how you can open this kind
of a file dialog with the help of your
hood QT GUI applications so let's get
started I will I have a blank project
made and here I will take a push button
and this push button I will double click
and change its name I will say open file
name for example ok so I want to see the
file name of whatever file I choose and
now I will right click and I will click
go to slot and I will select the first
option which is clicked and I reach to
this main window CPP file in here I will
include some header file first first of
all I will include include Q file dialog
which is this one Q file dialog and then
I will go to this
push button click event or push button
click method here I will declare a cue
string and I will name it as file name
is equal to Q file dialog and then I
will write get open file name okay and
then I will close this bracket and in
here in this bracket as an argument
I am going to pass some argument so
first argument would be let me make it a
little bit clearer so you can see it on
one screen so this bracket I have closed
here okay and the first argument would
be this and comma second argument would
be TR and this is the title of your file
dialog so for example you can write open
file and the third argument would be of
the comma is the default folder you want
to open okay so it depends what is what
default folder you want to open for
example I want to open I will give
double quotes and I want to open C colon
slash slash this is my C directly which
is my root folder in windows so by
default whenever I open the file dialog
it will by default open this folder
which is my C folder
okay and the fourth argument would be
what kind of file you want to filter
over you want to see in your file dialog
so for example whenever you see any file
dialog in here I cannot show but yeah in
this program I will show you what I mean
by that
so in here the fourth argument would be
just right double quotes and in here you
can filter your files so for example you
want to see all files right all files
and you give the bracket and you give no
extension so this star dot star means
all files star means any file you want
to open this is the prefix and this is
suffix for example then for example if
you want to filter text file so you give
double semicolon 2 times 1 and 2 times
semicolon and then say text file and
once again give this bracket and then
write star which means any of the text
file dot txt so this is the extension
which well you will be able to see so
all text file when you choose this
option you will be able to see and for
example you want to open all music file
for example so write music file and then
in this bracket right star dot mp3 for
example okay so this is the
filters you have applied whenever you
open the file dialog and now for example
I want to show this file name or file
path in a message box so whatever file I
selected I want to show it in a message
box so I will first of all I need to
import include a message box so i will
write include queue message box and in
here I will write queue message box and
this will be information so I will
select information and in here I will
pass my file names but first of all I
have to give it this argument second
argument will be TR the title of your
message box so I will name it as file
name and the third argument would be
your file name itself ok so just right
here file name now let's try to run our
program so I will click this button just
select the project which you want to run
and click this Run button save all the
piles and it's building my project
hopefully I should not get any errors
yes I don't have any errors and now my
program is running so for example I
click this open file name button from
here and it opens the file dialog this
is my file dialog this is the title of
my file dialog which is open file which
I have provided here you see here open
file
this is the title of my way along and by
default it has opened the seed directory
which I have given here the default
directory path we just see and now you
have three type of filter here all files
text files and mp3 files so this all
files will show you all the files which
is there in the folder for example you
want to see the text file then it will
only show the text files so it will show
the text files and the mp3 files it will
only show them three files and there are
no mp3 files in my folder right now now
for example I select some file so I will
go to my picture sample pictures and I
will select some sample picture from
here let me see where is sample picture
there is no sample picture in my
computer so I will go here and yeah I
haven't selected all file dead that's
why I was seeing no pictures now I come
to know okay so now I should be able to
see some pictures from here or here and
okay so I can see the pictures when I
select all files and when I select this
file it should show the path of the file
in the message box so I select this and
I click open
and you see the path of that file
wherever this file is located is in the
message box so in this way you can use
cue file dialog with your QT GUI
application I hope you have enjoyed this
