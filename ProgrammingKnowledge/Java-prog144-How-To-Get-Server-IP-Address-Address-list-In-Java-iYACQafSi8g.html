video I will show you how to get the IP
addresses with the help of your NetBeans
java application so let me clear you
what I mean by IP addresses so go to
your Start button and type here command
and when you type here IP config and
press enter you will get a list of IP
addresses which are connected to your
network so for example I have this IP
address which is my IP address and there
can be more than one IP addresses which
are connected so for example I have this
VirtualBox which I am connected to whose
IP address is different and my local IP
is different which is my IP on the
network so right now I am connected to
two IPs
so first I will tell you how to get your
IP address on the network and then I
will show you how to get all the network
IP or all done IP addresses of the
network you are connected to so whatever
which values of IP addresses which are
shown here you will be able to see with
the help of your java application so
let's get started I will go to the
palette and I will take a button from
here it change its text as get IP and
maybe I will also change its variable so
BT and
I pee and press ok and click this button
and at the top first of all I will
import some imports so import Java dot
net dot star and break it closed ok so I
have used this and now I will double
click this button once again and and in
here I will write the code so in here
right in at i and ii t at ress and give
it a variable name i will name it as IP
is equal to once again copy this and
paste it here dot get localhost ok and
break it closed and it's giving me error
so I see I need to surround this with
try-catch so I surrounded this code by
that try catch block and the error is
gone now so now in the next line what I
will do is here I will write or show
this IP in the form of in the J option
pain so I will write this joptionpane
dot show message dialog I couldn't break
it close and inside this bracket I will
write null comma then I will copy this
variable IP and paste it here dot get
host address ok so this will give you
the IP of your
computer on the network okay so let us
try and run the program right click and
run and when I click this button it
shows me this 192 one dot one sixty
eight dot 56.1 and when I see this
command prompt here here also my IP is
this 192 168 56.1 right now for example
I want the list of all IPs so what I
will do is I will delete this code here
and now I will write the code for
listing all the IPS which are here
whether they are in the ipv6 address or
they are ipv4 address so ipv6 address
looks like this and ipv4 address looks
like this so all the list I want so how
can I show this I will show you so
inside your try-catch block make some
space here and then you will write
enumerate and just copy the import or
fix the imports and give it a variable
name enumerate e is equal to and after
this equal to sign right network
interface dot get network interface and
bracket flows and then what we will do
is this exception I don't like so I make
it like this and now I will make a while
loop to list all my IP so I will right
while and break it and break it lost and
in here I will write the code so in here
inside this while loop we will write
this insert in the while loop bracket
just copy this eve area belinha
malaysian variable e dot and just click
this has more elements and now inside
this while loop we will declare this
network interface variable so write
network interface n is equal to in the
bracket network interface and then once
again copy this e enumeration variable
dot next element so it's running in the
while loop so we will get the values of
all the network now here we will declare
one more enumeration variable inside
this while loop so write enumeration e
this time
earlier it was e and this time it was
double e is equal to copy this n
variable network interface variable dot
get in net addresses okay so you have
written this code and now I will make
one more while loop so I will just copy
this while loop paste it here and close
this while loop and inside this while
loop what I will write is first of all
instead of this replace this ebuy double
e which is new our new enumeration
variable earlier it was only a which was
this one and now inside this while loop
I will write this so write in net
address and give it a variable name
I is equal to n net address in the
bracket and copy this enumeration
variable which is doubly dot next
element and one more line we need to
write so you can show this IP addresses
in the list box or something like this
but for simplicity I am just using
system output for showing the values so
I will right
system dot out dot
and app
and in here instead of this print F
print Ln print line okay and in here I
will pass the IP address so I will copy
this in net address I dot get host
addresses okay and now I will close this
bracket so I have written this code so
if you want you can just copy this code
once again I will just focus on this
code okay and once you are done with
this code I will just run the code so
right click and run and see here the
output so when I click this button get
IP here I will see the output in the
output here so I will click this and you
can see all the IP is whether they are
ipv6 or ipv4 all the IPS are listed here
so these IPS you can also show in the
list box I have already shown you how to
use this list box so this you can add in
the list box or J text area wherever you
want so I hope you have enjoyed this
video and you have learned something new
this time so please keep watching and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
