you how you can download and install
Java JDK 10 on your open to operating
system so let's get started
first of all open your terminal so you
can just press ctrl alt T in order to
open the terminal
or you can go here and search for
terminal in order to open the terminal
so one star terminal is open the
commands are relatively simple I have
just written all the commands together
and these commands I'm also going to
paste it in the description so you can
just copy all these commands one by one
and then install Java JDK 10 so the
first command is to add the PPA
repository so I'm going to just copy the
first command and I'm going to just
paste it here and then press Enter which
is going to ask for my windows password
I'm going to give my Ubuntu's password
and then press enter and in here it
asked me to press ENTER to continue so
I'm going to just press ENTER to
continue so this is finished so let's
copy the second command which is to
update so sudo apt-get update and I'm
going to just paste the second command
and then press ENTER and this command is
also finished so let's install Java JDK
10 using the last command which is sudo
apt-get install Oracle Java 10 installer
so I'm going to just copy and then paste
this command and then press ENTER and
then press Y and then press Enter
and after some times you will see this
message which says Oracle binary code
License Agreement for Java SE platform
products and Java effects so I'm going
to just press ENTER and the second
message is do you accept Oracle binary
code license so I will just use my arrow
key to come on yes and then press Enter
so the installation of Java JDK 10 is
finished on my system and at last you
will see this message which says Oracle
JDK 10 is installed and then you will
see an important note here and this
message says to set Oracle JDK 10 as
default install Oracle
Java 10 set default and the command for
this is this one so the command is sudo
apt-get install Oracle - Java 10 - set
default which I have also written on
this document so I'm going to copy this
command from here and then I'm going to
paste it on my terminal and then press
Enter and then everything is finished
now so let's check whether Java JDK is
installed and which version of Java is
installed on our system so for that I'm
going to open the next terminal or the
second terminal and in here I'm going to
just give this command to check the
version of Java which is Java - -
version is going to give us the Java
version and you can see Java 10 is the
latest version and we can also check the
Java C command which is used to compile
Java code so Java C - - version and then
press Enter it says Java C ten point
zero point one so everything is working
fine on your system so this is how you
can download an install Oracle Java 10
on your open to operating system I hope
