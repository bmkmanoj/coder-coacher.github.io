video I will show you how to add images
or pictures to your frame like this and
how to add icons like this to the button
and how to group your buttons together
like this so let's get started I will
open our project which we are working on
till now we have made a login page and I
want to make this page a little bit
better so what I will do is I will
select all this and I will just shift it
to the right and then I will go to the
tool box here and I will search for
the group Dropbox base one and drag it
and drop it here so this group box is a
box in which a group of come component
can have so just one by one I will place
this all components in your group
it's and these put them into the group
and make this group a little bit bigger
okay
and then I will place it at the left so
in this way you can provide Dropbox to
your components and I want to change
this title also I will name it as sign
sign in alright sign in enter Center and
now you can see this Dropbox is looking
really nice and now I want the image to
appear at the left hand side so that my
frame can look professional so once
again I will go to my toolbox and I will
find a picture box here drag it and then
you can see this small arrow button here
just click it and click Choose image and
you can cue choose your image from your
computer
so I'm choosing some image for example
this Bluefish image and now you can see
this image is here just resize your
picture box according to the size of
your image and now I'm it just ready one
thing if you want to search for the
images I found really good reference on
the Internet just go to your browser and
write I con archieve and here you can
see a website called icon arch if calm
and you can find many good images on
that site so for example you want to
search for okay I can I will right ok
and press ENTER and you can see this is
a Hokie icon but this icon is a little
bit bigger for my button which is really
small so here I can choose the size size
16 by 16 and here you can see very small
button size and just click this IC o----
for icon or PNG it for PNG image I
choose ICO image and
here you can see it's downloaded or for
example like you choose PNG image and
it's here and now you can right-click
and save it to a complete computer so in
this way I have saved some of the few
useful images that are PNG images by the
way and then I want to show that ok I
can on my login button so what I will do
is I will click this login button and go
to the property and I will go to image
here just click it and just click this
small button here and now from here you
can choose your image search for that ok
I can I found it I will click it ok and
you can see that icon is appeared here
but I want the text to be on the
right-hand side and the icon to be on
the left-hand side so once again I will
choose it or click it select it and go
to the properties and I will go to the
image align right now it's middle center
I will align it at the left and say in
the same way go to text text align and I
will align it at the right and you can
see it's aligned
in whatever manner I want so in this way
you can see a very professional frame
you can make in this way and when I run
it
it runs and looks very really nice so I
