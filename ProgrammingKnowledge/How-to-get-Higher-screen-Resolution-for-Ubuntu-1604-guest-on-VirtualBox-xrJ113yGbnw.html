show you how you can increase the
resolution of Ubuntu on VirtualBox so
whenever you install open 2 on
VirtualBox it's going to look like this
when you log in for the first time and
you can see the resolution is much worse
than the original
ubuntu right so what you can do to
increase the resolution so that these
icons will be smaller and you know look
good and you will be able to work you
know efficiently on open 2 on VirtualBox
so what you can do is you can just open
your terminal by going to this - room
and select terminals from here so once
your terminal is open you need to give
this command which I'm going to provide
you in the description so you can
directly copy this command and paste it
on your terminal and everything will be
ok so this command is sudo apt - get
install VirtualBox - guest guest
- DKMS space this backslash and then
VirtualBox - guest - you tools space
VirtualBox - guest - X 11 and press
ENTER and it's going to build all the
dependencies and click yes or give yes
or why and it's going to install and
once this is installed you will be able
to restart your virtual machine and you
can see the changes right away so I will
let it run and once this process is
complete we will continue so now this is
installed so we are ready to restart you
just need to close the terminal and we
just need to restart or shutdown and
restart once again so I'm going to shut
down this and let's shut down and we
will start
this open to virtual machine once again
once it's shut down so machine is shut
down and I'm going to restart this
virtual machine once again for open to
click yes
and right away you will be able to see
the changes every thing is must much
beautiful now and resolution is
increased and when I log in you will be
able to see the changes in the icon and
the resolution also so I have
successfully logged in and I can see the
icon resolution is increased you know in
a better way so in this way you can
increase a resolution of Ubuntu desktop
on VirtualBox I hope you have enjoyed
