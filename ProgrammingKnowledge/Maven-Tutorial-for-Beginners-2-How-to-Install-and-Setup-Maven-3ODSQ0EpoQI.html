maven tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can download
and install and setup maven on our
Windows operating system now before
installing maven you need to make sure
that Java JDK is installed on your
Windows operating system and Java home
variable is already added to your
environment variable so to check this
just open your search box and just
search for a system here and open the
system from here and in here open
advanced system settings and in the
advanced system setting you need to
press this button which says environment
variables and in here you need to make
sure that this Java underscore home is
set up in your user variables and the
path of this Java home should indicate
the path of JDK folder in your Windows
operating system so for example when I
copy this path and I open my folder
Explorer or File Explorer and paste this
path it should open the JDK folder here
right and if you're not sure how you can
do this or how you can install Java JDK
and setup Java environment variables
then I will paste the link of the video
in the description which shows exactly
how and what to do in order to install
Java JDK and setup this Java home
environment variable you also need to
make sure that in the path variable this
is indicating this Java JDK bin folder
so this bin folder must be added to your
system variables in system variables
search for path and when you double
click on it at the end or you need to
search for this path which is C program
file Java your JDK folder name
and then bin okay and if it's not there
you need to add it at the end of it
using semicolon okay once everything is
done and you are sure that these
environment variables are set up on your
system then we are ready to install
maven on our system so open your
favorite browser and search for download
maven and the first link which will
appear here will be from maven dot
Apache og slash download so just click
this link and in here you can you know
see different links here and if you
reach to the home page if you land it to
the home page then you can just click
this download button here and you will
reach to this place right now in order
to download maven you have different
options listed here but what we are
interested in is this option which says
Apache - maven - the version of the
maven which is three point three point
nine at the time of making this video
- bin dot zip files we need to download
this zip file in order to install Mabel
so just choose the second option and
save it at your desired location okay
now once your download is complete go to
the location where the zip file is
located and thus just open this zip file
and extract it to your desired location
in my case I am going to extract it to
my C directory ok so just choose this
and extract it once the extraction is
done we can browse to our Apache maven
folder in the C directory and we can see
there are some folders here the one
folder we are interested in is this bin
folder in which our maven executable
files are there so next step is to open
your system once again so just search
for system and open it and once again go
to
advanced system settings and once again
go to environment variables now anyhow
what you need to do is we need to go to
user variables and we need to create a
new user variables just click this new
button here and the new user variable
name would be M to underscore home in
capital okay
and the value of it will be your apache'
folder so this is the value in my case
it's C directory and in my C directory I
have this Apache maven folder right
don't go up to bin folder but just go at
the top level of this Apache folder
which is Apache a folder itself
okay so copy this part and then paste it
here and then click OK now some project
still uses some other name for this
em--to home which is maven home so it's
useful to create one more user variable
which is maven home so just write maven
home underscore home ok so because some
of the program still references maven
folder with this name it's not harmful
to create this environment variable and
the value of it will be the same C colon
slash Apache maven and the version of
your maven folder ok
click OK and once this is done the last
step is to just go inside your bin
directory here and then copy this path
up to bin inside the apache folder and
once again go to your environment
variables and in the environment
variables just search for the variable
called path and just open it and then
append this path at the end of this line
so I'm going to just give the semicolon
and then paste this path to my path
variable and then click OK
and then click OK and then click OK now
maven is installed in our system so in
order to check it what we can do in
order to check that maven is installed
in our system we can open our command
prompt so just right click on your Start
button and then open a command prompt
from here and then here just give mvn -
version here and then press ENTER and
it's going to give you the version of
maven installed on your system and it's
also going to show you the Java version
and it's going to show you the Java home
directory also so if it gives these
informations into your terminal then
maven is installed on your system so
that's it for this video from the next
video we are going to see how we can
create our first maven project so stay
tuned and please recommend subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
