last video I have shown you how to
populate a combo box with the database
values using your Visual Basic windows
form application now in this video I
want to show you how to populate the
corresponding value to index or the
value selected in the combo box in these
text boxes so basically what I want to
do is I have these columns in my MySQL
database and I want to transfer the
value corresponding to the name for
example when I select John his employee
ID name surname and age will be
reflected or will be shown in these text
boxes so for every name I want to show
the employee ID name surname and age for
every selected name so I want to show
you just that in this video so let's get
started and let's see how we can do it
so what you need to do first is you just
go to your form and in the last video
itself I have shown you how to populate
your combo box right and this was in
form load event so I will just select my
form and double click it and here I have
shown you how to populate a combo box so
I'm going to use this code once again
because it's just a skeleton of the code
which I am going to use for this video
also so what I'm going to do next is I
will select my combo box and double
click it and this will need to event
called
combo box selected index change event so
when you change the index of the combo
box then what you want to do is you want
to populate your text boxes curve with
the corresponding values right so here
in the combo box one select and exchange
event I have pasted all the code which I
have written in the last video so go and
see the last video and copy and paste
the same code or otherwise you can pause
the video and copy the code from here
from top to bottom this code okay and
now what I want to do is I want to
change this query here because this all
will remain the same and I have been
showing you or explaining you what these
Disko do and what this try cache block
do in the last few videos right so I'm
going to go to this query string and I
want to change the query to to get the
value with the corresponding selected
value in the combo box so this query now
will be select star or has s tricks from
your database name which is my database
name which is database dot the table
name which is the name of my table which
is e data and then just right after that
where name why I am choosing name
because in my combo box
I have populated names in my combo box
right so let me show you once again
these are all the list of names which is
populated in the combo box right so this
comes from the name column in my
database this one that's why I have
written names here okay so select star
from database dot e data where name
is equal to single code in between
double quotation and between this and
sign and in here just write the name of
your combo box which is combo box one
which I have shown you in the last video
so this is the name of my combo box
combo box one right so just write the
name of your combo box one dot text okay
and this is your query so your query now
is select star from database dot your
table name where name is equal to which
is the column name which I populate the
combo box with and then single quote
double quote and just twice this okay
and now command will remain same so I am
NOT going to change this Vida will also
remain same and what I am going to
change here is now I want to take the
values of the employee ID name surname
and age corresponding to the value I
select in the combo box and populate my
text boxes all these text boxes right so
I will go into my while loop which I
have while reader dot read rate this
reader is this variable here and in my
while loop what I will write here is so
I will write
the name of my text box for all the text
boxes one by one so the text box
ew d which is the name of my first text
box right and the second text box name
is named third text box name is surname
and the four text box name is age right
so the name of all my text boxes textbox
named for Eid Technium for name surname
and age right and then I will write dot
txt is equal to for all the text boxes
and in between dot here okay and then I
want to populate these text boxes with
the value I fetch from the data base
current sponding to the name which I
have select in the combo box so what I
will write here is I am going to copy my
reader variable which is my my SQL data
reader back object and I will write here
reader dot
get int 32 why I'm doing this I will
show you in a moment and I will write
here PID okay so why I have taken get
int here because in my database and my
table I have declared this Eid as an
integer so when I see all the data types
of my table you see here employee ID is
an int name is Val care which is a type
of string surname is also a type of
string and age is integer so because e
ID is an integer that's why I have taken
here get into 32 right so in the same
way called age also I am going to use
this get in 32 which because age is also
our integer right and for the string
funnier name I will say get string and
in the bracket I will write the name of
the column for the name so these all EW
I name and once more surnames so e ID
name surname and age are my column names
ew d name surname and age this is
exactly the name of my column this one
is the name of the column in the table
in the database right so just write this
and that's it that's good to load your
selected combo box values corresponding
values to the text boxes right so if you
want you can pause the video and just
copy this and now I am going to run the
program
and I will give my username and password
and my values are populated which are
names from the database and when I
select any name the corresponding value
should come here right so I will select
John and the corresponding value to John
which are employee ID one surname is
Bell and ages 27 is shown here some
other name
mark mark employee ID is what is the
employee ID of mark this one so employee
ID 7 and the surname is Gil ages 55 and
like this right and if you your database
or column which you populate here
contains two too similar names then this
text box will show the later values
right so for example I have mark here
and mark here two similar names then my
textbox will show the last value of the
name file right otherwise if it's a
unique name then it will show the
corresponding value call employ ID 8 and
the surname and the age right so in this
way you can show the corresponding value
chosen from the combo box in your text
boxes I hope you have enjoyed this video
