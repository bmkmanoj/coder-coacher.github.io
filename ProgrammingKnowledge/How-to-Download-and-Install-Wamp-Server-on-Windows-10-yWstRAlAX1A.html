so just open this system here and now
you will see here your system type and
my system type right now is 64-bit ok so
that's why I'm going to download the
64-bit version but if you have 32-bit
you will download this version ok so I
will just click this here and now it
says this warning ok so there are some
warning which you are going to see first
is don't use previous or web server
add-on or extension which we don't have
other is you need to have Microsoft
Visual Studio C++ extension or
redistributable so right now I don't
have
this thing so I am going to download
this okay
so just click this link Microsoft comm
slash download and it's going to
redirect you to this page okay so in
here you can see this visual c++
redistributable for Visual Studio 2012
so you just need to choose your language
and download it and then I have a 64-bit
operating system so I'm going to
download this first option which is x64

need to click this executable file and
click I agree and then click install and

and I'm going to minimize my browser and
just click yes first of all and now the
installation of web server will start ok
so just click Next here and then I
accept the agreement click Next and this
is the location where them server will
be installed so if you want to change it
you can change it but I'm going to leave
it as default and click Next
and then you can choose if you want to
create the quick launch icon and desktop
icon so I'm going to check both not no
harm in it
so just click Next and then click
install
and now it's going to take some time to
install this web server on your Windows
10 operating system so leave it for some
time until this process is complete
and in here you will see it's going to
give you this message please choose your
default browser and if you are not sure
just click open okay so in here you can
choose your default browser if you have
some browser preferences for example if
you have Chrome or other browsers like
Firefox or anything then you can choose
your browser from here so for example I
am going to go to my Program Files x86
and in here I'm going to choose Google
from here and go to Chrome application
and in here I'm going to choose a chrome

give you this warning you just need to
allow access and then you can see this
