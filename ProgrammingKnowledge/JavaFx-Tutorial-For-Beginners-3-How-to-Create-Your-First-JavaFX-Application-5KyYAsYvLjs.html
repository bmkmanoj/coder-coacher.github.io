Java effects tutorial for beginners in
this video we will see how we can create
our first Java FX application from
scratch so let's get started
I have this basic barebone Java class
with the main method now to add java
effects support in this class what i
need to do is first i need to import
this library called Java FX dot
application dot application ok and after
adding this library what you can do is
you can extend this class with the
application class so extend with
application and now this application
class will ask you to implement some
methods so you can just click this red
bulb here and it will say implement
unimplemented methods just click this
and it's going to implement this start
method right now to start a Java FX
application you need to call a method
called launched inside your main method
okay and this launch method will call
your Java FX application constructor
which in turn start your application ok
and you have this method called start in
which you can add your scenes or layouts
or widgets ok so you can see here we
have a start method with argument of a
staged class ok so you can take this
primary stage object from here and then
call a method called show ok and this is
your basic Java FX window so save your
code and run it and this will give you
this blank stage window ok now I have
told you in the first
video that to create a Java effects
application you need to add a stage and
inside the stage you need to add a scene
and inside the scene you need to have
your layout in which your widget resides
right so we will do the same here so for
example I want to add a button inside
the stage so I will add a button by
calling this button class and I will
name it as BTN is equal to new button
and to this button I can give an initial
text inside the constructor for example
click me and then what I can do is I can
create a layout ok so what I'm going to
do is there are different kind of
layouts in JavaFX for example stack pane
or vertical box or horizontal box so we
are going to create this layout for
example I am going to take one of the
layout which is called stack pane and
I'm going to name it as root is equal to
new stack pane and using this route you
can call a method called get children's
so get children and then you can add
your button to it so just call a method
called add and then call this button
object here ok now you have your layout
so now we are going to create a scene so
just below this we will create a scene
object so scene scene is equal to new
scene and then as an argument for the
constructor you will give your route
object which is your layout object ok
and now we are almost done so just take
your stage object from here and then
call a method called set scene here ok
so call a method called set scene and
then pass your scene object inside this
method argument okay
save your code and then run your code
now you can see this small button inside
this window now you can see here this
window is very minimal which is of the
size of this button now to give some
size to our scene what we can do here is
to the constructor we can add two more
argument one is the width so for example
I will give the width as 500 and 300 as
height save your quote and run it once
again and now you can see your button in
the middle and you have a sized window
of 500 by 300 okay now to add some
action to this button what we can do is
we can take this button object and then
we can call a method called set on
action and as a value here you call a
new event handler here okay
and it's going to automatically create
this method for you inside this event
handler and in here you can perform any
code for example printing something so
for example I will just write this out
and I want to print hello world on the
console so I will just write hello world
save it and I will run my application
once again and now when I press this
button I can see this hello world is
printed here on the console right so
every time I press the button hello
world is printed okay
so this is how you can create your basic
JavaFX
application so I hope you have enjoyed
