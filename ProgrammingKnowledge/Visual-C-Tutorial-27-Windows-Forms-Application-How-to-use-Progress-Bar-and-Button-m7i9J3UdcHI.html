video I will show you how to use
progress bar with your with visual C++
windows form application so go ahead in
your tool bar and first of all we will
take a button by pressing the button we
should initialize the progress bar and
then go ahead and take a progress bar
and drag it into your form this is our
progress bar and this is our button you
need to have one more thing which is
timer so take a timer and just drag it
into a form but it will appear here at
the bottom of the form so we have three
things I just quickly renamed this
button as start bar okay
and now what I will do is I will just
double click this start button which
leads me to the button actually perform
of button event and in here I'm right
this arrow pointer your timer name so
which is timer 1 this timer name is time
of 1 so I will go there and I will write
time or 10.0 start ok
so added this line to the button click
event and once again go to your form and
this time go to the timer select this
timer and double click this timer and
you will go to the time or event and in
here we will add our second code which
is this point your progress bar name so
this is my progress bar I will copy its
name from here and go to the form once
again and paste it here this progress
bar and then pointer
increment so increment and then right
here inside the bracket one so we have
added here this line of code this
progress bar increment and in the
bracket one and in the button click
event I am starting the timer with this
code this timer arrow point of start
okay so these two lines of code we
require and then when I run my program
let's see if our progress bar books or
not so when I click this button me my
progress bar should start filling so
let's see yes it's
molting
and this timer time you can also adjust
of filling the progress bar so how can
we do that just select this timer from
here and go to the properties yeah and
you can modify this interval for the
timer for example I make this interval
thousand M when I run my program once
again and when I press this start bar it
will fill slowly because I have
increased my interval okay and once
again if I go to the timer select and I
reduce the interval to ten and then I
run the program
and when I press this button you see the
progress is fast so in this way you can
use the progress bar for showing some
progresses so I hope you have enjoyed
