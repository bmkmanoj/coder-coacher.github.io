cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video and most probably in the next
video also I'm going to show you how we
can create a simple notepad using QT so
what we are going to do is we will try
to apply whatever whatever we have
learned till now in this video and try
to create a small a little project which
is a cutie notepad so let's get started
first of all I've created this simple
empty project so first of all what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to my
main window dot UI file and in here
first of all I will just take our text
box ok so just take this text add it
from here and drag and drop into your
form now what you can do here is you can
apply a layout to this window which is
for example you can apply this
horizontal layout okay so it will cover
all your all your main window now next
step is to create some menu items so
what we will do is let's create some
menu items here and the standard menu
item is file for example and I will just
keep file with capital F and inside the
file I will just add a new option and
then the second option will be to open
something so the second option I will
just say open and then I will provide a
separator here and then I will say save
and press ENTER and then save as so just
try save as and press ENTER ok
so we have I think we have three
separators somehow so I will just remove
two separators from here ok now in the
second menu item I will just say add it
and the first menu item would be for
example
cut and sew cut with capital C cut and
then press ENTER then copy so just write
copy and then the paste so just write
paste okay and we will add a separator
here and after the separator we will
just give for example redo and undo so
just write redo and here just write undo
okay and the third menu option we will
provide here for example would be about
this notepad so I will just say about
okay so these are the menu items I have
added and we have learned in our
previous video how cue action class
words so whenever you create a menu item
here all the you know related cue action
objects are created here also right so
you have new and open save save as
whatever menu item you have created here
there are some actions also created here
right so the next step is to provide
some icons to our all the menu items so
we will add a resource file first so I
will go to my project right click on my
project and I will say add new and then
Qt resource while Qt resource file and
then I will name my resource file as
resource itself and click Next and then
click finish it will create a crystal
file for me and then I will go here add
and I will add a prefix for example re
see for resource and once this prefix is
created I can add my icons so what I
have done is I have already downloaded
the icons and saved it in my project
folder so I can click any file here and
we'll say show an explorer and it will
show me this kind of project structure
what I have right and I have created an
extra folder here and I have downloaded
some of the icons here right so I will
choose these icons from my project file
so you can download and create an image
folder in your project and then you can
add it as resources right so add files
and I will go to image folder and I will
choose always to loop this and click OK
so it will add all the icons in my
resource file and then I will just say
ctrl s to save the resources so that I
can use them right so now I will go to
main window dot UI file once again and I
will provide the icons here so I will
just double click here and the name I
will leave it as default but from here I
want to provide the icon so for new I
will just choose a new icon if I can
find it this one ok and let's click OK
and in the same way I will just double
click every you know a reaction and I
will just provide the icon to it so open
click OK and I will do this same for
rest of them so I will just pause the
video and then continue after I added
all the icons right so I have added all
the icons here and if you have followed
my cue action tutorial you would know
that I can just drag these actions to my
tool by here and they will be visible
also right so I will drag it here and
then all the icons in my toolbar also ok
so one by one I will add
them cut and then copy and then paste
and I have two more are redo and undo
right and I think I just forget the
about menu item so I will just add for
example about for example notepad right
and press ENTER and then I will just add
the icon for this also so I will just
search for about and click OK and then I
will just drag and drop here now if I
want to add a separator for my toolbar
also I can just go here in between save
as and cut for example right click here
and I will say insert separator before
action cut so it will add the this kind
of separator here also I want to insert
the separator before redo and paste so I
will just go here and do here I wanted
to do it before the redo so like this
and also before the about so like this
okay so you can also set the these kind
of separators right now first of all
let's try to run our app and let's see
how it looks like so I'm going to run it
and you can see it looks like this ok so
now what we can do is we can write some
code for this thing so next step to add
some code so that these functions or
buttons or menu items must work so the
first thing what I'm going to do is I'm
going to remove these kind of this space
from the side you can see a little bit
of space here at the side of this text
adit right so I'm going to go to my edit
mode and I will go to a main window dos
CPP file and in the constructor I will
just say this dot set central with
widget ok
and the widget will be UI and your
TextEdit name okay and now let's run the
code again let's see or what happens
when we run the code so now you can see
the spaces are gone from the side right
so this is why I wanted to you know
write this code now the next step I will
go to main window dot UI file and I want
to add the trigger for every actions
right so if you remember how I used you
know trigger in actions you can just
right click on your action and then just
click this go-to slot and then you can
just choose triggered here right and
then click OK so it will create a
trigger for your every action so I will
just pause the video and I will provide
the trigger to each and every action
what we have here so I will just right
click on each of the actions and provide
the trigger to it ok so I have provided
a trigger to each and every action what
I have now the most may be complicated
part for this notepad would be creating
a new file or open a file so let's deal
with the simple stuff first and then we
will deal with the complicated stuff so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
provide the code for for example cut
copy paste and redo and undo let's check
how it works so I'm going to go to the
trigger which says action cut trigger
which is for my cut action and here I
will just write UI and then I will call
my text add it so just write text edit
and then just call cut okay so there is
a function called cut and that's it okay
so same I am going to do with paste also
so dot paste
this is no function and same I'm going
to do with the copy so on action copy so
I will just paste this code and then I
will just call copy function here right
same I will do for redo and undo so this
is my redo trigger so I will just call
redo function here and also undo
functions so I will just call our undo
function right now there are some more
you know functions here which you can
play with but right now we are just
creating a very simple you know notepad
there is this function called undo I
will label it will check if the undo is
available or not and it will give the
boolean value and if I undo is available
then it will say true or false and then
you can check if the undo is available
or not right but for now we will just
deal with the simple things right so
save and save as and open and new I will
leave for now and let's run the code and
let's see if this code works for cut
copy paste and redo and undo okay so
what I'm going to do is I will just
provide a some text here and first of
all I will cut its cutting and then I
will paste it so just paste it so it's
pasting and then I will just copy this
code and I will paste it again and it
spray pasting right and then I will just
click the undo button it will undo my
changes and then I will press the redo
button it redoing my things right so
undo and redo so all my buttons are
working and now the remaining thing is
new open save and save as and about
button so this we will see in the next
video I hope you've enjoyed this video
