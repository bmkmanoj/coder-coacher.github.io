video I will make our java mail program
a little bit interactive or user
friendly so what I have done in my
jframe is I have taken three text boxes
and I have labeled them as from 2 and
subject and this is for writing your
email text so I have done that and from
this I will take the email ID from of
the user and email ID of the recipient
and subject and I will write the text
here
and when I click the mail button my
email which I am written here will be
sent to the recipient
so for starting you can do like this you
have to take some text fields and text
area and assemble like this and now I
will go to my mail action perform method
and here at the top what I will write is
string
from from is equal to I will take its
variable name the from text field
variable name which is from and I will
paste it here dot get text so I will
copy this code four times because I need
this four times the second string we
will name as two and we will add the
recipients and press from here and in
third string will add subject and for
string write text of the message and
then I will take the variable name of
all text field and paste here
instant here this is right to ADT so it
can differentiate between the variable
here the subject and here my text area
where you be name which is next and I
will paste it here
and here also text to content so this
name should not conflict so what I have
taken what I have done is I have taken
the values from my text field and text
area and I have set it in to the form of
string and now go to your code and in
here we have written our your email id
gmail email ID and password this should
remain same you don't have to do
anything in this code but in the
try-catch block which i have shown in
the last video instead of this email ID
which is your email ID we will copy this
variable m from and we will paste it
here and then - we will paste it at the
place of recipients address which we
have written last time and in subject I
will copy the subject variable name and
paste it in place of subject and instead
of text I will copy it and paste it here
so what I am done is I have taken these
all the values I will write here I have
taken all these values in the form of
string and I have just replaced these
values here from to subject and
technical content
this was the port I've written last time
so if we in case you don't know and now
I will try and run the program
so here you can write your
which email address and the recipient
address and the subject and the text
whatever your text is you can write it
here so in this way you can make a
simple email form because I haven't
write my or I haven't given my email ID
and password here so this program will
not respond because my email ID and
password is not correct you can see user
name input not accepted and when I and
my real email ID and password here then
this program should run good so in this
way you can make your email Java mail
code interactive I hope you have learned
something new today and these very
company jobs and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
