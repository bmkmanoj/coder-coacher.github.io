video I will show you how to encrypt
texts and decrypt it by using our Java
program so what I'm talking about I will
tell you for example in this box I will
enter a simple text and I press this
encrypt button it converts my simple
text into the interrupted string and
when I press this decrypt button it
convert my encrypted string back to the
simple text so encryption and decryption
is very important when you are doing
some security data book so what is
encryption encryption encryption is a
technique by which you can send your
message without showing an unauthorized
person so if the other party have the
key of the encrypted data then it will
be able to decrypt it otherwise nobody
can decrypt your daughter so for the
sake of security we can use this
encryption and decryption now I will
tell you how I made this encryption and
description by using Java so what I have
done is I have taken three text boxes
first text box I have named simple text
second text box I have named encrypt
text and the third text box I named
decrypt text so in this will pass simple
text which will be converted and shown
into this text box and then when we
press this decrypt button this encrypted
string will be back in the same simple
text form in this text box these are two
button which I have named encrypt and
decrypt so take these five things from
your tool bar or your palate and now go
to your source and go at the top and for
this program you need to export these
three files import Java X dot crypto dot
sipper import Java X dot crypto dot spec
dot Ivy parameter spec and dot crypto
dot spec dot secret key spec otherwise
what you can do is just copy this part
of the code and just write dot star it
will take care of all the other things
which you have used in extension so just
do these imports or otherwise while you
are writing you just right-click your
mouse and just fix important will also
do your work now go down and when your
public class method start in the
starting
just below that just declare these
variables so this is the byte variable
and this is input this variable I will
use to enter my simple text data this
byte key byte which is a key you can
give your own key and you can give your
own IB bite these are the things which
are the keys to your encryption so if
the other party which you want to send
your message have this key and this IV
key then he would be able to decrypt
your message otherwise he could not be
able to decrypt your message so these
are like the keys of your data
okay so declare key bytes is equal to
whatever you want not get bytes and
might IV byte is equal to whatever you
want to set your data dot get by it so
this is what's for simple input this is
for your key and this is for IV which
are your special keys and your special I
mean if you want to learn more just go
to Wikipedia and learn about these keys
and what are sippers what are the key IV
is encryption decryption there are lot
of theory behind that so I'm just
showing the simple encryption decryption
metal now defined secret key spec key is
equal to new secret keys back in the
bracket key by its coma
double-quote des bitches in capital and
then define IV parameter spec these are
all kill sensitive so keep in mind IV
spec these are the variable name so you
can give your variable is equal to nu IV
parameter spec and this one comes from
here see this is here okay and this key
by it is from here and then define
stiffer and this is a encrypted in this
zipper will hold your encrypted data and
then might say for text int CT length
say for text and CT lens so the these
are the things you need to write on the
top of the your code so they will they
will be used as a global variable so
they can be used in any method which we
write down so these are global variables
so just pause your video if you want and
just copy these variables and if you get
some error
just right-click it and just fix import
and it will take care of the imports now
go to your design panel and just double
click your encrypt button double click
and you will go to the method of encrypt
method first of all you need to do is
make a try-catch block by the time I
think you know how to make the try-catch
block because this is I think 136 video
so I am sure you know what is a
try-catch block in the first line of the
try-catch block just rights security dot
add provider bracket new org dot bouncy
cast al e dot j c e dot provider dot
bouncy cast a li provider so this is a
type of security provider message which
we are providing here for this type of
message and now this is the input
variable which we have declared above at
the top of our program and is equal to
simple text which is this variable name
you can see a simple text the text field
variable name so in participant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
