Android SQLite database tutorial for
beginners in this video series I'm going
to show you how you can get started with
escalade using Android we will look in
this video series how we can create a
database and perform some database
queries like insertion updation or
deletion or other basic queries on
SQLite database using Android so let's
get started and let's see some important
stuff regarding SQLite on Android so
first of all what is SQLite as you all
know SQLite is our database which is an
open source database so you can use it
for free and it's a relational database
okay and the most important feature
about SQLite database is it's a local
database so it doesn't require any
server or any ODBC or JDBC queries for
query or connection for its you know
functionality it's just you can say it
saves its data into a text file and it's
saved locally on your you can say mobile
device or your tablet or whatever
Android device you are using and Android
comes with the built in SQLite database
implementation so you don't need to
install any extra libraries to use
SQLite with Android and the last point
is to create update a database in your
Android application you can create a
subclass of a class called SQLite open
helper this is a class which will help
us to create and you know manage our
SQLite database now enough
of the TV let's go to the practical part
and let's start with creating our app
from scratch so just open your Android
studio we are going to start a new
Android application and we will name our
application as SQLite app for example
and then click Next or select your
minimum SDK as you already know how to
select it click Next and I'm going to
select a blank activity next and main
activity is OK for me so I'm going to
finish now once your basic app is
created what we are going to do is we
are going to create a class for handling
the SQLite database so go to your app
folder and in the app folder go to the
Java folder and inside here go to the
package in which your main activity is
there so this is a package in which my
main activity is there so just go to the
package and right-click this package and
we are going to create a new Java class
and we will name it as database helper
class ok and click OK and this is a
basic blank class and in here as we have
discussed we want to create or we want
to extend this class using our SQLite
open helper so just go here and just
write extend SQLite open helper ok and
it will show some error because we
haven't imported the classes related to
this SQLite open helpers who just click
alt enter and just click this button
called import class and
is going to import this class okay
still it's showing error because we need
to create or implement some of the
method from it so you will be able to
see a small bulb red bulb here you just
need to click this bulb and then you
just need to click implement methods and
there are two important method related
to this class which are on create and on
upgrade we were going to select both of
them and click OK and one more thing
which is required is to create a default
constructor so once again click this red
bulb here and just choose create
constructor matching super ok and we are
going to select first of them and just
create it ok so we have successfully
created our database helper class which
extends from our SQLite open helper
which is the main class for handling
SQLite and we have some basic methods
here and a constructor now for creating
our database first of all we need our
database name now let's see how we can
you know of how we are going to create
our database and what will be the name
of our database and all other stuff so
for this for example to start with we
are going to create a SQLite database
like this and the name of the database
will be student dot DB the SQLite
database is not case-sensitive so you
can use upper cases and smaller cases
are together and it's not case sensitive
so case doesn't matter in SQLite ok so
the our database name will be a student
dot DB and it's going to contain four
columns first four
Eydie for the student second is the name
of wonder student third is the surname
or last name for the student and fourth
column will be the marks scored by the
student and we are going to create
database or insert some data like this
so ID will can be one two three four for
example name surnames and marks scored
by this student and in this video we
will just see how we can create this
database which is student dot DB and
create the table this table for our
database okay so now what we are going
to do is let's declare some variables so
that we can define the name of our
database so let's declare our variable
which we are going to assign the
database name okay so let's declare
public static final string and let's
declare a variable name called database
underscore name and we will assign the
name of our database for example student
dot DB student dot DB and I have told
you that case doesn't matter you can you
know write student dot DB root like this
or in capital it doesn't matter it's
going to treat them as same okay and
second what we are going to do is we are
going to declare our table name so this
will be our table name and let's give
the name to our table as student data
table or student table which will
resonate perfectly with our table and as
we have discussed this table is going to
contain 4 columns 1 2 3 4 and for
simplicity let's
keep all the variables as string first
column name was ID
okay so ID for the student and the table
name is column name is ID right so or
you can do something like this call
underscore one call one is ID and
similarly column two column 3 column 4
so like this column 2 column 3 column 4
first a first column was ID second
column was name third column was surname
and fourth column was marks ok so these
are the four column this is our table
name and this is our database name now
in order to create our database first
what we are going to do is we are going
to in the constructor we are going to
create our database so we need to call a
function which creates the database
right so for simplicity let's reduce our
constructor which only takes this
context ok and as you can see here the
superclass we can just give the name of
our database so our database name is
this variable pass it here third is
factory we are going to pass null here
and the version for example version is
equal to 1 now whenever this constructor
is called your data base will be created
ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
