show you how you can create your first
swing Java GUI application in IntelliJ
IDEA IDE so let's get started first of
all open your IntelliJ IDEA IDE and in
here we are going to create a new
project so just click new project here
and in here we need to choose the first
option which says Java ok and then we
just need to click Next and in here we
need to just click Next once again
because we don't want to choose any
default templates just click Next and in
here we just need to give the name to
our apps for example app swing ok and
then click finish so it's going to
create a blank Java project for us so
this is our project and inside our
project there is a source package or
source folder and we are going to create
a new package inside this folder and
then we are going to create a new class
inside the package so for example I am
going to just click on the source so I'm
going to right click on the source
folder and then I'm going to create a
new package and I'm going to name my
packages comm dot code bind for example
ok then click OK and then inside the
package we are going to create a new GUI
form so just right click new and search
for GUI form which is this option ok so
just click GUI form and then give the
name of your form for example app ok and
then click OK so it's going to create a
new GUI form for us so there are two
files created here app dot form and app
dot Java right so in the form we are
going to design our GUI and in the app
dot Java we are going to write some code
to add
some functionality to it now by default
this form contains one J panel and in
here you can see the layout of this J
panel is by default grid layout manager
so in order to you know pick and place
any component from the palette you need
to set first of all your layout using
this layout manager so there are some
layouts you can see here defined so for
now I will leave the default layout
which is grid layout manager here okay
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
add on J button here so I'm going to
just drag and drop a J button I was
going to just you know be placed inside
your J panel now let's give the name to
our J panel so by default you can see
field name and the J panel name is panel
1 for example so we can change the name
of our panel as for example panel mean
ok and the name to our button will be
for example button msg for message ok so
you can give the names which will be
like a ID to your button ok and when you
go to the app dot Java class here you
can see whatever name you have given
here they will be you know created in
your app dot java class so there will be
some private variables created whenever
you define the this name here ok so this
is a simple J panel inside which we have
a button so for example you want to show
some message when we click this button
so how do we do it first of all I want
to explain something about this palette
so from this
it you can see there are so many uh you
know components here like J panel
buttons J text fields text pane combo
box list and everything else which it
supports soon
whatever component you want from here
you just need to drag and drop here and
then you just need to give our listener
to this component so for example I want
to press this button and I want to show
some message so I will just right click
on this button and I'm going to add a
listener to it so just right click on
the button and then you see here it says
create listener so just click this
create listener and there are you know
list of listeners which buttons can
listen to so for example default
listener is action event so this is just
like clicking the button and then
component listener or focus listener or
input method listener item list the key
listener so there are few listeners for
the button so that it can listens for
some events so we are going to choose
the default listener which is action
listener so just click on this first
option and it's going to automatically
create a method for you you can see in
the background so just choose this
action performed and then click OK here
so this is going to create this method
by default for you ok so this is your
action listener method which is called
by your button which is this one right
and by default it overrides a function
which is action performed and inside
this action perform you can write some
code so for example we want to show some
message so there is a component in Java
swing which is called J option pane it's
like a message box which opens and shows
some message so J option pane dot show
Massey
dialogue so just call a method called
show message dialogue which takes two
argument which first is null which is
the context here and second is the
message for example you want to just
show the message helloworld so just
write hello world here and then save
your code now at this point your code
will not run because you don't have any
main method in your class so let's
create a main method in our class so
just go below this and just write public
static void main or you can just write P
as VM for public static void main and
then click or press our tab here which
is going to create this method for you
and inside your main method what we are
going to do is we are going to create on
J frames just write J frame and then
name your frame for example frame itself
is equal to new jframe and it takes one
argument which is the name of your app
for example app itself okay we take our
frame object and call a method called
set content pane here and we can set the
new content pane here so we want to call
that this you know object which is
jpanel
in here so we can just call our class
which is app and then we can call this
object which is panel mean now there is
a few more things remaining here one is
frame dot set closing method so just
write set default close operation and in
here just write J frame dot exit all
close okay and then once again take your
frame object and then call a method
called back so just call method call
back and at last just call your frame
and then we are going to set it visible
so setvisible is equal to true okay so
this is our main method and in which we
have defined the jframe and we have
called this panel inside the frame right
now save your code and we are going to
run it so just go here and then click
this Run button from here and it's going
to ask you for the class which we want
to run which is AB class and then it's
going to compile this class and then
it's going to run it ok so let's see it
runs so you can see there is a small you
know here frame appeared here and it's
like only button inside the frame so you
can just make it bigger for now and when
we click this button it's going to show
some message so it shows hello world
once again hello world ok so this is the
very basic program which you can create
in your IntelliJ IDEA IDE which is a GUI
swing application here so I hope you
