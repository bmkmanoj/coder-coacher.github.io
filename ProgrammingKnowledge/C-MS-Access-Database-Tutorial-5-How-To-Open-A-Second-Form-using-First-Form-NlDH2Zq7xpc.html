last video I have shown you how you can
add pictures and icons to your form and
button here and I have also shown you
how you can change this small icon here
you can see on the form and this icon
now in this video I will show you how
you can redirect your application to the
second page
when this username and password is
correct okay
so till now whenever we give username
and password and when we click this
login button it just shows us this
username and password this correct
message but now I want you to show I
want to show you that if this username
and password is correct I want to
redirect I want to close this form which
is login form and I want to open a
second form which will be some kind of a
access form for admin or whatever
employees where he can see some data so
how can I do that I will show you in
this video so let's get started what I
am going to do first is I'm going to
create a new form so I will go to my
project right-click your project first
here and go to add add new item and this
will open a wizard here and we can
choose our form here so just choose this
windows form and this form name will be
a default form - I will leave it as
default but you can change this from
nail name ik as according to your
application so in my case I will leave
it as default but you can change it and
I will add this form to my project
and now this is my second form and I
want to open the second form whenever my
username and password validation is
successful for now I will leave this
form as blank but in this second form we
are going to see lot of things in the
coming videos for example how to save
the data in the database I will make the
code in this form second form okay so
now you have the second form I will go
to the first form design and then the
second video of this series I have shown
shown you how you can check or validate
your username and password and show
these messages username and password is
correct or duplicate username and
password so if you don't know this code
just go to the second video and watch it
and now I want to redirect when username
and password is correct to the second
form so I will go to this condition
where I have if count is equal to zero
and I was showing username and password
is correct just below this code I want
to write the code to open the second
form right so this is logic whenever
your username and password is correct it
will go to the second form otherwise you
don't want to do anything and this
message will be shown and your form will
not close and will not go anywhere
so first the first thing we need to do
here below this username and password
this correct is to close your connection
with the database it's always good to
close your connection first with the
database and then go to the second form
so you already know that I have this
connection object which is oledb
connection object which I have shown you
in the first video so I will just copy
this connection dot close code and I
will paste it here which is which is
below this code message box but show
username and password
so what this will do this will close the
connection with your database and the
second thing I will do is I will just
copy this connection object and I will
say dot dispos and what this dispose
does is it releases all the resources
used by your component so all the
resources will be released which are
used in this form and then I will hide
this form so how can I hide how can I
hide this form I can use this this
keyword this keyword indicates or this
keyword points to the current class you
are m-dot hide so this this got hide
will hide your form and now you want to
open your second form so your second
form name is form - right so you can see
your second form name is form - and you
can go to the source of this second form
by right-clicking and going to the new
code and in here the second form of
class name is form right here so I will
just copy this form to class name go to
the code once again to the form one and
go to this connection dispose and high
this ID code and just below this I will
declare an object of this form - so I
will write form - for example and I will
write F 2 as an object is equal to new
form
- ok and then I will use this form to
object to open this form - so I will
save F 2 dot
show dialog show dialog and this will
open our forum - whenever username and
password is successful so let's try and
run the program once again and let's
give the username and the password
and for example I gave the wrong
username at first place right this is
the wrong username and when I click this
login button it says username and
password is not correct and will not go
to the other second forum which we have
created and this is what we want if the
username and password is not correct we
don't want to give the access to the
second forum but if the username and
password is correct so now I have given
the username incorrect username and
password and you can see it shows the
message username and password is correct
and when I click this ok just see what
happens it opens the second forum and
your first forum is hidden or the first
forum hides and socking form opens ok
so you can do it like this and I will
also show you how to create a sign out
button so you can redirect to the first
page in the coming videos but yeah now
this is how you can open the second
forum so I hope you have enjoyed this
video please rate comment subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
