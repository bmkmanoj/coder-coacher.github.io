show you how you can install Java in
your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
system so let's get started first of all
if you don't have Java and you want to
check whether Java is already there in
your system or not there is a small
little test you can do if Java is really
present in your system or not so what
you need to do is you need to go to your
Start screen here and go at the bottom
right and search for command prompt this
is my command prompt I will open it and
this is not what I want it to open here
so this is a command prompt and in here
type java c java c is command to compile
Java programs and if you enter Java C
and press ENTER here and if you see Java
C is not recognized as an internal or
external command then Java is probably
not present in your system or you can
even even give a command Java and if it
doesn't run then you know that Java is
not present in your Windows operating
system so how you can download this Java
in your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 just
open your browser and in the search just
search for Java JDK download ok and the
first link you will find here is
www.hyken.com slash tech Network slash
Java so this is the link you need to
click here
and this will open this website just
agree and proceed and in here there are
versioned for Java so if you want you
can install Java with this man means IDE
that means IDE is a development platform
IDE is the short-form for integrated
development environment so it's in Java
program editor if you want to install
you can install it but for now I want to
show you how you can install Java in
your system right so you need to click
this at the time of making this video
the latest version for Java is Java 8 so
this is we are going to install Java 8
in our system ok so just click this Java
platform JDK and click this icon here
for download
and we will reach to the download
section so here you will find Java SE
development kit 8 download and in here
you will find the version for your
Windows system so if you have a 64-bit
system then you need to install this a
x86 or if you have 64-bit operating
system you need to install this so I
have 64 bits so I will install access to
86 I will just click this link and I
will click ok so first of all I need to
accept the license condition you see so
I will accept the license condition and
then I will be able to download this so
I will click this download link for
Windows 64 and it will take around 1
minute to download and once this
download is complete we will be ready to
install Java JDK so I will let this run
and download and once it's complete I
will show you how you can install Java
ok so once this download is complete you
are ready to install Java I will just
click this executable file which I have
downloaded and I will start the
installation and now the installation of
Java JDK 8 has started just just click
Next
default tool just click Next
and the process is going on
the poor developing java-based program
you need to have Java in your operating
system to compile the program related to
Java so that's why we need to install
Java in our system there are some
application which need to run on Java
that's why also we want to have Java in
our operating system
so installing the class preparing
install and you see there this is the
link where Java is will be installed c /
program file / java and it will also
install JRE 8 for you which is Java
Runtime environment 8 which will help
your programs to run on your machine so
click Next
and saying three billion devices run
Chava
and I will let this process complete
and once this process is complete you
see yes you will be able to see this
message Java SE development kit updates
successfully installed so now this Java
8 or JDK 8 is successfully install in
your system just close this window and
to check whether it's really installed
in your system you can go to this file
explorer and in here go to the C disk or
local disk and go to Program Files and
in here you will be able to see this
folder which is called Java ok and there
will be two folder inside here one is
jdk 1.8 depending upon the version of
java jdk and second is JRE folder and
inside this JDK folder there is a bin
and you will be able to see Java C here
so this is what we want to compile our
programs and all the binary related to
Java resides here so what I'm going to
do is I will just rename this folder JDK
bit because it's a little bit big so I
will make it a little bit simple
right-click and rename and I will just
nee name it as JDK 8 right so because
it's Jenny Kade
okay now in order to use this on your or
you in order to use these binaries in
your system what you need to do is you
need to set the environment variable in
your Windows operating system so how you
can set environment variable in Windows
operating system for Java what you need
to do is just once again go to your
Start screen and search for search for
system system and you will see first
link your system
and in here in the systems window you
need to go to advanced system settings
and in here you need to go to an
environment variable to set the
environment variables so click the small
button here environment variable and in
the system variable section here this is
a system variable section search for
path so search for this row called path
and double click this row and in here
you need to give the part of the binary
files for Java in order to recognize
that Java is present in your system ok
so what you need to do is just go add
very last of these lines so I will go at
the last so in here at the last I will
give the same semicolon and I will give
the part of the JDK files so just put
the semicolon go and open the Java
folder where you have installed Java go
to JDK 8 and binary and just copy this
path here so I will copy this path from
here and go to system once again and in
here you need to paste the spot same
which is C colon slash program file
slash Java slash JDK 8 slash bin ok and
now you can click OK
okay and okay okay so now you have set
your environment variables now you are
ready to run Java or you have installed
Java and set the environment variable
for Java now to check once again that
Java is really installed in your system
just open your command prompt once again
and once again check it with the command
Java C and press Enter and it's saying
once again Java C is not recognized
let's see why maybe I have forgot the
slash here so I need to give in the
environment variable path
and after this bin let me see what I
need to do so I don't think this is this
/ is the problem here it should be like
this but I think I need to reopen my
command prompt because it was running
and the session was old for this command
from so I need to reopen this session
once again and then I will be good to go
I think so I will reopen the command
prompt once again
come on prompt and now I will type Java
C and now you will be able to see
different commands you can see above
these are the different you know Java C
options to compile a java program
generally you use Java C the command
with the source file and options so that
if you want to compile your Java program
you see you write Java C and the source
file name and then it will be compiled
but there are some better ways to
compile your program using some IDE for
example NetBeans or Eclipse so in the
later videos or in some other video I
will also show you how you can install
eclipse or NetBeans in your Windows 8
operating system but now when ever use
give Java C and you see a bunch of these
commands you know that Java is installed
in your system and you can compile your
java programs using this java c command
so i hope you have enjoyed this video
