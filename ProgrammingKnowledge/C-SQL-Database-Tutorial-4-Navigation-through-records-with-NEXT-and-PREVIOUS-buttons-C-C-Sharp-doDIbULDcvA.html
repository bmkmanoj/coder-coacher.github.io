last video I have shown you how to show
the number of rows in your database
tables in real time in your C shop
windows form application with local
database so for example we have 4 rows
in our database table it shows four row
there are four rows in the table and
when I delete some row it will
immediately change or update the number
of rows okay so that's real-time now in
this video I will show you how to add
next and previous button to your
database C shop application it will just
work like this so for example this
button moves the data next or previous
these buttons we will add the
functionality same like these buttons to
our application now you must be thinking
that if these button are present here
you can just select this button and just
check what's there in the button click
event but when you see in the button
click event there is no code available
for you okay or when you double click it
in here also there is no code available
right so I will show you how to make
these button or manually and how to
write the code for these button so I
will go to the toolbox I will take two
buttons
one button I will say for example this
button and I will go to its properties
and I will change its text as next and I
will also change its name as next button
and this also as previous button and I
will change the text of this button as
button previous okay so we have next
button and previous button so first of
all I will just click this next button
and I will say here just copy this name
of your binding source so the name of
your binding source may be whatever your
table name is and then the binding so so
just select binding source and copy the
name of the binding source and paste it
here and just add a dot and say move
next okay and break it closed and in
here you just close it with these
brackets same thing you will do for the
previous button so just copy this
binding source dot move last okay
and now when you run the program and
when I click Next
it's moving next and when I click
previous or it's we have written here
move last this should be instead of
moved last we should have written here
move previous so just delete move last
and add move previous here and now it
should work properly so run the program
next when you click Next and then from
previous button it goes to previous
right but suppose you just have one line
or one row of data then you don't need
these next and previous button so what
you can do is in the last video I have
shown you how to add this counter which
counts the number of rows and I have
added a timer tick event here so in your
timer tick event just go there in the
timer tick event and if you don't know
how I added this time at a given just
watched the last video and I also added
this count which was counting the number
of rows okay so now depending on the
number of rows I will say if my count
which is the number of rows in the table
is smaller or is greater than two
because there should be minimum to two
rows so that we can use previous or next
button right so just add a bracket and
just
copy the name of your button which is
next and previous button so first next
and I will copy the name of this next
button and I will say next button dot
visible is equal to false okay and in
the same way I will say for previous
button also previous button name and I
will say previous button also dot
visible is equal to false so it will
disappear these buttons if it's less
than so just make it less than 2 and
else you can say else make it visible
okay and I will break it here okay
so now when I run the program you see
here there is no button because my
condition is here it should be true okay
so if my number of rows is less than 2
in the database it will not show these
button for next and previous and when in
any other case it will show those
buttons so when I run the program right
now you can see the buttons because we
have more than two rows and you can use
this next in previous button let's
delete some data so I delete this data
and I delete this data and it's right
now also it's equal to two so it's not
agreeing with this condition which is
less than two so if our data is less
than two see here it will just remove
these buttons so just select this and I
will delete it and you see here there is
no next button present here but when I
click add new it appears two buttons or
you will be able to see these two
buttons when you add new data in the
database right so in this way you can
add next and previous button and use
them with your local database
application I hope you have enjoyed this
