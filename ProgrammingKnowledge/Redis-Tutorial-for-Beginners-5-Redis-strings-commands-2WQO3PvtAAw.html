register tool for beginners in the last
few videos we have seen how we can
download and install radish on our
Windows Linux and Mac operating system
now further videos I will be making on
my Linux operating system that is my
urban to operating system because more
frequently or most frequently this
raddest server is installed on a Linux
machine and it's used from a Linux
machine so it will be more appropriate
to go further with the Linux operating
system but all the command which I will
be using on this Linux operating system
using the command line are applicable on
the Windows terminal also and the Mac
terminal also so that command will not
change and you just need to start the
radius server and ready CLI on your
Windows or Mac OS and then follow the
instruction which I am giving on my
urban to operating system so if you are
on Windows or Mac you just need to
follow the same steps you just need to
open two terminals on your operating
system it can be Mac or it can be your
Windows and of course the Linux and on
one terminal you just need to start the
Redis server so I'm going to just start
the ready server here and on the other
one you just need to start the Redis CLI
okay so looks simple right the same
steps you need to do on your Windows or
your Mac okay so once our server is
running we can minimize this and start
working to interact with the server
using the raddest CLI okay now let's
start with the data types which are
there in Redis and then we will see how
we can use one of the data type which is
string so basically there are five data
types which we can use in Redis and as I
already told you that Redis is
key value storage so the T is a
printable ASCII right and it can be up
to 512 megabyte so it can take a really
big key for example and it should be a
printable ASCII and then we can see the
data types of values so the values can
be strings and then the containers of
string so they can be hashes or lists or
sets or sorted sets right so the key are
printable ASCII we can use printable
ASCII is for keys and for values we can
use strings hashes list
sets and sorted sets right and this
ready string can be up to 512 megabyte
okay now let's start with the practical
example so we will start with the basics
and we will try to set some values and
get some values so for example I have
set some values already to this Redis
server so what I will do is to get all
the keys which are set you just need to
write keys and then the pattern which is
Asterix here so ex-fix is a wild card
and it's going to search all the keys
which are saved in your database and
then give you the results so for example
I have set two keys which is name and
name too and it has given me both the
keys which I have saved right so in
order to see all the keys which are
saved in your Redis database you just
need to write keys and Astrix right now
as I already told you that to set some
value as a string you just need to use
set and then a key for example in this
case
I'm going to write name three because
name and name one is already set so I'm
going to just set the third key which is
name three and then I'm going to give
some name right and then press Enter
and then once again I will just write
keys Astrix and now I can see there are
three key stored in my database right so
set is to set a string value and as you
have already guessed from my previous
videos I have shown you this command
which is get command and whatever key
you will write here will give you the
value of that key which is mark in this
case right in the same way you can do
name to get name to and it's going to
give you the value of name - okay so get
and set we are already clear now there
is a delete command del okay so using a
del and the key name we can delete some
key value pair so for example I want to
delete name - for now and then I will
just press Enter it's going to give me
the number of keys affected and in this
case there is only one key with the name
- and now when I just do this command
which is keys Asterix now it just gives
me two values which is name and main 3
and because name to key is already
deleted so I will not see this mean -
again right in the same way for example
I want to delete name three key then
also I can do del and then name 3 and
then press Enter and I can see the
result one key affected and then now
only one key left which is name ok so
this is how you can delete some value
right now let's set these names once
again
for example name come and once again do
the get for example get mean now you
will see that the key value of name is
overwritten with the name Tom so
previously the value of name was mark
you can see here and now it's Tom so
whenever you set the value of previously
set key then whatever value you will
give for this key will be overwritten
right so value will be overwritten for
that key now for example if you want to
delete all the values which are stored
in our Redis database then we can use
flush all come on so for example I will
set some more values or to see this
example for example name 2 is equal to
John and then I'm going to give name XI
is equal to max' so now we have 3 names
so we can just give keys and strikes to
see that so we have 3 keys stored right
now for example I want to delete all
these keys then I can give flush also
just write flush all command and then
it's going to delete all the values so
it says ok and then once again when we
give keys Astrix then you can see empty
list or set so all the values are
deleted using flush all commands so
these are some of the most frequently
used commands which we can use with the
strings in the next video also we will
see some of the more commands which we
can use with the string values so stay
tuned and please recommend subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
