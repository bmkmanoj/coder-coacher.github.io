cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
use combo box in QT so let's get started
I have created a blank project and I'm
going to go to my main window dot UI
file and in here I will search for combo
box so just write Co and you will be
able to find combo box here so drag and
drop into your main window this is a
combo box right now how we can add items
to the combo box so we are going to go
to our main window dot CPP file and in
the constructor here what we can do is
we can just write UI and call combo box
from here and we have a function called
add item which takes a few eye items so
you can give for example you can see
here there is a little hint right it
takes first argument as icon and second
argument as the string right and then
you can just press the down button and
we have the second overload for the
function which is a string so we are
going to use this function which takes
the strain right so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to add an item for example
I am going to just add a name here right
and save my program and run it and let's
see what happens so most probably it
will add this item to the combo box
which is mark which is one name right in
the same way you can add multiple items
here for example you can just copy and
paste several times and then just change
the names here write some names
something like this and run it once
again and you will be able to see all
these items added to your combo box
right fairly easy right now the second
option I wanted to show you is it takes
the icon so it has two overloads one for
the icon and string and
second was for only the string so how we
can add icons to our combo box items so
for that we need some resources some
icon files so I am what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go to my project and I'm
going to go to add new and I'm going to
add a resource so in the QT we have
resource file choose name the resource
location resource itself and next and
then click finish it will add this
resource to your project right now we
can add a prefix first of all for
example prefix will be our EC for
resources and then we can add some files
so I already have some files in the
project so I will just add the files and
I will choose this folder in which I
have the files which is inside my
project by the way and I will choose
these icons and click open which will
add these resources I hope you know how
to do is because I have shown you
several number of times how you can use
resources right now what I need to do is
I need to go to my main window dot CPP
file and here I can add these icons
right so the first argument I can add
icon so how can I add a icon I can use a
queue icon class just use queue icon and
in the constructor we can give the
location of the icon something like this
so the I can we have here is these icons
so I'm going to just pick one of the
images or icons here and right click on
it and I will copy the path of it which
is like this price so just click this
option which will copy the part and I
will paste it here right in a same way I
will add these icons to other other
items also these are just icons you can
choose your icons right so I'm not
you know worried about what are the
icons here so I will just copy this and
let's paste it here
third icon I will just copy this and
paste it here right and then I will run
the app and let's see if the icons are
added or not so you can see the icons
are added this is for first name second
name and third name right so in this way
you can add icons to your combo box
items now if you want to do using a for
loop you can also do this so for example
for and then int I is equal to 0 and
then I for example if the I is less than
10 and I plus plus and then we want to
add some icons here items here right so
I will just write UI combo box and then
add item and here I can add some items
so how I can do this
because this I is a number and this
takes a string right add item takes a
string and I is a number what I can do
here is I can just convert this I into a
string using cue strings so just write
in cue string with a capital S which is
this one cue string and then it has a
member called number just use this which
will convert this I into a number so
inside this bracket it just passed this
I which is this here right and then you
can just add a string for example to
indicate something so for example name
right and for now I am just commenting
these item which I have added using the
add item right so now I'm going to run
my app let's see what happens and you
can see these items are added to my list
so from 0 to 9 because the value of I
start from 0 and it goes up to 9 but if
it's less than 10 then it's ok otherwise
you know it will not add it right for
loop now if you wanted to add the icons
to it I'm just going to just simply take
this I it I can and paste it here and
run it it will add this icon here so the
same icon so you can see the icon is
added ok now how this combo box will
work for example I want to listen to a
button click event so I will just use a
push button here so I will just add a
push button and I will right click here
and then go to slot and I will choose
clicked and click OK and in here what I
will do is first of all let me include
cue message box so include cue message
box okay so it will allow me to use cue
message box so just use this cue message
box and then you can just say
information and then first our argument
is this second is the title here and the
third is for example we want to show the
current item which is chosen using the
combo box so what we can do is you can
just write UI and then choose combo box
and then use current item text or
current text which is this one right so
this will show the current item text on
the message box so let's run it
and once we run it and choose any item
in the combo box for example I choose
the seventh item seven name right and I
press the push button it shows seven
name right so or otherwise to name and
it will show the current text on the
item on the combo box right now there
are some more function you can use here
for example current index or something
like this so for example if you want to
choose a current index which is okay
here and let's run it and hopefully it
will run it shows the error because this
returns are integer and the message box
except our number so we will use the
same method q string number and then
convert this integer to a number right
now it will run okay
so let's run it and let's see what
happens once again it will show the
index index is nothing but the you know
the position of the item so the first
position of the combo box item is 0th
position so it starts from 0 1 2 3 4 so
whatever item you will choose it will
show the index of this item right and
you can you know play with these
functions and see what you can do with
it there's one more interesting function
in the combo box which is insert item so
what I will do here is you see I have
added 10 items from 0 to 9 using this
for loop now for example for some reason
I want to change one of the item text
right how I can do this so I can just
use UI and then combo box and for
example I want to change the you know
text of item 3 for example so what I can
do is I can just write insert items
instead of add item and it takes first
argument as index index starts from 0 1
2
so I want the third item to change so I
will write three and the rest of them
are the same the icon name so for
example this is the icon I want and the
text on it so for example new text okay
and save your program and run it again
and let's see what happens so it runs
and you can see the third item zero one
two three
the text is changed right and for
example you wanted to change the icon
itself you can do it simply so you can
just change the icon here and run it and
let's see what happens so now the icon
is also changed right so in this way you
can use a combo box in QT I hope you've
