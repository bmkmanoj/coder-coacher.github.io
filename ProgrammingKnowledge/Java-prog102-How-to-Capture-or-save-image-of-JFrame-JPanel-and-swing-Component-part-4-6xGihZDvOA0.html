and this close
and here you have to pass two parameters
so first parameter will be your J
component name so I have given my panel
which I have in which I have enclosed
everything so the panel name was I will
see it my panel in the starting I have
given this name so once again I will
show you how to copy go to change
variable name and copy and just go to
your take pick action perform the third
and just paste it here and second thing
is comma you need to give your image
some name so I will name my images as my
panel image not B and G because it's a
PNG file and it's showing some error it
says that I haven't got my method so I
will right try and catch block
catch
so my error is gone now so what it will
do is it will take the picture of your
panel and save it with the name my panel
image so now I will run my program
this is
my program and I will go to take pick
and I will click it and buy this whole
panel which contains tables buttons and
all its PNG picture will be saved in my
source file so what I will do is I will
go to my source file which contains my
also scored and build directories and I
will search for my image
and this is my image which I have named
my panel image and I will click and open
it and you can see this image is open so
this picture is saved as PNG so in this
way you can save the picture of your
panel J component everything I will show
you next example so suppose for example
I just want to take a picture of this
button panel so I will just copy its
name I will name it as button pen can
have a copy its name and I mean go to my
source code and I will go to button
source code and I will write once again
see if
screenshot and then pause my button
panel inside it , I will give my images
some name so I will name it as button
panel only dot Eng and I will close it
out so in this way you can capture any J
component and I will run the program
this is my program and I will click take
thick so it has taken a pic off my
button panel and I will search for it
this is my button panel I will see it
and you can see only my button panel
picture is saved so in this way you can
save any J component picture in the form
of PNG so this was a tutorial on how to
save your J component in the form of
images I hope you have enjoyed and
