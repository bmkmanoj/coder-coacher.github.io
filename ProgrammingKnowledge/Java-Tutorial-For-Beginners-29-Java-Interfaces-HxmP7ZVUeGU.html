tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are interfaces and how we can use
interfaces in Java so an interface is
same as an abstract class as abstract
class cannot be instantiated and is the
interface also cannot be incident
instantiated so for making an interface
for example we have been seeing this
example from our last videos and we have
a bang class which is our superclass and
when we define this class as an abstract
class this bang class cannot be
instantiated we have seen in the last
video now in place of doing so many
things like declaring abstract public
class we can just use a keyword called
public interface and then it makes your
interface something like this and all
the method inside an interface are
abstract by nature okay so you don't
need to add a keyword abstract in any
member method of the interface like this
all the method or all the members of the
interface are abstract by nature so in
the last video we have seen if the
methods are abstract then we need to
implement this in the subclass in which
we are inheriting right now let's start
from the beginning so I am going to
delete all the classes which I made
earlier and then I'm going to
make an interface okay so in eclipse you
can make interspace by just going to the
package in which your main loss is or
main method is and just right-click it
and you can just go to new and click
interface here and you can give the name
to your interface for example we will
give the name to our interface as bank
as we have given in the last video to
our abstract superclass okay so this is
the basic definition of interface and
whatever method you define inside the
interface like get interest rate it's
automatically abstract by nature okay so
whenever you want to inherit from the
interface so interface only can be
implemented not can be extended so when
we define a class for example we will
define a new class for Bank interface
and this class we will name it as Bank
ABC for example and we want to inherit
from the interface this interface
because this is an interface there is no
class keyword in here in the bank
interface right so you cannot extend
from a interface in a class you need to
implement the interface so you need to
use the keyword implement implements
something like this okay and then you
can implement your Bank interface and
you will be good to go now because we
have this get interface
get the interest rate method inside our
interface we need to define or give the
definition of this get interest rate in
our sub class also because all the
methods inside our interface are
abstract by nature right so you need to
give definition something like this and
return some interest rate and then your
definition will be okay now it says you
cannot have reduce the visibility let's
say by because this should be public by
nature so we just need to add public
keyword and then it's okay so whenever
you want to inherit from the interface
use the keyword implement uh rather than
extends okay and whenever you want to
inherit from the interface to an
interface you can use the keyword extend
so just bear in mind whenever you to
class you have two classes class and
class and both are you know you want to
inherit one class from another then you
use extends okay if you have interface
as a base class and you have class as
sub class you need to use implement
implements and if you have two
interfaces interfaces and interfaces
interface and interface then you can use
extend okay so simple rule is if the
both subclass and superclass are classes
or interface then
cell both are same you use extent and if
the superclasses interface and subclass
is your class then you use implement
keyword here okay so this is how you can
use interface or and interfaces are
abstract by nature so they also cannot
be instantiated so if you want to
instantiate Bank Bank something like
this is equal to new Bank it's not
possible because it's just an interface
and interfaces are abstract by Nature
okay so this is how we can use interface
in Java I hope you have enjoyed this
