last few videos I have been showing you
how to make a registration page in
asp.net and how to link it with the
database now in this video I will show
you how to make a login page which
verifies the username and password from
the database and then redirect you to
the secure access page which you want to
show after the login so let's get
started by creating the login page first
of all so I will go to my project right
click it and I will say the add new item
and will show me this dialog box I will
choose webform and I will say this is my
login form so login dot aspx and I will
say add and once again this is a blank
form so I will say this will be my login
page and I can change the font also
first of all I make it bold and I will
say they should be extra-large 36 et
okay and I can also change the
justification or justify Center so this
will always be in the center now we are
having our heading now we will add a
table to our page so I will say in third
table this time also we will take three
columns and let's take four rows and
click OK and first of all I will say
user name second row will be password
and
okay for now we are okay with this so I
will select this and this both the rows
and I will say justify right now I will
go to my standard tool box and I will
take a text box here and text box for
the password
okay now I have both the text boxes I
select both text boxes and I will say
width is equal to 1/8 t PX property is
wrong because this should be 0 okay now
this is done now I will take a
validation tool this all this thing I
have also shown you in the registration
form so I will just make it a little bit
faster I will take a required field
value data 1 &amp;amp; 2
and I will change the text so I will go
select my required field validator and I
will change the error message as please
and the user name and second is second
error message is please enter password
okay now I have posted things I will
change first of all the ID of this text
box so I know which text box I am
talking about first text box name is use
a name text box user name and sexes
second text box ID is text box password
okay
now I'm done with that I will link my a
quite field validator with this textbox
so I will select my required field value
data and I will say control to validate
and I will still choose textbox username
from here and second required field
validator or password I will choose
control to validate will be my textbox
password and here I will select my
password field and I will say the text
mode of this is password so your
character doesn't show once this is done
I will take a button from my standard
tool box and I will say this will be my
login button and I will change also the
ID button underscore login okay so now
we are ready with our login page you can
just also change the font size of these
two also so I will select my required
field validator
I will go to the for for color and I
will say red okay now this is done once
your login page is designed just like
your login button and double click it
and first of all I will add here using
system dot data dot SQL client dot SQL
client okay and second is I will add
second namespace as system dot
configuration okay
now once you are done with that let's
try and write the code for this button
login click event so for that what I
will do is whatever code I have written
for the registration page for the
database connection I will copy and
paste it here also because it will be
the same more or less same not exactly
same so I will just copy whatever I have
written in page load event okay
I'm not copying button click event code
which I have written for database but I
am copying this page load event and
accept or inside this if is post back
condition so I will copy this I will go
through the code also so don't worry if
you haven't seen it and I will go to my
Loeb login dot aspx dot CS form and I
will paste my code here let me make it a
little bit wider and bigger so you will
be able to see it so first of all I will
just declare my SQL connection Korn is
equal to new SQL connection and I will
say as an argument I will pass
configuration manager dot connection
strings and in the square bracket I am
passing my registration connection
string which this is the connection
string from the my database if you have
some confusion you you can see my
previous videos and you will be able to
know what this registration connection
string is and after the square bracket
just right dot connection string and
close the bracket and now we will open
our connection with the database so
right conn dot open and in the next line
we prepare our query so i will write
String check user is equal to and this
is the query which we have let me open
this server Explorer so we will see the
database also at the same time so I will
right here select count and in the
bracket I will say stars from my table
name so this is my table name from the
database where username is equal to now
it will take some time to open so what I
wanted to show you in the solution
Explorer that we have made this table
called user data in the earlier videos
and it has five column ID username email
password and country right so what a
query I am writing is select count in
the bracket star from my table name
which is this where username which is
this column name is equal to whatever I
enter in the username text box so now my
user name textbox is little bit
different in the login form so I will
select my username text box and I will
copy my textbox ID and I will paste it
here so we remove the error so write
where username is equal to single quote
in between double quote plus plus and
then write this text box store text okay
and in the next video I will prepare a
command
so I will write SQL command dot which is
comm the object name is equal to new SQL
command and I will pass my query as the
first argument and second argument is
the connection with the database now I
will
right int temp is equal to convert dot
two in 32 and the argument right calm
which is this calm dot execute scaler
dot two string and I will close my
connection okay and earlier what we are
doing is if the user already exists then
we say user already exists
okay now this time what we will do is
inside this stamp is equal to 1 we will
write the code once again for verifying
the user name and password so let's try
and code the user login code so what I
will write here is first of all I will
open the connection once again so I will
write con not open and in the second
line I will make my query
so I will write string I will say check
password query for example long name is
equal to and double quote and semicolon
and in here I will write the query I
will say select password from my table
name which is user data where my
username is equal to whatever I enter in
the text box I will copy just the same
code and I will paste here instead of
this okay so my query looks like this
and in the next line what I will do is I
will just copy this
SQL command and I will paste it here and
instead of this query I will just
replace this query by this and I will
change the constant come come on name so
I will say pass calm now okay this is
done now what I will do is I will write
in the next line string because we are
verifying the string and then we will
say pass word is equal to and then I
will say we copy my password command dot
execute scalar and
make it dot to string okay once this is
done then it will pass your password in
this string from this query so whatever
user name you write here in the text box
it will search in the database and it
will find the password and then it will
give you in this string because we are
saying this selects password from the
user table right okay now in the next
line we will verify the password from
the password which you user has entered
in the password text box so what I will
do is I will give a if condition if and
let me close the brackets I will say if
my password which of this password is
equal to the password which user has
entered so I will just select my
password text field and I will copy my
ID for the text P text field for the
password and then I will say text box
password dot text so if this password
matches the password which user has
entered that means our password is
correct
right so here we will say response dot
right and we will say password
first of all double quote and then I
will say pass word is correct okay so
once this is done we know that our
password is correct right
and if this is not the case then we will
write else I will give the response
password is not correct right so I will
just copy response but right and I will
say password is not correct and after
this if condition where we have written
F temp is equal to 1 we will say here
also else and we will make a bracket and
here also we will give the response that
if username is not present so you say
username is not current so all right
username is not correct okay so once
this all is done let me make a new
session also after the login is correct
your login is correct yes right fashion
and the square bracket right new is
equal to and what
ever is your text box for the user name
ID is so text box user name dot text
okay so now this is done I think this
will work this code is now done so let's
try and run the program so I will run my
program from here or I will go to my
login page and I will right-click it and
I will say view in the browser so right
click and view in browser and I will say
yes I want to save the data and it opens
my login page hopefully no error occurs
okay so there is no error let me see
what that I have in the database so I
will go to my solution Explorer
I will right-click my table and say show
table data it will show me the data
which is there in the table so I have
user name admin and with respect to the
admin I have the password one two three
four five so let me enter this username
admin so I will write admin and the
password is one two three four five and
I will say login and it's saying
password is not correct why it's saying
this I have observed sometimes when you
enter your username and password it this
string password has some space is
unwanted spaces which you don't want so
just right here string password is equal
to password dot execute scalar dot to
string and just right after this to
string dot
right to replace and what we are going
to replace is we are going to replace
all the single spaces with no space
right so just right double quote and
give us space and in the second argument
just write no space okay now once again
right-click and view in the browser yes
and this time I will say my username in
is admin and password is one two three
four five why it's not in turn I will
say one two three four five and say
login and now you can see my password is
correct
okay so sometimes this phenomena comes
if this phenomena comes you need to
replace all the spaces with no spaces
okay let's try some other username and
passwords for example mark which have
the same password let's try it for this
Julie and four times three okay let's
try username and the password
three three three three and I will say
login and he says password is correct
let me enter the wrong password so I
will enter some random password and I
will login and this time it says
password is not correct
let me not enter anything in the
password field and it says please enter
the password when ice and nothing in the
username it says please enter the
username what next you can do is one
more thing you can do if your password
is correct you can redirect your user to
the new page
so for example I will write this pawn
store redirect and for example this is
an example I will create or you can
create a new page which is exclusively
for the login user so I will say double
quote and select any page for example
manager so I will write manager dot aspx
and let me try and run the program once
again view in browser and username is
admin password is one two three four
five and when I login it will lead me or
redirect me to the new page so let's try
and you can see there is manager page so
in this page it you can design your own
data which is which the only login user
can see okay so now I have shown you how
to login create a login page and how to
login with the verification of username
and password I hope you enjoyed this
