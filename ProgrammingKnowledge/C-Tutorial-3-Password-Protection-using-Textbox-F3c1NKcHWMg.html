last video I have shown you how to make
a simple login form with your c-sharp
and MySQL database application and when
I enter the password and user name it
will check for the username and password
and if the username and password is
correct and it shows me the message that
this is correct
okay but remember last time I have told
you that this password what I am writing
here is visible so anybody could be able
to recognize this password but I don't
want that I want something like star to
appear in place of my real password so
my password is always hidden from others
so how can I achieve this within the C
shop application I will show you right
now so let's go to the main form and
just select your password text box here
and then go to the properties and go to
its name and copy this name ok so just
copy this and then go to the code for
this frame so just double click it and
you go at the top and I will search for
the function where my initial is
component function is called so go in
that public your frame name bracket and
this brackets and wherever your
initialized component function is there
this is a default function with c-sharp
creates automatically and this is the
function which initializes all the
components so just go there and just
below that paste your password text name
okay and then right dot password care so
this one password care is equal to
single quotes and in here in between the
single quote you can provide your
special character which whatever you
want to show instead of your password so
for example I want to show this dollar
sign instead of my password so I will
write this dollar symbol here okay and
one more thing you can do is to restrict
the number of character you can enter in
the text box field so for example you
don't want a long password to be entered
with your application you just want to
enter the password which is having the
length maximum ten character can be
entered so just once again write
password
underscore text this is your text box
name dot
max length is equal to 10 for example
you can define it according to yourself
according to your convenience so for
example I'm defining 10 so my
application or my password text field
will not take more than 10 characters
when I will enter the password so write
these two lines wherever your initialize
component is their function is there and
when I run my code once again let's see
I will write my user name and I will
write my password so when I enter my
password it will show this dollar symbol
okay and I will enter try to enter more
than 10 characters so count with me 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 it will not go
beyond 11 because it's restricted to 10
characters okay so in this way you can
provide a password protection for your
c-sharp login application and when I
enter our correct login username and
password and when I press login it will
say user name and password is correct so
in this way you can protect your
password I think you have enjoyed this
