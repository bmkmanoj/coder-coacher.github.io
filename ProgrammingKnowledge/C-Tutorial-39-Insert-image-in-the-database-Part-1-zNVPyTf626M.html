following this video till now I have
been writing the code to add delete and
update the data from c-sharp to my MySQL
database so this is the code I I have
written till now to save delete or
update data so whenever I enter some
data here I can save it and delete it
and update it now in this video I will
show you how to insert image into your
MySQL database with the help of your C
shop application so what I mean is I
want to choose a image which is present
in my PC or computer and that image I
want to save it into my MySQL database
and then later I want to retrieve that
image once again so that I could be able
to see it once again when I want to
retrieve that image so let's see how we
can achieve that first of all I will
close this application make this a
little bit smaller so we are not using
this so we need this till here and now
we want to add our image with this data
so take a picture box from here to here
and resize it so this picture box will
hold the picture which we are going to
select and
take a button and we will change the
text of this button as
load image for example so this will load
the image into this picture box so this
is the first part of the code suppose
selecting the picture so just double
click this button and in here write this
code this is just to open a Open File
dialog and choose a picture from your
computer or PC okay if we want we don't
want to give this title also okay
so write Open File dialog dialog and
then is equal to new Open File dialog
and in here copy this variable name here
dot filter is equal to jpg file and
bracket dot jpg bracket close or then
once again star dot JB jpg or PNG files
in the bracket star dot PNG bracket
close or dot star dot PNG or all files
and in the bracket star dot star or star
dot star so what this code will do is it
will filter your files because we are
using this dialog box only to choose
pictures so that's why I am choosing the
picture format jpg or PNG or all files
so when you're opened I'll file dialog
will open it will show the option jpg or
PNG or
all files so I will show you that in a
moment what this line means and then
right if if dialogue dot show dialogue
is equal to dialogue dot okay then in
the bracket right string take load or
you can say pick path this is the path
of your picture so string pick path and
dialogue dot file name to string okay so
what this will do is this will copy the
file path into this string okay and then
copy the name of your picture box which
is this picture box and paste it here
and write dot image location is equal to
this path so what this line is doing is
it's just providing the path of the
picture and it's loading this picture
into this picture box so write this code
to select the picture and load the
picture into the picture box so if you
are done with this code then we will
test this so username password correct
and I will when I click this load image
here you can see it sets the filter jpg
or PNG or all files so that's why I have
given those filters to it okay so for
example I want to choose PNG files and I
want to choose this picture so it has
loaded a picture into my picture box
okay and that picture now I want to save
it in the database okay so now we will
write the next part of this code so once
again first of all let's see what we
have in the database so if you are
following this video I am using this
database in MySQL or demonstrating in
this video and I have this table
employee data until ha now I have added
employee ID name surname age and we have
this username and password gender of the
employee and date of birth of the
employee but now I want to add the image
of the employee so I will add a new
column so I will right-click and alter
table and in here I will add a new body
called image and the data type of this
image is a blob this block contains
binary data so that's why I am choosing
this blob button data type so just do
that name name of the column and data
type blob and just apply that and finish
so now I have added one more column for
the images in my database now I want to
add the image or save the image into the
start of this so let's see how can we do
that so I will go to my code once again
now the second part is saving these
images so if you are following these
videos in the video number 6 I have
shown you how to save data into the
the base certainly we have been adding
the strings or integers or date into the
database so this button when we click it
double click it this is the code for
saving the data into the database so
this code if you don't know I have shown
you in the video number six and in the
later videos I have added how to add
date into the database also basic code
if you don't know then you will find it
in the video number six so I will add
some new things into this code and the
rest of the code will remain same okay
so if you don't know then go to video
number six and copy that code now I mean
come to the form once again and here I
will add one more text box to save the
location to see the location of the
chosen file so I have added this text
box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
