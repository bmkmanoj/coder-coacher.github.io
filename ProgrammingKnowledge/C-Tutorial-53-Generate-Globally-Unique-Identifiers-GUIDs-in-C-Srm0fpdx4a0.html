video I will show you how to generate a
globally unique identifier or GUI knee
with your c-sharp application so the
first question comes into mind is what
is a GU ID or a globally unique
identifier so if you search on Wikipedia
according to Wikipedia definition a
unique ID or a globally unique
identifier or geo ID is a unique
reference number which is used as an
identifier in computer science so
whatever you GU ID you will generate it
will be usually of 128-bit values and
it's shown in 32 hexadecimal digits and
whatever GU ID you generate it's
believed to be unique so it's unique for
every user or as you generate UID from
your computer it is believed that this
GU ID will be unique and only possessed
or generated by that computer only so GU
ID is can can be used in many
application where the uniqueness of a
particular object is required for
example we have been working on the
MySQL database with c-sharp application
and I have been showing you this
database in MySQL and how to use this
database with the C sharp application so
one use of GID could be you can assign a
Geo ID to a particular employee so that
that unique ID ID a unique identifier
can only be possessed by only one
employee and that geo ID cannot be
just by other employee so you could be
able to distinguish two employees even
if they have the same name or surname or
everything the same but that unique ID
will be different so that can be one I
use for gyd
and you can think of the use different
uses of gyd in your application so let's
make a chord with generates gyd so for
what first of all I will take a button
and I will change it text as create gyd
so every time I click this button it
must generate a new GID every time
different gyd for me so hi how can I do
this I will just double click this
button and I reach to the button click
event of this button and here I will
write the code so right
spring I will name my string as new GUI
D is equal to system dot GUI d dot new
gyd dot or first of all bracket and then
to string ok because your GUI D is a
hexadecimal number it is represented in
hexadecimal that's why I am converting
my GUI D into string by this code so not
to string is converting my hexadecimal
into the string which I want to show and
now I want to show this geo gyd every
time when I click this button so I will
show it with the help of message box
message box
daaad show bracket bracket closed and
just double click this on copy this new
GID
string variable and paste it inside your
message box ok and now when you run your
program
it runs and give you the name and ID is
correct and when I press this button it
should generate a GU IDR globally unique
identifier for me so let's see yes it
has generated a globally unique
identifier and it every time i press
this create g ID button it will generate
a different gyd for me so every time are
different gyd okay but in many of the
useful a player application you don't
want to show these dashes in between
your gyd you just want to show it as a
continuous code without these dash in
between so how to remove these dashes I
will show you now so just in the code
which you have written go after to
string and here we will write dot
replace bracket and bracket closed and
in here we will pass two arguments one
and two sorry one and
and in here first argument you will pass
which you want to replace you want to
replace your - and second argument you
will write what character you want to
replace the - width so I don't I want to
replace my - with nothing that's why I
am leaving these double quotes empty so
it will just remove my - from my gyd
and let's see how now my gyd looks like
so when I click this screen geo ID it is
a continuous hexadecimal digit number
with no - in between but still it looks
a little weird because the hexadecimal
number or hexadecimal codes are
generally represented in capital letters
so the C or D or F I want to represent
as a capital letter or uppercase letter
so now I will show you how to change
this lowercase letter to uppercase
letter
so we'll just close this and then I mean
once again go to my code and I will
write here after my replace code right
dot to upper okay
and break it and break it close I think
okay so write this and now when you run
your program and when you click this
button it gives me the Geo ID which is a
hexadecimal code in capital letters
wherever any letters are present so this
geo ID is more useful and whatever what
I can use in my application so this is
very useful code for gyd okay so you can
use a raju ideal so you can use it with
dashes you can use it with small letter
also but i have shown you how to convert
this GID in different form according to
your use so I hope you have enjoyed this
