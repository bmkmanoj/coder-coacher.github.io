tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video we will discuss about
scope rules in C now there are two kinds
of variable declaration in C one is
called a local variable which we have
been seeing in our tutorial and one is
called global variable so for example
local variable is a variable which you
declare inside some function so inside
for example in main you can declare int
a is equal to 10 it is called a local
variable okay
so what is called local variable okay
now whenever you declare a variable
which is not inside any function it is
called a global variable okay
so for example I declare a function
which is not inside main or I will
declare one more function in for example
or void void number print it doesn't
take any argument and prints something
okay and here we can declare a variable
called X or a variable called int or any
variable int a and this is also all
local local variable right because it's
declared inside your function but
whenever you declare a variable for
example in G it is called a global
variable okay which is not inside any
function and what is difference between
global and local variable is a local
variable is only valid inside your
function so it's local
to your function so you cannot use this
a inside this number or you cannot dis
use this X inside this main function or
anywhere else but on the other hand a
global variable is visible to every
function in our program so you can use
this global variable here also and here
also now let's see what I mean by that
so for example I want to print i declare
global variable as 0 or for example i
just declare a global variable and just
remember i will just comment here global
variable and always remember whenever
you declare a global variable and it's
initialized by 0 if it's int float or
double its already initialized by 0 you
don't need to initialize it by 0 but a
local variable
whenever you declare it the like this it
is not initialized by a 0 so this
variable can contain any value any
garbage value and you may not know the
value of this a so let's see first of
all we will print print f we will print
the value of this global variable global
is equal to percentage D and this should
be percentage D without space and comma
G we are printing this value right in a
same way we will print this local
variable so we will write local and we
will print a ok or let us name them
logically so I will
am this variable as global underscore of
V and I will name it as local underscore
V local underscore V stands for local
variable and local and global underscore
V stands for global variable so I use
this global variable to print here or
let us not print it here but let's print
this global variable value in our main
function because we are not going to
call this function for now and there
should be local variable and remember we
haven't initialized this and this by any
value let's see what happens when we run
this program we can see that this
variable local is equal to 77 let me
give one more thing here which is this
/n to change the line and I will run the
program and you can see this local
variable is printing 77 but we haven't
initialize this local variable by any
value so it's taking the garbage value
but whenever you use this global
variable it's always initialized by zero
even if you haven't assigned any value
to it so just remember this and if it's
a character it will be initialized by a
null character and if it's a pointer
which we are going to learn in next
videos it will be initialized by a null
pointer now a global variable so for
example you or declare this global
valuable is equal to 25 here you
initialized it and you also initialized
a local variable like this global
variables with the same name but this is
is equal to 20 for example
and I will just comment this because we
do not need this line so what we have
done we have initialized the globe
variable called global V and initialize
it by 25 and the same name I have given
to my local variable now what happens in
this case so in this case whatever value
is contained by your local variable even
if it's declared with the same name
globally it will the value of this
global V will be the value in the local
variable right so whenever we print this
this value will print 20 here so local
variable is always has the preference
over the global variable if they have
the same name I will run the program and
it says 20 instead of 25 right now for
example you want to use global variable
inside this function I will just print
this here so I will print something like
global variable plus 50 for example okay
and I will name it as global plus 50
okay and so what this will do it will
print whatever the value of global
variable which is 25 plus it will add 50
to it and I will call this function here
and it's visible to this function so we
can see global plus 50 is 75 it's
printing so global variable is visible
to your functions and all all your
functions and all AR code right but
local variable is you know you cannot
use it globally for example in num
local is equal to 30 for example and if
you want to use this local variable here
you want to print this local num here it
will give you compilation error because
this variable is not visible to this
main function because it this exists in
other function other than mean right run
it and it says the this error and this
error is num underscore local undeclared
right so you cannot use a local variable
in your other functions right so these
are the scope rules in C I hope you have
