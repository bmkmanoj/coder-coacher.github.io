last video I'm showing you how to use
this password care property with your
text box so when I run the program and
when I type some password it will hide
the password from other viewers and it
will show some special character which
you set in the password field now in
this video I will show you how to open a
second form on successful login so for
example when I run the program and I
enter some username and password and
I'll click login button and it says
username and password is correct at this
point I want to open a second form when
the username and password is correct and
I want to allow my user to see some
special data and if the username and
password is not correct nothing will
happen it will just say username and
password is not correct and it will stay
on this login page and it will not go on
the second page with the user access so
let's see how we can do it first of all
let's create a second form so I will go
to my solution Explorer here and I will
click my project and I will right-click
my project and I will go to this ad and
I will say add new item and in this add
new item wizard which will open I will
go to windows form here and I will
select windows form from here and I will
leave this form as default which is
formed - and I will say add the
to create a second form which is formed
to dot we be here now this is a page I
want to open or this is the form I want
to open from the first login form yeah
for example I will add a label for
showing the second page and I will edit
it SEC text as second form okay and
maybe I can change the font size so that
we can see that it's a second form bold
16 now you can see let's make it bigger
okay now I want to open the second from
from the first form when the login and
use login password and user IDs correct
so in the last video when I when I have
shown you how to create a login page in
this I have shown you this code for the
login and what you need to do is you
need to go to the line where we are
showing the message username and
password is correct so whenever our
condition is true for the username and
password is correct just we were showing
this message that username and password
is correct just go below that line and
in here just right form to dot show what
this line will do is it will open the
second form when the username and
password is correct when the condition
is true for the correct username and
password and what we want now is we want
to hide this login form right so what we
can do is we can
right me dot hide and what this code
will do is it will hide the current form
which is you are in which in which you
are in which is log in pill form so
let's try to run the program and see how
it works I provide the correct username
and password and I say or for example I
provide first of all wrong password and
wrong username and I click login button
and it says username and password is not
correct and we stays on the same login
form right and for in the second time
for example we enter the right username
and password and when we click this
login button it says username and
password is correct and when I click
open it will hide the first form and it
will open the second form right the same
in the same way for example you want to
go from your second form to your first
form what you can do is just open your
second form and add a button and you can
say this is my sign out button right and
when I double click this in here you can
write form 1 dot show and me dot tied ok
and now when you run the program
whenever you enter your username
password correct
it shows the correct username and
password it opens the second form and
when you click the Sign Out button you
come to the first form
and the second form disappears right so
in this way you can make a mechanism of
sign out and opening the second form on
the validation of username and password
so this is the video and I think that's
it for this video
I hope you have learned something new
