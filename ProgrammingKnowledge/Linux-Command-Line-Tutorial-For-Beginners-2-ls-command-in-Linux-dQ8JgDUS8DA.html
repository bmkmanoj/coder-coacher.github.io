Linux command line tutorial for
beginners and in this video we will
learn about LS command LS is a linux
shell command that lists directory
contents of files and directories now
first of all let's open our terminal I
have told you in the last video if you
press ctrl alt T then it's going to open
your terminal so just press ctrl alt T
to open the terminal now for the Alice
command you need to know some syntax so
we all know that Alice command can be
given by just writing Alice on the
terminal but it has some options so
these options will come in as a second
argument so we can say here comes the
options right and then comes the file or
directory name so you can say here comes
the file or directory name so you can
write FD ok so LS command comes with
options first and then files and
directory now I will show you what I
mean by that so first of all simple LS
command will you know work like this
only which lists the content of a
directory so we are you know whenever we
open the terminal we are in the home
directory right so we can just say LS
and it looks oh us the contents of our
home directory which is the desktop or
other document directory or you know
downloads or other directories the same
when you open this folder when you click
here it will also open the home
directory and you will be able to see
all the contents of the directories here
so these all the you know contents are
here also this so whatever you see here
will be listed here also ok now the
second
option or using LLS command is by using
a directory name for example we want to
see the contents of this document
directory right so our document
directory contains these two files so
how we can list the content of this
document directory you can just write LS
and then just write documents and then
press enter and it will list all the
files which are there in the documents
directory right in a same way if you
want to list out all the contents in the
downloads folder then I will just say LS
downloads okay and press ENTER it will
show us the contents of the Downloads
folder right so simple now if you want
to list out all the contents of our root
folder as I have shown you in the last
video you just need to give LS and then
forward slash which is our root
directory right and press Enter it will
show us the content of our root
directory and in here you can verify
this by going to this computer option
and you can match all the directories
here and here right now by default as I
already told you we whenever we open the
terminal we are in the home you know
directory right now home directory you
can just give a PWD command and it will
give you what is your home directory and
this is your home directory right right
so you are presently in your home
directory now in other terms when you
you know want to list out the content of
home directory you can just say LS and
then give this tilde symbol which will
also give you the same content as LS
will give you so let's print out LS
first but let me clear all the commands
which I have
were given earlier so to clear the
terminal you just need to write clear
here so just write clear and press ENTER
and who clear your terminal and clear
means your terminal will be you know
blank but when you scroll up all the you
know all the commands are there so clear
means it will just scroll down a little
and it will blank out your terminal for
you so let's list out again so LS so it
gives me the content of my home
directory and when in whenever you give
Alice and this tilde symbol
thus tilde also means the home directory
so whenever you press ENTER it will give
you the same content and whenever you do
LS and you can type the path prove you
know by yourself so home programming
knowledge which is my home directory
once again and when I press ENTER it
will give me the same directory
structure right so there are three
command to list out the same thing one
is LS which will give you all the
contents of your home directory when you
open your terminal right and then Alice
tilde which will be also giving you the
same content so this tilde means though
your home directory and also your you
can type the home directory file path
something like this now let's see some
options so whenever you want to go
inside some directory as I have done so
I will just say LS document and you can
just list out anything but you can just
write LS and then dot dot and this dot
dot means you want to print out one step
back directory structure right so
whenever you press LS like this it will
give you programming knowledge because
right now we are in home and then
programming knowledge so whenever we
want to print the content of
home folder then we just need to give
these to dad dots it'll tell you just
one folder back right if you want to go
two folders back and you want to list
out the content of two folders back
content then you can do dot dot and then
forward slash and once again dot dot and
then press enter and you can see it will
give you your root directory
you know directories and file structure
so this will you know go to the root
directory because right now we are in
home our home you know directory so
whenever you go one step back you will
be here in your home and once back once
again you will be in your root folder ok
once again I will clear the screen and
then we will move forward now there is
so are some flags or options as I have
told you you can use with Alice files so
for example you give LS - L and this
means you want to list out all the files
and directories in long format and when
you press ENTER it will give you the
listings in long format let me just make
it a little bit bigger and I will give
it once again this come also clear and
LS - L and it gives you the you know
content in long format long format means
it will give you the details so who is
your you know user what are the rights
for this file and what is the size of
your file and at which date this file
was created and the time that which this
file is created right now you may be
wondering what is this dr w XR or what
are all these things so you can see
there these are the user rights so these
users rights are separated by this -
symbol so the first you know this thing
which is d rwx
R so what does this mean so D means
directory here R means read w means
write X means execute and once again R
means right
so these are the rights of the owner
owner means so whoever is logged in so I
can you know read write execute this
directory which is desktop right second
is the group right after this - right so
execute and read are the rights of the
group and then the third is for the
others which is only execute this
directory okay so this is how you can
you know list out the long list of files
and directories now there is one more
command which is Alice - a and this will
give you the hidden files also so this
will show you the hidden files also so
just write LS - a it will give you all
the hidden files so these are dots and
double dots and dot Android and dot bash
history logout dot cache these are all
the hidden files so hidden files in
Linux start from dot okay and they will
not be shown here you can see these dot
files are not here so whenever you give
LS - a it will give you all the hidden
files right and then you can combines
the option so whenever you give LS - a
for showing the hidden file and then L
for showing the long list then it will
give you the hidden file and long list
combined combined
okay so press enter and will give you
long list and hidden file right
something like this I will make it
little bit bigger so you can see it okay
and I will just clear the terminal once
I
in now there are some more commands for
example you can sort your directory by
their size so I will just give LS - L
for long list and then when you give
capital S it will sort your directory by
their size so press enter and you can
see the file which has the biggest size
is listed first and then they will go
down as according to the size so
whatever file has the lowest sizes will
be at the bottom and whatever files or
directory has the biggest size it will
go at the top right so you can sort it
something like this now for example we
want to you know list something which
only we know the extension arm so let's
list for example you can just write LS
once again we will list out document
list so just write documents and press
ENTER and this document has this test
dot HTML and test dot CS file but for
example I want to only list out all the
HTML files which are there in the
document folder so what I can do so I
can just write LS and then I can just
write documents and then I will just
give this wild card which is Asterix so
which will be will search for all the
prefix which are there right and then I
will just write dot and then I will just
write HTML so this means I want to
search for all the files which ends with
dot HTML and then I will press ENTER and
it only prints out this test dot HTML
which is correct because we wanted to
print out only HTML files in the other
way when you give Asterix dot X tricks
which means all the files so whatever
all the extensions and all the names
right and press ENTER it will list out
these two files which are
they're in your documents directory
right now
you can also output the content of your
LS to a file so for example I want to
you know save all the result which I
have listed here to some files I will
write LS - for example al with capital S
and then I want to save all the content
to a file so I can just give this angle
bracket and then the name of the file
which I want to you know save these
content to so I will just say out dot
txt by the way this out dot txt is not
existing here so it will create this out
dot txt and then fill all the result of
LS command to this you know out dot txt
file so this arrow means the direction
of the stream so it will put all the
content into the output right and press
ENTER and you will be able to see we
have one new file created which is out
dot txt and when I open this file then
it will just you know fill all the
result of LS - LS command
- this output file right so you can do
this or you can output the content of
the file also to a file now the next
command is to list out only the
directories so for example you want to
just list out only the directories you
can just give LS - D and then you just
need to give asterisks and forward slash
and it will list out all the direct C
directories ok so you can see it's not
listing out the files but only the
directories right so these are the all
the important commands related to Alice
but this is not all Alice is you know
having more options and flags and if you
want to know more about this
LS command what you can do so you I will
just clear the terminal first of all and
to know more about this Alice command
you can just write man and then Alice so
men is you know is that you can say the
dictionary kind of a thing for your
Linux commands right
and when anyway you give this man
command and then give the command name
which you want to see or you want to
take the reference off then when name
when you click enter here it will give
you all the options which you can use
with LS so you can see LS - list
directory contents so this is the
explanation of this and then you can see
all the flags so I have shown you how to
use - a but I haven't shown you how to
use - B so you can find out all the you
know important information what this - B
does or what this - C does or what this
- D does so D as I have shown you less
directory entries right and I have also
shown you what L does so I have only
shown you the important comma related to
LS but there is a big list which you can
you know execute with this LS command so
you just need to write am man and then
LS and it will give you this kind of
interface which you can see the
reference right and you can see at the
bottom whenever you press Q or write
quit then you quit this man terminal so
I will just press Q which will quit the
terminal right so just remember this man
command if you want to take the
reference of all the all the you know
references or particular commands so I
