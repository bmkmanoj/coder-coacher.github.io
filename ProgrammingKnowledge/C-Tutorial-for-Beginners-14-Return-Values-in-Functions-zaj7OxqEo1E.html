last two videos I have been teaching you
about using functions in c++ in this
video also I am will be talking about
function and in this specific video I
will show you how to declare and use a
function which returns values so let's
get started
you by now you already know how to
declare a function so this time we are
going to make the sum of two numbers so
we will make a function which adds two
number and returns the sum in the main
program so first of all we need to
decide what we want to return in the
last video if you noticed we were
returning void but this time we want to
return some value so this is not void of
it this is not null value but this will
be some values for example I want to
return int this time so this is called
the return value whatever data type you
want to return just write in the
declaration here and then write the name
of the function for example sum and once
again if you want to pass two parameter
just give the Declaration of those two
parameters here so int first number and
int second number okay and because we
are returning this time int here we need
to return some value in order to execute
the function okay so this because we are
returning something instead of void we
need to write this return here or
whatever you want to return so this time
what I am going to do is I will take the
sum of these two
numbers and I will make some and return
the value here so let's see what Howard
can do it I will declare a third
variable called make or I will say this
is my result which is initialized as
zero okay so that there will be no
confusion there will be no garbage
garbage value in sight result then what
I will do is I will write
result equal to the first number plus
the second number okay
so what this is doing I have declared
integer as a result and I am storing the
addition of first parameter and second
parameter inside this result and now
what I am going to do is because this is
this parameter fold my result and this
function is supposed to get int in
return I will just return this result
like this okay so this is basic
definition to return a function if you
want to return int then you need to
declare or function or declare a
variable or return only the variable
which is of data type int if you return
here some decimal value that will give
you error because this function is
expecting integer in return right the
left let now let's write or let's call
this function inside your main function
so what I am going to do is
for example I want to declare one more
variable
for example multiply from mul T Eli and
then what I'm going to do is I am going
to call this function so I will call
this function here and I will pass two
parameters first number and second
number so for example I pass first in
digit 253 and second integer 456 and
because we are returning some value here
what I can do is I can say let's
initialize this by 2 so my x value is
initialized by 2 and I will say mean I
will declare one more variable int main
result okay
and this main result will contain the
result so what I am going to do is I
will say main result is equal to this
multiplied variable in two so for
multiplication we use Astrix remember
and then I am going to take this
function and paste it here so what this
function will do is let me show you
first of all the simple way this will be
a little bit complex to understand for
the first time so let me use C out and I
will say
the result is and then I will call this
some function and I pass these two
values here and then I will end line
okay so what this will do is this will
call this function add these two values
and return the result in here so return
the result means sum or the result will
be printed here so for example I compile
this program and run it it will show me
the sum of these two values right so
what this function is doing it's taking
these two values making the sum of these
two values and the result it's returning
as an int and it holds the result as an
integer so whenever you call this
function it will return you the sum
right now for example I want to multiply
whatever if this function is returning
to my variable multiplying okay so now I
can use this multiply result is equal to
multiply into because this function is
returning integer I can use it as a
variable okay so this you can think of
it as an integer because it's returning
in teaser which is the sum of these two
values right so I can multiply it by
another integer and I can store the
product in the third variable called
mean result and I will just copy this
and instead of this I can paste it here
so the main result is now
the product of whatever the sum of this
and the multiplier variable now I will
just build the program and run it and
now you can see first of all it makes
the sum of these two numbers and then it
multiplies this number by two and then
it stores the multiplication in this
variable and we are calling this
variable here so it will show the result
in this form so remember this thing that
whenever you return something you need
to give the returning value same of same
data-type whatever you have declared
here if you have declared double here
you need to return double value okay and
then whatever the function is returning
you can add this function or multiply
this function to the other variable
because it's returning something in our
case it's returning integer okay so
that's how you can return value using
functions I hope you have enjoyed this
