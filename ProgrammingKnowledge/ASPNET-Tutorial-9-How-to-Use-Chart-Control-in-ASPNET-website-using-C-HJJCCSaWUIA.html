video I will show you how to add a chart
control to your asp.net she shop a
website application so till now we have
made a database and linked it with your
ASP website and I have also shown you
how to make the master page and login
page to your ASP website now earlier I
have shown you I have created our
registration dot mdf database and I have
one table inside this database which is
user data and when I see the content of
this data it has some of the users data
but I haven't added some column in this
which from which I can make a chart
control so I'm going to make a new table
and using that table in the database I
am going to make a chart control so
let's get started in the table or go to
your data base in the solution server
Explorer and go to your database and
click table and right click your table
and add new table from here and here I
will add new tables called name ID this
is the first column of the table and the
second column of the table is name
itself and third column of the table is
age for example this will be a second
column and the third column is age okay
and age has the data type in teacher so
I will choose int from here
let's say int and name can be of fifty
characters and name ID will also be an
integer okay and once you have made
these columns I will just save my data
table and I will say this is my name
data table and I will click okay so now
I have two tables one is name data and
one is user data okay and let's fill
this name data with some data so I will
right-click my table and I will say show
table data and in here I will add some
new data so for example one and the age
is something and then name ID two and
age and name ID three and name ID four
so four columns we are going to add
okay so now we have added four rows of
data in the database and we will save
our data by clicking the Save button and
now let's try to make a Chow chart out
of this table data so I will go to
manager dot aspx you can make a new page
for showing the data and I will say show
designer of you designer and in here let
me make it a little bit bigger from here
okay and I will go to the toolbox and I
will search for that chart control from
here in the data you will find the chart
control drag and drop into your page
where ever you want to show this chart
and just resize it okay so now my chart
is resized now what I am going to do is
I need to link my database with this
chart so what I will do is I will select
this chart and just click this small
arrow at the right top end of this chart
and I will choose a new data source for
it so new data source is SQL data source
registration which is my registration
database and let's say I am going to say
configure data source and this is my
registration connection string which is
okay I will say next
and in here I need to choose my database
so we have made a new database called
name data so I will select this name
data table okay so you can choose either
user or name data but I'm choosing name
data and it has name ID in name and age
so I will select this star from here and
I will click Next and now I will just
test my query if it's working or not yes
it's working because it's giving me the
data and I will say finish okay and yes
so now what I will do is here I can
choose the type of chart which I want to
show so I can choose column chart or
line chart or whatever pie chart stock
range anything so far for our first
application let's choose the column
chart itself and x-axis will be the name
and y axis will be the age okay it's as
simple as that and now when I right
click my page and view in the browser I
will say yes save my daughter
and it's saying server is currently
offline so let's make it run for example
first it's offline right now okay so my
other servers was running that's why it
was not running this page so I stopped
my previous server and now once again
when I right click and view it in the
browser I will be able to see this chart
and I have this names these names mark
Julie Paul and Jack and their ages with
respect to the table so you can see here
mark has aged 23 so you it's yeah it
aged 23
Julie has 33 age you will be able to see
it here and Paul has aged 45 and jack
has aged 38 now you can change the type
of this database also for example I want
to see now the pie chart so just select
this pie chart and once again view in
the browser yes and now you will be able
to see the pie chart and one more thing
if you want to see these this data in
the 3d format you can do it also so go
to your chart and go to the source of
your aspx page and wherever you have
your chart so search for the chart here
this is my chart which is chart area
named chart area one you will be able to
find this line I will make it a little
bit bigger so you have chart area so you
have the stack chart area and inside
this you have the chart control right
and go here and just make a little space
and I will say area 3d style
- enable 3d and is equal to true so when
I make this as 3d true and when I run
the program once again in the browser
you will be able to three see a 3d graph
or 3d chart you see here it's a kind of
3d and it will show better and in the
short in line chart or in bar chart so I
will select this column chart and now
when I run the program
it's showing me the chart in 3d right so
that's also option you can choose many
or design your chart in other ways also
you just have to play with the code so
in this way you can use this chart
control with your aspx or asp.net
application I hope you have enjoyed this
