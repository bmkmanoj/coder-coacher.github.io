last video I have shown you how to show
messages with your C++ GUI program with
cute so when I click this show message
button it shows me the message what I
want to display in the message box in
the previous videos I have also shown
you how to use signal and slot like this
and how to use this button to set the
text on this label in this video I will
show you how to open a new window by a
button click from your first or main
window so suppose I want to open a new
window and when I click button like this
it should open the new window also so
let's get started first thing I am going
to do is I will create a new window
because I have till now only one window
which is my main window and I want to
create a second window so that I can
open it from my main window so I will
right-click my project and I will say
add new and in here I can choose what I
want
so I go to Qt and QT designer form with
class so click this and click Choose and
you can choose different kind of windows
dialog with buttons button and dialog
with button right dialogue without
button
and main window and widgets also so you
can see the preview also the dialog with
button button looks like this and the
dialogue with button right looked like
this and the dialogue without button is
the plain dialogue and main window has
the status bar in toolbar and a widget
I'm going to choose this dialogue
without button and I will click Next
and here I can give the name to my class
for examples second dialogue so SEC
dialogue okay and I click Next and I
click finish so it has created a second
dialogue for me so I have two windows
one is my main window one is my second
window and I can drag and drop some
widget from here to here for example
this and now I going to go to my added
and you can see my mean and the second
UI so what I want is I want to open the
second UI from my main so I will click
mean and for opening I will take a
button from here and I will double click
it and I can change the text of this
button or caption of this button so I
say open
second win for window okay and I can
resize my push button like this and now
I right-click it and I click go to slot
all and I go to click so when I click
this button the second form should open
so I choose click I click OK and we
reach to this void main on push button 3
click event so first of all as in all
C++ program we include the CPP file or
this header file for this second dialog
so I will go at the top in my main
window dot CPP and I go at the top and I
say hash include' and this sign and I
say second dialog dot H which is the
name of my dialogue ok now I can create
the object for this second dialogue so I
write second dialogue and I can create
the object
chicken dialogue so I have created a
object for my this second dialogue class
and then I use this object to open my
second window so I go copy and paste
this object and I write dot set model
and I will write true so it will set the
second window here and now I want to
show it so I write second dialogue dot e
x ec so this will show my dialogue when
I press this button so this approach for
showing your second dialogue or second
window is called model approach there is
one other approach called model less
approach which I am going to show you
next but this method this code is for
model approach so let me explain you
what is model approach I will just build
my program first I save all and it
builds my program see here and I have
some errors so whenever you get if you
get any error while building this code
then what you need to do is a simple
procedure you just go to your build here
and click it and just clean your code so
just click clean all and once again
click run Q make
okay so it will run cumec and once again
when you build your program build all
your build will be successful and it
will no more show the error so if this
code is is showing any error for linking
file or link file error then just do the
clean first and then run this queue make
and then build your program and
hopefully the problem will go so once
again I will run my program and now this
time it runs and when I click this
button it should open my second window
click it and its opening my second
window so what is a modulus or model
approach so when you open the second
window you could not move or you could
not go to the first window when you
click this it will not allow to go to
first window when you close this second
window then you can move this first
window so this is called a model
approach when you cannot move or go to
the first window without losing your
second window now this time I will show
you the second approach which is the
model less approach so that you can open
different instances of second and you
can go to any window main or second at
any time so let's see how we can do that
so for the model less approach let's
comment these line of code because for
model less approach we need the
different code from this little bit
different but not totally different so
what you need to do is go to your main
window dot H which is your main form
code header file so go to main window
dot edge and just include the second
dialogue dot edge which is our second
form header file so write include second
dialogue dot H in your main window dot H
right so do that and we are going to
create a object for second dialogue here
so write SEC dialogue and write pointer
and then give it the object name so SEC
SEC dialogue object name so this time we
are creating our object in the main
window dot H file and we are giving it
the point object so it will work in the
heap memory right and now go to your
main window once again and we go to the
same on push button click event where we
have written this model approach for
opening the second window and once again
I will give the name of my object which
I have created in my main window dot
edge so I write SEC dialogue object is
equal to new SEC dialogue this is the
class and here in the bracket I will
pass this okay so I write this and then
we can just copy this object once again
and this time we are not providing dot
pointer but we will provide this arrow
pointer and give show function okay so
this method which will model approach in
this we are dealing with the stack
memory or stack yeah stack memory and in
the model s approach we are dealing with
heap memory so whenever you are dealing
with heap memory you use this arrow
pointer right so I'm I don't want to
make it complex for you just write this
code for the model less approach and
once again build your code and it's
building and it's building without error
okay so now I when I click this button
it opens the second form but notice here
I can go to my first Oh
first window also and I can go to my
second window so this window I can
operate also and this window I can
operate so I can open multiple instance
of second window and I can operate any
of them separately so this approach is
called model less approach so I hope you
have learned these two approaches for
opening the second window and
you have learned something new this time
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
