show you how you can show current date
and time in your Eclipse GUI application
I am also going to show you how to make
a simple digital clock in your jframe
for example so I have this blank jframe
and in here
I will demonstrate how to do with so
first of all to show this date and time
I will take a label and I will name it
this label as clock for example and I
will just make it a little bit bigger so
we can see date and time okay and I can
change the font size of this to bold and
for example 30 for example
okay now I want to show date and time
here so what I am going to do is I will
go to my source code and search for the
constructor for example this is my
constructor constructor has the same
name as your class name so you can find
the method which has the same name as
your class name just go above that
constructor and we are going to make a
public method here but first of all make
sure that your label is global so when
you drag and drop your label in your
frame and my label name was label clock
you see here whenever I have dragged and
dropped this label inside my form it's
by eclipse its created locally okay so
you can make it global by just copying
this declaration and delete this class
jail label and leave this name here as
it is and make the Declaration of this j
label above whenever wherever your class
is classes starting so this is your
class and this is the code starting in
the class just make it private member of
the class and declare it global so this
will become blue in my case and this
will become also blue so this is a
global variable so we can use it in
other method other than the constructor
also right now go above your constructor
and here I am going to make a public
method so I will say public what we can
give the name to our method for example
public void o'clock o'clock okay
and I will give the these two curly
braces and in here there should be
public public okay now to show the date
and time in your label for example you
need to get the time form somewhere so
you can get the time from the from the
class calendar in your java application
so just write calendar which is a part
of Java util okay so just take this
calendar and then K with the name Cal
for example is equal to new and here you
can decide which class of date and time
you want to use I am going to use
Gregorian calendar so I can write
Gregorian calendar and close it okay now
this calendar object you can use it to
get for example month or year day second
anything for example I want to get the
end
for example they a first day and this
will be is equal to Cal just use the
scale object dot get and inside this you
can use this calendar class to call the
days calendar dot day of month you have
to write day of month okay so and they
you are getting day of month right in
the same way you can get the month here
so month this is for year and for
example you also want to get second hour
and minutes for example so
also going to show you how to get that
but first of all let's make it month
first this should be one okay and this
should be Calendar dot month
okay and third variable will be are here
here and this should be dot here and
then we take second minute and our
so the fourth variable name I will name
it as second fifth variable name I will
name it as minute and fifth bearable
name I will name it as hour and in here
calendar dot second will come right
second calendar dot second and in here
calendar dot minutes will become
calendar dot minute and here over will
come calendar dot Oh
okay
so in this way you can get the values of
these date and time here and now you
just need to set these values to your
label for example so my label name was
label o'clock okay
just use that label and just write label
dot set text and in here you can set the
text so for example I will just write
here first of all time time give it a
space and I will use my above variable
first of all to show the time so I will
use this concatenation operator to show
the time and then in double quotes once
again I will give a little space or you
can give this colon sign and then in
here I will give month and once again
take this : and and seconds okay
and cave here this plus operator and
then I am going to show the date so in
double quotes this is just a
concatenation of string if you are
wondering why I am doing time plus over
plus this and this is just to make our
strings which can give us logical time
so this is just concatenation of the
strings right and here I am going to
show the date date little space and then
the date will come so date for date I
can show you first of all here and then
hold for date I will use this slash
symbol right then the month
and then I am going to copy this and
then day okay
so this is how I can show it but you
need to use this clock method somewhere
so go to your constructor which is this
one right and in here you can just use
if inside your constructor just call
this method called clock or if you have
second from you can just go to the end
of your end of your constructor and just
use it so this is my application window
that is why I can see initialize and
initialize method is here but if you
have a frame you can just go to the last
of your constructor code and paste this
method there okay
run the program and hopefully we will
see this you see here the time is 629 58
seconds you can match it from here right
now it's 6:00 6:30 so but this time is
not moving right this time is not moving
so for example you want running time
then how you can show it I will make
this test little bit small so that it
can fit to the frame
okay now it will fit to the frame now
for example you want to show running
time right this is just the static time
which you want which which is which it
is showing for example you want to
running time how much that second is
going on thirty thirty one or running
time how can you do it you can use
threads for that so go to your clock
method once again and in here we are
going to define a thread thread is
general is not so what is a thread
thread is a small process which is which
can run differently from your process so
that your process is also going on and
thread is also going on so we will
create a thread just right thread and I
will name this thread as clock for
example clock is equal to new thread
and this thread what I am going to do is
just give this two curly braces so I
will start the thread inside my method
and then I will declare a public method
which will run by itself so I will write
or do I need to do this you know I think
I need to do this so bub lick void run
and then in here I will just write the
code okay so this is the thread and what
we need to do here I think we don't even
need to use this but we will see I will
just add a semicolon here for now so I
have created a thread inside that thread
I have this method called run and this
in this method what I am going to do is
I will sleep for 1000 seconds so I will
just write sleep and this sleep takes
milliseconds so I will say for one
second I will to provide thousand
seconds okay
so I want to sleep for thousand second
and when you do that it will show an
error or this red line because you need
to surround this bike try catch block
because it can show error also this can
throw error also so just hover over the
second
and you will see here surround with
try-catch okay just click this around
with prying catch and it will be
surrounded with the trycatch okay and
now just above your six seconds or just
above this try-catch block i will just
copy my code which i was I have written
to show the show this date and time in
the label I will just copy and cut all
the code and just above the second or
sleep code I will paste my Co code okay
so just above the sleep you paste all
the code to show the date and time in
your label okay so this is a thread
which will start immediately whenever
your form loads because we are calling
this method here and this thread will go
on go on
until and unless your form is running so
I run my program and let's see if it
works or not
so it's not working let's see why
yeah I know why because I have created a
thread but I haven't started this thread
right so just take this clock variable
or clock object of the thread this one
thread clock is equal to neutron thread
just take this and after the end of this
curly braces after the thread
declaration just write clock dot dot
this will start your thread okay and now
hopefully we will be able to see our
running time and
it is not running let's see why
okay so I know why this is not running
because we have called our method in my
initialize or after this in my
constructor but this method is only
running once it is not running
continuously why because we haven't
provided any loop here to show the time
okay so in this method run public void
run and in the try block you can what
you can do is you can make up infinite
for loop to run it for you know forever
so you can just write blank for loop
which will run until unless your
application will run and like this that
what this port will do is this blank for
loop will do is it will never end it's
never ending loop okay so either you can
make never ending loop like this for and
blank semicolons here or you can just
write while and you can say while true
it is also our never ending loop so you
can choose two of two options from one
option from two I will use this for loop
which is a never-ending loop and I will
run the program once again and hopefully
this time you will succeed so you see
the time is running now okay 27 28 and
it will also change this minutes also
once it goes to 60 let's wait and let's
see if this changes or not minutes
changes or not from 40 to 41
so there is one more thing that you must
use these threads whenever necessary
because it takes the memory in your
program so yes it changes what this
minute to 4241 that means it's running
fine so in this way you can use date and
time and show it in your form and in
this way you can make a running clock in
your Eclipse GUI application I will just
show this code once again if you want to
copy this code you can just pause this
video and copy all the code and then you
will be good to go I hope you have
