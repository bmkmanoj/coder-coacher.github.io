how to operate a jet in which a table is
very essential when you want to show
your database table data on to into nj3
so let's get started first of all go to
palette and pick table and your frame
and write like name your table table
right
tink
okay now in order to popularity of jade
him you need to jump download one jar
table which you need to include in your
library so I will show you how to
download an John cable go to your
browser go to google right iris - XML
download then we will see the link or
the site
play are as - XML download and then
click this site
this page will open
and you just need to click download and
when you go further I'll just work some
Java file will be downloaded I have
already downloaded so I will not
download it once again once you now look
at this file go to you know project go
to libraries right click go to
properties and jar file wherever you
safety of Java just click it click off
plus ok so your jar file will be
included here
and out the source we need to import as
usual the basic time refined sign copy
paste or sweeping code one more
important fire hose damage report that
not
because
is fine to import once I mean to make
connection to another ways we need to
include these three components
so I'm also once again copy because I am
already shown it last time just below
the mean
just paste it here and also we need to
include the pawn is equal to Java
connect dot connector gave me this
so your connection is and done now we
need to make a method which will
populate projectable
limit and date table
the table close to this in tonight
strength execute whatever gave me love
to give and right
eight select start
um
last time we made the table called
employee info so we want to show this
data on teh of jafer right this next
term from the table to contain the email
and then just write TST related not
the best statement
this q1 so I asked you well
I think I meant some mistaken
I'll just copy
the statement from you
spending stink
now there's an on the spelling mistake
when we go here it shows that our method
is not what we need to impose a
statement try-catch block but why
exception
tonight gee
which game not
sure
this is done
you can see the angle is Cardinal chain
them right RS is equal to P sub T naught
C cute
20
deca matically remove the spring turns
out step 1 name table name is table
employ just copy it and paste it here
and then not set
do
and here is been signed
entering the
d be you please don't
we'll start to table model
you know Brittany tablename side model
in the blocks you have two ND b dot is
all set to an attendant model so I think
that finishes our simple program and
trying to run it
and still I'm not dying out here
so try to find a mistake okay found a
mistake you need call this method into
the main routine just go paid just paste
so where you have written your
connection method just copy and paste it
you're a brick table method also program
forget the problem girls let's see what
is the problem I think we can extract Q
and this RS is equal to p st dot execute
your query it's enough we don't need to
write it here SQL query so now we will
try to run our program yes what table is
shown here everything we can see all the
dot down the table we can see here one
more thing if you want to show specific
data then you will need to write the
specific column name here so my column
name is name for example you need want
to see me and age so just write me at a
chair just run
so you can see only name an age so that
initial our tutorial for today hope you
have enjoyed and please rate comment and
