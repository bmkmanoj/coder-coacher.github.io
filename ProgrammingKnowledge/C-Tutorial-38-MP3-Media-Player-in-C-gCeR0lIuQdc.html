video I will show you how to make a
simple mp3 player with the help of your
c-sharp application in the last video I
have shown you how to add a window media
player for playing video into your C
shop application so I'm using the this
window media player tool from my last
video if you don't know how I added this
window medium clear in my C shall form
just go back to the last video and see
how I have taken or added this window
media player to e in my C sharp
application so just go and drag this
window media player this one and just
drop it here okay now these are the
button which I have created last time
I'm going not going to use them so this
time I will use a list box from here so
I will drag and drop this list box yeah
for choosing the list of the mp3 files
okay and then I will take a button for
choosing those files so this button text
I will change it as choose play lisped
okay this is for choosing the playlist
and this list box will show the playlist
of the videos and when you select any
one song from here it should play here
so once you have done that we need this
this and the
for this task so just double click this
button and just go at the top and we
will declare just this below this form
declaration where your initialize
component is there we will declare two
global variables here which are string
array type so right string this square
bracket pies comma art so declare these
two global variables which we can use in
our function just go back once again
into your form just double click this
and in here we are going to write the
code once again so in here just write
this code so what is this code first of
all I will show you so this is for
opening the Open File dialog and then
copying the path of the files into your
list box so just write Open File dialog
open file dialog variable name is equal
to new open file dialog bracket and
bracket close if your open file dialog
dot show dialog is equal to system dot
windows dot forms dot dialog result dot
okay then just save the name of the file
into this file variable ok which is a
global variable file string file so if
you have know if you know I am declared
this two global variables here file and
path so this is the first variable file
is equal to your open file or file
dialog where you believe dot save file
names okay so this is this
this will just copy the name of the file
into this string variable called file
then in the second line right path is
equal to open file dialog one dot file
names so this will copy the whole path
of the file into this path variables
paths variable so it will copy all the
files we'll live with you select and it
will copy all the paths which you will
select and save it into this path array
variables then right for in the bracket
int I is equal to zero semicolon I is
less than files dot length so this is
the length of this file variable this
variable file dot length semicolon I
plus plus okay and in the four condition
right list box which is the name of this
list box where you will see it from him
so name of that list box dot items dot
add and just copy this files variable
here and in the square bracket right I
which is this int variable and bracket
and bracket closed so this is just for
choosing the file and placing the files
into the list box okay so the in the
list box you will only see the name of
the file and our og original file will
be contained by this path variables path
of the file will be contained by this
path variable and the file names will be
contained by this variable and this are
we are transferring into the list box so
the list box will only show the name of
the files it will not show the part of
the files so it will go look good
now just go to your palm once again and
just select your list box and
double-click it and we come to the list
box selected index event and in here we
will write just select your window we
media clear doing and just copy its name
so I will copy it copy it and once again
this box double click it and paste it
here dot you are L ok and then just copy
your path variable string type variable
which we have declared above as a global
variable so write this and bracket and
bracket close and in here we are going
to pass whatever there in the list box
so whatever we choose in the list box
that path will come in this bracket so
this is array that's why I should write
square bracket here right and then I
will go to my form I will just select
this list box and I will copy the name
of the list boxes from here and just go
there once again and in this path array
I will pass this box dot selected index
okay so write this
so this is only one line code and this
one line code what is doing is it's
whatever file or whatever name you will
choose in your list box it will copy
that list or the path of that file into
your window media player URL okay and
now let's try and run our program so
this is our program so I will choose a
mp3 file from here so I will select one
and b35 and when I click this mp3 file
you see the music is started but there
is still one problem with multi-select
so for example once again I select some
other file it will be added here but
when you click this second file it will
not play and it will show some error so
let's fix this problem now so once again
go to your forum here and go to your
choose playlist once again and in here
we have declared earlier open file
dialog open file dialog name is equal to
new Open File dialog so just copy this
variable and so I will copy this and
just below that I will select paste it
here dot multi slash select is equal to
true so what this line will do is it
will in it enables us to choose multi
files ok multiple files so now when you
run your programs and when you
see here you could be able to select all
the three files at the same time right
so that's what we wanted just select all
three files open it and when you play I
will just new this and then when you
play first it's playing cost a song and
you can live when you click second it's
playing the second song and when you
play third it's playing the third song
okay so now you have made a simple mp3
player with the help of your windows
form application in c-sharp I hope you
have learned something new this time
