last video I have shown you how to use
some navigation rules with the help of
your JSF application so when I run the
program it opens a web page and when I
click this button it goes to the second
web page ok in this video I will show
you how to use images with your JSF web
application so images you can use in two
ways one for showing images as a
background and the other is you can show
images in your actual page so I will
both show you both ways so first of all
I will show you how to show image in
your web page not in background
background I will show you in the later
half so this is your web application it
has a web page ok and it has job web dot
INF folder so just click this web pages
folder right click it and go to new and
select folder from here but if you are
making this web application for the
first time you may not see this folder
option here so what you need to do is
you go to others and in here go here
also others this folder and in file
types search for this folder option and
in here you will define the folder name
so make sure that you define your folder
name as resources and in the same way
also so do not change the spelling this
will we will use in our application so
just write result resources as it is no
spelling mistakes nothing and then click
finish
and now when you see here in your web
pages
there is one other folder called
resources right and now you can make one
more folder inside this resources so
this resource folder will contain all of
your resources it can be a text file it
can be images it can be anything so for
different resources we will made make
different folder so inside this
resources right click once again go to
new and click folder and in here now you
can give the name of all your choice so
I named this folder as image images and
click finish so now my folder structure
is like this I have webpage folder
inside this webpage I have this
resources folder and inside this
resources I have images and now inside
this image folder I can drag and drop my
images which are present anywhere in my
computer so for example I take this
image I drag it to the netbeans and drop
it in this image folder so drop it and
you will see it just copies this image
and paste it here it doesn't move this
file okay so I move this image and maybe
I will
move one more image for example this
image I want to transfer so I will just
drag and drop here in in this images
folder and now I have two images in my
folder if you are not happy with your
image name you can always change this
how just right-click it and go to
properties and in here it will show the
properties so for example you can name
this image as I am G 1 and form it is
PNG itself and press close and now in
here the name is also changed and you
can also see this image here also so I
click this it looks like this and I
click this it looks like this
ok now I will show you how to use these
images inside your web pages so for
example first of all you want to show
the image on the web page so what you
write here go here inside inside the
body just below inside inside the body
tag you make a new tag called sorry H
underscore graphic images or graphic
image and then write value and just
close this tag
and like this so right like this and in
here you can pass your image so by
default a the JSF application knows this
webpage folder so whatever you give path
here it will be with respect to this
webpage folder so I have this webpage
inside this web page I have this
resources folder so I right here
resources and then forward slash and
then I inside this resources I have
images folder so I write images / / and
then I will give the name of my image so
for example I want to show this I am G 1
dot PNG so right here I am G 1 dot P and
G ok so now when I run the program it
shows me this image in my web page ok so
this is one way of showing images in
your web page now for example I want to
change the background and I want to set
some image in my background how can I do
that I will show you that also so now I
have this second image like this it's a
small image but it will set as a
background as you will see later so this
code we have written for setting the
image but this code you can also make it
smaller how you can make it smaller just
delete all of this code just leave this
image
and here double quote okay and in here
sorry in here you can write library is
equal to and by default in new JSF
version it recognizes this resources
library so if you define library
attribute here it recognizes resources
folder as it is so you just need to
write here the folder name which is
inside your resources so this is image
images so write images and after this
here this is the name of your image so
right name is equal to and just pass
this image here and just clear this so
you can write your or you can show your
image in this way also because this
library attribute recognizes this
resources folder by defaults so that's
why I have told you not to change the
spellings
and now when I run the program once
again it shows the image so these are
two ways in which you can show images
this is the newer version of JSF so in
the newer version you can show it like
this and in the older version like one
point something you can show it like in
the previous code I have shown you now
the back
ground image so go in this head tag and
you cannot define background image by
just using this JSF or XHTML code you
need to make some CSS code also cascaded
stylesheet that is so that provides the
style to your pages so right here
smaller them and right style and close
it like this and inside this style we
will define a class so right dot and
your class name so you can name your
class anything it depends upon you I
give my class name as B for background
and image background image and give this
curly brackets here and inside this
curly bracket what you need to do is you
will define the property which you want
to change so I want to change the
background image so I will write back
ground
image this one and then the part of this
image so after this : you pass the pass
path of the image so it's in resources
image so once again I will write with
sources slash images slash image dot jpg
so this is in my resources image and
image jpg and once you write your
property you need to write here
semicolon otherwise it will create some
problem
I forgot here you must try it you are
sorry URL and give bracket here and give
the closing bracket here like this okay
so you need to define the style inside
this style you need you define a class
called B image and inside this class you
define this background image property so
you are setting this image here now go
to your body this body make space and in
here write style class to call this
class so just copy this class name from
here and paste it inside this bracket
okay so you write you have written this
style code CSS code and you have given
the body this image class so it will
take the image and it will set in the
broad body so now let's run the program
and you will see this background image
is set here okay this is your webpage
image and this is your background image
so you can set images like this but when
you press this next go to next page
button it doesn't have any style because
you haven't provided here any image or
background image go back and you have
the image so in this way you can use
images with your JSF application that's
it for this video please rate comment
