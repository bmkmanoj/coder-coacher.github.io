Java effects tutorial for beginners in
the last two videos we have been seeing
how we can create a media player using
Java fix and we have written a code to
load of a media file resize it and to
add some functionality like play pause
or play faster or play slower or move
the video to the start or to the last
now in this video we will try to add a
volume bar to your media player so we
can control the volume of our media
player so let's get started so first of
all what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open my main dot F XML file in scene
builder and in this scene builder what
I'm going to do is I'm going to search
for a slider which is a horizontal
slider and I'm going to drag and drop in
my bottom you know horizontal box for
each box which I have here okay
so just drag and drop this slider here
and then you have some functionality of
your slider for example minimum value
maximum value just okay for us 0 and 100
and we can set the initial value also
from here but we are going to set the
initial value or value to the slider
using the code not from here which will
be better for us and then we will just
give the ID to our slider we can say
it's our volume slider okay and just
copy the name save your F XML file go to
your project refresh your project and go
to the main controller dot Java class
and in here first of all we are going to
add this slider so just right at the
rate F XML and then slider search for
the slider and the name of the slider is
volume slider as we have given in the F
XML file right now using this volume
slider
what we can do is first of all we will
go to our initialize method which is
like a first method which will be called
when this app will run or this class
will run and what we are going to do is
first of all take the slider and then
dot set value so just call set value and
then we will call our Media Player
instance here and then we will call a
method called get volume okay so just
write get volume and this volume if you
hover over on this method you can see
the default value of this get value
method is 1 and 1 means here is maximum
value and 0 means the minimum value okay
and you can see in the slider if you
observed in the properties our maximum
value for the slider was hundred right
so it's hundred times more so what we
can do here is we can multiply this gate
value by 100 which will be you know
proportional to our volume property okay
and now in the next step what we are
going to do is we will take a volume
slider once again and then call a
property called value change property or
value property and then call a method
called add listener and in the
constructor of this add listener we will
just write new invalidation listener
okay so just search for new invalidation
listener and you can see it has given us
this default method using this
invalidation listener right and inside
this invalidated method what we want to
do is we want to set the value according
to the value set on the volume slider
right so just take your MP or media
player object
and then just call a method called set
volume and this set volume takes a
double value right which can be taken
from the value of the slider so just
take the volume slider dot get value and
this will give you the value in
proportional to hundred right so to
convert this value to match with your
Media Player value you need to divide it
by 100 right in here we have multiplied
it and in here we need to divide it okay
and then save your project and build
your project and then run your project
so run it and now our app is running so
let's play our app and pause the app and
you can see this slider is on 100 right
so the default value which was given by
this get volume method is one which is
multiply it by 100 and this value is set
to your volume slider right once again
I'm going to play my video and then I'm
going to move this slider and see what
happens with the volume so you can see
the volume has been reduced to the
minimum value of the slider which is
zero right and you know as you increase
this volume slider the volume will also
increase so in this way you can add a
volume slider to your media player I
