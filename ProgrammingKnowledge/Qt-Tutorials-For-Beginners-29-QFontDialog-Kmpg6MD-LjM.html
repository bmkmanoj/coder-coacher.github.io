cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can use a cue
font dialog class in QT the cue font
dialog class provides a dialogue widget
for selecting a font now for this
demonstration I will be using my code
from the last video in which I've shown
you how we can create a 2d notepad right
so if you haven't seen that video in
which I have shown you how we can create
a simple notepad then watch it and I
will be using the code from the same
video right so this is the project I
have created in the notepad video and I
will go to my main window dot UI file
and in here I was using text added to
enter some text right and I had some
buttons for you know cut copy paste or
open a file or save a file right now in
the menu here in the Edit menu I have
cut copy paste and then redo and undo
now for example I want to add one more
menu item here which is for selecting
the font so how I can do this so what I
am going to do is first of all I will
add a separator here and then after
adding a separator I will add the new
menu here and for example this menu is
called font
okay and I'm not going to provide the
toolbar button for this I think you know
how we can you know drag and drop this
font action to here and provide the icon
to it right so I'm not going to you know
show you how you can do this I will just
show you how this work this font dialog
works so I've created this submenu
called font here right now what I'm
going to do next here is I will go to
this
action which is created by creating this
submenu which is the section and I will
right-click on it and I will click go to
slot and in the go-to slot I will just
click triggered okay so just like
triggered and click ok and this is going
to create a function for us right now in
here in order to you know open a cue
font dialog and apply it to our added
text first of all we need a boolean
operator to check whether any font is
selected or not
okay so just declare a variable for
example okay right and then in the next
line what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create an object of cue fonts so for
that we need to add this header class to
our header so just include Q font dialog
in here so just write Q font dialog
which is this one and we will also
include two font so just add Q font here
okay which will be with Q okay so Q one
dialogue and Q font now we are going to
create in here a coupon two objects so
just write Q font and then give it a
name for example font itself is equal to
we will use a Q font dialog so what we
want to do here is using a cue font
dialog we want to select a font and
assign it to this font variable right so
just write Q font dialog and there is a
static method here which is get font so
just use this method and the first
argument here you can see is the boolean
pointer which is this one so what we are
going to do here is we will provide the
reference to this boolean variable which
we have created which is
this variable right the second argument
here is the parent class so just provide
this here and it has some overloads so
if you want or if you know which font
you want then you can directly provide
this font in here right in the next
argument so we are not going to do this
we just need these two argument here now
once you know the argument and once any
argument or any font is selected then we
want to just proceed forward so if this
font is okay this variable will be set
and if this font is okay then we will do
something or otherwise we will just
return so you can just say else return
because this is a void so you can just
return empty return something like this
but if your font is selected and there
is some font selected by the user then
we want to set it on the edit text right
so how we can set it so for adding the
font you just need to call your text add
it here so just call add text add it and
then you can just set the font using
function called set font
okay so just use set font and then it
takes this argument which is the object
of Q font so you can pass it here okay
so this is how you can set the font to
your Q add it and this is how you can
use Q Phi upon dialogue and let's see
how it works so we are going to run our
application and we will see how will it
work when it runs so for example I write
something here some random text here any
text okay and then I want to change the
font size and everything for this
file dialogue or edit text right so what
I am going to do is I will go to add it
and I will click a font and it's going
to open this font dialog here and here
you we can choose any font let's choose
some font I don't know which one to
choose it but let's see which one we can
choose from here let's use any random
font from here so I'm going to choose
this font and I will say bold and I will
make it a little bit bigger so we can
see the text so for example 28 or 36 and
click OK and this font is applied to our
text here right once again we can just
go to font and change the font for
example ms outlook
this time we want italic and then we
want 28 font and click OK and this is
applied right or once again you can go
to font and some other for example Times
Roman you can use and this time bold
italic and once again we want to choose
for example this 1048 and click OK and
now this font is applied to your text
right so in this way you can use coupon
dialog in QT I hope you've enjoyed this
