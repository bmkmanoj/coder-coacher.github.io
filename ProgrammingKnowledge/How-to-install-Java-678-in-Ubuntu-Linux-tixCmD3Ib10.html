show you how to install java in your
open to operating system and i'm also
going to show you how you can install
either java 6 or 7 or 8 whatever you
wish to install in your open to system
so let's get started first of all you
need to open your terminal you can open
your terminal by going to this search
option here and writing here terminal
and you can see terminal here or either
you must have this terminal locked in
your toolbar so I will go to my terminal
from here and first command we will give
in our terminal is to check whether JDK
is really installed in our system or not
so this is the command to check whether
JDK or Java is installed in our system
Jadakiss stand for Java development kit
so just give this command sudo apt - get
purge pu r GE space open open JDK and
this star symbol here so sudo apt - get
purged open JDK star and press enter and
you will see here the messages that open
JDK source is not installed and all the
Java libraries or open JDK libraries are
not installed you can see here not
installed not installed so Java is not
installed in my system it's just
matching all the entries related to open
JDK and it's showing that nothing is
right now installed in my system so now
I will try to install Java in my system
so I will clear my terminal first by
giving this command CL AR clear and now
I will give this command to add the PPA
or the repository to my system so just
give sudo add - apt - repository space
PPA : web you PD eight-team / Java so
just give this command on your terminal
in order to add repository and press
ENTER and it will once again ask for
continuing this process so just press
ENTER once again and now this repository
is added to your system
now once again we are going to give the
update command to our terminal so that
all the updates or our Ubuntu
repositories are up-to-date so just give
this command sudo apt - get update to
your terminals just give this sudo space
apt - get space update and press enter
and it will install all the updates
whatever available in your system
now all the updates are installed in
your system so we are ready to install
our Java versions so I am just once
again clearing the terminal by a giving
clear command and in here I am going to
write the command to install Java eight
in my system so just right give this
command sudo space apt - get space
install space Oracle - Java 8 -
installer so this Java eight stand for
the version you are installing if you
right here Java 7 then it will install
JDK 7 to your system or if you can you
write here
Java 6 then it will install Java 6 in
your system so first of all I will
install Java 8 so just write sudo apt -
get installed Oracle - Java 8 -
installer and press enter here and it
will install Java 8 in your system
it will ask for your permission that you
really want to install this yes so just
write y and press enter
and now it will give this command prompt
here that you must agree to the license
of this Java license if you agree with
this license press Enter
or yes and once again give this warning
or this message that in order to install
this package you must accept the license
term in condition once again if you
agree with the conditions just highlight
this yes by up down and side arrows and
press Enter
and now you can see
it's installing
so we are waiting for this percentage to
go 100% here right
so once this process is complete your
Java 8 is installed in your system ok
and to confirm this you can once again
give this command to check whether it is
already there or not so just once again
give sudo apt - get purged open JDK star
in your cut terminal and press ENTER and
it will show you whether Java 8 is
installed in or not in your system and
likewise if you want to install Java 7
instead of Java 8 just replace this Java
8 by Java 7 here and press Enter
and once again it will start installing
Java seven in your system
and when this process reaches 100% and
then your Java seven is ready to use in
your Ubuntu operating system and in the
same way you can also install Java 6 in
your system right
so once the process is complete
your Java 7 is installed and in the same
way you can also install Java 7 instead
of the Java 6 instead of Java 7 but by
changing this Java 7 instead you write
Java 6 here ok and press Enter it
learned little install Java 6 in your
system so I am NOT going to give this
command right now and but if you want
you can give this command to install
Java 6 and once you have you are done
with all this installation you just need
to give this update command once again
which is sudo apt - get update and press
Enter
so once again your repositories will be
updated and now you are ready to use
Java in your system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
