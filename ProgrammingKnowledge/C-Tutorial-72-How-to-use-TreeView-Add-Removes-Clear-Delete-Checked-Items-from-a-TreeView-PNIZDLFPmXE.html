video I will show you how to use tree
view with your c-sharp application so
let's get started first of all I will
take a button and I will drag and drop
this tree view or sorry not this but
this tree view in my form will resize it
and I will give the text to the button
as this button and text is add nodes ok
and I will just double click this button
and I will just write the name of my
tree view name dot nodes dot add and in
the bracket I will write the name of my
nodes so for example I want to give the
name as books so this is the first node
of my tree in the same way I can add
more nodes for example papers and
holder's and now when I run the program
and when I click this add node it'll add
three nodes book paper and folder to my
tree view now for example I want to add
the sub node to my tree array or tree
view so this nodes work like an array so
this is the zeroth array this is first
and this is second so what I will do is
I will give the name of my tree view dot
nodes and I will give this square
bracket and in this I will pass the
array number so for example I want to
generate sub node for this book node
so I will write 0 here because it's the
zeroth or it dot nodes
once again dot add and break it and
break it close and in here I will write
book 1 and in this way I can add more
sub nodes and for example I also want to
give the sub node for this papers also
so in the same way I will just copy this
paste it here and change the array
number and change this here also paper 1
papers 2 people 3 okay
so now I will run the program and when I
click this add note it has created the
nodes and also the sub nodes here ok now
if you want to remove your node what can
you do I will take a button here and I
will change it text as remove nodes and
now I will double click this button and
in here I will just copy the name of my
tree view dot selected node dot remove
so it will remove the selected node from
my preview so let's see it adds the node
and for example I want to remove this
paper 3 so i select it and i will click
remove now for example I want to remove
this book and remove ok so in this way
you can remove the selected item also
now for example if you want to clear all
the nodes from the tree view you want to
the remove all the node at one go how
can you do that just write node tree
view nodes dot clear and when you run
the program add node and when you click
this it will remove all the nodes yes it
removes right now for example you want
to add at the check box to your tree
view so just select your tree view go to
the properties here and search for this
checkbox and
make it true from here okay and then
when you run the program it will when I
add these nodes it will add the check
box to your nodes okay now for example I
want to remove the selected nodes so
whatever checkbox I select and when I
click this it should remove the node
from the tree view so how can I do that
once again I will go to my method here
and below this method or the function I
will create a new function you know so
first I will declare I'll list list of
tree nodes and I will name it as checked
node is equal to new list tree node so
this is the Declaration of list I'm
declaring an s list of tree nodes okay
then I will make a function in here I
will write this so this is a function
and I will close this function first of
all so I will I have declared void
removed remove checked nodes so this is
the function name and I am passing the
tree node collection so whatever the
tree nodes are there I am passing that
here okay and inside this function I
will add for each loop so like this
right for each tree node give it a name
in nodes and break it closed for for
loop and inside this for loop what I
will do is I will give a condition if
node is checked so right if and in the
argument gave node
which is this variable dot checked so if
it is no distract then what we are doing
is check node which is this list it will
add this node to the list okay so this
variable this list where you will paste
it here dot add and inside this right
node which is this variable else what we
will do is here we will provide the else
condition so so we passed in the else
condition else we are calling this
method once again which we have declared
here else node which is this variable
dot nodes okay so what it will do is if
the checkbox is checked then it will add
to this list and otherwise it checks for
check for the sub nodes and it will once
again call this method remove if any sub
nodes are present in the in the tree
view okay and now after this else if
condition I will go outside this for
loop and I will declare one more for
each loop like this so right for each
and inside this bracket first of all I
will close it for each tree node check
node which is the declaration for this
tree node in check nodes which is this
check nodes and inside this for each
loop I will write nodes which is this
nodes variable which we are passing dot
remove
and inside this bracket give this
variable so I have declared this
function for removing the checked item
from my tree view right now what I will
do is when we made this function we need
to call it in order to remove the nodes
so what I will do is I will just copy
this remove function name and instead
instead of this clear method which I was
using to clear all the nodes I will
write this function name and inside this
function I will pass the name of my tree
view which is 3 V 1 dot nodes ok so now
when I run my program I can add the
nodes and sub nodes by this button and
for example eyes check this box and I
want to remove this papers and when I
click this it is removed right for
example I want to check or remove these
two they are removed I want to remove
all all the node it is removed okay so
in this way you can remove the nodes or
some node by using check boxes so I hope
you have learned something new this time

and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
