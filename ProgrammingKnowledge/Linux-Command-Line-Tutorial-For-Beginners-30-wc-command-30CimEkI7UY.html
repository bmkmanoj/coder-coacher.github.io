length command line tutorial for
beginners in this video I am going to
show you how you can use WC command in
Linux
WC command or word count prints a count
of new lines words and bytes for each
input file so generally you can use WC
command with a file and it's going to
you know give you the number of lines in
the file or number of words in the file
or number of characters in the file so
let's see how we can use it so you can
see on my desktop I have that this test
dot txt file so I will just change the
directory to the desktop and then I am
going to give the WC command here and
then the name of the file which is test
dot txt and I will press enter and you
can see it gives this kind of output now
the first you know output here is 1 and
this is the number of line in this file
so I am going to open this file and you
can see there is only one line in this
text file and this is due to this so
this is the number of line second here
is 6 so 6 is the number of words here so
I can count these are words 1 2 3 4 5 6
so second is the number of words and
then the third is the number of
characters here so total number of
character in this file is 42 that's why
it's printing this and first fourth is
the name of your file ok so this is the
simplest use of this file you can use
now you can also use for example let me
increase the number of lines here so I
am going to paste for example five lines
here right and I'm going to give the
same command and you can see it gives
right now five lines and then it gives
the 30
you vote because six into cut 6 into 5
is 30 and then it gives the 210
characters right so this is basically
how you can use it now you can use
certain flags in your WC command which
will give you specifically what you want
so for example you want to print only
the number of bite then you can just
write a flag called WC minus C and this
is going to print only the number of
bytes or essentially the number of
characters right and just print and just
print the number of characters which is
210 here right similarly if you want to
you know count the number of lines you
can just say minus L and then press
press enter it gives you number of lines
here right or you can use the W
character or W you know flag here it's
going to give you the number of words
okay and you can also use a flag called
capital L and this capital L prints the
length of the longest line for example I
am going to just give some more words
here for example words words so this is
essentially going to give you the length
of this line because this is the longest
line here right so we can just press
ENTER and you can see it gives the
number of characters in the longest line
which is this one
in our case okay so these are the flag
you can use with WC command
