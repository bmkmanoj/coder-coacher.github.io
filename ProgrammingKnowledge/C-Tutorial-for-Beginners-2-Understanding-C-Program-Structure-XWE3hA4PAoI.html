last video I have shown you how you can
download and install code blocks IDE to
develop your C++ programs and I have
also shown you how to create your first
C++ program and you have seen that code
blocks has automatically generated this
code for us okay now in this video I
will explain what this code does
so line by line I will explain what is
the meaning of each and every line of
this code so you will be able to
understand what is what and why it is
important to write this lines of code so
we will start with the first line the
first line starts with this hash
include' and it includes this file so
this hash include' in C++ is called a
preprocessor directive and what it does
is it include the pre-defined header
file so think this as a file which is
already present in c++ and this file is
included by writing hash include' and
whenever you write or whenever you want
to include some file you include it in
these greater than and less than sign
like this okay so the first line means
include a pre processor directive so
this is a preprocessor directive and
this preprocessor directive include this
file which is already present in E
or C++ program so this is by default
okay and when you include this this will
include the header file and what this
header file will contain this header
file will contain some function which
will be useful for us to develop our
code okay now we come to the next line
so this line using a namespace standard
says a C++ that we are going to use the
standard library to do our work
for example this see out here belongs to
the standard library okay so what these
two line means is first line is to
include the file okay and this line says
there is somewhere STD class or STD
namespace in this file and in so include
this namespace STD from this file okay
and we are going to use some function
from this namespace which are present in
this file to perform our code okay now
in the next line this int main function
is declared so every C++ program has one
and only one main function and this main
function tells C++ that here from here
you need to start your program okay so
the main is the main entry point
of the C++ program to execute and if you
see here there is int written before
this main function so this int shows
what kind of return it is expecting
right so int main is a function and
every function start with this curly
bracket and end with this closing curly
bracket okay so whenever you write a
function start with this curly bracket
and closed with this curly bracket so
C++ knows that this is a function and
C++ always start with a main function
right and what this int mean that it's
expecting by integer to return so you
can see here we are returning zero which
is an integer when our program is
successfully compiled and run okay
so zero it is a default value for
success so whenever you write zero and
your program reaches here that means C++
knows that the execution of your program
is successful right that's why we are
returning zero and for now just take it
as a convention that you need to return
zero at the very end of your main
function and because we are returning an
integer here this will be integer right
and now we come to this line so what
this line does is this line prints a
string which is written after this
greater than greater than sign okay so
see out is present or see out is a
function or an object in this iostream
file and what is the function of the C
out is to output whatever is written
after this greater than greater than
sign okay so this 2 greater than science
or symbol means or this greater than
greater than symbol of are called
insertion operators okay so if this
whatever you write after this in double
quotes will be printed as an output
output on your terminal when you run
your program and once again you have
this insertion operator and then you
have this e and DL this en DL means end
line so this code tells and this is used
with C out so if you write C out then
only you can write E and DL okay so this
line will look or this code will tell
your C out function that you need to
change the line after you see this
en BL okay so once again I will compile
my code and we go to build and I will
click build and my program is build
successfully right and now I will run my
program and you can see hello world is
written here okay and now for example I
will just copy this code and paste it
once again then you see what happens
once again I will
save my code and build it once again and
once this is build I am going to write
it so zero error zero warning I'll run
my code and you can see there are there
is hello world
printed two times because I have written
two times see out hello world a and BL
now to show the use of this EMD L I am
going to exclude this env L from the
first line okay and in the second line I
will leave it as it is once again I will
save my code and build the code once
again zero error zero warning run it and
now you see here without env L your line
is not changed so HelloWorld is preceded
by second HelloWorld
so that is the use of en BL and the line
okay so that whatever you want to print
in the next line you can write e n BL
and then it will print to the next line
you can also change a line or you can
also go to the next line by using some
other function or some other code walls
which is like this so you can write /
and and /n is read as a as one letter
and it says the code to change the line
so this means new line okay and this
will also work in the same manner as
this en DL box so I will once again
David and I will build my program once
again and first of all I will close this
running program save pilled and when the
build successful run it and you can see
this /n is also performing the same
tasks as en DL okay and now this program
is running I want to show you some more
basic things when you start your
programming one most important thing is
the comments so whenever you write your
program and generally when you write
your program you should write some
comments so that other user can
understand your program so for example
at the top of this line included which
is a preprocessor I will give two
slashes which will tell our code that do
not perform whatever I write for after
these two backslashes so whatever I
write I can write program to show hello
world and this line will not be executed
by the code because this two slashes
tell C++ not to perform this line okay
so comment this line after two slashes
is called comment and this comments are
you can use to explain your code to the
other user whoever is reading your board
this makes your code readable okay so
this is one way to write comment the
other way is
- right comment is you can just write
this star first of all start with this
slash star and then once again the star
and then once again this slash okay so
whatever you write in between this slash
star star slash is also be taken as not
to execute okay so there are two ways to
comment in your code one is slash slash
as one and other is this slash star star
slash okay so in this way you can make
your code more readable so I hope you
understood this basic functionality and
basic description of this code in the
next video I will show you some more
codes so please stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
