last video I have shown you how to edit
your data in the database which is your
SQLite database using WPF c-sharp
application in this video I will show
you how to delete your data in the
SQLite database using your WPF c-sharp
application so for that I will need a
button this is not a button so I will
drag and drop a button once again this
one and I will just change the name of
this button so BT and button delete and
I will change the content of this button
also so I will write delete and now I
will double click this button here and
we will reach to the button delete like
event so just go to your form once again
and in the last video I have shown you
how to update your data with the button
click so I just double click that and I
will copy all the pay all the code from
there you can copy the code from the
Save button click event also which I
have shown you in the previous two
previous video so any code either update
code or the Save button click event code
you just copy it and paste it into this
delete button click event so this is the
code if you don't want know what this
code was you can process this video and
copy this and I am just changing the
query from here for deleting the data
from the database so I will keep this
code as it is
instead of this query so I deleted the
query and I will write new query here
double quotes and then I will close and
in between these codes I will write the
query for deleting so for deleting data
from the database I write this delete
from your table name so my table name
here is employee info table
so whatever from whatever table you want
to delete your data write delete from
table name where where on what basis you
want to delete your data so for example
I have in the in my database employee ID
name surname and age I can choose any
one of the field for example I want to
delete the data on the basis of my
employee ID so I will write here delete
from employing for the table name where
my e ID which this is the column name
and is equal to double quotes inside
this no this is a single code than the
blue code and then plus plus sign okay
and in here I will write this dot e ID
text which is the text box name of my a
ID dot text okay this is the name of my
text box so I have written delete from
employee info where my employee ID is
this so whatever I enter in this Eid
text box here it will delete the
employee ID or delete the dot of that
employee ID so this is it this is the
code nothing much in it
you can just copy and paste the code
from here so just pause the video and
copy the code I just need to change this
message also so I will write delete it
here okay and this is your code now we
will check whether our code works or not
so I will run the code and user name and
ID which is correct or user name and
password and let's open our database so
this is my database this is my table
employee info and I have employee ID the
name surname age user name and password
so for example I want to delete the data
of employee ID 6 this one so I will
write here 6 in the employee ID text box
and I don't need to fill any other field
because I am deleting on the basis of my
employee ID and I click this delete
button and it shows me deleted that is
my daughter is deleted but in here you
will see the change when you refresh
this database so how can you refresh
this database just switch the tab and
come here and you see employee ID 6 is
gone ok so in this way you can delete
your data with the help of your WBFF
application in yours SQLite database so
I hope you have enjoyed this video
