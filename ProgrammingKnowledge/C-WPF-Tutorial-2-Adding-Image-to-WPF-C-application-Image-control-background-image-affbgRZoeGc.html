on WPF c-sharp application tutorial in
this video I will show you how to use
images with your WPF c-sharp application
so in the last video we have seen how we
can create a WPF application in c-sharp
and we have created this button now this
in this video I want to add a image to
my application or this main window so
what I will do is I will go to my tool
box and I will drag and drop image tool
from my tool box in my main window and I
will just resize it so that it will fix
into my main window
now what I will do is I will select this
image and then I will go to the
properties here
and I will search for the source
property in the common category so go
here and go to this source category and
one more thing I want to point out when
you click this solution right-click your
solution first and click this open
folder in Windows Explorer so it will
open your project folder here and right
now you can see we have been obj folder
properties folder so now when I select
this main in main window this image tool
and I will go here to the source and I
will select any image from my computer
so what I will do is I will click this
button and this open this choose image
wizard and now I can choose any image so
I will search for image in my folder
so now for example I choose this image
and I click open and it loads into my
project folder so it may it
automatically made a folder called
component and in that component folder
it made a another folder called image
and in that folder it is going to save
my new image so I click OK and you can
see here the image you can see in this
image tool and when you go to the folder
in which your project is there you will
see here a new folder called image
created automatically here ok and when
you click it your image will be copied
in this image folder in your project
folder ok so this will be your path or
now you can copy and paste more images
here and you can give the path for these
images from here itself and you can
observe here also we have an XML file we
have this button already have this
button we have this grid grid is the
total form of our main window and we
have in the grid we have a button which
is this and now when we drag and drop
this image tool this new code code is
automatically generated here for the
image so see here it's automatically
generated and here is the source in your
project folder it has created
a folder called component images and
there is your image copied so you can
now when you run the program you will be
able to see your image like this in here
now for example you don't want this
image here you want the image to be set
on the background of your grid or your
main form whatever you say
so what I will do is I will copy this
from here or what I can do is I can
write a new tag here to set the
background image so I will write this
smaller than sign and then image and
then I will give the source
so I will write source is equal to and
you can give the source as this so you
need to give this format in your source
so what you can do is you can copy and
paste some other image here and you can
now just copy this source code which is
generated for this image tool I mean
just copying here and in here I am
pasting so I copied the path and I
pasted it here
like this and this can also become your
background image so the this image I am
using for setting my background and what
I want is this image should stretch to
the length of my form so I will give a
new property called stretch and I can
give the here the argument uniform to
fill like this and I will close my I
will close my tag so you see when you
write this code the image is set
automatically in the background of your
grid and now I can remove this this
image tool to make it clear so I am
removing it like this and now you can
see the image is set on the background
and nothing is there so now when I run
the program it looks like this and if
you can if you see when I stretch this
form the my image is also stretches
according to the size of my form so it
will take the size whatever size my form
is and it will stretch according to the
size of my form so that's why I have
given uniform to fill stretch here now I
close my program so in this way you can
set foreground image or background image
in your form so once again what I can do
is I can choose an image tool from here
and I can resize it once again if you
want to give
a smaller image here and now what I can
do is I can select this image tool once
again and go to the source in the
properties here to the source property
click to choose the image you can choose
another image for example I'm going to
choose some other image like this and I
choose this image and I click OK and you
see here the image is set here so now
you have both background image and
foreground image this is really cool
when you want to give your your style to
your application so that's why it's good
so I hope you have learned something new
