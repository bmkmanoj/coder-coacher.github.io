video I will show you how to capture the
screenshot area of your window with the
help of your c-sharp windows form
application so let's get started first
of all go to your toolbox and take a
picture box in this picture box we are
going to show our screenshot for example
and I will just anchor it just select it
and in the property I will just anchor
it to the all sides okay and then take a
button so when I click this button it
will take a screenshot and it will save
it into the picture box so right in the
text capture image for example now I
double click this capture image button
and I reach to the event of this button
click event of the capture image so in
here you need to write the code which is
sorry
this code so I will explain what is this
code first of all you need to declare a
bit map variable which will contain our
image so declare bitmap and give it a
variable name is equal to new bitmap and
it is in the bracket we pass the width
and height of the screen so we are
taking the screenshot of our window or
our screen so we will write screen dot
primary screen which is all the screen
dot bounds dot width so first argument
is for width in the same way after comma
right screen dot primary screen dot
bounds dot hide so this argument is for
height so this all line this line of
code will take the picture of the
screenshot or of your screen
and the height of the picture and width
of the picture it's the screen width an
ID okay and then in the next line we
declare a graphic variable so graphics
and in give it a variable name I gave it
as graphics is equal to graphics dot
from image and in the bracket right
bitmap which is this variable as image
okay and in the next line write graphics
dot copy from screen and pass these
arguments so first argument 0 second 0
third is 0 and fourth is 0 and fifth
argument is bitmap bitmap which is once
again this bitmap variable dot size
okay and in the next line write the name
of the picture box so my picture box
name is default no picture box - so I
will just copy it and paste it here so
my picture box name is picture box -
okay so write the name of the picture
box dot size mode is equal to picture
box size mode dot stretch image and in
the last line you need to write the name
of the picture box dot image and just
pass the bitmap variable so this
contains your image and it you are just
passing your image into the picture box
so let's see if it works or not you just
need to write this code so if you want
to copy you can just copy this this code
only okay so let us try and run the
program and when I click this capture
image it is supposed to capture the
image and show it into the picture box
so let's see yes it captures the image
and shows in the picture box once again
okay it once again takes the picture and
saves in into the picture box once again
it takes the picture and saves it into
the picture box so if you can see every
time when I click this button it takes
the picture and saves it into the
picture box now if you want you can also
make a thread of this picture capture
capture picture event and you can show
the picture in
picturebox continiously also so let's
see what how can we do that first of all
we need to go at the top and if you
don't have the namespace threading you
need to take that into or write it above
your code so here write using and then
system dot threading
here
so for using the thread we need to
import this namespace into our code so
just declare at the top and once again I
will just go to the capture event and I
will just copy this code or first of all
let me make a function and in here we
will make a new function so right white
screen shot and bracket bracket closed
and in here what I will do is whatever I
have written in this button click event
I will just copy and cut it and paste it
into this function which I created this
new function okay and then what I will
do is in this picture or in this button
click event for capture image double
click not this is blank because I have
transferred all the code here and in
here we will declare a variable cord
called thread and this is for pick
thread I will name it as
is equal to new thread okay and in the
next line we will copy this thread
variable picthread dot start
and if you see this is showing error
because we need to pass this function
which is screenshot function which we
have created and we need to pass it here
so what it will do is when we click the
button it will start a thread and it'll
run this function and it will transfer
this into the thread and it will keep on
running okay and one more thing you can
do is because if you want to capture
your picture continuously we need to put
this into the infinite loop so you can
give here the for loop so I will write
for and in I will enclose all the code
in the for loop this all gold and in
here I will pass just two semicolons and
these this for loop takes no argument
so this will run infinite whenever or
until your program ends so what have you
done you make a function new function
and transferred your picture code here
and enclose it into the infinite loop
and you have created the thread and in
which you are passing this function here
and you are just dotting the thread with
the help of this capture image button
click event let's see how does this code
work so now I am running the program and
when I click this capture image it's
taking the image continuously if you see
the mail images are changing at the
runtime
okay so in this way you can capture the
image continuously but it takes too much
memory so you need to remember that that
your process will be slow now if you
want to save the image into certain form
like jpg or PNG format in some folder
what you can do is once again I am just
copying this thread function and what
can I do is I will take a new button and
I will name it as save image and in here
I double click it and paste my code once
again okay so in this button click event
when I paste my code the same code it
will take a picture and it will show
into the picture box and you just need
to copy this bit map variable and below
your code you just write bitmap dot dot
save and in the bracket you just need to
pass the path of your folder so for
example I want to save the image in my
binary folder itself so I will just name
it as a IMG dot jpg format for example
so now when I run the program and when I
click this save image button it shows
the picture here also and when I go to
the folders I have a right-click it
and I will just click open folder in
Windows Explorer it will open the
project folder and I will go to the
binary debug and in here you can see the
image of your screenshot which I have
recently taken so you can save this
picture in the jpg or PNG format also by
this bitmap function of bitmap variable
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
and you have learned something new this

and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
